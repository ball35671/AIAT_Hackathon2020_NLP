Background: Patients who experience the onset of psychotic illness with a comorbid diagnosis of cannabis dependence experience poor clinical outcomes. Few studies have identified interventions that reduce cannabis
use and improve clinical outcome in this population.
Aims: We undertook a multi-center, randomized controlled trial of a group psychological intervention for
psychosis with comorbid cannabis dependence to determine whether there was any impact on cannabis
use symptoms, global functioning, insight, attitudes to treatment and subjective quality of life.
Method: Across three centers, we compared a group psychological intervention, based on cognitive behavioral
therapy and motivational interviewing, with treatment as usual among patients experiencing their first psychotic episode or early in the course of psychotic illness. Substance misuse and indices of clinical outcome
were assessed at baseline, 3 months and 1 year.
Results: At 3 month and 1 year follow-ups, there was no evidence for an intervention effect on cannabis use,
symptoms, global functioning insight or attitude to treatment. However, the intervention improved subjective quality of life at 3 months and this effect was sustained at 1 year.
Conclusions: Over the early phase of psychotic illness, group psychological interventions for those with
comorbid cannabis dependence improved subjective quality of life. However, this was not associated with
reduction in use of cannabis or improvement in clinical outcomes.

1. Introduction
Substance misuse is the predominant comorbidity of schizophrenia (Buckley et al., 2009) with cannabis being the most commonly
used substance (Koskinen et al., 2010). Up to 60% of patients experiencing a first psychotic episode have used cannabis in the
12 months prior to presentation to treatment services (Wade et al.,
2006). Emerging evidence supports the hypothesis of cannabis as a
causal factor in the development of psychotic illness (Moore et al.,
2007) with cannabis users developing psychotic symptoms at an earlier age than non-cannabis users (Large et al., 2011). Those patients
who continue to use cannabis are also more likely to have poorer outcomes and to experience a greater number of relapses and longer
periods in hospital (Isaac et al., 2005). Poor insight and inadequate adherence to prescribed treatment are highly prevalent among substance
abusers (Kamali et al., 2001) with increased risk of loss to treatment
services over the first 12 months following the onset of psychosis
(Miller et al., 2009). Cannabis users experience positive symptoms of
psychosis with greater frequency and severity (Machielson et al.,
2010) without reduction in negative symptoms (Compton et al.,
2004). However, comorbid cannabis use is often associated with poorer
psychosocial outcomes relating to occupation (Claussen, 1999) and
housing (Drake and Osher, 1991). In terms of quality of life, adverse financial circumstances, social isolation and interpersonal conflict appear
related to comorbid substance misuse (Kessler, 1995).
Despite these poor clinical outcomes, there are few interventions
of proven efficacy for psychotic patients with comorbid substance
misuse. A Cochrane review of psychosocial interventions for people
with both severe mental illness and substance misuse (Cleary et al.,
2008) found 25 randomized controlled trials of sufficient quality
that compared psychosocial interventions with standardized care in
reducing substance misuse. Only one randomized controlled trial

(RCT) included in the Cochrane review used a combination of motivational interviewing (MI) and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for
first episode psychosis with comorbid cannabis use (Edwards et al.,
2006); there was no evidence in the Cochrane review for any group
intervention based on MI and CBT for psychosis with comorbid cannabis dependence. No trial in the Cochrane review revealed any
meaningful improvement over treatment as usual and many had
high dropout rates. However, a recent UK study (Barrowclough et
al., 2010) demonstrated that a psychological intervention was beneficial in reducing substance misuse over 1 year follow-up. Therefore,
we carried out a multicenter RCT of a group-based psychological intervention (GPI) that integrated CBT with MI, in comparison with
treatment-as-usual (TAU), among a cohort of persons early in the
course of psychotic illness with comorbid cannabis dependence. Our
primary outcome was extent of substance abuse and our secondary
outcomes were symptoms, global functioning, insight, attitude to
treatment and quality of life.
2. Materials and methods
The subjects were 88 patients who were either experiencing
their first psychotic episode or within 3 years following the onset
of non-affective or affective psychosis and who had presented to (i)
the DETECT first episode psychosis service in South County Dublin/
North Wicklow (population 375,000), (ii) the National Drug Treatment Centre Board in Dublin city center, or (iii) Cavan–Monaghan
Mental Health Service (population 109,000); the study was approved
by the Provincial Ethics Committee of the St. John of God Hospitaller
Services, the Research Ethics Committee for the National Drug Treatment Centre Board and the Research Ethics Committee of the Health
Service Executive Dublin North East Area, respectively. The recruitment procedure involved a poster and media campaign, including appearance on a prime-time current affairs television program, letters of
information to referred patients prior to consent, and flexible appointments for assessment at a time and venue of the patients choosing. Each patient's participation in assessment was acknowledged
with the allocation of a token voucher to cover any costs of attendance. Patients were also offered the opportunity to meet with a service user who had previously participated in the psychological
intervention, to clarify any outstanding issues and help alleviate any
anxieties regarding involvement in the study. Once patients had
given written, informed consent, patients who met inclusion criteria
for the RCT were interviewed using the Structured Clinical Interview
(SCID-1) for DSM-1V (First et al., 1995) to confirm a diagnosis of
psychosis with comorbid substance dependence. Both outpatients
and inpatients aged between 16 and 65 years and without learning
disability or organic brain damage were included.
2.1. Outcome measures
The rater was a clinical nurse specialist experienced in recruiting
patients to clinical trials and assessing signs and symptoms early in
the course of psychotic illness. The baseline SCID-1 assessment to
confirm a diagnosis of psychosis and comorbid substance dependence
was repeated at 1 year and was also used to gather demographic
information, including age, gender, education and work history.
Frequency of cannabis abuse over the past 30 days was measured
using the cannabis abuse subscale of the Addiction Severity Index
(ASI) (McLellan et al., 1980; Zanis et al., 1997). Level of insight was
established using the global score of the Birchwood Insight Scale
(BIS) (Birchwood et al., 1994). Attitude to treatment was recorded as
the global score of the Drug Attitude Inventory (DAI-30) (Hogan
et al., 1983). Positive psychotic symptoms and negative symptoms
were measured using the global scores of the Scale for the Assessment
of Positive Symptoms (SAPS) and the Scale for the Assessment of
Negative Symptoms (SANS), respectively (Andreasen, 1983, 1984;
Malla et al., 1993; Norman et al., 1996). Depressive symptoms were
evaluated using the global score of the clinician-rated Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia (CDSS) (Addington et al., 1990, 1992).
Psychosocial functioning over the past month was measured using
the clinician-rated Global Assessment of Functioning Scale (GAF)
(Endicott et al., 1976; Patterson and Lee, 1995). Subjective quality of
life was evaluated using the global score of the World Health Organization, Quality of Life assessment (WHOQOL, BREF) (Skevington et
al., 2004). Duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) was evaluated
using the scale of Beiser et al. (1993) with collateral information
obtained from family members, and calculated as months.
2.2. Three month and 1 year follow-ups
Patients were re-evaluated at 3 months and 1 year, at which times
we measured substance use, symptoms, insight, attitude to treatment, level of functioning and quality of life.
2.3. Randomisation
Using a block randomized, computerized method, patients were
allocated to one of two treatment arms: GPI with a probability of 2/3
or TAU with a probability of 1/3. Randomisation was conducted by a
researcher uninvolved in the provision or assessment of interventions
and was withheld from the rater, who remained blind to allocation
until the final assessments were completed.
2.4. Interventions
2.4.1. TAU
This arm continued to receive care from a multidisciplinary team
in their local service; this included antipsychotic treatment and regular review. Five patients in the TAU group had availed of addiction
counseling, primarily for opiate use, in excess of one year prior to
consenting to the present trial.
2.4.2. GPI
This arm also continued to receive care from a multidisciplinary
team in their local service, similar to the TAU group. Ten patients in
the GPI group had also availed of addiction counseling, primarily for
opiate use, in excess of one year prior to consenting to the present
trial. Group psychological intervention was provided by an experienced clinical psychologist; this specialist in cognitive therapy is a
ratified member of the British Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Psychotherapies. Patients attended group sessions once per
week for 12 weeks and were then invited back 6 weeks later for a
‘booster’ session. The interventions were held in community mental
health centers and involved weekly sessions of anxiety management,
motivational interviewing and CBT techniques (Edwards et al., 2006);
they consisted of six phases based upon motivational interviewing
principles (Miller and Rollnick, 1991; Edwards et al., 2006), as per
the Australian CAP trial, together with cognitive behavioral therapy.
1. Entry: engagement, gaining commitment to treatment and raising
the issue of problem substance abuse (psychoeducation).
2. Committment: building commitment to a goal of non-problematic
substance misuse (motivational interviewing; harm reduction).
3. Goal Setting: reinforcing commitment to change and development
of goal achievement strategies.
4. Challenges: withdrawal counseling and psychoeducation.
5. Relapse prevention and lifestyle: motivational interviewing and
psychoeducation.
6. Maintenance: coping skills and time management.
7. Exit: termination; provision of resources.

2.5. Data analysis
Data were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis using SPSS V15
and BMDP 5V. Baseline variables were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and an unbalanced, mixed effects, repeated
measures analysis of variance was used to analyze the three time period data; the z statistic, the standard Normal random variable, was
the statistical test criterion used in the latter analysis.
3. Results
3.1. Recruitment and participation
Of 230 patients referred to the multi-center RCT, 88 were randomized
to GPI (n=59) or TAU (n=29) in the intended 2:1 ratio; the number of
those who did not meet inclusion criteria or refused [disengaged from
assessment, n=20; did not wish to travel to intervention, n=18; did
not wish to participate in intervention, n=13; did not wish to participate
in group intervention, n=19], those who received intervention and those
analyzed at baseline, 3 months and 1 year are given in the CONSORT flow
chart (Fig. 1). Patients included in this study were representative of a
homogeneous ethnic sample. Demographic information on age, gender
distribution, duration of untreated psychosis, education, employment
and primary diagnosis is given in Table 1. Mean lifetime duration of
cannabis use was 7.5 years (s.d. 6.6) in the TAU group and 9.6 years

3.4. Attitude to treatment
There were no differences in DAI scores between TAU and GPI
groups at baseline (F(1, 54)= 0.01, P= 1.0), 3 months (z=−0.68,
P=0.5) or 1 year (z=−0.73, P=0.5).
3.5. Positive symptoms
There were no differences in SAPS scores between TAU and GPI
groups at baseline (F(1, 85)=0.18 P= 0.7), 3 months (z=−0.15,
P=0.9) or 1 year (z=0.63, P=0.5).
3.6. Negative symptoms
There were no differences in SANS scores between TAU and GPI
groups at baseline (F(1, 85)= 0.07, P= 0.7), 3 months (z=−0.71,
P=0.5) or 1 year (z=0.62, P=0.5).
3.7. Depressive symptoms
There were no differences in CDSS scores between TAU and GPI
groups at baseline (F(1, 85)=0.01, P=1.0), 3 months (z= 1.42,
P=0.2) or 1 year (z=0.93, P=0.4).
3.8. Global assessment of functioning
There were no differences in GAF scores between TAU and GPI
groups at baseline (F(1, 85)= 0.01, P= 0.9), 3 months (z=−0.50,
P=0.6) or 1 year (z=−0.50, P=0.4).
3.9. Quality of life
At baseline, there was no difference in WHOQOL, BREF score between TAU and GPI groups (F(1, 51)=0.42, P=0.5). At 3 months,
WHOQOL, BREF score was higher in patients who had received GPI
than in those who had received TAU (z=−2.51, P= 0.01) and this
increase was sustained at 1 year (z=−1.96, P= 0.05).
4. Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first RCT that compares GPI aimed at
reducing cannabis use with TAU in a population of patients soon after
the onset of psychotic illness with comorbid cannabis dependence.
The results indicated no reduction in cannabis use following either
GPI or TAU. An Australian RCT (Edwards et al., 2006) that compared
a similar but individually delivered intervention with a psychoeducation control reported reduction in cannabis use in both arms
of the study. A recent RCT from the UK (Barrowclough et al., 2010)
that compared a similar but individually delivered intervention indicated some reduction in amount, but not in frequency, of substance
use relative to TAU. An earlier RCT demonstrated improvement over
TAU in terms of global functioning and positive and negative symptoms at 12 months post psychological intervention (Barrowclough
et al., 2001); the benefit of improved global functioning and negative,
but not positive, symptoms were sustained at 18 months (Haddock
et al., 2003).
Our RCT did not show any improvement for those randomized to
either GPI or TAU in terms of insight, attitude to treatment, positive
or negative symptoms, depression or global functioning at 3 months
or 1 year. However, despite any evidence for reduction in cannabis
use, those patients randomized to GPI did show improvement in subjective quality of life at 3 months that was sustained at 12 months.
Thus, patients who receive GPI for early psychosis with comorbid cannabis abuse perceive improvement in their life circumstances in
terms of quality of life. Only one RCT of psychological interventions
for psychosis and comorbid substance use found an improvement in
subjective quality of life in the intervention arm over control, while
Barrowclough and colleagues concluded that an important outcome
of group CBT for persons with schizophrenia was a reduction in negative outlook on ones situation (Barrowclough et al., 2006; Bellack
et al., 2006). It will be important that issues relating to quality of
life among such patients are explored further, as Melle et al. (2005)
found that substance abusers with first episode psychosis experienced poor subjective and objective quality of life.
Cannabis abuse associated with psychosis is a complex and clinically challenging area and we suggest that a group intervention of
18 week duration may be insufficient to provide adequate therapeutic benefit to this population as they attempt to overcome their substance abuse while adapting to a relatively recently acquired
psychotic illness. Sixty percent of patients had received previously
an offering of comprehensive intervention at the DETECT early psychosis program, hence these interventions may contribute to lack of
effect of GPI on indices other than quality of life. The findings of this
study suggest that a brief group psychological intervention for early
psychosis with comorbid cannabis dependence has little benefit in
terms of reduced substance use, insight, attitude to treatment, symptoms or global functioning. However, there is enduring improvement
in subjective quality of life.
Regarding strengths and limitations of the study, this RCT was
block randomized, blind to rater and analyzed on an intent-to-treat
basis; it is unique in comprising a group intervention based on CBT
and MI for patients with early psychosis and comorbid cannabis dependence. Most previous RCTs of psychological interventions for psychosis and comorbid substance use have focused on substance misuse
as opposed to substance dependence. This study recruited only 88
participants from 230 patients referred; 31% of those referred with a

cannabis use disorder did not meet SCID criteria for current substance
dependence. We did not compare relapse between GPI and TAU
due to variations in admission procedures between services in this
multi-center trial; treatment for acute psychotic illness resulted in
inpatient admission, acute day hospital and home based treatment
in various centers.
More RCTs of psychological interventions for those patients with
early psychosis and concurrent cannabis dependence are required,
given their generally poor long-term outcome. Future studies seeking
to develop alternative engagement strategies that are both effective
and acceptable to this challenging group of patients may first consider
utilizing qualitative research techniques that elicit patient opinion
and choice on this matter.
