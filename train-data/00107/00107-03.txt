Objective: Cannabis use disorder is the most common co-occurring drug use disorder in people with
schizophrenia and is associated with poor outcomes. The authors launched a randomized controlled
trial to assess the impact of clozapine compared with treatment as usual on cannabis use in patients with schizophrenia and co-occurring cannabis use disorder. Methods: Thirty-one patients with
schizophrenia and co-occurring cannabis use disorder were randomly assigned to switch to clozapine
or to stay on their current antipsychotic and were then followed weekly for 12 weeks. Blinded raters
assessed participants weekly with the Timeline Followback for substance use and the expanded Brief
Psychiatric Rating Scale for symptoms. Longitudinal random effects models were used to investigate
the time-varying differences in cannabis use and other outcomes between the treatment as usual and
clozapine groups. Results: The two groups differed in average intensity of cannabis use by approximately 4.5 joints/week, with lesser use in the clozapine group (t = −1.77; df = 28.5; p = .086; effect
size ∼ 0.6). Symptoms and functioning were not different between the two groups. Conclusions:
Clozapine may reduce cannabis use among patients with schizophrenia and co-occurring cannabis
use disorder. Further controlled trials are warranted. (Journal of Dual Diagnosis, 7:50–63, 2011)

Clozapine and Cannabis Use in Patients With Schizophrenia 51
Up to 60% of people with schizophrenia have a lifetime co-occurring substance use disorder
(Alterman, Erdlen, & Murphy, 1981; Ananth et al., 1989; Freed, 1975; Kessler et al., 2005; Kessler
et al., 1994; Mueser et al., 1990). Cannabis use disorder is the most common co-occurring drug use
disorder in these individuals (Kessler et al., 2005; Mueser et al., 1990; Regier et al., 1990), with
lifetime rates ranging from 13% to 42% (DeQuardo, Carpenter, & Tandon, 1994; Dixon, Haas,
Weiden, Sweeney, & Frances, 1991; Hambrecht & Hafner, 1996; Koskinen, Lohonen, Koponen,
Isohanni, & Miettunen, 2010; Mueser, Bennett, & Kushner, 1995; Peralta & Cuesta, 1992), a 3-
to 10-fold increase over the lifetime prevalence of 4% in the general population (Regier et al.).
Cannabis use disorder has been associated with clinical exacerbations, noncompliance with
treatment, poor global functioning, and increased relapse and rehospitalization rates (DeQuardo
et al., 1994; Knudsen & Vilmar, 1984; Linszen, Dingemans, & Lenior, 1994; Negrete, Knapp,
Douglas, & Smith, 1986; Peralta & Cuesta, 1992; Treffert, 1978). It adds greatly to the financial
costs and emotional toll that schizophrenia places on patients, families, and the mental health
system (e.g., Dickey & Azeni, 1996; Kivlahan, Heiman, Wright, Mundt, & Shupe, 1991).
Comprehensive psychosocial treatment programs that integrate treatments for schizophrenia
and substance (including cannabis) use disorder have been developed and shown to be effective for
this population (Drake, Mueser, Brunette, & McHugo, 2004). Nevertheless, even with abstinence,
relapse is common (Xie, McHugo, Fox, & Drake, 2005); moreover, almost half of the patients with
co-occurring disorders continue to use substances and experience negative consequences after 3
to 12 months of psychosocial treatment. Hence, there continues to be a need for better treatments
and for a better understanding of the role of pharmacological treatments of co-occurring cannabis
and other substance use disorders in patients with schizophrenia.
While typical antipsychotic medications do not appear to limit cannabis or other substance
use in patients with schizophrenia (Noordsy, O’Keefe, Mueser, & Xie, 2001), preliminary data
suggest that the atypical antipsychotic clozapine may be helpful not only in the treatment of their
psychotic symptoms but also in limiting their cannabis and other substance abuse. Case reports,
retrospective studies, and a small, open-label, prospective study have reported reduced substance
and tobacco use during treatment with clozapine (Albanese, Khantzian, Murphy, & Green, 1994;
Buckley, McCarthy, Chapman, Richman, & Yamamoto, 1999; George, Sernyak, Ziedonis, &
Woods, 1995; Lee, 1998; Marcus & Snyder, 1995; McEvoy, Freudenreich, Levin, & Rose, 1995;
Yovell & Opler, 1994; Zimmet, Strous, Burgess, Kohnstamm, & Green, 2000).
A subsequent study by our group provided further evidence of the potential role of clozapine
in dual-diagnosis patients. This study, a naturalistic clinical services survey, followed 151 patients
with co-occurring psychotic and substance use disorders for 3 years (Drake, Xie, McHugo, &
Green, 2000). Patients taking clozapine had higher rates of remission of cannabis abuse (6/9 =
67%) compared to those treated with typical antipsychotics (12/37 = 32%). Similarly, remission
of alcohol abuse was higher in patients taking clozapine (15/19 = 79%) compared to those treated
with typical antipsychotics (29/86 = 34%). Moreover, in a continuing assessment of those patients
whose abuse remitted, only 8% of those treated with clozapine relapsed to abuse in the following
6 months, compared to 40% of those treated with other antipsychotics (Brunette, Drake, Xie,
McHugo, & Green, 2006).
Given the many side effects of clozapine (which led to restriction of its Food and Drug Administration approval to use for patients with treatment-refractory psychosis), many investigators
are currently assessing whether other atypical antipsychotics share with clozapine an ability to
limit substance use in patients with schizophrenia. Unfortunately, available data are somewhat

mixed and not overly promising (Green, Noordsy, Brunette, & O’Keefe, 2008) for risperidone
(Green, Burgess, Dawson, Zimmet, & Strous, 2003; Smelson et al., 2002; Smelson et al., 2004),
olanzapine (Akerele & Levin, 2007; Brunette et al., 2008; Noordsy et al., 2001; Petrakis, Leslie,
Finney, & Rosenheck, 2006; Smelson et al., 2006), quetiapine (Brown, Nejtek, Perantie, Rajan
Thomas, & Rush, 2003; Brunette, O’Keefe, Dawson, Buckley, & Green, 2009; Potvin et al.,
2006), and aripiprazole (Beresford et al., 2005; Brown, Jeffress, Liggin, Garza, & Beard, 2005;
Warsi, Sattar, Bhatia, & Petty, 2005). Thus, at present, clozapine remains the only antipsychotic
medication for which published research provides consistent evidence of a substantive decrease
in cannabis and other substance use.
We have presented a neurobiological formulation, based on animal studies, suggesting that
clozapine’s unusual clinical effects on substance abuse in patients with schizophrenia may relate
to its varied pharmacological actions on dopaminergic and, particularly, noradrenergic systems.
Specifically, we have proposed that clozapine’s weak dopamine D2 receptor blockade coupled
with its activation of the norepinephrine (NE) system (including its antagonistic effects at the NE
α2 receptor and its ability to release NE) (e.g., Antelman & Caggiula, 1977; Breier et al., 1994;
Green et al., 1993; Lieberman et al., 1991; Rice, Smith, Silk, & Rosen, 1984; Sarafoff, Davis, &
Ruther, 1979; Svensson et al., 1995; Thierry, Godbout, Mantz, & Glowinski, 1990; Van Kammen
et al., 1990) may ameliorate dysfunction in the dopamine-mediated “brain reward system” that
may underlie the common use of cannabis and other substances in patients with schizophrenia
(Green, Zimmet, Strous, & Schildkraut, 1999).
Given the consistent albeit still preliminary data about clozapine’s ability to decrease substance
use in patients with schizophrenia, as well as our published rationale of the basis of this effect,
our group launched a randomized controlled trial of clozapine (as compared with treatment as
usual) of cannabis use in patients with schizophrenia and co-occurring cannabis use disorder.
METHODS
The study was a 3-month, randomized, open-label investigation (with blinded assessments) of
the efficacy and safety of clozapine compared to continued current antipsychotic treatment (i.e.,
treatment as usual) in outpatients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and comorbid
cannabis use disorder. After researchers established participants’ eligibility at baseline, blinded
raters assessed participants weekly for substance use, symptoms, and side effects. Unblinded
clinicians prescribed and adjusted study medications weekly for 12 weeks. The institutional
review boards at Dartmouth Medical School and at the University of South Carolina approved
the study. All procedures were consistent with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical
Practice according to the International Conference on Harmonization guidelines. There was a
complete and thorough discussion of the study with potential participants, and all participants
gave written informed consent prior to engaging in any study procedures.
Study Participants
Participants were recruited, primarily through clinician referral, from two urban study sites, one
in New Hampshire, affiliated with Dartmouth, and the second in South Carolina, affiliated with
the University of South Carolina. Inclusion criteria were as follows: Diagnostic and Statistical
Journal of Dual Diagnosis

Clozapine and Cannabis Use in Patients With Schizophrenia 53
Manual (DSM-IV) diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and current cannabis
use disorder; cannabis use on at least 5 days over the 3 weeks prior to screening; age 18 to 65;
outpatient status prior to randomization; and current treatment with antipsychotic medication other
than clozapine. Patients taking medications with possible effects on alcohol use (e.g., naltrexone,
disulfiram, or topiramate) were excluded, as were patients with active, serious medical illness,
suicidality, or severe psychiatric instability. Patients for whom clozapine was contraindicated
(e.g., white blood cell count <3,500/mm3 at screening, history of a seizure disorder) were also
excluded. Fifty patients were screened. Nine did not meet eligibility criteria; seven withdrew
consent; four were lost to follow-up; and one left the area prior to baseline. Thirty-one patients
proceeded with a baseline study visit and were randomized to a treatment group.
Study Procedures
Once patients were deemed eligible, they were randomly assigned to one of two treatment conditions: switching to treatment with clozapine or staying on their current antipsychotic medication.
Randomization was blocked by site. For those patients switched to clozapine, study physicians
increased the dose of clozapine in a flexible manner to reach a daily dose of 400 mg by the end
of week 4. During this titration period, the dose of participants’ initial antipsychotic medication was gradually reduced and then eliminated within 4 weeks. Dose adjustments of clozapine
were allowed based on psychosis symptom response and side effects, but the maximum allowed
dose of clozapine was 550 mg per day. Those patients randomized to continue receiving their
current antipsychotic were kept on a steady dose, although adjustments were allowed to address
newly emerging symptoms of psychosis or side effects. The group of research physicians and the
principal investigator (AIG) reviewed the pharmacological treatment of all study participants at
monthly intervals to ensure that antipsychotic treatment was consistent across the study.
Participants attended weekly study visits for 12 weeks. Unblinded study physicians assessed
participants for psychosis treatment response and adverse events. Trained, blinded raters assessed
participants for cannabis, alcohol, and other substance use, for psychiatric symptoms, and for
medication side effects. Experienced study raters were trained and certified prior to rating study
patients and were recertified yearly. Psychosocial treatment for psychosis and substance use was
measured monthly. Participants were reimbursed with a $25 gift card at the completion of each
study visit for their time and travel expenses.
Measures
During the screening phase, raters used the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis-I
Disorders–Patient Edition (First, Spitzer, Gibbon, & Williams, 1996) to establish participant
diagnoses of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and cannabis and other substance use disorders. Study physicians completed a physical examination and laboratory assessment (complete
blood cell count and glucose and lipid profile) to establish the participants’ medical stability.
Patients randomized to clozapine had the complete blood cell count repeated weekly; participants
who stayed on their baseline antipsychotic medication did not have blood drawn for weekly
complete blood cell count assessments.

Blinded raters assessed participant substance use with the Timeline Followback procedure
(L. C. Sobell & Sobell, 1992; M. B. Sobell et al., 1980) at screening, at baseline, and weekly
during the course of the study. In addition, at each visit, participants were given a breathalyzer
test for alcohol (with the AlcoHAWK-Pro from Q3 Innovations) and a urine screening for
drugs (with the ACON 2-Panel Multi-line Test Device for tetra-hydro-cannabinol [50 ng/mL]
and cocaine [300 ng/mL]). Blinded interviewers conducted the Timeline Followback procedure
using calendars and data from urine drug screenings and breathalyzer tests to facilitate recall of
substance use over the past week and to increase the validity of self-report. Participants were
asked to estimate the amount of cannabis, converted to “average-sized joints,” they had used
each day. Information from collateral informants was also obtained to increase the validity of
self-report. Baseline level of addiction treatment engagement was measured with the 8-point
Substance Abuse Treatment Scale, with higher scores indicating more progress in treatment
(McHugo, Drake, Burton, & Ackerson, 1995). Motivation to stop using cannabis was measured
with the single-item Contemplation Ladder (0–10; with higher level indicating more motivation)
(Amodei & Lamb, 2004).
Blinded raters assessed participants symptoms with weekly expanded Brief Psychiatric Rating
Scales (BPRS; Lukoff, Liberman, & Nuechterlein, 1986), weekly Clinical Global Inventories
(CGI; Guy, 1976), and biweekly use of the Schedule for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms
(SANS; Andreasen, 1982). The BPRS rated 24 symptom items with a score of 1 to 7 for each item
(1 = not present and 7 = extremely severe). The CGI was used to assess general improvement
with one item scored 1 to 7 (1 = very much improved to 7 = very much worse). The SANS was
used to assess five negative symptom components on a scale of 0 = not at all to 5 = severe.
Unblinded clinicians measured neurologic side effects weekly with the Simpson Angus Scale
(Simpson & Angus, 1970), the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (Lane, Glazer, Hansen,
Berman, & Kramer, 1985), and the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (Barnes, 1989). At baseline and
monthly thereafter, blinded raters assessed the amount of services patients received to address
their alcohol use disorder with a substance use treatment services questionnaire (Clark et al.,
1994). Study physicians recorded medication dose at each visit. Dose was later converted to
chlorpromazine equivalents (Gardner, Murphy, O’Donnell, Centorrino, & Baldessarini, 2010).
Medication adherence was measured by weekly pill count (Byerly et al., 2007).
Data Analysis
Chi-square tests and t-tests were used to assess whether the characteristics of the participants
were different between groups. For analyzing repeated measures outcomes, we used longitudinal
random effects (LRE) models (Laird & Ware, 1982) to investigate the time-varying differences in
cannabis use and other outcomes between the treatment as usual and clozapine groups. The main
outcome measure was intensity of cannabis use, as measured by the number of joints per week.
Baseline values of this measure were included in the models to adjust for possible differences
between the two groups and to improve efficiency; fixed effects included group, linear, and
quadratic trends (retained only if they were significant at the alpha = .05 level) and group by
trend interactions. The covariance structure was modeled using random effects for the intercept
and any significant trends; first-order autocorrelation for residual errors was also specified.

Clozapine and Cannabis Use in Patients With Schizophrenia 55
For the primary explanatory analyses, data for the clozapine group were censored (set to
missing) for deviations from treatment protocol, including greater than 3 days of missed study
medication doses and early termination of study medication. Secondary explanatory analyses of
cannabis use also involved censoring for poor adherence and early termination of medication
in both groups. For the intent-to-treat analysis, weekly data on cannabis use were censored for
hospitalization or confinement for more than 4 consecutive days to control for halo effects on use
due to forced abstinence. (There was no need to censor for hospitalization/incarceration in the
explanatory analyses because data for such participants had already been censored due to poor
adherence). Note that participants who terminated study medication contributed data to the LRE
models up to the time of censoring due to medication termination, whereas participants who were
poorly adherent contributed data for all weeks they took medication except for the week(s) of
poor adherence, which were censored on a week-by-week basis.
RESULTS
The characteristics of the 31 study participants are noted in Table 1. Overall, participants were
primarily single, unemployed, Caucasian males whose average age was 35 years. Participants
were moderately symptomatic and had been hospitalized multiple times. The group assigned to
clozapine had more education and fewer lifetime psychiatric hospitalizations. Most participants
had diagnoses of cannabis dependence (rather than abuse), about half also had an alcohol disorder,
and over a third had another drug use disorder. Measures of substance use, motivation, and
treatment did not differ between groups.
The characteristics of study medication use and other treatment use are shown in Table 2.
Most participants remained on study medication and in the study for the entire 12 weeks. Study
medication was well-tolerated, but many patients reported side effects, which are shown in Table 3.
The most frequent side effects were somnolence, hypersalivation, and weight gain. Patients who
were taking clozapine were more likely to report somnolence, hypersalivation, and constipation
than patients who remained on treatment as usual.
Outcomes
For the primary explanatory analysis, the two groups differed in average intensity of cannabis
use by approximately 4.5 joints per week (main effect in LRE due to group), with lesser use
in the clozapine group; there were no significant within-group trends during study follow-up
(see Figure 1). This result suggests that clozapine treatment (as compared to continuation of the
current antipsychotic) is associated with a decrease in cannabis use (effect size ∼ 0.6), although
differences for the small sample did not reach statistical significance (t = −1.77, df = 28.5;
p = .086). Similar results were found using the intent-to-treat analysis, with modest attenuation
of treatment differences (t = −1.72, df = 28.1; p = .096). The secondary explanatory analysis,
in which data for the treatment as usual group were also censored due to poor adherence, showed
little change in the estimated difference in intensity of cannabis use (which increased slightly
to about 5 joints per week) but had an increased standard error due to fewer observations (t =
−1.63, df = 24.9; p = .115).

Secondary outcomes included symptoms (negative, positive, total BPRS; composite, summary and total SANS; and SANS subscales for affective blunting, alogia, avolition, anhedonia,
and disturbance of attention) and functioning (CGI). Data were censored for deviation from
protocol (as above) for these secondary explanatory analyses; data were not censored for
hospitalization/incarceration for either explanatory or intent-to-treat analyses. In all cases, the
two groups did not differ in terms of symptoms or functioning. Negative linear trends (indicating
improvement) over time were found for total and positive BPRS.
In a subsidiary analysis, the two groups were also compared for alcohol use, measured as heavy
drinking days per week (with heavy drinking defined as 5 or more drinks per day). Censoring was
carried out as for cannabis use, but in this case both linear and quadratic terms were included in
LRE models to capture nonlinear trends over time. Interestingly, there were significant differences
for both explanatory (t = 2.32, df = 27.4; p = .028) and intent-to-treat analyses (t = 2.4,
df = 28.3; p = .023), with greater alcohol use in the clozapine group, due primarily to one
participant in that group who drank heavily throughout the study. When data for this participant
were removed from the analyses, the differences were no longer significant (as shown in Figure 2

for explanatory analysis). Moreover, a comparison of Figure 2 and Figure 1 showed an important
contrast between the cannabis and the alcohol results: the near significant results for cannabis
use reflect systematic differences between the two treatment groups, while those for alcohol use
do not (once outlying data are removed). Additionally, there was no correlation (longitudinally)
between changes in drinking and changes in cannabis use over time, based on days of heavy
drinking per week and days of cannabis use per week. Last, there was a floor effect for possible
clozapine action on heavy drinking, given that drinking levels were very low throughout the
study—on average fewer than 1 day per week when the one heavy drinker is omitted. (This is
most clearly demonstrated in Figure 2, when the data for the outlying participant are removed
from the analysis.)

Clozapine and Cannabis Use in Patients With Schizophrenia 59
DISCUSSION
This study provides the first evidence from a randomized controlled trial that clozapine may
limit cannabis use more than continued treatment with other antipsychotics in patients with
schizophrenia and co-occurring cannabis use disorders. Clozapine was well-tolerated in this
group of patients, with noted side effects of the types expected for this medication. Interestingly,
we did not find differences in psychiatric symptoms between the two groups, despite the welldescribed beneficial effects of clozapine for people with treatment-resistant schizophrenia. This
may reflect the overall moderate levels of psychiatric symptoms in this group of patients without
treatment-refractory psychosis.
The magnitude of the effect of clozapine (effect size ∼ 0.6) on decreasing cannabis use was
moderate, suggesting a clinically meaningful role for this medication in this population. But the
small size of the study sample limits the conclusions that can be drawn. Recruitment of patients
with schizophrenia and co-occurring cannabis use disorders into randomized medication trials is
challenging and requires a number of sites and a large recruitment team, which were not available
for this study. Given the relatively tenuous connection that these patients may have to treatment
and the reluctance that their clinicians have in referring them for research studies, the recruitment
team needs to be carefully integrated within treatment systems.
A limitation of the study beyond sample size included the fact that the prescribing physicians
were not blinded to study medication. Because clozapine causes characteristic side effects,
blinding of the prescribers and patients in this type of study tends to be difficult and was not
attempted here. Ratings of symptoms and substance use were, however, completed by blinded
raters. Nonetheless, whether expectancy effects contributed to the apparent efficacy of clozapine
in reducing cannabis use cannot be ascertained here.
In this study of patients with cannabis use disorders, the finding that clozapine was not
associated with improvement in heavy alcohol use was not consistent with previous research
(e.g., Brunette et al., 2006; Drake et al., 2000). Nevertheless, the lack of correlation between
changes in alcohol and changes in cannabis use suggests that the decrease we noted in cannabis
use was not related to an increase in alcohol use in these patients. Moreover, as noted above,
the two groups did not differ significantly in alcohol use during treatment when data for a single
participant with unusually heavy drinking were removed from the analysis. The undue influence
of such a participant reflects both the small size of the sample and the generally low amount of
drinking among these cannabis-using patients. We note that by design this sample was recruited
for level of cannabis, not alcohol use, and thus it would not be unexpected to find an outlying
heavy-drinking participant in only one of the treatment groups (only half of participants had a
diagnosed alcohol use disorder). Taken together, the alcohol data appear to support the robustness
of the primary finding of clozapine’s effect on cannabis use, despite failing to replicate a similar
result for alcohol use.
In summary, this small randomized trial of clozapine compared to other antipsychotics suggests
that clozapine may reduce cannabis use in patients with schizophrenia and cannabis use disorders
independent of any effect on symptoms or overall functioning. Although effective treatments for
cannabis use disorder in schizophrenia are sorely needed, at present, clozapine’s side effect profile
severely restricts its use in clinics. Given that these findings are promising and consistent with
previous research on the effect of clozapine on cannabis use, a fully powered, blinded clinical trial

is warranted to definitively establish whether clozapine is effective for the treatment of cannabis
use disorders in this population. If it can be demonstrated to definitively decrease cannabis use in
patients with schizophrenia, it may be appropriate to expand the routine use of clozapine beyond
that of those with treatment-refractory psychosis to include those stable outpatients who have a
co-occurring cannabis use disorder.
