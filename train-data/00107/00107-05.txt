Background. Cannabis abuse in psychotic patients is associated with rehospitalizations, reduced adherence and
increased symptom severity. Previous psychosocial interventions have been ineffective in cannabis use, possibly
because of low sample sizes and short interventions. We investigated whether adding CapOpus to treatment as usual
(TAU) reduces cannabis use in patients with cannabis use disorder and psychosis.
Method. A total of 103 patients with psychosis and cannabis use disorder were centrally randomized to 6 months of
CapOpus plus TAU (n=52) or TAU (n=51). CapOpus consisted mainly of motivational interviewing and cognitive
behaviour therapy (CBT). TAU was targeted primarily at the psychotic disorder. The primary outcome was selfreported days with cannabis use in the preceding month.
Results. Pre-randomization cannabis use frequency was 14.9 [95% confidence interval (CI) 12.7–17.1] days/month.
Post-treatment, the ratio of days/month with cannabis use in CapOpus versus TAU was 0.76 (95% CI 0.38–1.50)
(p=0.42), and 0.80 (95% CI 0.21–3.10) (p=0.75) at the 4-month follow-up. From 46.4 (95% CI 36.4–56.3) monthly joints
pre-randomization, consumption fell to 27.3 (95% CI 12.6–41.9) joints in CapOpus and 48.2 (95% CI 31.8–64.6) in
TAU (p=0.06). Follow-up amounts were 28.4 (95% CI 13.5–43.2) and 41.6 (95% CI 25.2–58.0) joints (p=0.23). Several
subgroup analyses suggested benefits of CapOpus.
Conclusions. CapOpus did not reduce the frequency, but possibly the amount, of cannabis use. This is similar to the
findings of previous trials in this population. Implementation of CapOpus-type interventions is thus not warranted at
present but subgroup analyses call for further trials.

Introduction
Cannabis abuse is highly prevalent in patients with
psychosis, with on average 11% of patients having
current abuse of cannabis and 19% having abused
cannabis during the past year (Green et al. 2005). In
comparison, around 1.5% of Americans are estimated
to have diagnosable cannabis abuse or dependence
(Compton et al. 2004). Cannabis use in patients with
psychosis is associated with reduced adherence to
antipsychotic treatment (Olfson et al. 2000; Kamali
et al. 2006), and increased psychotic relapses (Hides
et al. 2006), psychotic symptoms (van Os et al. 2002;
Grech et al. 2005) and number of hospitalizations
(Caspari, 1999). Although evidence regarding the impact of cannabis on negative symptoms and cognition
is unclear (Bersani et al. 2002; Yu¨ cel et al. 2012), experimental studies have shown that intravenous delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) acutely and negatively
affects these domains in patients with psychosis
(D’Souza et al. 2005; Leeson et al. 2012). For these reasons, treating cannabis use disorders may improve
prognosis for patients with psychosis.
Trials on cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT), motivational interviewing, psycho-education and treatment as usual (TAU) have generally failed to show
efficacy of any intervention over others for treating
cannabis use disorders (Cleary et al. 2008; Hjorthøj
et al. 2009). Most trials have been relatively short

ORIGINAL ARTICLE
interventions (1–10 sessions) with short follow-ups,
and with risk of bias and random errors due to small
sample sizes, incomplete allocation concealment and
analyses not being intention-to-treat. Only two trials
have focused exclusively on cannabis (Edwards et al.
2006; Bonsack et al. 2011). Trials with lower risk of
bias have generally not reported separate results for
cannabis use (Hjorthøj et al. 2009) and often found
significant intervention effects of motivational interviewing, CBT, or their combination (Jerrell & Ridgely,
1995; Barrowclough et al. 2001; Kavanagh et al. 2004;
Bellack et al. 2006; Kemp et al. 2007). It remains unknown whether the lack of efficacy in trials reporting
separate outcomes for cannabis is due to poorer quality of these trials or to the interventions being more
effective for other substances. It was thus important to
initiate a trial targeted directly at cannabis abuse, attempting to replicate the successful findings in studies
that did not report on cannabis separately. This entailed setting up an intervention with more sessions
than in previous studies because shorter interventions
may be insufficient for dual diagnosis patients to
change their substance use. It also entailed recruiting a
sufficient number of participants to achieve statistical
power to detect intervention effects, and minimizing
potential sources of bias that may have been present in
previous trials.
We aimed to compare 6 months of CapOpus, consisting mainly of motivational interviewing and CBT
aimed at cannabis-related problems, plus TAU versus
TAU alone. Our primary hypothesis was that
CapOpus added to TAU would be more effective in
reducing the number of days with cannabis use in the
previous month compared with TAU alone. Our secondary hypothesis was that CapOpus added to TAU
would also improve psychopathology, cognitive
functioning, quality of life and similar areas compared
with TAU alone.
Method
The trial was a 6-month, parallel-group, observerblinded superiority trial comparing CapOpus plus
TAU with TAU alone, including patients from
September 2007 to December 2010 in Copenhagen,
Denmark.
Participants
Patients were referred from Danish Early Psychosis
Intervention Services (Opus teams; Petersen et al.
2005), Community Mental Health Centres (CMHCs;
Nordentoft et al. 1996), Assertive Community
Treatment (ACT) teams (Vendsborg et al. 1999), and
psychiatric wards. Inclusion criteria were: ICD-10
schizophrenia spectrum psychosis (F2); cannabis use
disorder (F12); age 18–35 years (chosen so as to yield
more homogeneous groups for the planned group
sessions; a combination of slow influx of patients and
interested participants just outside the inclusion age
range led us to modify this after 5 months of inclusion
and include patients aged 17–42 years); residence in
the Copenhagen area; not requiring an interpreter;
and the ability and willingness to give informed consent. We allowed dependence to other substances if
participants themselves designated cannabis as their
primary substance of abuse. The diagnosis of schizophrenia spectrum psychosis was usually established
by the referring agent, and in cases of doubt was established by the Schedules for Clinical Assessment in
Neuropsychiatry (SCAN) interview (Wing et al. 1990).
After complete description of the trial to the participants, written informed consent was obtained before
randomization.
Randomization and masking
Computerized central randomization (1: 1) was performed by the Copenhagen Trial Unit, stratified by
intensity of cannabis use (0–14 or 15–30 days in the
past month) and type of TAU (see below). The block
size varied between 6, 8 and 10, and was known only
to the Copenhagen Trial Unit. The outcome assessor
was kept blind to allocation by asking participants not
to divulge the allocation, staff names, etc. The assessor
registered a guess of the intervention group at both
follow-up interviews, and these were ultimately compared to the actual intervention received by participants. The value of k between allocation and guess
was 0.33 (p=0.004) post-treatment and 0.22 (p=0.03)
at follow-up. Fourteen patients or case managers accidentally broke the blind, with a tendency towards
higher risk of unblinding in the CapOpus group (19%
v. 8%, p=0.09). Blinding was maintained throughout
data entry and management, analysis, manuscript
preparation and drafting of conclusions; after data
collection was completed, the investigators received a
randomization code from the data manager of the
Copenhagen Trial Unit detailing whether patients had
been allocated to group 0 or group 1. Only once the
manuscript and conclusions had been approved by all
authors were the CapOpus investigators informed by
the data manager which of the two groups was the
experimental group.
Interventions
CapOpus
CapOpus was an add-on intervention to TAU, which
all patients received. Full details are given in the
1500 C. R. Hjorthøj et al.
design paper (Hjorthøj et al. 2008) and full protocol
(www.capopus.dk). The intervention was based on
the EPPIC manual, and was similar to the Midas trial
(Hinton et al. 2002; Barrowclough et al. 2010).
CapOpus lasted 6 months from first contact with
CapOpus consultants. One or two weekly individual
sessions were offered in the first month, depending on
the participants’ wishes (two sessions were actively
encouraged to those whom CapOpus consultants
deemed to be more troubled by their cannabis use or
psychosis). One weekly session was offered during the
remaining 5 months. The intervention was fully manual based, starting with motivational interviewing to
enhance alliance and motivation, and shifting to CBT
as patients became motivated to change their cannabis
use. Returning to motivational interviewing was often
required. Emphasis was placed on analysing the advantages and disadvantages of continued use, and instructions in the development of personal strategies
in relation to craving trigger situations. The sessions
could take place in CapOpus offices, at the patient’s
home or treatment facility, and typically, an assertive
approach was applied to get the patients to attend (e.g.
home visits). Addiction consultants were trained and
experienced in motivational interviewing and CBT.
One consultant was a psychologist (handling 71% of
participants), one a master student of psychology, and
one an occupational therapist. The consultants met
several times a month and shared experiences, and
received both internal and external supervision.
Meetings with TAU case managers and families were
sought at a predefined schedule. Patients were offered
complimentary food regardless of cannabis use, in an
effort to increase adherence. The uptake of this was
minimal and was deemed to have influenced the
consultant–participant alliance in a maximum of six
participants. Case load was intended to be 1: 10 but
was usually between 1: 6 and 1: 7. Weekly group
sessions were planned but never implemented, as too
few patients wanted to participate in them.
TAU
TAU consisted of the treatment available to patients
had they not participated in the trial, provided by staff
not employed by CapOpus. TAU was carried out in
Opus, CMHCs or ACT teams (Nordentoft et al. 1996;
Vendsborg et al. 1999; Petersen et al. 2005). No explicit
manual exists regarding co-occurring cannabis use
disorder in TAU. Instead, these facilities primarily
target the psychotic disorder using both antipsychotic
medication and methods such as CBT (but generally
not targeted at substance use). Case load is approximately 1: 10 in Opus and ACT teams and 1: 20 to 1: 30
in CMHCs, not all of whom participated in the trial.
We did not register use of antipsychotic medication,
but previous investigations have shown that approximately 60% of patients in TAU in Denmark are given
antipsychotic medication (Petersen et al. 2005). Most
patients already received TAU at inclusion, and we
facilitated referral for the rest. TAU did not end after
the 6-month trial duration.
Measurements
Patients were interviewed three times by a trained
assessor blind to treatment allocation. The first interview was pre-randomization. For the CapOpus group,
the second interview was scheduled 6 months after the
first contact with the CapOpus consultant. This variation in time since inclusion was replicated in the TAU
group by flagging TAU participants included around
the same time as the CapOpus participants as ready
for interview. This second interview is referred to as
‘post-treatment’. The third interview was scheduled
4 months later and is referred to as ‘ follow-up’. If the
post-treatment interview was not conducted within
4 months, attempts were still made to conduct the
follow-up interview. Interviews could take place at
CapOpus, the participant’s home or a treatment
facility. As a last resort, interviews could be conducted
by telephone and questionnaires sent by post. Interviews could be split in two over a week, or partial
interviews could be conducted on prioritized outcomes.
Most data were collected at all three interviews. The
primary outcome was the self-reported number of
days with cannabis use in the past month, with recall
assisted by Timeline Follow-Back (TLFB; Sobell &
Sobell, 1992). This also allowed for quantification of
the number of ‘ standard joints’ in the past month. We
defined a standard joint as containing 0.5 g of cannabis
resin, and multiplied this by 1.5 for more potent types
of cannabis. TLFB-assisted self-report is a highly valid
measure of cannabis consumption even in this patient
group, perhaps even better than blood samples when
going beyond 30 days (Hjorthøj et al. 2012a, b).
Baseline information on other abuse diagnoses was
collected using the SCAN. Secondary outcomes were
the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS;
Kay et al. 1987), Global Assessment of Functioning
(Endicott et al. 1976), the World Health Organization (WHO, 2000) Disability Assessment Schedule,

et al. 1999), the Brief Assessment of Cognition in

(Nelson & O’Connell, 1978). The Client Satisfaction
Questionnaire (CSQ) was administered post-treatment
(Larsen et al. 1979). Outcome measures on health-care
utilization will be published separately.
Sample size
With a=0.05 (two-sided) and power=0.9, we calculated a priori that to detect a statistically significant
difference at either interview point of 5 days of
cannabis use (S.D.=5.0), we needed 2r22 patients.
Assuming 37% attrition (Petersen et al. 2005), 2r35
patients were needed. To perform subgroup analyses,
we attempted to include 2r60 to 2r70 patients, but
slow inclusion of patients forced us to cease inclusion
after the 103rd patient was recruited. Early analyses of
patients were performed for conference presentation
purposes once before inclusion ended, with the explicit determination that these results would not lead
to decisions regarding early stopping, as this may introduce bias and random errors.
Approval
The study was approved by the local ethics committee
(H-D-2007-0028) and the Danish Data Protection Agency
(2007-41-0616), and registered at ClinicalTrials.gov
(NCT00484302).
Data management and statistics
Data were entered into the database twice and discrepancies corrected according to unambiguously
designed case-record forms. The primary outcome
was analysed using multi-level, mixed-effects repeated-measures Poisson regression, yielding both
timergroup interaction terms and between-group
comparisons at each assessment point expressed as
incidence rate ratios (IRRs; the ratio of days with
cannabis use). Continuous outcome measures were
analysed using linear mixed models (LMMs), with
unstructured variance repeated measurements. We
also performed LMM analyses for the primary outcome to obtain estimated marginal means (a measure
of absolute rather than relative difference). Both of
these models include baseline values in their estimation of treatment effects. Abstinence was analysed
using logistic regression and satisfaction with treatment using linear regression. Analyses were intentionto-treat, analysing all patients as randomized. Missing
outcome data were handled by log-likelihood-based
measures in the multilevel Poisson model and the
LMM, and by multiple imputations in other analyses.
We conducted sensitivity analyses assuming either
last observation carried forward or an increase in
cannabis consumption. All tests of significance were
two-sided. We specified a priori that we would perform subgroup analyses, but not on which subgroups.
The subgroups we chose were deemed likely to influence the efficacy of a psychosocial intervention.
Analyses were performed using Stata/SE 11.2 (Stata
Corporation, USA).
Results
Participants
Participant flow is depicted in Fig. 1. Patients were
randomized to CapOpus plus TAU (n=52) or TAU
alone (n=51). Table 1 shows that there were no indications of skewed distribution of cannabis consumption or other baseline characteristics between
intervention groups. Post-treatment interviews were
carried out by telephone and letter for three patients in
CapOpus and two in TAU (p=0.66). At follow-up,
three interviews in each group (p=0.98) were carried
out by telephone and letter.
Attrition
Mean (S.D.) time between baseline and the post-treatment interview was 9.3 (1.4) months, and 14.9 (2.1)
months between baseline and follow-up. Neither differed between interventions (p=0.59 and p=0.97).
Thirty-eight patients (73.1%) in CapOpus and 30
(58.9%) in TAU completed the post-treatment interview (p=0.13). For the follow-up interview, completion proportions were 37 (71.2%) in CapOpus and
31 (60.8%) in TAU (p=0.27). There were no indications
of skewed attrition in terms of baseline cannabis use,
sociodemographic factors or any baseline scores.
Effect of intervention on cannabis consumption
The primary outcome, the number of cannabis-using
days in the past month, is presented in Table 2 as IRRs
(ratio of days) for the CapOpus group compared with
the TAU group, showing no significant differences
post-treatment or at follow-up. The absolute consumption of cannabis is shown in Fig. 2 as estimated
marginal means and confidence intervals (CIs) from
the LMM. The ratio of cannabis-using days in
CapOpus versus TAU was 0.76 (95% CI 0.38–1.50)
(p=0.42) post-treatment and 0.80 (95% CI 0.21–3.10)
(p=0.75) at follow-up. CapOpus participants smoked
20.9 (95% CI –1.0 to 42.9) fewer joints post-treatment
per month than TAU participants (p=0.06), whereas
the difference was 13.3 (95% CI –8.5 to 35.1) (p=0.23)
1502 C. R. Hjorthøj et al.
at follow-up. There were no differential effects according to which addiction consultant had treated
patients in the CapOpus group (p>0.20). Multiple
imputation logistic regression analyses revealed that
post-treatment and follow-up odds of abstinence from
cannabis did not differ significantly between CapOpus
and TAU participants [odds ratio (OR) 1.31, 95% CI
0.47–3.64, p=0.61 and OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.25–1.68,
p=0.37 respectively]. This was confirmed in observed
cases and all sensitivity analyses. LMM analyses did
not reveal any difference on plasma concentrations of
THC between interventions (data not shown).
Effect on cannabis consumption in subgroups
Table 2 shows IRRs for cannabis-using days in the
preceding month for patients receiving CapOpus
versus patients receiving TAU, stratified into subgroups. Table 3 shows, within the same subgroups,
LMM-estimated marginal means within the two interventions on standard joints during the preceding
month. Although the IRRs between interventions were
not significant for any subgroups based on the baseline amount of cannabis used, post-treatment marginal
means of monthly standard joints were significantly
lower in CapOpus than in TAU for two such subgroups; among those not abstinent at baseline, participants in the CapOpus group had used 26.1 (95% CI
3.5–48.7) fewer standard joints in the preceding
months than patients in the TAU group (p=0.02). At
follow-up, the difference was reduced to 18.2 (95% CI
–5.7 to 42.1) (p=0.14). In the subgroup of patients
who had used cannabis at least 15 days during the
month prior to the baseline assessment (a separate

randomization stratum), the difference post-treatment
was 30.7 (95% CI –0.6 to 62.0) (p=0.05) in favour of
CapOpus.
There seemed to be a strong intervention effect in
the youngest quartile of patients (age 17–21 years).
These CapOpus participants reduced their number of
cannabis-using days post-treatment by a third, and
their number of monthly joints by half. Young TAU
participants increased their cannabis use to nearly
daily consumption and 40% more joints. At follow-up,
these differences were no longer significant. A similar
tendency was observed for patients with the earliest
onset of cannabis abuse (age f14 years, p=0.05, data
not shown).
Unemployed patients in CapOpus more than
halved their number of post-treatment monthly joints
whereas unemployed patients in TAU did not alter
their consumption (p=0.03).
Effect of intervention on other outcomes
There were no significant intervention effects on other
outcomes such as PANSS scores, cognitive tests and
quality of life. The difference in marginal means posttreatment in TAU compared with CapOpus on overall
PANSS scores was x0.7 (95% CI x7.9 to 6.6), p=0.86;
for the positive symptoms PANSS subscale the difference was 1.3 (95% CI x1.1 to 3.7), p=0.29; on the
negative symptoms subscale the difference was x1.1
(95% CI x3.7 to 1.6), p=0.44. On quality of life as
measured by MANSA, the difference was 2.2 (95% CI
x1.9 to 6.2), p=0.29. Among cognitive tests, the one

There seemed to be no harmful effects defined as increases in cannabis use or psychopathology. In multiple imputation linear regression analyses, the
standardized
b coefficient of CSQ satisfaction with
treatment was 0.64 in favour of CapOpus (
p
<0.001).
Adherence
CapOpus sessions usually lasted 1 h, but could be
shorter or longer according to the participants’ wishes.
Twenty-four sessions were planned and on average 16
were achieved. Ten sessions per patient were carried
out as home visits. Three patients (5.8%) attended
zero sessions, and 77% had at least eight sessions
of CapOpus. Adherence varied with consultant (p=0.02); one consultant who saw 71% of patients had
9.9 fewer sessions per patient than one consultant who
saw 15% of patients. The importance of this seems to
be negligible as there was no indication of a time-bystaff interaction (p=0.79). Most case managers delivering TAU to CapOpus patients participated in the
planned meetings. The involvement of families was
largely unsuccessful, with 73% of patients more or less
completely refusing family involvement, and only
19% having at least four meetings with the family.
Data on TAU were obtained from service registers for
97 individuals, revealing nearly identical TAU usage
in the two groups. CapOpus participants received a
mean (
S
.
D.) of 15.3 (11.8) TAU sessions, compared with
15.6 (11.9) in TAU alone (
p
=0.89).
Discussion
Adding CapOpus to TAU did not significantly reduce
the number of days with cannabis use, but there was a
tendency to reduce the number of monthly joints,
compared with TAU alone. Certain subgroups seemed
to have reduced their cannabis use when receiving
CapOpus, including those not abstinent at baseline,
younger participants and unemployed participants.
Previous trials have not published intervention effects
within subgroups. Because of multiple-comparison
issues potentially leading to type I errors, our subgroup results should only be used for generating new
hypotheses. Future trials should define which subgroups to explore a priori, to reduce risk of type I errors
due to data-mining.
Participants receiving CapOpus were significantly
more satisfied with the intervention than those receiving TAU, indicating that the intervention was acceptable to patients but that satisfaction does not

The CapOpus randomized trial 1505
Our main results are comparable with previous
trials, including the tendencies towards reductions in
amount but not frequency of substance use (Hjorthøj
et al. 2009; Barrowclough et al. 2010; Bonsack et al.
2011). Our trial was larger, lasted longer or achieved
more therapeutic sessions than most trials identified in
a systematic review, which may explain why we tend
to find more evidence of an effect at least on the
number of monthly joints (Baker et al. 2006; Edwards
et al. 2006; Martino et al. 2006).
This lack of efficacy may several possible explanations. Patients may perceive cannabis as having
positive effects that outweigh its negative consequences, such as self-medication for negative symptoms, anxiety, sleeplessness and social dysfunction
(Schofield et al. 2006). Furthermore, the psychological
and physical dependence could be too strong to overcome without a pharmacological agent. Patients both
in TAU and CapOpus may have benefited from the
research interviews, potentially diluting the efficacy of
CapOpus over TAU. Although cognitive deficits in
psychosis may limit the applicability of CBT and motivational interviewing (Heinrichs & Zakzanis, 1998),
these approaches do seem to work for general substance use disorders in this population (Hjorthøj et al.
2009). Furthermore, there was a tendency towards
fewer monthly joints post-treatment in the CapOpus
group, possibly indicating a successful harm reduction. The significant reduction of post-treatment
joints in CapOpus for those who had not already
stopped using cannabis on their own at baseline indicates that inclusion of ‘ self-curers’ may have diluted
the efficacy of CapOpus.
Strengths and weaknesses
Our trial holds important strengths. We used centralized randomization, which reduces selection bias,
improves comparability between intervention groups
and ensures allocation concealment. We used a
manual-based intervention implemented in a very
similar manner to what would be feasible outside a
randomized trial. Although neither treatment staff nor
patients could be blinded, all other stages of the trial
were blinded, including observer-rated assessments,
data management, analysis, drafting the manuscript
and drawing conclusions.
Our trial also has certain limitations. Because
patients were referred, they may have been selected
among those most willing to change their cannabis
consumption. We did not obtain data on readiness
to change, and cannot exclude this potential bias.
It is thus not certain that our results can be generalized
to patients at the pre-contemplation stage according to the Stages-of-Change model (Prochaska &
DiClemente, 1992). Future trials should try to explicitly
include such patients, for example by approaching
consecutively admitted patients.
CapOpus addiction consultants carried out fidelity
self-ratings following sessions, shared experiences
with each other and were involved in internal and
external supervision. The fidelity measure used was
not, however, truly quantifiable, and future trials
should take more care in registering fidelity, as lack of
fidelity to the treatment manual may be a cause of lack
of effect in the psychosocial intervention trials.
Participants and addiction consultants were not
blind to allocation, and we cannot exclude collateral
intervention bias, although no evidence of this was
apparent when comparing TAU in the two intervention groups. Furthermore, outcome assessment
and all other tasks were carried out blinded, minimizing the risk of reporting bias. The outcome
assessor was better at guessing the allocated intervention than would be expected by chance, but with k
values indicating that this was only modestly so.

We chose to register these guesses because this was
the recommendation at the time according to the
original Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials
(CONSORT) statement, although it was consequently
advised against in the latest update to CONSORT
(Schulz et al. 2010
a
,
b). As explained in the latest revision of the CONSORT statement, outcome of such
guesses could just as well be attributable to efficacy,
etc.
Although we stopped inclusion earlier than 120
patients, power is above the 80% used in our samplesize calculation, which required 2r35 patients. The
observed between-group difference was lower than
the 5 days specified in the sample-size calculation, and
it is doubtful whether this difference is clinically relevant and should be used to guide power in future
trials. The lack of group sessions and less than optimal
adherence to the CapOpus intervention may have influenced the efficacy of CapOpus negatively, but is
probably how patients would behave if CapOpus was
implemented. If future trials become more successful
at achieving these non-individual aspects, this may
improve intervention efficacy. Furthermore, because
TAU case managers could have patients in both interventions, a degree of contamination may have occurred so that elements of CapOpus became available
in TAU as well.
Our trial had 34% attrition, which is comparable to
other trials (Petersen et al. 2005). Attrition seemed to
be non-differential. Time from inclusion to the posttreatment interview was a mean of 9.3 months,
reflecting delays in participants starting the intervention, cancellations and no-shows from the posttreatment interview. We achieved similar follow-up
times in the TAU group, which we believe has guarded against biases. We cannot exclude the possibility,
however, that this may have introduced biases or
random errors that could have both over- and underestimated intervention effects.
The contents of TAU regarding cannabis use disorders is not manual based, and some compensation
may have occurred for participants randomized to
TAU, that is case managers increasing their focus on
the problem beyond their normal approach. We did
not observe a difference in frequency of TAU sessions
in the two interventions. Cannabis use was largely
unchanged over time in TAU, indicating that even if a
change in focus did occur, it was not successful.
Implications and future research
Psychosocial interventions seem to be insufficient for
reducing the frequency of cannabis use among
patients with psychosis. In the spirit of harm reTable 3
duction, it may be better to add CapOpus to TAU but

The CapOpus randomized trial 1507
research should be taken a step further. Open-label
and randomized trials in patients without psychosis
have shown the efficacy of buspirone and perhaps
dronabinol, entacapone and lithium (Weinstein &
Gorelick, 2011). Combining pharmacological and
psychosocial interventions may yield a more pronounced treatment effect. Such combination trials on
dual-diagnosis patients are an obvious choice for future research and could focus on some of the subgroups in which we may have found significant
intervention effects. Such trials may benefit from exploring ways to include group sessions and familybased interventions.
