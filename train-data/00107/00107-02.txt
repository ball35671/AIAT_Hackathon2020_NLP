 Introduction
 Substance use disorder (SUD) comorbidity is highly
prevalent in patients suffering from severe mental disorders [1, 2] . In particular, prevalence of drug abuse or dependence is high among patients with schizophrenia,
ranging from 5 to 69%, depending on samples, methodology, criteria used to define SUD and on the diagnostic
subtype of psychosis included in the cohort [3–7] . The
proportion of people with schizophrenia who use cannabis varies, but surveys commonly report prevalence rates
of around 40% [8] , particularly among young people in
the early phases of psychosis [9] . Improving treatment for
cannabis users with psychosis is therefore a priority, considering that cannabis use has been associated with higher rates of psychotic relapse among individuals with first
episode and established psychosis, as well as poor attendance and medication adherence [10–13] .

 Abstract
Background: Cannabis use has a negative impact on psychosis. Studies are needed to explore the efficacy of psychological interventions to reduce cannabis use in psychosis.
Our aim is to study the efficacy of a specific motivational intervention on young cannabis users suffering from psychosis. Methods: Participants (aged less than 35 years) were randomly assigned to treatment as usual (TAU) alone, or treatment as usual plus motivational intervention (MI + TAU). TAU
was comprehensive and included case management, early
intervention and mobile team when needed. Assessments
were completed at baseline and at 3, 6 and12 months followup. Results: Sixty-two participants (32 TAU and 30 MI + TAU)
were included in the study. Cannabis use decreased in both
groups at follow-up. Participants who received MI in addition to TAU displayed both a greater reduction in number of
joints smoked per week and greater confidence to change
cannabis use at 3 and 6 months follow-up, but differences
between groups were nonsignificant at 12 months. Conclusions: MI is well accepted by patients suffering from psycho-

 A recent review found seven randomized clinical trials
conducted among mental health patients that reported
cannabis use outcomes using pharmacologic or psychological interventions [14] . Three of them reported on cannabis use outcomes of psychological interventions for cooccurring in psychosis [15–18] . Barrowclough et al. [16]
showed in a sample of 36 patients that an intervention
composed of cognitive behavioral therapy, motivational
interviewing (MI) and family work led to a higher level
of functioning, significant reduction of positive symptoms and increased number of days of abstinence from
drugs and alcohol at 12 months than standard care alone.
Haddock et al. [15] showed that increased functioning
was maintained in this sample after 18 months. Edwards
et al. [17] reported on an intervention designed specifically to reduce cannabis use in 47 first episode psychosis
patients. They compared specialized cognitive behavioral therapy and psychoeducation, but found no differences
between the impact of these interventions on reduction
of cannabis use after 6 months. The study was, however,
limited by a small sample size and a possible floor effect
due to low rates of cannabis use at baseline. Baker et al.
[18] , in a larger group of 130 patients with SUD and psychosis, reported that a 10-session intervention combining
MI and cognitive behavioral therapy resulted in shortterm improvement in depression and cannabis use and
improvement in general functioning after 12 months
compared with treatment as usual.
 Considering the particular needs of young users of
cannabis suffering from psychosis and the potential effect of a specific motivational intervention, we examined
if the addition of a MI to routine care (treatment as usual,
TAU) would impact on outcomes for people with psychosis and comorbid cannabis use. Specific outcomes examined the number of joints smoked per week, motivation
to change cannabis consumption, number of days in hospital, psychotic symptoms and level of functioning.
 Methods
 This study was a single-centre randomized controlled clinical
trial. Patients were allocated to either TAU alone or TAU with additional sessions of MI. Outcome data were collected over 12
months (baseline, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months). The primary hypothesis was that MI + TAU participants would show a
greater decrease in cannabis consumption than controls. MI +
TAU was also expected to reduce psychotic symptoms and days
of hospitalization in addition to increasing motivation to change
cannabis use behavior. Specifically trained psychologists conducted the MI intervention. A senior psychiatrist (C.B.) provided
clinical supervision.
 Participants
 Participants were patients receiving treatment as inpatients or
outpatients at the University Department of Psychiatry CHUV
(DP-CHUV) in Lausanne (Switzerland) at the time of the study.
Participants were chosen from the medical records of patients receiving treatment at DP-CHUV, and through systematic reviews
with psychiatrists of their patient lists. All patients meeting study
criteria were invited; in the presence of carers they were explained
the study, an initial screening was conducted and informed consent was obtained. Inclusion criteria were: a DSM-IV diagnosis of
schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, bipolar disorder with
psychotic features, schizoaffective disorder, psychosis not otherwise specified; age 18–35 in order to target young adults; smoking
at least 3 joints of cannabis per week during the month preceding
inclusion. Exclusion criteria were: organic brain disease; poor
command of French; current alcohol or any other substance dependence (except nicotine and cannabis).
 After initial screening, eligible patients were then asked to
participate in the study during a stable phase of their illness. Each
participant received a written description of the study, which explained the aims of the study, the extent and implications of their
participation, the process of randomization, the nature of the intervention, intake assessment, and follow-up evaluations. Patients
were also informed about confidentiality of data and their right
to withdraw from participation at any time. Informed consent
was obtained from all participants. Immediately after initial assessment, each patient was randomized and assigned to TAU or
MI + TAU [19] . Randomization was performed by blocks of 8,
based on a computer-generated allocation placed in closed envelopes. Envelopes were generated and kept by a member of the administrative staff of the project. Initial and follow-up assessments
were conducted by 2 research psychologists who had been trained
prior to the study using videotaped material to ensure inter-rater
reliability. The assessments were conducted by an independent
member of the research team who was not the participant’s therapist.
 Treatment as Usual
 TAU was identical in each group. It consisted of psychiatric
management by a clinical team composed of at least one psychiatrist and a psychiatric nurse or clinical psychologist, with additional access to community treatment or hospital admission if
needed. Treatment included antipsychotic medication, regular
office-based or community contacts with the clinical team for
treatment monitoring, and allowed access to community-based
rehabilitation activities, such as day centers. No attempts were
made to standardize this treatment, which was based on individual patient’s needs. Control participants received standard counseling and psychoeducation regarding substance use, but were not
exposed to any other specific MI.
 Motivational Intervention
 The intervention was additional to and not substitutive to
TAU. The main aim of MI is the reduction of harmful cannabis
use. The MI sessions were conducted individually and based on
written guidelines, and included 4–6 sessions depending on a
patient’s readiness to attend [20] ( table 1 ). The first session lasted about 60 min and was followed by a feedback session of 45–
60 min within the next week. Two to four booster sessions tailored to the needs of the participants of 30–45 min took place

Matching patient’s motivation level, booster sessions focused on:
C3: 2 months after inclusion
C4: 3 months after inclusion
C5: 4 months after inclusion
C6: 6 months after inclusion
– development of goal achievement strategies (goal setting)
– adopting a sound approach to all potential challenges to cannabis
reduction goals (withdrawal counseling, relapse prevention, etc.)
– examination of factors that are ‘threats’ to short-term achievement and
long-term maintenance of nonproblematic cannabis use and thinking
about specific resources; consider positive lifestyle change to support
goals (relapse prevention, cannabis refusal skills, time management)
– maintenance of motivation for a commitment to nonproblematic
cannabis use; ongoing consideration of positive lifestyle change to
support cannabis goals (e.g., coping skills)
Optional MI groups Participant could participate in a cycle of three 1-hour group sessions.
The sessions were structured in an experiential exercise followed by a
short debriefing and discussion. The goal of the MI groups is to highlight
the contrast between short-term positive consequences of cannabis use
and long-term negative consequences, in an atmosphere in which ambivalence was accepted and even expected.

during the first 6 months. The main elements of the sessions were
derived from a publication on MI [21] , but incorporated two significant adaptations to be more applicable for dual-diagnosis patients [22–25] . First, in an integrated dual-diagnosis approach,
MI therapists strategically explored interactions between psychosis and substance use, capitalizing on the effects of recent
symptoms to help patients to identify a link between cannabis use
and psychotic symptoms. Second, to accommodate to cognitive
impairment and disordered thinking accompanying some psychotic disorders, MI interviews were structured around the Decisional Balance Grid (DBG) and incorporated strategies of repetition and the use of simple, concrete verbal and visual material.
MI emphasizes empathy and focuses on strengthening the patient’s own verbalized motivations for change [26] . Following the
recommendations by Martino et al. [23] , emphasis was put on
some MI microskills: (a) using simple and concise language; (b)
more regular reflection; (c) using concrete metaphors; (d) summarizing frequently; (e) giving sufficient time for the patient to
respond to reflections.
 During the first session, participants were invited to report
positive and negative aspects associated with cannabis use. The
responses of participants were recorded verbatim on the DBG.
Benefits and drawbacks of cannabis consumption were discussed
in relation to psychiatric symptoms and medication [24] . The
most recent symptoms were exploited to help patients identify a
link between their illness and cannabis use [22] , and an information leaflet regarding cannabis use and psychosis was given. During the second session, a written summary of the decisional balance grid completed in the first session (DBG) was provided and
discussed with the patient. In order to integrate the intervention
with overall psychiatric care, both written and oral feedback was
given to the patient’s treating clinician after the first two sessions.
This feedback gave a brief evaluation of current cannabis use,
stage of change, and advantages and disadvantages of cannabis
use for the patient. The third to sixth sessions provided an opportunity to reinforce the patient’s motivation in accordance with
their stage of change [27] .
 Additionally, participants in this arm of the study were offered
three optional motivational group sessions [28] . The three sessions were organized as experiential exercises (namely ‘The Great
Debate’, ‘Cannabis on Trial’ and ‘Angel and Devil’) followed by a
short debriefing and discussion.
 Outcome Measures
 Assessment was conducted at baseline (after informed consent
and before MI treatment initiation), and after 3, 6 and 12 months,
and could be either office- or home-based depending on participants’ preference. Participants were called by phone the day preceding assessment in order to remind them of the meeting.
 The main outcome variable was measuring change in cannabis use. The timeline followback technique (TLFB) [29] was utilized to measure the quantity of cannabis use in number of joints
per week during the last week. Building on the experience of previous research, TLFB is a sensitive and reliable assessment of
change for daily substance users [30] . In addition, the Cannabis
and Substance Use Assessment Scale [22] was used to quantify
cannabis use in the last month (percent of days), the frequency of
cannabis use (daily, weekly, etc.) and an ‘index of severity’ of cannabis use, ranging from 1 to 4, on the basis of the general impact
of cannabis use upon the individual (such as amount used, withdrawal/dependence, risk-taking activities, and negative impact
on functioning) [17] . The DSM-IV research criteria [31] were used
to assess the diagnosis of cannabis abuse or dependence at baseline.
 The secondary outcome measures included readiness to
change cannabis use behavior, clinical assessments and service
use. Readiness to change cannabis use behavior was assessed on
three dimensions [readiness to stop or decrease cannabis use; importance (degree of priority) of this change for the patient; selfconfidence in the capacity to change] on the basis of three scales
ranging from 0 to 100 [32, 33] . Psychotic symptoms were assessed
using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) [34, 35] .
The Social and Occupation Functioning Scale (SOFAS) and Global Assessment of Functioning Scale (GAF) [36, 37] recorded current functioning. The Client Socio-Demographic and Service Receipt Inventory (CSSRI-EU) [38] assessed both sociodemographic data at baseline and service received at baseline and during
follow-up.
 Data Handling and Analysis
 A power calculation based on a pilot study predicted that with
44 participants (22 individuals in each group), there was 80%
chance of detecting a significant difference in the reduction of
cannabis use at a p value of 0.05. All analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for Social Science, version 15.0 for Windows. All statistical tests were two-tailed and significance was
determined at the 0.05 level. Missing data were handled using last
observation carried forward (LOCF) technique. Assessment of
group differences on nominal variables was undertaken through
data cross-tabulation, performing 2
 tests of independence, and
Fisher’s exact tests when appropriate. Treatment groups were
compared on cannabis use, readiness to change substance use behavior, psychopathology and psychosocial functioning. Pre- and
post-treatment group differences on variables were assessed using
nonparametric test for independent samples (Mann-Whitney U
test) for not normally distributed data. Cohen’s d was calculated
to determine the effect sizes [39–41] .
 Results
 Recruitment, Treatment Delivery and Retention
 Participants were enrolled between September 2005
and December 2006. Medical records of 365 patients were
screened with clinicians, 88 of whom met initial inclusion
criteria. Twenty-three patients could not be contacted by
the research team: 11 refused to participate and 12
dropped out prior to consent to take part in the study. A
total of 65 patients agreed to participate and were randomly assigned to MI + TAU or TAU. Two participants
failed to attend initial assessment, and 1 did not meet inclusion criteria at baseline. Data is therefore available for
62 participants (30 in the MI + TAU group and 32 in the
TAU group). The 30 patients of the MI + TAU arm received an average of 5.13 MI sessions (SD = 2.06) in the
first 6 months. Four participants received between 7 and

12 MI sessions according to their motivation to change
and needs. Two participants received only 3 sessions of
MI. Fifteen MI + TAU participants took part in the MI
group sessions (number of session: mean = 2.60, SD =
1.24). In total, patients of the MI + TAU condition had an
average of 6.43 sessions (SD = 2.65). Follow-up assessments were completed by 54 patients (25 in the MI + TAU
group and 29 in the TAU group). A CONSORT diagram
illustrating participants’ flow through the trial is shown

trols and treatment groups at baseline regarding diagnosis, service use, symptom intensity or functional level ( table  2 ). Forty-one participants (66.1%) were diagnosed
with schizophrenia and 51 (82.3%) met criteria for cannabis dependence. On average, participants had experienced psychotic symptoms for 4.2 years (median = 3.75,
range = 14.4).
 Participants’ baseline characteristics regarding cannabis abuse are displayed in table 3 . During the month
before trial, participants reported smoking on 76.8% of
days at the average rate of 27.3 joints per week (median =
21.0, range = 95.0). Mean age of first cannabis use was
15.3 years (median = 15.0, range = 14.0) and 17.9 years
(median = 17.0, range = 19.0) for regular cannabis use.
There were no significant differences regarding cannabis
and other substance use between control and treatment
groups at baseline ( table 3 ).
 Primary and Secondary Outcome Measures
Cannabis Use. Cannabis use decreased significantly
over time both in the control and intervention groups,
with an overall median decrease of 2.5 joints (range =
160) per week at 3 months, 5.00 joints (range = 75) at
6 months and 6.50 joints (range = 88) at 12 months follow-up. At 3 months follow-up, MI + TAU patients reduced the number of joints significantly more (median = 6.0, range = 62) than those in the TAU group
(median = 0.5, U = 308.5, p = 0.015, Cohen’s d = 0.65).
This represents a medium effect size for the intervention
(effect size above the 0.5 criterion for a medium effect
size) [40, 41] . The difference between groups was maintained at the 6-month follow-up (experimental group:
median = 10.5; control group: median = 0.5, U = 308.0,
p = 0.015, Cohen’s d = 0.65). At the 12-month follow-up,
this difference between groups was no longer statistically significant (experimental group: median = 10.0;

Motivation to Change Cannabis Use. As shown in table 4 , there were no significant differences between the
control and experimental groups on ‘readiness to’ and
‘importance of change’ regarding cannabis use as rated
on the motivational scales. While there was a significantly greater increase on the confidence score in the
treatment group at 3 months (experimental group: median = 75; control group: median = 50, U = 302.0, p =

spent in hospital after trial initiation ( table 4 ).
 Discussion
 We investigated the impact of a specifically designed
psychological intervention on cannabis use in young people with psychosis. Building on experience gathered in
previous trials, we based this study on a sample of patients with relatively high levels of cannabis consumption, in order to avoid a floor effect in the decrease of
cannabis use. Our results show that while cannabis use
decreased in both groups, the addition of MI to TAU in-

 Psychosis and Cannabis Motivational
Intervention
Psychother Psychosom 2011;80:287–297 295
duced a significantly greater decrease during the intervention period, both at 3 and 6 months follow-up assessments. Additionally, we observed that patients who received MI reported significantly more confidence to
change than the control group at 3- and 6-month followup. This short-term effect was similarly observed in previous studies [18] .
 However, despite identifying positive outcomes relating to the additional MI intervention over a 6-month period, at 12 months both groups displayed similar decreases in cannabis use and similar levels of confidence to
change. There may be a number of reasons for this. First,
it is possible that the duration of the intervention was too
short either to induce a durable change in cannabis use or
to impact on secondary variables. Secondly, the observation that both groups displayed a decrease in cannabis use
at the 12-month follow-up shows that TAU was also beneficial. In our setting, TAU was already quite comprehensive and included several components reported as potentially efficient such as clinical case management or early
intervention [9, 16] . Improvement regarding cannabis use
in the control group may also be the result of being involved in a research and evaluation process [42] . In particular, all participants underwent detailed evaluation,
which may have contributed to increased insight about
their cannabis-related problems. During the research
process, clinicians also focused on cannabis use issues
and improved their skills in approaching these questions
with patients. Finally, while separation of MI intervention from clinical care was necessary for research purposes, there is still controversy about whether SUD interventions are more effective if integrated with the existing
treating team or provided as a separate specialization
[42] . In integrated programs, treatment techniques usually include a stepwise approach delivered by specialized
clinicians using an assertive and flexible style of engagement but with close monitoring of patients. Care is provided in a long-term perspective and with an optimistic
attitude, ideally within comprehensive services (including inpatient, day hospital, community team and outpatient care), in collaboration with supportive living environments. It is therefore possible that such an integration
of the intervention into standard care would have led to
greater and steadier improvements in the MI + TAU
group.
 There are various limitations to this study. First, the
decrease in cannabis use in the control group was higher
than expected in the sample size calculation. This suggests that TAU was already effective in reducing cannabis
use. As participants were high users, this could also be
partly explained by a regression toward the mean. Reported cannabis use may also have resulted from demand
characteristics or treatment expectancy [43] rather than
a real reduction in usage. However, the TLFB has been
reported to have high validity in measuring cannabis
consumption when compared with urinalysis [44] . In
further studies, as suggested in the CapOpus trial [45] ,
self-reported cannabis consumption could be validated
with blood samples if patients consent. Second, participants smoked a median number of 20 joints per week at
baseline, which avoided a floor effect in the outcome
measure, but which may be higher than the average psychosis patient with comorbid cannabis use. It is possible
that the SUD of such heavy users are more entrenched
and therefore less amenable to long-lasting modification.
Average users who smoke lower numbers of joints per day
may prove more sensitive to the intervention. Third, handling missing data using LOCF has been criticized as it
depends on the relative number of subjects lost to followup in each group. However, considering the equally low
number of subjects lost to follow-up in both groups, this
did probably not introduce bias into our study. Finally,
while control group patients received also a comprehensive treatment, MI patients benefited from additional attention and from group approach. Differences between
groups may therefore be explained by the effect of additional sessions rather than by the actual content of the
intervention.
 The results of this study are nevertheless encouraging
and, in keeping with previous findings [16, 18] , provide
support to the observation that the addition of motivational intervention to TAU may be an active ingredient to
reduce cannabis use by young patients suffering from
psychosis. The supplemental impact of MI on motivation
to change during the treatment period and the high retention rate achieved is interesting considering the relative simplicity of the intervention. The motivational approach was indeed highly appreciated by patients, many
of whom reported that this frame allowed them to speak
freely about all aspects of their cannabis use without feeling judged by clinicians. Considering the important impact that SUD discontinuation can have on outcome, especially in early psychosis [46, 47] , efforts must be made
to develop effective interventions that promote reduction
in cannabis use. The next step would be to instruct psychiatric treating teams to pay attention to cannabis use
among young psychotic patients for a longer period of
time in the frame of a comprehensive treatment program.
This would allow a more responsive and steadier approach where motivational modules could be delivered
