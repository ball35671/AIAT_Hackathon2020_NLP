Edwards J, Elkins K, Hinton M, Harrigan SM, Donovan K,
Athanasopoulos O, McGorry PD. Randomized controlled trial of a
cannabis-focused intervention for young people with first-episode
psychosis.
Objective: To evaluate a cannabis-focused intervention (cannabis and
psychosis therapy: CAP) for patients continuing to use cannabis
following initial treatment for first-episode psychosis (FEP).
Method: Consecutive admissions to an early psychosis program were
screened and consenting individuals using cannabis in the 4 weeks
prior to assessment participated. A single-blind randomized controlled
trial compared CAP (n ¼ 23) with a clinical control condition
(psychoeducation, PE; n ¼ 24).
Results: There were no significant differences between the CAP and PE
groups on cannabis use at end of treatment and 6 months postintervention. There were no significant group differences on
psychopathology and functional ratings at follow-up. A significant
reduction in cannabis use was observed for both groups over time.
Conclusion: PE and specific cannabis-focused intervention are
associated with similar reductions in cannabis use in an FEP cohort.
Simple interventions may therefore be worth considering prior to
intensive psychotherapeutic efforts with this population.

Significant outcomes
• Both a specific cannabis-focused intervention and psychoeducation are associated with reduced
cannabis use in young people with first-episode psychosis.
• As neither intervention was found to be superior, relatively simple, general interventions are worth
implementing in the first instance to reduce cannabis use in this population.
Limitations
• The absence of a treatment-as-usual control condition limits interpretation of the results;
• Small sample size;
• Use of multiple study entry points, which may introduce variability in participant characteristics (e.g.
degree of symptom stabilization).
Introduction
Substance misuse is a common comorbid problem
in first-episode psychosis (FEP) (1, 2). Cannabis is
the most widely used illicit drug of dependency in
this population, with an estimated 86% of patients
in one study reportedly having experimented with
the drug (3). A significant minority of FEP patients
are likely to meet the diagnostic criteria for
cannabis abuse/dependence, with recent estimates
ranging from 14% (4) to 28% (5). The use of
cannabis in early psychosis correlates with poor

medication adherence (6), increased severity and
chronicity of symptoms (7, 8) and risk of relapse
(9). There is a pressing need to develop effective
interventions to reduce cannabis use as part of
comprehensive treatment programs for young
people with psychosis.
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) targeting
self-identified problem cannabis users in the community indicate that cognitive-behavioral therapies
and motivational interviewing techniques are
effective in comparison with delayed treatment
(10), although the relative weight and dose of the
best approach remains unclear. In a clinical
context, the extant treatment literature on dual
diagnosis has focused predominantly on established schizophrenia, with only a handful of
evaluations involving early psychosis (11, 12).
Evaluating the efficacy of interventions for dual
diagnosis has been hampered by small sample sizes,
lack of control groups and non-attendance (13),
though a methodologically rigorous RCT of substance use and schizophrenia (n ¼ 36) utilizing
improved assessment and randomization procedures, demonstrated modest improvements in
abstinence over the 12-month trial (14). Despite
the clinical consequences of ongoing cannabis use
in early psychosis, no treatment study to date has
evaluated an intervention to reduce its use in this
population (15).
We devised and conducted an RCT to test the
effectiveness of a cannabis-focused intervention
(cannabis and psychosis therapy, CAP) for individuals with FEP who were continuing to use
cannabis despite engagement with early psychosis
treatment services. The CAP condition consisted of
a cognitive-behavioral-oriented program delivered
in weekly sessions by trained clinicians over
3 months. An active control condition involving
psychoeducation (PE) was chosen as it has face
validity with patients and clinicians (16), which is
important in retaining young people in therapy,
and represents a cost-effective alternative to the use
of specialist clinical therapies. It was hypothesized
that patients in the CAP intervention would
demonstrate a greater reduction in cannabis use
and significant improvements in clinical and psychosocial functioning compared with patients
receiving PE.
Aims of the study
To assess among FEP patients with ongoing use of
cannabis, whether a psychologically based intervention (CAP) is associated with greater reduction
in cannabis use and more readiness to change
cannabis use behaviors, as well as decreased
psychopathology and enhanced psychosocial functioning, in comparison with PE at end of treatment
and 6-month follow-up.
Material and methods
The study involved a single-blind RCT of CAP
intervention and PE to cannabis-using patients
attending a youth mental health service in
Melbourne, Australia. Consecutive admissions
to the Early Psychosis Prevention and Intervention Centre (EPPIC) were screened between
March 1998 and December 1999. The EPPIC
program provides a comprehensive, integrated,
community-based treatment program to FEP
patients aged 15–29 years residing in the service
catchment area (approximately 800 000). These
catchment areas have minimal alternative private
sector services and it is therefore estimated that
the EPPIC caseload (approximately 240 new
cases per year) represents close to the entire
treated prevalence within the catchment area
(17). Detailed descriptions of the structural and
clinical characteristics of EPPIC are available
elsewhere (18).
Study inclusion criteria were a DSM-IV (19)
diagnosis of a psychotic disorder (i.e. schizophrenia, schizophreniform, schizoaffective, delusional
disorder, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder with psychotic features, psychosis not
otherwise stated, and brief reactive psychosis),
informed consent for research participation and
adequate English language comprehension. As
approximately 50% of young people using cannabis at admission to early intervention services
such as EPPIC can be expected to voluntarily
cease use within the first 6–10 weeks (20), only
patients who were continuing to use cannabis at
10 weeks post-initial clinical stabilization were
eligible for study inclusion. No additional exclusion criteria were applied.
Assessments for the study occurred at four time
points: within the first few days following entry
into EPPIC (index presentation, T1), at the time of
symptom stabilization (usually 10 weeks after
index presentation, T2), and then as close to
3 months (T3) and nine months (T4) after T2 as
possible. Individuals who reported using cannabis
in the 4-weeks preceding either the T2, T3 or T4
assessments were eligible for the RCT. Those who
agreed to randomization received either CAP or
PE, delivered by the same therapists. Participants
were informed that they could withdraw at any
time and this would not affect access to routine
care. The study was approved by the local research
and ethics committees.

Interventions
Cannabis and psychosis therapy is an individually
delivered cognitive-behavioral harm minimization
approach to cannabis use in individuals with FEP.
Young people are often traumatized by psychosis
and its implications, and the desire to avoid further
episodes can encourage reconsideration of cannabis use, providing a window of opportunity to
influence behavior change (21). The intervention is
delivered over 3 months, ideally involving 10
weekly sessions (20–60 min in duration). A booster
telephone call 3 months after end of treatment is
designed as a generalized relapse prevention, and
serves to emphasize gains made in treatment and
reinforce strategies to manage potential relapse.
CAP commences with a detailed assessment and
attention to engagement, followed by education
about cannabis and psychosis and building motivation to change (22). The focus of therapy is then
determined by phase of commitment to change (23)
and may include further education about cannabis
and psychosis, motivational interviewing, goal
setting, goal achievement strategies, and discussion
about relapse prevention. Feedback was sought
from five international experts on an early CAP
outline and their comments were incorporated
within the final treatment manual (24).
The 10 individual PE sessions were guided by
standardized powerpointTM slides (in electronic or
printed form) which covered the nature of psychosis, medication and other treatments, and relapse
prevention and stigma, but avoided explicit discussion of cannabis. The therapists were four clinical
psychologists trained in cognitive-behavior therapy
and experienced in the treatment of FEP (J.E., K.E.,
M.H., O.A.). M.H. also had expertise in the
treatment of substance misuse disorders and led
weekly peer supervision sessions for both conditions. In addition to the randomized condition, each
participant received standard EPPIC care which
includes case management, regular psychiatric
review and medication; access to mobile assessment
and treatment, family work, group programs, and a
prolonged recovery clinic (25).
Measures
Baseline assessments were conducted prior to
randomization (i.e. at T2, T3 or T4) and followup occurred both at the end of treatment (approximately 3 months after baseline) and 6 months
post-intervention. For individuals randomized at
T2, their T3 and T4 assessments functioned as endof-treatment and 6-month post-intervention assessments, respectively; participants randomized at T3
or T4 received additional assessments at the
designated outcome time.
The Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnosis
(SCID; 26) was used to diagnose functional psychoses and substance use disorders according to DSMIV (19). Cannabis use was measured with the
Cannabis and Substance Use Assessment Schedule
(CASUAS), which is modified from the Schedule for
Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (27) and
includes similar information to the Addiction Severity Index (28). Key outcomes measures included the
percentage of days using cannabis in the past
4 weeks, the frequency of cannabis use (e.g. daily,
weekly, more than once in last 4 weeks but not
weekly, etc.) and an index of severity of cannabis
use (0–4), which estimates the general impact of
cannabis use upon the individual, based on a
detailed assessment of amount of use, withdrawal/
dependence, cannabis-related problems, risk-taking
activities, interference with functioning, craving,
and confidence to reduce cannabis use. The Readiness to Change Questionnaire-Cannabis (RTCQC), adapted from Rollnick et al. (29), classifies
individuals according to commitment to change
cannabis use (precontemplation, contemplation,
action). Psychopathology was assessed using the
Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale-Expanded (BPRS-E;
30); a positive symptom subscale was formed by
summing conceptual disorganization, hallucinations, unusual thought content, and suspiciousness
items (BPRS-PS); the Scale for the Assessment of
Negative Symptoms (SANS; 31); and the Beck
Depression Inventory-Short Form (BDI-SF; 32).
The Social and Occupational Functioning Scale
(SOFAS; 33) records current functioning. Knowledge About Psychosis Questionnaire (KAPQ; 34)
examines understanding about psychosis and treatments. The Service Utilization Rating Scale (SURS;
17) includes information about out-patient attendance and medication.
Procedure
The SCID was administered at T2; the CASUAS,
BPRS, SANS, BDI, and SOFAS at T1–T4 and
both follow-up intervals; the RTCQ, KAPQ and
SURS were administered at T2–T4 and follow-up.
Randomization codes were computer generated
and placed in sealed envelopes, managed by a nonclinical member of the research team (S.H.).
Attempts to maintain rater blindness included use
of separate rooms and administrative procedures
for project staff, limiting information recorded in
clinical notes, and requesting participants and
clinicians not to disclose treatment conditions to
raters. The two raters who undertook the majority
RCT of cannabis intervention in first-episode psychosis
111
(85%) of the outcome assessments conducted 27
inter-rater reliability interviews. Two-way random
effects intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC)
with absolute agreement were: cannabis frequency
(ICC ¼ 1.0), cannabis severity (ICC ¼ 0.96),
BPRS-E (ICC ¼ 0.95), BPRS-PS (ICC ¼ 0.98),
SANS (ICC ¼ 0.93) and SOFAS (ICC ¼ 0.93),
suggesting excellent reliability.
Data analysis
Data were analyzed according to the intent-to-treat
principle. Missing data were handled using last
observation carried forward (LOCF) and analyses
of cases with complete data were also undertaken.
Differences between groups were assessed using
independent samples t-test, chi-square test and
Mann–Whitney U-test as appropriate. The main
dependent measure was self-reported percentage of
days used cannabis in the previous 4 weeks. Subsidiary analyses were also undertaken with this
variable; first, assessing whether there was a differential pattern of change over time by treatment
group (35) and secondly, examining outcome
according to regular (weekly or more) cannabis use
(36) given the possibility that the inclusion criteria of
individuals with any cannabis use in the past 4 weeks
may have been too broad. Finally, analyses were
performed on a subset of patients with a diagnosis of
schizophrenia/schizophreniform disorder, in order
to allow comparisons with previous literature.
The treatment groups were compared on cannabis use, psychopathology and psychosocial functioning using separate one-way analysis of
covariance (ancova) models performed at end of
treatment and 6 months post-intervention, using
the baseline score as a covariate. Change over time
on percentage of days using cannabis was assessed
using general linear model (GLM) repeated measures analysis of variance. Treatment condition was
represented by a two-level between-subjects factor
and the baseline, end of treatment and 6 months
post-intervention assessments formed a withinsubjects factor representing time. Non-normality
of continuous data was handled by performing
appropriate transformations. Adjusted contrast
coefficients in the ancova analyses were converted
to Cohen’s d effect sizes, with d ¼ 0.2 defined as a
small effect, d ¼ 0.5 as a moderate effect and d ¼
0.8 defined as a large effect (37).
Results
The recruitment path is outlined in Table 1. There
was no significant association between the entry
time for randomization and the condition received
(exact P ¼ 0.48). Table 2 shows that those who
agreed to randomization (N ¼ 47) were comparable with non-participants (N ¼ 24) on most
variables at T2, although the latter were more
educated and had lower negative symptoms scores.
Overall 65.3% of patients eligible for randomization agreed to participate in the trial. There was
no significant difference in the number of sessions
received by each group (CAP: mean ¼ 7.6, SD ¼
2.8, median ¼ 8; PE: mean ¼ 8.4, SD ¼ 2.5,
median ¼ 10; Z ¼ 1.27, P ¼ 0.20). Follow-up
rates were similar across intervention conditions
(end of treatment: CAP, N ¼ 22, PE, N ¼ 23;
6 months post-intervention: CAP, N ¼ 16, PE,
N ¼ 17).
At baseline, 57.4% of participants were using
cannabis on a weekly basis (n ¼ 27), with 42.6%
reporting monthly use (n ¼ 20). Seven participants
(14.9%) reported using cannabis on at least a daily
basis. The mean percentage of days that the
intervention groups used cannabis at baseline was
positively skewed. A log transformation was
applied and the difference between the intervention
groups was not significant (t ¼ 0.98, d.f. ¼ 45,
P ¼ 0.34; d ¼ 0.29). There were no significant
differences at baseline between the CAP and PE
groups according to gender (65.2% vs. 79.2%;
P ¼ 0.29), never married status (78.3% vs. 87.5%;
P ¼ 0.46), diagnosis of schizophrenia/schizophreniform disorder (63.6% vs. 79.2%; P ¼ 0.57)
or diagnosis of DSM-IV cannabis abuse/dependence (54.5% vs. 43.5%; P ¼ 0.46). Similarly, the
groups did not differ in terms of mean scores on the
severity of cannabis use, psychopathology, social
and occupational functioning, KAPQ and outpatient attendance (see Table 3).
As Table 3 demonstrates there were no significant differences between the CAP and PE groups
on the adjusted mean outcome scores at end of
treatment or 6 months post-intervention for the
LOCF analyses. Figure 1 shows the distribution of
percentage of days used cannabis in the previous
4 weeks at baseline and follow-up. Due to severe
positive skewness in the percentage of days used
cannabis variables, these data were log transformed to approximate normality prior to analysis.

At end of treatment, effect sizes were mostly small
or very small, with small to moderate effects
observed for the BDI favoring CAP; at 6 months
post-intervention effects sizes were small or very
small. For the complete-case analyses there were
no significant treatment effects at end of treatment
or 6 months post-intervention.
Readiness to change
Over half of the sample was in the action stage of
readiness to change at baseline (24/44; 11 CAP/13
PE), end of treatment (30/44; 14 CAP/16 PE) and
6 months post-intervention (29/44; 12 CAP/17 PE).
Four categories were created to reflect change from
baseline to end of treatment, and from baseline to
6 months post-intervention: remained action,
became action from lower level, became lower
level from action and remained at level lower than
action (lower level ¼ precontemplation or contemplation). There were no significant differences in
change between CAP and PE on readiness to change
categories at end of treatment from baseline (exact
P ¼ 0.68), or at 6 months post-intervention from
baseline (exact P ¼ 0.72).
Subsidiary analyses for percentage of days used cannabis in the
previous 4 weeks
Change over time. There was no difference in the
pattern of change over time between the CAP and
PE groups on the log-transformed percentage of
days used cannabis using LOCF, as indicated by a
non-significant interaction between treatment and
time (F ¼ 0.09, d.f. ¼ 2, 44, P ¼ 0.92). There was
a change over time effect, irrespective of the
treatment group (F ¼ 14.52, d.f. ¼ 2, 44,
P < 0.001). Repeated contrasts showed that the
log-transformed percentage of days used cannabis
decreased significantly between baseline and end of
treatment (P < 0.001; untransformed baseline
mean ¼ 32.6 [median ¼ 14.3], end of treatment
mean ¼ 24.5 [median ¼ 7.1]); there was no change
between end of treatment and 6 months postintervention (P ¼ 0.91; 6 months post-intervention
mean ¼ 25.8 [median ¼ 3.6]).
Regular users. Regular users were defined as those
using on at least a weekly basis. While regular
cannabis users in the CAP condition had moderately higher levels of cannabis use at baseline than
the PE regular users, this difference was not
statistically significant (t ¼ 1.40, d.f. ¼ 25, P ¼
0.18; d ¼ 0.56). A GLM repeated measures analysis using LOCF for the regular users indicated a
significant change over time regardless of treatment
group (F ¼ 8.39, d.f. ¼ 2, 24, P ¼ 0.002), but no
interaction between group and time (F ¼ 0.18,
d.f. ¼ 2, 24, P ¼ 0.84). ancova models indicated
that there were no significant differences between
the CAP and PE regular users at end-of-treatment
(F ¼ 0.40, d.f. ¼ 1, 24, P ¼ 0.53) or at 6 months
post-intervention (F ¼ 0.03, d.f. ¼ 1, 24, P ¼
0.86). At end of treatment the effect size was

Schizophrenia/schizophreniform disorders. A GLM

between group and time (F ¼ 1.08; d.f. ¼ 2, 30;
P ¼ 0.35). ancovas indicated no differences
between the CAP and PE groups at end of

moderate at end of treatment (d ¼ 0.41) and
negligible at 6 months post-intervention.
Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first RCT to compare
methods of cannabis reduction in FEP. The results
indicate that use of a specialized, cognitive-behavioral intervention for reducing cannabis use and
enhancing readiness to change was no more
effective than the provision of regular PE. In
both conditions there was a significant decrease in
cannabis use at the end of treatment, which was
sustained at 6-month follow-up. The decrease in
cannabis use was evident among regular users and
individuals with schizophrenia/schizophreniform
disorders. Both interventions were also associated

psychosocial functioning. In the absence of a
treatment-as-usual/standard care control condition, definitive conclusions are limited; however,
the findings suggest that relatively straightforward
interventions such as PE warrant preliminary
attention as a means to reduce cannabis use in
early psychosis.
Both groups in this study reduced their cannabis
use over time, with an overall change from a median
of 4 days in the 4 weeks prior to baseline, to 2 days
at end of treatment, and to 1 day in the 4 weeks
prior to 6-month follow-up. These results arguably
represent a clinically meaningful decrease, albeit in
the context of a floor effect in the rates of cannabis
use at baseline. Furthermore, many of the participants were in the action phase of change across the
study (ranging from 54% at baseline to 66% at
6-month follow-up), supporting the notion that
there is a window of opportunity for intervention
with this population. Baker et al. (38) also noted
that among psychiatric in-patients using cannabis,
younger people were more likely to be in the
contemplation/action stage. On the basis of these
findings, there should be clinical optimism regarding both the opportunities for intervention and the
effectiveness of treatments for cannabis use in the
early phase of recovery from a psychotic illness.
Nonetheless, replication of the results in a sample of
FEP patients with more severe and entrenched
cannabis use is necessary. Furthermore, while briefer interventions than those trialled here are clinically appealing and potentially worth evaluating in
the context of the current findings, the challenge of
achieving a sufficient intervention dose for individuals in the early stages of FEP may auger against
the effectiveness of such an approach.
Contrary to the hypothesis, there was no benefit
of CAP intervention over PE, either for cannabis
use or psychosocial indices. The small sample size
is unlikely to account for the lack of differences as
the effect sizes for cannabis use were negligible. It
could be argued that PE was too active for a
control condition as intensive PE delivered by
specialists may assist in establishing an association
between cannabis use and psychosis. Comparison
treatments controlling for therapist time have not
been included in recent trials of cannabis-focused
interventions (e.g. 35, 39, 40) and hence superior
outcomes reported for active conditions compared
with delayed treatment may reflect additional
therapist contact. The enriched EPPIC treatmentas-usual environment is a further consideration for
the lack of intervention effect. While there appears
little advantage for cognitive-behavioral therapybased interventions here, it is possible that approaches such as CAP may show benefits over control
conditions in mental health services where routine
care is less comprehensive.
There are several limitations associated with this
study. First, interpretation of the results would
have been assisted by inclusion of a treatment-asusual condition. The PE comparison intervention
controlling for therapist contact was included for
reasons similar to those outlined by Sensky et al.
(41). Nonetheless, as little is known about the
natural history of cannabis use in the early
months following treatment engagement for FEP,
it cannot be discounted that the same decrease in
use may have been observed in patients receiving
standard care. Secondly, the results suggested that
the CAP group comprised more individuals with
greater cannabis use at baseline compared with PE
and, in hindsight, it would have been advisable to
stratify the sample on cannabis use. Use of
collateral information to validate self-reported
cannabis use would also be prudent. Our recruitment strategy permitted trial entry at one of three
points over a 12-month period and the comparability of individuals using cannabis at these various
times is unclear, including their degree of symptom
stabilization. It is possible that this recruitment
strategy also contributed to the lack of differences
between treatment groups. Furthermore, the nonparticipation rate in the sample was relatively high,
although this reflects the nature of the patient
population, where factors such as first time diagnosis, ambivalence about treatment and the need
for patient collaboration during the engagement
and treatment process can influence refusal rates.
Finally, individuals with substance use problems in
addition to cannabis were not excluded from the
trial, although poly-substance abuse at the time of
the study (postclinical stabilization) was infrequently reported.
There are several issues arising from this firstgeneration cannabis and psychosis treatment trial.
Cannabis-focused interventions may have maximum impact for daily cannabis users and/or individuals meeting criteria for cannabis dependence,
with treatment effects in the present study hampered
by the floor effect. Adding a single-item assessment
concerning the quantity of cannabis use, such as
number of joints consumed on a typical day, may
increase the sensitivity of measurement, particularly
for daily users. Relapse following an FEP may also
be an opportune time for learning and motivation to
change, possibly enhanced by increasing the duration and frequency of CAP therapy, and using a
longer follow-up period. Finally, there may be
considerable flux in cannabis use over the course
of early treatment for psychosis and prospective
studies will be informative.
RCT of cannabis intervention in first-episode psychosis
115
In conclusion, there are few RCTs on individual
psychological therapies for individuals with schizophrenia and the present study is the first intervention trial targeting cannabis and psychosis. We
focused on the early phases of psychotic disorders,
targeting clinically stabilized young people who
were still using cannabis despite initial comprehensive treatment for FEP. Contrary to expectations,
the experimental treatment did not show advantages over the active control condition, suggesting
that simple interventions such as PE warrant
consideration before implementing more intensive
clinical therapies.
