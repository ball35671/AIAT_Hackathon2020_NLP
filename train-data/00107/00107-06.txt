Cannabidiol is a component of marijuana that does not activate cannabinoid receptors, but moderately inhibits the degradation of
the endocannabinoid anandamide. We previously reported that an elevation of anandamide levels in cerebrospinal fluid inversely
correlated to psychotic symptoms. Furthermore, enhanced anandamide signaling let to a lower transition rate from initial prodromal
states into frank psychosis as well as postponed transition. In our translational approach, we performed a double-blind, randomized
clinical trial of cannabidiol vs amisulpride, a potent antipsychotic, in acute schizophrenia to evaluate the clinical relevance of our initial
findings. Either treatment was safe and led to significant clinical improvement, but cannabidiol displayed a markedly superior sideeffect profile. Moreover, cannabidiol treatment was accompanied by a significant increase in serum anandamide levels, which was
significantly associated with clinical improvement. The results suggest that inhibition of anandamide deactivation may contribute to
the antipsychotic effects of cannabidiol potentially representing a completely new mechanism in the treatment of schizophrenia.

Introduction
The search for safe and effective drugs to treat schizophrenia
is hindered by the complex nature of this disorder, which is
known to involve multiple brain neurotransmitters.1 Among
them are the endogenous cannabinoids, a family of lipid
messengers that target the same cell surface receptors
engaged by D9
-tetrahydrocannabinol in marijuana.2 Because
D9
-tetrahydrocannabinol and other direct-acting cannabinoid
agonists can induce psychotic symptoms both in healthy
volunteers3–5 and schizophrenic patients,6,7 it has been
suggested that hyperactivity of the endocannabinoid system
might contribute to psychotic states.8,9 This idea has fueled
two large-scale clinical trials with CB1-type cannabinoid
receptor antagonists in schizophrenia, which yielded, however, negative results.10,11 A diametrically opposite view —
namely that certain components of the endocannabinoid
system might have a protective role in schizophrenia — was
suggested by studies with antipsychotic-naı¨ve schizophrenic
patients, in which it was found that the symptom intensity
experienced by these subjects was negatively correlated with
cerebrospinal levels of anandamide,12,13 an endocannabinoid
transmitter known to be involved in the regulation of pain,
mood and cognition.14 Consistent with these clinical observations, animal experiments have shown that pharmacological
blockade of anandamide degradation attenuates, rather than
enhances, psychotic-like behaviors induced in rodents by
amphetamine and phencyclidine.15,16
Cannabidiol is a non-psychotropic component of marijuana
that binds to CB1 receptors with only comparably very low
affinity17,18 and is devoid of overt cannabimimetic or propsychotic properties.17 Biochemical studies indicate that
cannabidiol may enhance endogenous anandamide signaling
indirectly, by inhibiting the intracellular degradation of
anandamide catalyzed by the enzyme fatty acid amide
hydrolase (FAAH).19 Furthermore, preliminary clinical case
reports suggest that cannabidiol might exert antipsychotic
effects in schizophrenic patients.20–22 In addition, experimental studies show that cannabidiol reduces psychosis-like
effects of D9
-tetrahydrocannabinol and synthetic analogs.22,23
Materials and methods
Pre-clinical studies
Detection of fatty acid ethanolamides. Serum levels of
anandamide, palmityolethanolamide and oleoylethanolamide
were determined at baseline, day 14 and day 28 by
liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry as described
previously.24,25
FAAH assay. FAAH activity was measured at 37 1C for
30 min in 0.5 ml of Tris buffer (50 mM, pH 7.5) containing fatty
acid-free bovine serum albumin (0.05%, w/v), protein from
tissue homogenates of the rat brain membranes (50 mg),
cannabidiol (0.3 mM, 1 mM, 3 mM, 10 mM, 30 mM, 0.3 mM, 0.1 mM,
and 1 mM) and (3
H-ethanolamine) anandamide (10 000 d.p.m.,
specific activity 20 Ci mmol1
). For concentration response
the drug CBD was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide and added
to the samples at a final concentration of 1% dimethyl

Clinical trial. This study was a therapeutic-exploratory
(phase II), double-blinded, monocenter, randomized,
parallel-group, controlled clinical trial of cannabidiol vs
amisulpride (CBD-CT1; ClinicalTrials.gov. Identifier:
NCT00628290). The study protocol was approved by the
Ethics Committee of the University of Cologne and the
BfArM (Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Products).
Initially an independent psychiatrist assessed patients to
confirm their ability to provide informed consent. Then,
written informed consent was obtained from each patient
following a detailed explanation of study procedures.
Men and women age 18–50 years who had a diagnosis of
schizophrenia or schizophreniform psychosis according to the
DSM-IV criteria were eligible for the study. All patients were
hospitalized at baseline and through day 28 after random
assignment to treatment. A total number of 42 inpatients of the
Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy of the University
of Cologne participated in the study. In all, 37 patients were
suffering from acute paranoid schizophrenia (DSM-IV 295.30).
Another 5 patients were initially diagnosed as suffering from
schizophreniform psychosis (DSM-IV 295.40) based on the
duration of illness, but were followed-up and diagnosed with
paranoid schizophrenia after completing the study. Only
acutely psychotic patients with a total Brief Psychiatric Rating
Scale (BPRS) score X36 and a BPRS THOT factor (thought
disorders) score X12 were eligible to participate. Patients
with a positive urine drug screening for illicit drugs in general
and cannabinoids in particular were not allowed to participate
to avoid an interaction of currently bioactive cannabinoids
(including cannabidiol) with treatment. Further exclusion criteria
were relevant psychiatric disorders including substance use
disorders, previous treatment with a depot antipsychotic within
3 months before the participation in the study, a history of
treatment resistance, defined by the persistence of severe
symptoms despite adequate treatment with at least two
antipsychotics or prior treatment with clozapine, a relevant
and/or unstable medical condition and an insufficient contraception, pregnancy or breast-feeding in female patients.
We enrolled 42 acutely exacerbated schizophrenic patients
who had met the DSM-IV criteria. In all, 39 patients were
evaluated according to modified intention-to-treat (Table 1),
33 were observed and treated per protocol and all 42 were
valid for safety evaluation (Figure 1). After a screening period
of up to 7 days and a minimum period of 3 antipsychoticfree days patients were randomized (1:1) to receive either
cannabidiol or amisulpride starting with 200 mg per day each
and increased stepwise by 200 mg per day to a daily dose of
200 mg four times daily (total 800 mg per day) each within the
first week. The hospital pharmacy provided individual medication kits according to a randomization sequence prepared by a
person otherwise not involved in the study (drawing paper lots
out of a bowl). The respective treatment was maintained for
another 3 weeks. A reduction of each treatment to 600 mg per
day was allowed for clinical reasons, such as unwanted side
effects after week 2, which was the case for three patients in
the cannabidiol and five patients in the amisulpride treatment
group. In addition, lorazepam co-medication was allowed with
up to 7.5 mg per day during the entire study.
Clinical measurements. The end points of the clinical trials
are generally accepted and recommended by the European
Medicines Agency for the measurement of clinically
observed changes in patients with an acute schizophrenic
and schizophreniform psychosis. The BPRS and the Positive
and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) were both used as
primary outcome measures for the assessment of psychotic
symptoms at baseline, day 14 and day 28 of the treatment
period of the trial. The BPRS was implemented in the trial
to establish a fast to assess safety parameter in case of
a relevant worsening of symptoms in single patients and
was assessed on day 7 and day 21 if clinically relevant by
investigator’s decision. Side effects were evaluated using
the Extrapyramidal Symptom Scale (EPS) and included the
measurement of serum prolactin (mg l1
) and body weight
(kg). Safety measures included repeated electrocardiograms
as well as routine blood parameters.
Hypotheses and statistical analysis. The primary study
objective was to determine whether cannabidiol given for
28 days was non-inferior to amisulpride in the treatment
of patients with schizophrenia as measured by the PANSS
and the BPRS. Side effects were evaluated using the
Extrapyramidal Symptom Scale and included the measurement of serum prolactin (mg l1
) and body weight (kg). Safety

measures included repeated electrocardiograms as well as
routine blood values. These end points are generally
accepted and recommended by the European Medicines
Agency for the measurement of clinically observed changes
in patients with an acute schizophrenic and schizophreniform
psychosis.
We planned to randomly assign 35 patients to each
treatment group which would have provided 82% power to
detect an effect size of 0.7 (E9/13 ¼ D/s) in the change-frombaseline PANSS/BPRS total score at a two-sided 5%
significance level using an unadjusted two-sample t-test.26
Unfortunately, enrolment was significantly affected by the
exclusion of cannabinoid-positive patients in urine drug
screening (Figure 1), which led to a termination of the study
due to expiration of funding.
The primary efficacy variable was the intra-individual
difference of PANSS and BPRS at baseline (days 8 to 1)
and day 28, that is, PANSS/BPRS (baseline) minus PANSS/
BPRS (day 28). The primary hypothesis to be tested
confirmatory with the parametric Sasabuchi test, (a ¼ 2.5%,
one-sided) was relevant inferiority of cannabidiol vs
amisulpride, that is, H0: mCannabidioly  mAmisulprider0 vs H1:
mCannabidioly  mAmisulpride40 with y ¼ 80% (m denotes the
expected value).27 Equivalently, a 95% confidence interval
for the ratio mCannabidiol/mAmisulpride was calculated (according
to Fieller). The non-inferiority parameter y ¼ 80% was
chosen because in the literature PANSS/BPRS changes of
20–50% are discussed as ‘response to therapy’.28 Thus,
changes up to 20% can be deemed clinically irrelevant
(especially because of the large intra-individual variance;
compare CPMP/EWP, 1998).29
Patients with missing post baseline measures were excluded
from the efficacy analysis. Thus, the ‘modified intention-to-treat’
set encompassed all patients who had been randomized,
had received any study medication and had provided a valid
PANSS/BPRS at day 14 or 28. A missing PANSS/BPRS
at day 28 was imputed by the last valid preceding value
‘last observation carried forward’, LOCF. The ‘per protocol’
set encompassed all patients who had been treated, and
observed according to protocol.
A mixed effects repeated measures model (unstructured
covariance matrix) for the change-from-baseline included
baseline as a covariate with treatment, visit and treatment-byvisit interaction as fixed effects (missing values were not
imputed). The same analysis model was chosen for secondary outcomes and side effects. Specific contrasts were
evaluated (between groups at specific visits, between visits
within groups).
The ‘valid for safety’ set encompassed all patients who were
randomized and received any study medication. On the basis
of this the treatment-emergent adverse events were compared among treatment groups using Fisher’s exact test.
Owing to the exploratory nature of the study, all analyses were
performed without adjustment for multiplicity. Statistical
analyses were done using IBM SPSS Statistics 19 (Somers,
NY, USA) and R 2.12.1 (Vienna, Austria; Sasabuchi test,
Fieller’s confidence interval).
Results
The basic hypothesis for our translational approach was
that enhancement of anandamide signaling by administration of cannabidiol should result in an improvement of
psychotic symptoms. To put this hypothesis to test, we
performed a 4-week double-blind, parallel-group, randomized, active-controlled clinical trial of cannabidiol vs the

subcategories of symptoms of schizophrenia (Figures 2b–d,
Table 2). Comparison (modified intention-to-treat) of the
clinical effects of amisulpride and cannabidiol revealed no
relevant difference between the two treatments (1.0, 95%
confidence interval 12.6 to 14.6, P ¼ 0.884; Table 2);
the confirmatory test of non-inferiority with 80% retention
bound yielded a ratio of means 0.94 (CBD/AMI) with 95%
confidence interval 0.55–1.59. Thus non-inferiority seems
highly plausible, but could not be demonstrated, P ¼ 0.27
(one-sided). Results were very similar using the per protocol
set and/or the BPRS (Table 2). We found no difference in the
proportion of responders (X20% improvement in PANSS total
score) to each treatment (CBD 15/20, AMI 14/19, P ¼ 1.000).
Furthermore, lorazepam co-medication did not significantly
influence our results (Supplementary Figure 1). These results
suggest that cannabidiol is as effective at improving psychotic
symptoms as the standard antipsychotic amisulpride.
The use of antipsychotic drugs is associated with frequent
side effects, which markedly influence acute compliance and
long-term treatment adherence. These include motor disturbances (so-called extrapyramidal symptoms), weight gain
and sexual dysfunction. Compared with amisulpride, we
found that treatment with cannabidiol was associated with
significantly fewer extrapyramidal symptoms (P ¼ 0.006;
Figure 3a), less weight gain (P ¼ 0.010; Figure 3b), and lower
prolactin increase—a predictor of galactorrhoea and sexual

was well-tolerated (Supplementary Table 3) and did not
significantly affect hepatic or cardiac functions.
Previous work has suggested that cannabidiol may protect
anandamide from deactivation by interfering with FAAH
activity 15. We confirmed this result showing that cannabidiol
inhibits FAAH in rat brain membranes with a median effective
concentration of 8.6±0.2 mM (n ¼ 12). We further found that
cannabidiol, at a concentration that reduces FAAH activity
by B50% (10 mM), does not significantly interact with a broad
panel of neurotransmitter receptors that are relevant to
schizophrenia, including dopamine, glutamate and serotonine. To determine whether treatment with cannabidiol
reduces FAAH activity in our study subjects, we measured
anandamide concentrations in serum before and after
exposure to cannabidiol or amisulpride. Anandamide levels
were higher in subjects exposed to cannabidiol than in those
exposed to amisulpride (Figure 4a). Importantly, the serum
levels of two additional FAAH substrates—the non-cannabimimetic lipid mediators palmitoylethanolamide (Figure 4b)
and oleoylethanolamide (Figure 4c)—were also elevated in
schizophrenic patients treated with cannabidiol, compared
with those treated with amisulpride.
Next, to assess whether the ability to impair FAAH
activity might contribute to the antipsychotic effects of
cannabidiol, we investigated the relationship between
changes in serum anandamide levels and psychotic symptoms (median slope analysis). We found a statistically
significant association between increase in anandamide
levels and decrease in psychotic symptoms in patients treated
with cannabidiol (P ¼ 0.0012). In contrast, no such association
was found in patients treated with amisulpride (P ¼ 0.64)
(Figure 5). Moreover, no such relationship was apparent for
serum oleoylethanolamide (median slopes: cannabidiol 0.05 1/
(pmol ml1
), P¼ 1.00, amisulpride 5.91 1/(pmol ml1
), P¼ 0.30)
or serum palmitoylethanolamide (median slopes: cannabidiol
3.8 1/(pmol ml1
), P¼ 0.091, amisulpride 5.6 1/(pmol ml1
),
P¼ 0.19). These findings suggest the existence of a functional
link between the antipsychotic effects of cannabidiol and its
ability to inhibit anandamide degradation, though further
research is needed to determine whether this link represents
cause and effect.
Discussion
Our results provide evidence that the non-cannabimimetic
constituent of marijuana, cannabidiol, exerts clinically relevant
antipsychotic effects that are associated with marked tolerability and safety, when compared with current medications.
Although a plethora of pharmacological mechanisms have
recently been suggested relevant for the antipsychotic effect of
cannabidiol31 the primary pharmacological mechanism through
which cannabidiol exerts this antipsychotic effect in humans
is unclear at present. However, the significant association
observed in cannabidiol-treated patients between improvement of clinical symptoms and serum anandamide levels
suggests that the ability of cannabidiol to inhibit the FAAH
activity and enhance intrinsic anandamide signaling might be a
functionally relevant component of its antipsychotic properties.
Although only serum levels of anandamide were assessed in
this study in comparison with cerebrospinal fluid samples,13,32
the systemic effect of cannabidiol on FAAH inhibition is highly
likely to be reflected in this compartment. In addition, while
serum values of endocannabinoids have been found less
useful in early stages of schizophrenia, they have been
reported valuable in more chronic cases.33,34 Our interpretation is supported by two sets of clinical data. First, in a relatively
large cohort of antipsychotic-naı¨ve schizophrenic patients
(n ¼ 47), cerebrospinal anandamide levels were found to be
inversely correlated with psychotic symptoms.13 Second, highrisk subjects for psychosis35 who exhibited lower cerebrospinal
levels of anandamide also showed a higher risk for transiting to
frank psychosis.32 As is often the case in this type of study, we
cannot exclude that cannabidiol may reduce psychotic
symptoms through complementary or even alternative mechanisms to FAAH inhibition, including interactions with
serotonin 5-HT1A receptors,36 GPR55 receptors37 and transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 receptors.19 Nevertheless,

our results do provide a rationale for additional clinical testing
of selective FAAH inhibitors in schizophrenia.
