Objective: To evaluate and compare the effectiveness and adverse effects of intramuscular (IM) olanzapine and IM
aripiprazole for the treatment of agitated patients with schizophrenia in clinical practice.
Methods: A 24-hour randomized double-blind study carried out at a psychiatric hospital in Thailand enrolled
adult patients (18–65 years old) with schizophrenia experiencing agitation. Patients received one dose of IM
olanzapine or IM aripiprazole followed by routine oral psychotropic medications. Efficacy was primarily measured using the Excited Component of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS-EC).
Results: A total of 80 patients with a PANSS-EC score range of 22–35 entered the study, of whom 13% had a medical comorbidity and 40% a history of active substance abuse. The 40 patients receiving IM olanzapine showed
greater improvement than the 40 patients receiving IM aripiprazole in PANSS-EC scores at 2 h after the injection
(p = 0.002) but not at 24 h. The two treatments were well tolerated. Patients receiving IM olanzapine experienced greater somnolence than those receiving IM aripiprazole. There were no clinically relevant changes in
vital signs in either group.
Conclusion: The results indicate that IM olanzapine and aripiprazole are similarly effective and well tolerated in
the real-world treatment of agitation associated with schizophrenia over the first 24 h. However, in the early
hours, IM olanzapine may produce more sedation and reductions in agitation.

1. Introduction
Agitation can be considered a psychiatric emergency and is a common presentation for multiple psychiatric conditions, including schizophrenia (Nordstrom and Allen, 2007). Although a possible cause of
agitation in patients with schizophrenia may be comorbidities, such as
metabolic disorder, traumatic brain injury, and infection, the most common cause is psychotic relapse (Battaglia et al., 2007; Buckley et al.,
2011). Management of agitated patients with schizophrenia involves
non-pharmacological intervention and pharmacological agents (Marco
and Vaughan, 2005; Marder, 2008). Effective pharmacological agents
include several classes of antipsychotic agents and benzodiazepines
(Marco and Vaughan, 2005). Benzodiazepines cause nonspecific sedation but have little effect on psychosis (Battaglia et al., 2007). For psychosis-driven agitation in patients with known schizophrenia,
antipsychotics are preferred over benzodiazepines because they address the underlying psychosis (Wilson et al., 2012). The successful
use of these medications also requires rapid onset of action (Buckley
et al., 2011), which usually requires a medication/formulation to have
a short time to peak plasma concentration (Citrome, 2013).
Owing to its established efficacy in managing agitation in psychosis
and rapid onset of action, the first-generation injectable antipsychotic
haloperidol has long been used in the treatment of agitation in schizophrenia (Zeller and Citrome, 2016). Second-generation antipsychotics
(SGAs) are a newer development in the management of agitation. Several SGAs, including olanzapine, ziprasidone, and aripiprazole, are commonly used in the acute setting and are now available as short-acting
intramuscular (IM) formulations (Buckley et al., 2011; Wilson et al.,
2012). Reports of meta-analyses have demonstrated that IM preparations of SGAs produce more favorable extrapyramidal side effect profiles
than haloperidol (Citrome, 2007; Satterthwaite et al., 2008) while providing similarly strong effects in the reduction of agitation (Citrome,
2007).
Like other SGAs, olanzapine is primarily an antagonist of serotonergic (5-HT2A) and dopaminergic (D2) receptors. It also has antagonist effects on muscarinic, histamine, and alpha-1-adrenergic receptors
(Bymaster et al., 1996; Schatzberg et al., 2007). Short-acting IM
olanzapine reaches maximum plasma concentration in 15–45 min,
compared with 3–6 h after an oral dose (U.S. Food and Drug
Administration Psychopharmacological Drugs Advisory Committee,

agitation in patients with schizophrenia: A pragma..., Schizophr. Res. (2016), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.schres.2016.07.017
2001). Previous studies in agitated patients with schizophrenia show
that IM olanzapine 10 mg has efficacy in reducing agitation that is comparable but more rapid than IM haloperidol 7.5 mg (Breier et al., 2002;
Wright et al., 2001, 2003). In clinical trials, the most frequently reported
adverse events with IM olanzapine were somnolence, dizziness, asthenia, and hypotension (Wagstaff et al., 2005).
Aripiprazole differs pharmacologically from the other SGAs. It is a
partial agonist of the dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT1A receptors
and an antagonist of 5-HT2A receptors (Burris et al., 2002). Aripiprazole
has moderate affinity for histaminic and alpha-adrenergic receptors and
low affinity for muscarinic receptors (Shapiro et al., 2003). A peak plasma concentration of aripiprazole is achieved in 1–3 h after IM injection,
compared with 3–5 h after oral administration (Boulton et al., 2008;
Mallikaarjun et al., 2004). In two large randomized double-blind placebo-controlled studies (Andrezina et al., 2006; Tran-Johnson et al., 2007),
9.75 mg IM aripiprazole demonstrated rapid and effective control of agitation without oversedation in patients with schizophrenia and
schizoaffective disorder. IM aripiprazole was well tolerated and associated with lower extrapyramidal side effects than IM haloperidol. The
most frequent adverse events after injection of aripiprazole were headache, nausea, dizziness, and somnolence (Andrezina et al., 2006;
Sanford and Scott, 2008; Tran-Johnson et al., 2007).
Guidelines from the American Association for Emergency Psychiatry
recommend using an SGA as monotherapy or in combination with another medication instead of haloperidol to treat agitated patients with
a known psychotic disorder (Wilson et al., 2012).
There have been no head-to-head trials of rapid-acting IM formulations of SGAs in the acute setting. Most comparisons of efficacy were
generated relative to comparisons with placebos and older treatments.
Although published reviews have generally indicated that SGAs are
equally effective in reducing agitation, there are differences between
the SGAs that should help the decision making process in clinical practice (Schleifer, 2011; Wilson et al., 2012). Short-acting IM aripiprazole
appears slightly less efficacious than short-acting IM olanzapine
(Citrome, 2007). The choice of pharmacological treatment for agitation
should also take into account the risk of adverse reactions, the presence
of medical comorbidities and substance abuse, and drug interactions
with concomitant medications (Fagiolini et al., 2013; Ng et al., 2010;
Zimbroff, 2008). In the first published review of the post-marketing
safety data of IM olanzapine, 51.7% of fatal cases reported current or
prior benzodiazepine use (Marder et al., 2010). A review of patients
who received any type of SGA in emergency departments demonstrated
that approximately 11% of them presented with evidence of alcohol intoxication and 21% were co-administered with benzodiazepines
(Wilson et al., 2014), whereas most published studies of the administration of SGAs in agitated patients have not investigated their use with
benzodiazepines or in alcohol-intoxicated patients (Wilson et al., 2012).
The purpose of this study is to evaluate and compare the effectiveness and adverse effects of IM olanzapine and IM aripiprazole in the
treatment of agitated patients with schizophrenia in real-world clinical
practice.
2. Methods
2.1. Patients
The study was conducted at Nakhon Sawan Rajanagarindra Psychiatric Hospital, the only psychiatric hospital in Lower Northern Thailand.
The hospital offers outpatient care and inpatient hospitalization with 60
beds and serves as a referral center for psychiatric patients in its area. Eligible participants were male and female patients aged 18–65 years
with a diagnosis of schizophrenia according to the DSM-5 (American
Psychiatric Association, 2013) visiting the outpatient or emergency department of the hospital from July 2014 to October 2014. Patients may
have no history of antipsychotic treatment, may have been treated
with oral antipsychotic medications or long-acting injectable
antipsychotics, or may have discontinued medication. Our study required patients to be experiencing acute agitation with a total score of
15 or higher on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale–Excited
Component (PANSS-EC) and a score of 5 or higher on at least one
item—the same scores as used for the administration of as-needed
anti-agitation medication in the study hospital (Chaichan, 2008). The
patients also had to be appropriate candidates for parenteral treatment
according to the treating physician. Additionally, patients had to agree
to be admitted to the hospital or their legally authorized representatives
had to agree for them to be admitted. Patients were excluded if they had
a known allergy to olanzapine or aripiprazole or were pregnant or
breastfeeding. Medical comorbidity and substance use were not exclusion criteria. The study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee review board. The study was explained to the prospective
patients or their legally authorized representatives and the patients or
their representatives gave written informed consent before any protocol-required procedures were performed.
2.2. Study design and treatment
This was a pragmatic double-blind randomized study evaluating and
comparing the effectiveness and adverse events of IM olanzapine with
IM aripiprazole in the treatment of acute agitation in hospitalized patients with schizophrenia. The recruiting process was performed at
the outpatient or emergency department of the study hospital and included a medical record review, history taking, and clinical evaluation.
After a baseline assessment using relevant measures, participants
were assigned to receive an IM dose of either 10 mg olanzapine or
9.75 mg aripiprazole by a nurse who blindly picked the name of the
assigned medication from a box with equal numbers of folded papers
printed with each medication. The patients were then admitted to a
psychiatric ward for a period of 24 h. The randomization and process
to administer an injection of the study medication to the patients
were carried out by nurses. The patients and the physician investigator
were blinded to treatment assignment as long as the 24-hour assessment was not completed. The assessment was performed by the investigator and the nurse who administered the injection was not involved
in the assessment process of the study.
An IM injection of the study medication was given to the patients as
soon as they were transferred to the ward. Repeated doses of the study
medication or any kinds of parenteral medication were prohibited during the 24 h after the injection of the study medication. Following standard practice in the study hospital, a scheduled oral regimen of
antipsychotics was prescribed and administered concomitantly since
the first day of admission. The antipsychotic medication administered
orally and its dose were decided by the treating physician. The treating
physician was also allowed to prescribe a scheduled regimen of oral
benzodiazepines, other psychotropic medications, and trihexyphenidyl.
Nevertheless, as-needed (PRN) or stat orders for any medications were
not allowed. Patients who had been taking medications for underlying
medical conditions, such as antihypertensive or antidiabetic drugs,
were allowed to continue taking their medications during the study
period.
2.3. Assessments
Patient demographic data and psychiatric characteristics, including
duration of the illness, duration of the current episode, and the total
number of hospitalizations, were collected upon recruitment. In addition, patients' history of past treatment with long-acting injectable antipsychotics within 30 days prior to recruitment was collected, as were
data on medical comorbidity and substance use. The initial severity of
the symptoms associated with schizophrenia was evaluated using the
Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), with 18 items and a scale of 1 to
7 (Overall and Gorham, 1962).

agitation in patients with schizophrenia: A pragma..., Schizophr. Res. (2016), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.schres.2016.07.017
2.3.1. Efficacy assessments
The efficacy of the study medications on agitation was primarily
assessed using the PANSS-EC (Kay et al., 1987; Lindenmayer et al.,
2004). The PANSS-EC scale is a subset of items derived from the
PANSS and consists of five items: excitement, hostility, tension,
uncooperativeness, and poor impulse control. Each item is scored on a
seven-point severity scale (1 = absent to 7 = extreme), primarily by
observation. The PANSS-EC is a validated and reliable instrument that
allows for the investigation of the anti-agitation effects of antipsychotic
treatment in short-term clinical trials (Lindenmayer et al., 2004;
Montoya et al., 2011). The PANSS-EC was rated by the two investigators,
psychiatrists with 10 years and 17 years of experience with the schizophrenic population, and the Thai version of the structured clinical interview for the PANSS was used as a guide for the evaluation (Nilchaikovit
et al., 2000).
Secondary outcome measures used to assess the severity of agitation
during the study included the Agitation Calmness Evaluation Scale
(ACES; Copyright Eli Lilly and Company), a single-item, nine-point
scale that rates the patient on an agitated–calm–sleeping continuum.
A score of 1 indicates marked agitation; 2, moderate agitation; 3, mild
agitation; 4, normal; 5, mild calmness; 6, moderate calmness; 7, marked
calmness; 8, deep sleep; and 9, unable to be aroused (Battaglia et al.,
2003). This scale has high convergent validity and high reliability
(Battaglia et al., 2003; Meehan et al., 2002) and has been used in several
clinical trials (Montoya et al., 2011). The Clinical Global Impression-Severity of Illness (CGI-S;Guy, 1976) was also used to assess efficacy of the
study medication. The CGI-S is a single-item instrument used to assess
overall severity based on the clinician's experience with a particular patient population. Ratings on the CGI-S in this study focused on the severity of agitation rather than the severity of illness, with scores ranging
from 1 (normal, not at all agitated) to 7 (among the most extremely agitated patients).
Before patients were assigned to the study medications, the study
investigator conducted baseline assessments using all of the efficacy
measures. These measures were then rated again at 2 h and 24 h after
an injection of the study medication. For each patient, the same rater
conducted the assessment throughout the study.
2.3.2. Safety assessments
Patient adverse effects were monitored during the study period with
spontaneous reports and using the Udvalg for Kliniske Undersogelser
side effects rating scale (Lingjaerde et al., 1987). This questionnaire divides adverse effects into four general categories of symptoms: psychic,
neurologic, autonomic, and miscellaneous. Extrapyramidal symptoms
were also evaluated using the Simpson–Angus Scale (SAS; Simpson
and Angus, 1970), which ranges from zero to 40, with higher scores indicating more extrapyramidal signs. Akathisia was also assessed using
the Barnes Akathisia Scale (BARS; Barnes, 1989), which ranges from
zero to 14, with higher scores indicating more severe akathisia. These
adverse effect measures were performed together with an assessment
of injection site reactions (including pain, swelling, and redness) at
baseline and at 2 h and 24 h after an injection of the study medication.
Patients' vital signs, including blood pressure and pulse rate, were also
assessed.
2.4. Statistical analysis
Demographic data and baseline clinical characteristics were summarized using descriptive statistics. They were compared between two
treatment groups using Student's t-test for continuous variables. Categorical variables were compared using a chi-squared test or, when
N20% of the expected frequencies were less than five, a Fisher's exact
test. Efficacy outcomes were changes from baseline to 2 h and 24 h
after the injection as measured by PANSS-EC, ACES, and CGI-S scores.
These were compared within treatment groups using paired t-tests
and between the two groups using Student's t-test. Patients who
achieved a 40% reduction or more in their PANSS-EC total score from
baseline to 2 h and 24 h were defined as responders and the response
rates were compared between the two treatment groups. A subgroup
evaluation was also performed based on baseline agitation levels.
Data on concomitant medications were summarized and the doses
expressed as a multiple of the defined daily doses (DDD; World
Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Drug Statistics
Methodology, 2014) to allow comparisons of different antipsychotics
and benzodiazepines between the two treatment groups. The DDD
was obtained from the World Health Organization Collaborating
Centre for Drug Statistics Methodology (2015) and is assumed to be
the average maintenance dose per day for a drug used for its main indication in adults.
Analysis of safety data included changes in blood pressure and pulse
rates and extrapyramidal symptoms, akathisia, and other adverse
events. Criteria for potentially clinically significant (PCS) changes in
vital signs were defined and used in the safety analysis. An ACES score
of 8 (deep sleep) or 9 (unarousable) was also considered an adverse effect. The numbers of patients who experienced adverse events were
summarized for each treatment group. Mean changes from baseline in
the SAS and BARS scores were also analyzed. All the statistical tests
were two tailed and a p-value of 0.05 was considered statistically
significant.
3. Results
3.1. Patient disposition and baseline characteristics
A total of 80 agitated patients with schizophrenia were enrolled in
the study. Two-thirds (67.5%) of the patients were men and the mean
age was 40.7 years (range 18–62 years). All patients were ethnic
Thais. A total of 40 patients received an IM dose of olanzapine and an
equal number of patients received an IM dose of aripiprazole. All of
the patients completed the study. Patient demographic and clinical
characteristics are summarized in Table 1. There were no significant differences in demographic characteristics between treatment groups. The
psychiatric histories, including the duration of the illness, the duration
of the current episode, and the number of previous hospitalizations,
were similar in both groups. The overall schizophrenic symptomatology
at baseline, as measured by the BPRS total score, in the olanzapine group
was more severe than that in the aripiprazole group (p = 0.050). With
regard to the severity of agitation, all patients had a mean baseline
PANSS-EC score of 28.61 ± 3.09 (range 22–35). There were no significant differences in the mean baseline PANSS-EC score between the
two treatment groups.
The numbers and percentages of patients with each type of comorbidity are listed in Table 1. Four patients (10.0%) in the olanzapine
group and six patients (15.0%) in the aripiprazole group had medical comorbidity. One patient in the olanzapine group had more than one
medical condition (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia),
as did one patient in the aripiprazole group (hypertension and dyslipidemia). A total of 19 patients (47.5%) in the olanzapine group and 13 patients (32.5%) in the aripiprazole group presented with active substance
abuse within one month. Five patients in the olanzapine group used
more than one substance: Four used alcohol and nicotine and one
used amphetamines and nicotine. Four patients in the aripiprazole
group used more than one substance: One used alcohol and nicotine;
one used amphetamines and nicotine; one used amphetamines and
cannabis; and one used alcohol, amphetamines, and nicotine.
3.2. Efficacy
At baseline, there were no differences in the PANSS-EC total scores,
ACES scores, and CGI-S scores between the olanzapine group and the
aripiprazole group (Table 2). Each item's score for the baseline PANSSEC in the olanzapine group was comparable to the corresponding

score in the aripiprazole group, except for a higher excitement score in
the olanzapine group (p = 0.042). Within-group analysis demonstrated
a significant decrease in the PANSS-EC total score of the olanzapine
group from baseline to 2 h and 24 h after the injection (29.00 ± 3.27,
13.65 ± 3.89, and 13.00 ± 4.91, respectively), as well as a significant decrease in that of the aripiprazole group (28.23 ± 2.89, 16.18 ± 5.33, and
13.55 ± 4.08, respectively; p b 0.001 for all within-group comparisons
vs. baseline). Similarly, ACES and CGI-S scores at the two time points
showed improvements in each treatment group relative to the baseline
(p b 0.001 for all within-group comparisons vs. baseline).
The change from baseline to 2 h in the PANSS-EC total score of the
olanzapine group (−15.35 ± 4.61) was significantly greater than that
of the aripiprazole group (−12.05 ± 4.74; p = 0.002). For the PANSSEC individual item scores at 2 h, the olanzapine group showed a significant decrease in excitement, hostility, and uncooperativeness compared with the aripiprazole group, but not in tension or poor impulse
control. At the same time point, greater improvement in ACES scores
was observed in the olanzapine group (2.73 ± 1.13) than in the
aripiprazole group (2.15 ± 1.05; p = 0.021). In addition, changes in
the CGI-S score at 2 h in the olanzapine group (−3.68 ± 1.16) were
greater than in the aripiprazole group (−3.10 ± 1.41; p = 0.050). However, the changes from baseline to 24 h in the PANSS-EC total score,
PANSS-EC individual item scores, ACES score, and CGI-S score did not
differ significantly between the two treatment groups.
At 2 h after the injection, the patients receiving IM olanzapine
achieved a significantly greater response rate (35 patients, 87.5%) than
those receiving IM aripiprazole (27 patients, 67.5%; p = 0.032). The response rates at 24 h after the injection were higher than those at 2 h, but
there was no statistically significant difference between the olanzapine
group (37 patients, 92.5%) and the aripiprazole group (35 patients,
87.5%; p = 0.456).
To examine changes in the PANSS-EC total score and the response
rate in patients with different baseline agitation levels, the patients
were divided into two groups using the mean baseline PANSS-EC total
score of all the patients as the cutoff value (28.61). Patients with a baseline PANSS-EC score of 28 or lower were classified as less severely agitated and patients with a baseline PANSS-EC score of 29 or higher
were classified as more severely agitated. Mean changes from baseline
in PANSS-EC total scores and the response rates for each treatment in
less and more severely agitated subgroups are reported in Table 3. In
more severely agitated patients, discrepancies between the olanzapine
and aripiprazole groups seem to be observed in the response rate at
2 h (95.7% and 62.5%, respectively) and at 24 h (91.3% and 75.0%,
respectively).
3.3. Concomitant medications
The concomitant medications reported included long-acting antipsychotics received within 30 days prior to recruitment and scheduled
oral medications taken during the 24-hour study period. These concomitant medications were categorized as antipsychotic medications, benzodiazepines, other psychotropic medications, anticholinergics, and
medications for comorbid medical conditions (Table 4). Nine patients
(22.5%) in the olanzapine group and five patients (12.5%) in the
aripiprazole group received long-acting injectable antipsychotics within
30 days prior to the study entry, including haloperidol decanoate and
fluphenazine decanoate. A total of 39 patients (97.5%) in the IM
olanzapine group and all the patients in the IM aripiprazole group received scheduled oral antipsychotics during the 24-hour study period,

including perphenazine, trifluoperazine, haloperidol, chlorpromazine,
risperidone, olanzapine, and clozapine. The mean daily doses of all the
concomitant antipsychotics in the olanzapine group (1.543 ± 1.126
DDDs) and the aripiprazole group (1.210 ± 0.886 DDDs) were similar
(p = 0.145).
Almost all of the patients in the two treatment groups received
scheduled oral benzodiazepines. A total of 35 patients (87.5%) in the
olanzapine group and 37 patients (92.5%) in the aripiprazole group received trihexyphenidyl. There was no significant difference in the
mean daily dose of benzodiazepines or trihexyphenidyl between the
two groups. Other psychotropic medications, including fluoxetine, sertraline, and sodium valproate, were given to a small number of patients
during the study period. Antihypertensive drugs were given to two
patients with hypertension in the aripiprazole group. No other medication for medical comorbidity was given during the 24-hour study
period.
3.4. Safety and adverse events
Within-group analysis demonstrated a statistically significant reduction from baseline to 2 h and 24 h in the mean systolic and mean diastolic blood pressure in the olanzapine group and the aripiprazole
group (p b 0.01 for all within-group comparisons vs. baseline). The
mean pulse rate showed a statistically significant reduction at the two
time points in the aripiprazole group and at 2 h in the olanzapine
group (Table 5).
PCS vital sign events were defined by results outside defined limits
at anytime post-baseline. The criteria for PCS changes in vital signs
were categorized as high systolic blood pressure, low systolic blood
pressure, high diastolic blood pressure, low diastolic blood pressure,
high pulse rate, and low pulse rate and are listed in Table 5. The percentages of patients with PCS changes in vital signs were calculated as the
number of patients who met criteria for PCS values at 2 h or 24 h post
injection divided by the total number of patients with a measure not
meeting the criteria for PCS values at baseline. A small number of patients in the olanzapine group and in the aripiprazole group met PCS
criteria for high systolic blood pressure, high diastolic blood pressure,
and high pulse rate, whereas a large percentage of patients in both treatment groups met criteria for low systolic blood pressure (60.5% and
48.7%, respectively) and low diastolic blood pressure (45.0% and
46.2%, respectively). Of all the patients meeting criteria for low systolic
blood pressure, a few patients (3 of 23 patients in the olanzapine
group and 1 of 19 patients in the aripiprazole group) exhibited a systolic
blood pressure of b90 mm Hg, while almost all (22 or 23 patients in the
olanzapine group and 19 of 19 patients in the aripiprazole group) experienced a reduction of N20 mm Hg in systolic blood pressure. Among patients who met the criteria for low diastolic blood pressure in both
groups, all of them experienced a reduction of N15 mm Hg in diastolic
blood pressure, while no patients experienced a diastolic blood pressure
of b50 mm Hg. No patient reported any adverse events clinically relevant to changes in blood pressure or pulse rate.
The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) during the 24-hour study period are presented in Table 6. A TEAE was defined as an adverse event not present prior to the injection of the
investigational medication or an adverse event already present that increased in severity after the injection of the investigational medication.
A total of 20 patients (50%) in the olanzapine group and 15 patients
(37.5%) in the aripiprazole group experienced one or more TEAEs. No
patients were dropped from the study. Commonly observed adverse
events (with an incidence of 5% or greater) in both the olanzapine and

aripiprazole groups were somnolence, injection site pain, rigidity, and
tremor and included headaches in the aripiprazole group.
Somnolence was the most commonly observed adverse events in
the olanzapine group and was four times as common in the olanzapine
group (12 patients, 30%) as in the aripiprazole group (3 patients, 7.5%).
Of a total of 15 patients with somnolence, 7 patients in the olanzapine
group experienced moderate somnolence while the others (5 patients
in the olanzapine group and 3 patients in the aripiprazole group) experienced mild somnolence. No patient was rated as being in a deep sleep
or unarousable by the ACES. The most frequent adverse event in the
aripiprazole group was injection site pain, which was reported over
twice as frequently by patients in the aripiprazole group (8 patients,
20%) as by those in the olanzapine group (3 patients, 7.5%). All injection
site pain in both groups (11 patients) was considered mild and resolved
without sequelae. One patient in the olanzapine group and two patients
in the aripiprazole group experienced mild treatment-emergent headaches. One patient in the aripiprazole group experienced mild nausea.
During the 24-hour study period, seven patients experienced mild
treatment-emergent rigidity. Five patients experienced treatmentemergent tremors, all of which were mild, except for one patient in
the olanzapine group, who experienced moderate tremors. The mean
baseline total SAS scores in the olanzapine group (0.25 ± 0.742) and
the aripiprazole group (0.15 ± 0.700) were very low, with a range of
0 to 4. Mean changes from baseline to 2 h (−0.03 ± 0.480 in the
olanzapine group and 0.08 ± 0.474 in the aripiprazole group) and
24 h (−0.05 ± 0.677 and 0.08 ± 0.474, respectively) were minimal.
Akathisia was not found during the 24-hour study period, as demonstrated by mean BARS scores of zero at baseline and at the two time
points in both groups. In addition, no cases of dystonia were observed.
No serious adverse events occurred during the study period.
4. Discussion
This study aimed to determine whether any differences in the
effectiveness and tolerability of the two IM SGAs, olanzapine and
aripiprazole, for the treatment of agitation in patients with schizophrenia in a pragmatic setting, where participants typically presented themselves to emergency services and routine practice was not disrupted. A
total of 10 participants (12.5%) presented with medical comorbidity and
32 participants (40.0%) presented with active substance abuse. Fourteen participants (17.5%) received long-acting antipsychotics within
30 days prior to the study entry. As the study hospital's routine practice,
the investigational medication was co-administered with scheduled
oral antipsychotic medication, oral benzodiazepines, or other psychotropic medication. To the best of our knowledge, this study appears to
be the first head-to-head study of rapid-acting IM SGAs.
Due to its broad selection criteria and being conducted in a referral
center, the present study enrolled patients with a mean baseline
PANSS-EC score of 28.61. As reported in previous randomized doubleblind placebo-controlled trials of IM olanzapine or IM aripiprazole in agitated patients with schizophrenia (Andrezina et al., 2006; Breier et al.,
2002; Tran-Johnson et al., 2007; Wright et al., 2001), the mean baseline
PANSS-EC scores (18.3–19.5) were mild to moderate. Most published
studies of IM SGAs in more severely agitated patient samples have
been observational, where the mean baseline PANSS-EC scores were
24.2–29.0 (Centorrino et al., 2007; Damsa et al., 2008; Escobar et al.,
2008; Perrin et al., 2012; San et al., 2006). Compared with previous
studies of this kind, the patients in the present study represented a
moderately to severely agitated patient population, which allowed generalization to real-world clinical practice.
As reported in previous observational studies (Castle et al., 2009;
Centorrino et al., 2007; Perrin et al., 2012), the use of rapid-acting IM antipsychotics concomitant with oral psychotropic medication, including
antipsychotics and benzodiazepines, in agitated patients with schizophrenia has been common practice. Almost all patients in the present
study were prescribed scheduled oral antipsychotics and scheduled
benzodiazepines since the first day of admission. This study had a higher
frequency of concomitant oral antipsychotic and benzodiazepine use
compared with previous observational studies (Castle et al., 2009;
Centorrino et al., 2007; Perrin et al., 2012). Although the use of these
concomitant medications may have enhanced the anti-agitation effect
of the IM investigational medication, there were no differences in the
mean DDDs of the concomitant antipsychotics and concomitant
benzodiazepines administered between the IM olanzapine and IM
aripiprazole groups, allowing the comparison of the efficacy outcomes
between the two treatments.
The results demonstrated that a single dose of IM olanzapine or IM
aripiprazole effectively reduced agitation in patients with schizophrenia
over 24 h. In comparison, treatment with IM olanzapine was shown to
be more effective in the reduction of agitation and to have a greater response rate than IM aripiprazole at 2 h but not at 24 h. Due to the fact
that medications most useful in treating agitation also require rapid
onset of action (Buckley et al., 2011; Ng et al., 2010), the results focused

on the anti-agitation effects of the two investigational medications at
2 h after the injection. Nearly 90% of the patients receiving IM
olanzapine achieved a response within 2 h after the injection, whereas
68% of the patients receiving IM aripiprazole achieved a response within
the same time. A previous review indicated that the number needed to
treat for agitation associated with schizophrenia for IM olanzapine was
3 and that for IM aripiprazole was 6 (Citrome, 2007). The results of the
present head-to-head study is consistent with previous reports regarding the efficacy of the two treatments in controlling agitation associated
with schizophrenia within the first 2 h.
Findings of efficacy in subgroups of patients with different baseline
agitation levels derived from post hoc analysis must be carefully
interpreted. The response to IM olanzapine tended to be better than to
IM aripiprazole in more severely agitated patients, whereas no such discrepancy was observed in less severely agitated patients. The difference
in efficacy in the more agitated subgroup could explain the main finding
of the study.
The administration of IM olanzapine or IM aripiprazole followed by
routine oral psychotropic medications resulted in similar changes in
vital signs, with statistically significantly decrements of blood pressure
and pulse rate. In addition, high incidences of PCS low blood pressure
and low pulse rate were observed. However, a few of the patients who
met the criteria of PCS low blood pressure showed values below the
lower limits (b90 mm Hg for systolic blood pressure and b50 mm Hg
for diastolic blood pressure) and no patient experienced adverse events
clinically relevant to changes in vital signs. A number of explanations
are possible for the high incidence of PCS low blood pressure in the present study. First, concomitant antipsychotics, especially perphenazine
(Tardy et al., 2014) and risperidone (Khasawneh and Shankar, 2014),
had the capacity to facilitate hypotensive effects. Second, some patients
had conditions that predisposed them to hypotension, including conditions that impinge on the autonomic nervous system, such as alcohol
abuse, diabetes mellitus, and treatment with antihypertensive medications (Gugger, 2011). Third, agitated patients generally have elevated
blood pressure (Harvey, 1996). Some of the decrements of blood pressure during the treatments may have resulted from the calming therapeutic effects.
As suggested by some studies, the incidence of TEAEs may be higher
in patients treated with multiple concomitant psychotropic medications
(Taylor, 2002; Taylor et al., 2009); TEAEs, including somnolence and extrapyramidal side effects, were commonly observed in the present
study. The results also demonstrated that somnolence occurred more
frequently with IM olanzapine than with IM aripiprazole. This finding
confirms previous reports of pooled incidence in agitated patients
with schizophrenia that indicated that somnolence was one of the
most common adverse events (at least 5% and at least twice that for placebos) related to IM olanzapine (Eli Lilly and Company, 2015) while it
was less common for IM aripiprazole (Otsuka Pharmaceutical, 2014).
In the present study, almost all patients received oral benzodiazepines,
which are known to have a sedative effect and the potential for respiratory depression (Schatzberg et al., 2007). Co-administration with benzodiazepine could contribute to the somnolence observed with the
investigational medication, especially IM olanzapine. In a previous review of post-marketing safety data of IM olanzapine, benzodiazepine
use was reported in a majority of the nonfatal serious cases and in half
of the fatal cases (Marder et al., 2010). Therefore, the concomitant use
of IM olanzapine and benzodiazepine could lead to an increased risk
of somnolence and related adverse events compared with the concomitant use of IM aripiprazole and benzodiazepine.
This study has some limitations. First, the sample size was relatively
small, which may reduce the statistical power of detecting differences
between the two treatments. Second, there are multiple comparisons,
which could lead to uncontrolled type I errors. Third, the study was conducted in only one psychiatric hospital, where routine practice may differ from those in other settings. Moreover, due to concomitant oral
medication use, care should be taken in the interpretation of causality
and association between treatment and outcome. Finally, some safety
data, including electrocardiograms and assessments of orthostatic hypotension, were lacking.
In conclusion, the study findings suggest that in real-world clinical
practice, initial doses of IM olanzapine and IM aripiprazole followed
by routine oral psychotropic medication are similarly effective in the
treatment of agitation associated with schizophrenia over the first
24 h. However, in the early hours, IM olanzapine may produce more
sedation and reductions in agitation than IM aripiprazole. The two treatments are well tolerated; however, considering the capacity of concomitant oral psychotropic medications to facilitate adverse events, IM
aripiprazole seems to offer a better safety profile compared to IM
olanzapine when used concomitantly with benzodiazepine. Regular
monitoring of vital signs and assessments for oversedation after IM
doses of olanzapine and aripiprazole are recommended. Due to a number of limitations, further studies are warranted to confirm this study's
findings.
