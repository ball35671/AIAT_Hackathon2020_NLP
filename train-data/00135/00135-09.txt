Received 20 June 2008; returned for revisions 25 June 2008; revised manuscript accepted 29 June 2008.
Objective: To compare the efficacy of electro-acupuncture with that of sham
electro-acupuncture for auditory hallucinations in patients with schizophrenia
partially responsive or non-responsive to risperidone.
Design: Patient- and assessor-blinded randomized controlled trial.
Setting: Hospital-based practice.
Participants: Schizophrenia patients with auditory hallucinations who are partially
responsive or non-responsive to risperidone monotherapy (n ¼ 60).
Interventions: All patients were randomly allocated to a real electro-acupuncture
group or a sham electro-acupuncture group and treated for 30 sessions within
six weeks.
Main outcome measures: The primary outcome measure was the Psychotic
Symptom Rating Scales Auditory Hallucination Subscale. Secondary outcomes
included the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale and side-effects. A clinical
response was defined as 420% reduction score (from baseline) on the total score
of the Psychotic Symptom Rating Scales Auditory Hallucination Subscale.
Results: Sixty patients were selected for randomized real electro-acupuncture
treatment (n ¼ 30) or sham electro-acupuncture treatment (n ¼ 30). Patients in the
real electro-acupuncture group experienced greater improvement in the Psychotic
Symptom Rating Scales Auditory Hallucination Subscale total score, physical
characteristics factor score and the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale positive
symptom score than the sham electro-acupuncture group at both week 4 and
week 6. The clinical response rates in the real electro-acupuncture group and sham
electro-acupuncture group were 43.3% (n ¼ 30) and 13.3% (n ¼ 30), respectively
(2 ¼ 6.648, P ¼ 0.027). There was no significance between-group difference in
side-effects.
Conclusion: Electro-acupuncture might provide improvement in auditory hallucinations and positive symptom for patients with schizophrenia partially responsive or
non-responsive to risperidone monotherapy.

Introduction
Schizophrenia has always had very poor social
outcomes for patients and creates an enormous
burden for carers and society.1 Despite recent
advances in pharmacotherapy and psychosocial
interventions, a considerable number of patients
with schizophrenia have disabling residual symptoms and are handicapped in social functioning.2
Auditory hallucinations are reported in 50–80% of
patients with schizophrenia.3 These may result in
secondary disturbances of thought, emotion and
behaviour, such as delusion, anxieties, depression,
suicide and violent acts. Treatment of resistant
auditory hallucinations remains a considerable
public health problem.
Acupuncture has been used to treat auditory
hallucinations with some evidence of effectiveness.
The oldest extant classic text on Traditional
Chinese Medicine, huangdi neijing (Medical
Classics of the Yellow Emperor), describes the clinical utility of acupuncture for schizophrenia-like
diseases and auditory hallucinations.4 Recent
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
and positron emission tomography (PET) studies
have revealed that acupuncture causes a broad
matrix of central neurological responses involving
the cerebellum, hippocampus, hypothalamus,
amygdala, basal ganglia, anterior cingulate, as
well as other limbic structures,5 neurological
systems that are involved in the pathophysiology
of auditory hallucinations.6 Electro-acupuncture is
based on conventional acupuncture, with the additional application of an electric pulse to meridians
and acupoints to strengthen the acupuncture
effect. In the case of electro-acupuncture the
responses in various central nervous system targets
are dependent on the type of acupuncture and the
frequency of stimulation.7–9
Numerous Chinese studies have reported the efficacy of acupuncture in treating auditory hallucinations and schizophrenia. However, the results have
rarely been quantitative due to the use of improperly validated measures. Rathbone and Xia10
undertook an electronic search for all relevant
randomized controlled trials involving acupuncture
for schizophrenia and related psychoses in the
Cochrane Schizophrenia Group’s Register (April
2005), which is compiled from systematic searches
of major databases, hand searches and conference
proceedings. The results showed that there were
five randomized trials comparing acupuncture or
electro-acupuncture with antipsychotics. However,
both the numbers of participants and the blinding
of the acupuncture were inadequate.10 Thus
more comprehensive, well-designed studies are
needed to determine the effect of acupuncture on
schizophrenia.
The aim of this randomized controlled trial was
to compare the efficacy of electro-acupuncture
and sham electro-acupuncture on auditory hallucinations in patients with schizophrenia partially
responsive or non-responsive to risperidone.
Patients and methods
Patients
Study participants were recruited from the
Department of Psychiatry, Renmin Hospital of
Wuhan University. Records of psychiatric history
and prior antipsychotic drug therapy were available from all patients. Patients chosen for this
study: (1) were 18–60 years of age; (2) had a
DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia11 using the
Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV12;
(3) had previously been treated with risperidone
following documented treatment failure after two
antipsychotics were administered for an adequate
duration with sufficient dose; (4) demonstrated a
documented failure to show a satisfactory clinical
response to an adequate trial of risperidone
(three or more months of at least 4 mg/day of
oral risperidone); and (5) had persistent and distressing auditory hallucinations, evidenced by a
score of 11 or more on the total of Psychotic
Symptom Rating Scales Auditory Hallucination
Subscale.13
Patients with the following conditions were
excluded: (1) mental retardation; (2) seizure disorder; (3) substance abuse/dependence; (4) pregnant;
(5) severe and unstable physical illnesses; (6) danger
of attack or extreme agitation; or (7) previously
received acupuncture (to maximize blinding).
The study was approved by the ethics committee
of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University and was
conducted in accordance with the principles of
Declaration of Helsinki. All patients who participated in the study gave informed consent.

Study design
This was a patient-blinded and assessor-blinded
randomized controlled trial. A four-week baseline
evaluation and risperidone run-in phase was
followed by six weeks real electro-acupuncture
treatment or sham electro-acupuncture treatment.
Before initiation of the baseline observation period,
all patients had been on a stable dose of risperidone
for at least four weeks. Baseline doses of risperidone remained stable throughout the study.
Concomitant lorazepam (54 mg) was allowed to
counteract sleep problems. Antidepressants, mood
stabilizers and antipsychotic drugs other than
risoperidone were not allowed during the study.
Randomization and blinding procedures
Patients were randomly assigned to either the
real electro-acupuncture group or the sham
electro-acupuncture group by the SAS program
(version 8.2, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC,
USA). Allocation concealment was maintained
using opaque sealed envelopes. Patients and clinical investigators, who performed regular visits
and outcome assessments, were blinded to the
treatment allocation. The acupuncturist delivered
real or sham treatment according to the randomization code transmitted by the envelopes, but was
instructed not to communicate with the patients
and the clinical investigators about treatment procedures and responses. To maximize participant
blinding we included only acupuncture-naive
patients who could not compare their treatment
with previous experiences with acupuncture.
There was also limited contact between the study
participants and restricted conversation between
acupuncturist and participants during treatment.
Interventions
Acupuncture was administered by a trained acupuncturist according to the practice of Traditional
Chinese Medicine. Each patient was scheduled for a
total of 30 sessions, five times a week over a period
of six weeks. In the real electro-acupuncture group,
the following acupoints were selected because they
had previously been reported as being effective in
auditory hallucinations14,15 and from experience
in our clinical practice: Tinggong (SI 19), Tinghui
(GB 2), Yifeng (TE 17), Daling (P 7), Neiguan (P 6)
and Sanyinjiao (SP 6). During each session, the six
acupuncture points were needled bilaterally for
20 minutes. Individual therapeutic schemes were
avoided to allow statistical comparison between
groups. The acupuncture needles (sterile, singleuse, size 25 mm  0.30 mm and 40 mm  0.30 mm,
manufactured in Suzhou Medical Appliance
Factory, China) were inserted to a depth of
15–30 mm. All patients in the real electroacupuncture group reported the ‘De-Qi’ sensation,
a local sensation of heaviness, numbness or tingling, that accompanies the insertion and manipulation of needles during acupuncture. Once the
sensation was elicited, the handles of the needles
inserted into Tinggong, Tinghui and Yifeng were
connected to an electrical input (sparse dense
wave, frequency 2–10 Hz, intensity 2–3 mA) via an
electro-acupuncture machine (G6805-1A; Shanghai
Huayi Medical Equipment Factory, China) for
20 minutes. We chose these locations because of
their theoretical importance and the impracticality
of applying electrical stimulation to all of the points
in a clinical trial.
In the sham electro-acupuncture group, the
needles were inserted less than 5 mm superficially
and about 20 mm away from each corresponding
acupoint. The handles of the needles inserted
into the points near Tinggong, Tinghui and
Yifeng were connected to the electro-acupuncture
machine with no electrical current for 20 minutes,
simulating a real electro-acupuncture procedure.
The acupuncturist did not manipulate the needles
and no ‘De-Qi’ sensation was elicited in the sham
electro-acupuncture group.
Outcome measures
The change in auditory hallucinations on the
Psychotic Symptom Rating Scales Auditory
Hallucination Subscale13 was the primary outcome measurement. The total and three factors
derived from factor analytic study – physical characteristics factor, emotional characteristics factor
and cognitive interpretation factor – were used.16
Psychopathology symptoms were secondary outcomes, measured with the Positive and Negative
Syndrome Scale.17 Patients were assessed by two
assessors who were blinded to the grouping at
Electro-acupuncture for auditory hallucinations in schizophrenia 581

baseline, week 2, week 4 and week 6. Any adverse
events that occurred during acupuncture sessions
were recorded.
Statistical analysis
The sample size calculation of the study was
based on pilot data. The minimum clinically
important difference in the Psychotic Symptom
Rating Scales Auditory Hallucination Subscale
total score reduction was set to 2.8 between the
two groups, with a hypothesized standard deviation of 3.5. The estimated sample size was about
25 patients in each group, with a statistical power
of 80% at a two-sided significance level of 5%.
Given a projected dropout rate of 20%, we
aimed to recruit 60 patients for the study.
Outcomes were analysed on an intention-to-treat
basis. The Psychotic Symptom Rating Scales
Auditory Hallucination Subscale scores were compared between treatment groups using the repeated
measure analysis of covariance. Age and initial
dose of risperidone were used as covariates in the
model. If the treatment group  time interaction
tested significant at the 5% level, post-hoc comparisons were carried out to compare the treatment
arms separately at weeks 2, 4 and 6 (Bonferroni
adjusted significance level 1.667%). If the interaction term was not statistically significant it was
excluded from the model and the main effect of
treatment evaluated to estimate treatment effect.
Secondary outcome scores for the Positive and
Negative Syndrome Scale were analysed using the
same analysis of covariance model.
Continuous variables were expressed as mean
standard deviation (SD) and baseline comparisons
of the two groups were performed using independent t-test. Categorical variables were analysed
using chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test. All
tests were two-sided and statistical significance
was defined as P  0.05. All data analyses were
attained using SPSS for Windows version 10.0
(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
Results
Patient characteristics
Patients were recruited from January 2004
to January 2007. A total of 210 patients were
screened and 60 patients were randomized to the
real electro-acupuncture group (n ¼ 30) and sham
electro-acupuncture group (n ¼ 30). Figure 1
shows the flow of patients through the trial.
There were no significant differences between the
real electro-acupuncture and the sham electroacupuncture groups in terms of age, sex, initial
risperidone dose, duration of auditory hallucinations or baseline scores on the Psychotic Symptom
Rating Scales Auditory Hallucination Subscale
and the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale
(Table 1). No treatment difference was noted in
the concomitant use of lorazepam between the
real electro-acupuncture group (56.67% (17/30))
and sham electro-acupuncture group (66.67%
(20/30)).
Primary outcome: auditory hallucinations
symptoms
By the end of the six-week treatment period, a
treatment response (20% or greater reduction in
the Psychotic Symptom Rating Scales Auditory
Hallucination Subscale total score) was achieved
by 13 (43.3%) of the 30 patients in the real electroacupuncture group and by 4 (13.3%) of the
30 patients in the sham electro-acupuncture
group (
2 ¼ 6.648, P ¼ 0.027).
Table 2 shows the results of the Psychotic

P ¼ 0.004) with the real electro-acupuncture group
slightly better than the sham electro-acupuncture
group (as shown in Figure 4). The mean differences in the positive symptoms score reduction
(from baseline) were 1.03 (95% CI 0.30 to 1.76)
at week 4 and 1.17 (95% CI 0.38 to 1.95) at week 6
between the two groups.
There was no group  time interaction or main
effect of group for the Positive and Negative

score or general psychopathology score.
Safety and tolerability
Seven patients (11.67%) discontinued the
assigned treatment, with no statistically significant
difference between the real electro-acupuncture
group and the sham electro-acupuncture group
(13.33% (4/30) vs. 10.00% (3/30)). The reasons
for these patients’ withdrawal were not statistically
different in the real electro-acupuncture group
compared with the sham electro-acupuncture
group: dissatisfaction with treatment outcome,
1 vs. 1; insufficient time, 1 vs. 1; and feeling pain
at the needling point, 2 vs. 1, respectively. No local
complications such as bleeding, haematoma, infection or others necessitating treatment were seen.
Discussion
These results suggest that real electro-acupuncture
has a slightly better effect than sham electroacupuncture on the Psychotic Symptom Rating
Scales Auditory Hallucination Subscale total
score, physical characteristics factor score and
the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale positive
symptom score in schizophrenia patients with
auditory hallucinations. Electro-acupuncture was
not associated with any severe adverse.

Electro-acupuncture for auditory hallucinations in schizophrenia 585
Downloaded from cre.sagepub.com at PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV on May 22, 2015
To date, only a few randomized controlled trials
have evaluated the effect of electro-acupuncture
on auditory hallucinations.14,15,18 To the best
of our knowledge, the current study is the first
randomized controlled trial involving sham
electro-acupuncture on auditory hallucinations.
Consistent with previous trials,14,15 the present
study demonstrated the beneficial effect of
electro-acupuncture in the treatment of auditory
hallucinations in patients with schizophrenia.
The present study found no significant difference between six weeks of real or sham electroacupuncture in treating negative symptoms of
schizophrenia at any time-point. In their eightweek randomized controlled study Zhang and
colleagues found significant effect upon positive
symptoms and negative symptoms.18 One possibility is that a delayed beneficial effect on negative
symptoms evident after eight weeks of treatment
may have dissipated after six weeks of electroacupuncture.
Some previous studies have revealed that higher
levels of positive symptoms (including auditory
hallucinations) of schizophrenia was associated
with a longer duration of hospitalization,
decreased ability to meet basic needs, decreased

quality of work and more vulnerable to stigma
experience later in life.19,20 The present study
showed that auditory hallucinations and positive
symptoms of schizophrenia might be alleviated by
the electro-acupuncture.
Thus patients with schizophrenia who are being
rehabilitated and who receive electro-acupuncture
may have a shorter duration of hospitalization,
increased ability to meet basic needs, increased
quality of work and little vulnerable to stigma
experience, which means better rehabilitation.
However, this is just a speculation based on our
current trial; further studies are needed to test it.
In addition, during the study, we noted that some
other symptoms of schizophrenia, such as insomnia, anxiety and depression, were also alleviated
in some patients after six weeks of real electroacupuncture. More comprehensive randomized
controlled trials are needed before we can conclude that electro-acupuncture treatment is helpful
in the rehabilitation of these symptoms.
We selected sham acupuncture rather than a
placebo therapy to ensure blinding. However,
it is easy to distinguish between real and sham
electro-acupuncture if both are given to a person
as the sham electro-acupuncture cannot elicit the
‘De-Qi’ sensation produced by the real electroacupuncture. To maximize blinding we only
recruited patients who had not previously received
acupuncture and we limited contact between the
recruited patients. We did not measure patient
blinding but this would clearly be useful in subsequent studies.
Another important issue relates to the cause of
the improvement we observed. We cannot readily
conclude that the effect is made by the electroacupuncture. The improvement occurred over
time and may be due to patients’ participation in
the study and the benefits of regular clinic visits.
The improvement may also be an artefact of the
fluctuating course of schizophrenia and the tendency for extreme observations to regress toward
the mean over time. However, our patients did
appear stable in their lack of risperidone response.
The observed treatment effect could also be due to
the combination of electro-acupuncture and risperidone rather than electro-acupuncture alone.
This cannot be completely ruled out with current
patient samples.
The short duration and the small sample size of
this study should also be considered limitations.
Our findings must be regarded as preliminary.

Clinical messages
 Real electro-acupuncture might provide
slightly better improvement in auditory
hallucinations and positive symptoms for
patients with schizophrenia partially responsive or non-responsive to risperidone monotherapy than sham electro-acupuncture.
