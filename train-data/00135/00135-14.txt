Abstract
To compare the short-term curative effect of clozapine (CZ) and its combination with electroacupuncture (EA) in treating schizophrenia.Ninety schizophrenia patients were randomly divided into two groups equally: the EA group treated with combination of CZ (200 - 300 mg/d in mean) and EA, and the CZ group treated with CZ alone. The effects of treatment were evaluated with PANSS, CGI and TESS before and at the 2th, 4th, 6th and 8th weekend of the treatment.The initiation of effect in the two groups was the same, the total effective rate was 75% in the EA group and 73% in the CZ group. However, somatic complaint was lower and compliance was higher in the EA group than that in the CZ group respectively.With the effect equal to CZ, combination of CZ and EA shows higher compliance in treating schizophrenia, which would be beneficial in the later stage treatment for consolidation.
