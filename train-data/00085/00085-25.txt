& Abstract
Background: Gabapentin enacarbil (GEn), a transported
prodrug of gabapentin, provides sustained, dose-proportional gabapentin exposure. The purpose of this study was to
investigate the dose response of GEn to select the optimal
dose(s) for clinical use in subsequent diabetic peripheral
neuropathy (DPN) trials.
Methods: This was a multicenter, randomized, doubleblind, double-dummy, parallel group, placebo-controlled
trial with a study duration of approximately 20 weeks
(Clinicaltrials.gov database, Identifier # NCT00643760). Pregabalin (PGB) (Lyrica®; Pfizer Inc.) was used as an active
control to provide assay sensitivity of the trial. A total of 421
adult subjects with DPN were randomized in a ratio of
2:1:1:1:2 to receive oral GEn 3,600 mg/day, GEn 2,400 mg/
day, GEn 1,200 mg/day, PGB 300 mg/day, or matching placebo, respectively. The primary efficacy endpoint was change
from baseline to end of maintenance treatment with respect
to the mean 24-hour average pain intensity score based on an
11-point Pain Intensity Numerical Rating Scale (PI-NRS).
Safety and tolerability assessments included treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), laboratory evaluations, vital
signs, electrocardiograms (ECG), neurological examination,
and pedal edema.
Results: The adjusted mean difference vs. placebo at the end
of maintenance treatment with respect to the mean 24-hour
average PI-NRS pain intensity score for GEn 1,200 mg (0.35;
[95% CI: 1.02, 0.31]; P = 0.295), GEn 2,400 mg (0.02; [95%
CI: 0.71, 0.66]; P = 0.946), and GEn 3,600 mg (0.55; [95%
CI: 1.10, 0.01]; P = 0.105) was not statistically significant.
The active control, PGB (300 mg/day), did not differentiate
from placebo.
Conclusion: Overall, none of the GEn treatment groups
differentiated from placebo. Analyses of the secondary
endpoints showed comparable results across treatment
groups. However, the majority of the endpoints, including
all of the pain endpoints, showed the largest numerical
treatment difference was between GEn 3,600 mg and

INTRODUCTION
Diabetes mellitus, particularly type 2 diabetes, is a
common condition in the developed world and its
prevalence is increasing rapidly. Diabetic peripheral
neuropathy (DPN) is a common complication of
diabetes mellitus and can occur in 34–90% of the
diabetic population, depending on the diagnostic criteria
used1–6
. While not all DPN is painful, pain can develop
as a symptom of DPN. It is estimated that between 16%
and 26% of diabetic subjects experience chronic neuropathic pain associated with DPN7
.
Neuropathic pain associated with DPN is caused by
lesions or dysfunction of the peripheral and/or central
nervous system and does not require receptor stimulation. Painful sensations are most commonly relayed via
small primary afferents, the A-d fibers, and unmyelinated C fibers to the dorsal horn of the spinal cord
where a synaptic junction in the outer part of the
dorsal horn subsequently relays sensations to the
spino-parabrachial-amygdaloid pathway and spinothalamic tract7
. Neuropathic pain is a paradox, in that
there is development of pain in the area where the
subject experiences sensory deficit due to nerve injury.
Neuropathic pain results from plastic changes in the
nervous system of some, although not all, subjects that
leads to increased excitability of the remaining and
surrounding neurons and results in the experience of
pain.
Since 1999, the United States (US) Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) has approved two medications
for the management of neuropathic pain associated with
DPN: pregabalin (Lyrica®; Pfizer Inc., New York, NY,
USA) and duloxetine (Cymbalta®; Eli Lilly & Co.,
Indianapolis, IN, USA). Other nonapproved pharmacotherapies commonly used for treatment include
gabapentin, tricyclic antidepressants, and opioids. In
clinical trials, pregabalin and duloxetine have both been
shown to improve pain scores in DPN subjects.
However, less than half of subjects in the clinical trials
with pregabalin and duloxetine experienced at least
50% reduction in pain score from baseline8,9. Both the
degree and variability of effectiveness of the currently
approved medicines suggests that there are patients with
neuropathic pain associated with DPN who might
benefit from a new treatment option.
Gabapentin enacarbil (GEn [XP13512/GSK18382
62]) is a prodrug of gabapentin designed to overcome
the pharmacokinetic limitations of gabapentin. Unlike
orally administered gabapentin, which is absorbed by
low capacity transporters expressed in a limited region
of the upper intestine, GEn is designed to be absorbed by
high-capacity transport mechanisms located throughout
the intestinal tract, including the colon10. GEn is well
absorbed and provides rapid and extended delivery of
gabapentin into the systemic circulation, offering predictable absorption, dose-proportional gabapentin
exposure, and the opportunity to optimize gabapentin
exposure to patients. Additionally, GEn has been
formulated as an extended release (ER) formulation,
thereby providing less frequent dosing compared with
gabapentin.
The current study, PXN110448, explored the efficacy
of GEn in the treatment for neuropathic pain associated
with DPN. Study medication included different doses of
GEn, pregabalin (PGB), and placebo.
METHODS
This study (PXN110448, Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier
# NCT00643760) was conducted at 85 centres in the US,
from March 2008–February 2009, in accordance with
“good clinical practice” (GCP) and all applicable subject
privacy requirements, the guiding principles of 21 Code
of Federal Regulations parts 312, 50, and 56, and of the
Declaration of Helsinki. The study protocol, the
informed consent, and other information that required
preapproval were reviewed and approved by applicable
institutional review boards or ethics committees. Written
informed consent was obtained from each subject prior
to the performance of any study-specific procedures.
Study Population
Men and women at least 18 years of age who were
diagnosed with diabetes mellitus (type 1 or 2) and had
pain attributed to DPN, defined as painful distal
symmetric sensorimotor polyneuropathy, for at least
6 months and no greater than 5 years were considered
for inclusion. Subjects must have had pain attributed to
their DPN of at least moderate intensity, defined as an
average pain intensity score of  4 on an 11-point pain
intensity numerical rating scale (PI-NRS) where 0 = no
pain and 10 = worst possible pain. During the 7 days
486  RAUCK ET AL.
preceding randomization, subjects recorded pain scores
at least 4 of 7 days in a daily pain diary.
Enrolled subjects were required to have stable glycemic control 3 months prior to randomization and
glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels < 8% at the
time of randomization (levels were permitted to range
between 8–11% if attempts to control diabetes had
failed). Women of childbearing potential were required
to have a negative pregnancy test and were willing to use
an effective method of contraception throughout the
study. Acetaminophen, up to 3 g/day, was allowed as
rescue medication for pain throughout the trial but was
not allowed within 24 hours of any site visit for
assessments.
Key exclusion criteria included the following:
 Subjects with chronic pain due to neuropathy or
lower extremity pain not related to DPN. However, subjects with chronic pain conditions not
associated with DPN were not excluded if the pain
was located at a different region of the body, the
pain intensity was not greater than the pain
intensity of the DPN pain, and the subject was
able to assess DPN pain independently of other
pain conditions.
 Subjects with conditions (eg unstable depression,
alcohol, substance abuse) or medications (eg acute
pain medications, hypnotics, antidepressants) that
could possibly have interfered with the assessment
of pain improvement following the use of Gen.
 Subjects with pre-existing liver, renal, cardiovascular, disease, epilepsy or seizure disorders, or any
other medical condition or treatment that could
have interfered with the accurate assessment of
the efficacy, safety, or absorption of Gen.
 Subjects who were currently participating in other
clinical trials or who had been recently exposed
to, or had an allergic reaction to, GEn or its
components or acetaminophen or compounds
closely related to acetaminophen.
Study Design
This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind,
double-dummy, parallel group, placebo-controlled,
and active-controlled study to investigate the dose
response of GEn in subjects with neuropathic pain
associated with DPN.
The duration of the study was approximately
20 weeks, divided into six phases: screening (up to
4 weeks); baseline (including randomization, 1 week);
up-titration (1 week); maintenance phase (dose maintained at fixed level, 12 weeks); down-titration
(1 week); and follow-up phase (1 week after last investigational product dose; 16 days for females of child
bearing potential).
Subjects were randomized to receive GEn 3,600 mg/
day, GEn 2,400 mg/day, GEn 1,200 mg/day, PGB
300 mg/day, or matching placebo in a 2:1:1:1:2 randomization ratio according to a computer-generated
schedule. Gabapentin enacarbil was provided as 600 mg
tablets with identical-in-appearance placebo tablets to
ensure blinding of subjects and investigators; PGB was
provided as 50 mg and 100 mg with identical-inappearance placebo capsules and was administered in
accordance with the recommended dose for the management of neuropathic pain associated with DPN
specified in the FDA approved package label8
. To
maintain blinding during the maintenance phase, all
subjects were instructed to take the study medication as
indicated in Table 1 in the morning, afternoon, and
evening. All GEn and matching placebo tablets were
provided in Medisets that were filled by an unblinded,
third-party pharmacist; all PGB and matching placebo
capsules were provided in blister cards.

Study Assessments
The primary objective of the study was to investigate the
dose response of GEn using improvement in pain
intensity scores to select the optimal dose(s) for clinical
use in subsequent DPN trials.
Additional (secondary) objectives included characterizing the effect of GEn on improvement in pain
parameters, physical and emotional function, and global
improvement; investigating the safety of GEn; and
estimating the systemic exposure of gabapentin associated with GEn doses of 1,200 mg/day, 2,400 mg/day,
and 3,600 mg/day.
The primary efficacy assessment instrument was the
11-point PI-NRS as completed by subjects in their daily
pain diary. Subjects described their pain during the
previous 24 hours by choosing the appropriate number
from 0 (“no pain”) to 10 (“pain as bad as you can
imagine”). The primary analysis compared the change
from baseline to end of maintenance treatment
(EOMT) with respect to the mean 24-hour average
pain intensity score. The baseline score was the
calculated mean of the daily 24-hour average pain
scores for each subject during the last 7 days prior to
randomization. The EOMT score was the calculated
mean of the daily 24-hour average pain scores for each
subject during the last seven days of the maintenance
phase.
The secondary efficacy endpoints included the change
from baseline in the mean: 24-hour average pain
intensity score, daytime average pain intensity score,
nighttime average pain intensity score, current pain
intensity score, daytime worst pain intensity score,
nighttime worst pain intensity score, sleep interference
score, and rescue analgesia consumption (mg), each of
which was analyzed at each week of treatment and posttreatment.
Other efficacy endpoints included: the Neuropathic
Pain Scale (NPS); Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ); pre- and post-50-foot (15 meter) walk
pain scores; proportion of subjects who were “much
improved” or “very much improved” on the Patient
Global Impression of Change (PGIC) and Clinician
Global Impression of Change (CGIC) questionnaires;
proportion of subjects achieving various levels of
reduction in the 24-hour average pain intensity score;
time to onset of sustained improvement in the 24-hour
average pain intensity score; Profile of Mood State
(POMS); and Short-Form-36 (SF-36) health-related
quality of life questionnaire.
The safety assessments included treatment-emergent
adverse events (TEAEs), possible suicidality-related
adverse events (PSRAEs), laboratory evaluations (blood
chemistry, hematology, immunology, urinalysis, pregnancy), vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate), electrocardiograms (ECG), and a neurological exam, including
a detailed examination of sensory and motor systems,
body weight, and pedal edema. The investigator was
responsible for the detection and documentation of
events meeting the criteria and definition of an AE or a
serious adverse event (SAE) as defined in the study
protocol; adverse events were collected at each study
visit.
The objective of the population PK analysis was to
derive the daily area under the gabapentin plasma
concentration curve (AUC0-24) in each subject with
neuropathic pain associated with DPN. A Bayesian
approach was applied to estimate individual PK parameters assuming the population PK model previously
estimated with data from healthy subjects and subjects
with RLS as priors. A population PK/PD model,
describing the relationship between gabapentin systemic
exposure and pain intensity scores, was then developed.
In addition, the potential effects of covariates (age, body
weight, height, body mass index, sex, concomitant
medications, and baseline pain score) on the defined
exposure–response relationship were investigated.
Statistical Methods
The study was originally designed to assess dose
response from an anticipated Emax distribution. Consequently, there was an unequal randomization to the
different treatment arms. However, the primary statistical analysis (per-protocol amendment 3) was designed
to test each potential dose (GEn 3,600 mg/day, GEn
2,400 mg/day, or GEn 1,200 mg/day) against placebo.
A planned sample size of 336 subjects, randomized in a
2:1:1:2 ratio (GEn 3,600 mg/day:GEn 2,400 mg/day:
GEn 1,200 mg/day:Placebo) (112:56:56:112), provided
power ranging between 71 and 96% to detect a
treatment effect of 1.2 points in mean pain intensity
score as compared to placebo, assuming a standard
deviation of 2.45. Additionally, 56 subjects were to be
randomized to PGB (300 mg/day) as an active control
to provide a descriptive assessment of the assay sensitivity of the study. To protect the experiment-wise alpha
level of 0.05, a combination of sequential methods and
a Hochberg procedure was used for the primary
endpoint.
488  RAUCK ET AL.
Based on a simulation of the Hochberg method for
adjusting for multiple comparisons, if both GEn
3,600 mg/day and GEn 2,400 mg/day were effective,
there would be approximately 96% power to detect a
difference for at least one of the comparisons, GEn
3,600 mg/day vs. placebo and GEn 2,400 mg/day vs.
placebo. If only GEn 3,600 mg/day was effective, there
would be 88% power to detect a difference between
GEn 3,600 mg/day and placebo at an alpha level of
0.025. If only GEn 2,400 mg/day was effective, there
would be 71% power to detect a difference between
GEn 2,400 mg/day and placebo at an alpha level of
0.025.
The GEn 1,200 mg/day dose was to be compared
with placebo only if both of the higher doses were
statistically significant at an alpha level of 0.05. Formal
statistical testing of PGB to placebo was not conducted.
The Safety Population, used to assess safety endpoints, was composed of all subjects who took at least
one dose of investigational product. The Intent-to-Treat
(ITT) Population, used to assess all efficacy endpoints,
comprised all randomized subjects who took at least one
dose of investigational product and provided at least one
postbaseline efficacy measurement. The Per-Protocol
(PP) Population was defined as all subjects in the ITT
Population who had no major protocol deviations. The
PK Population was defined as all randomized subjects
who took at least one dose of investigational product
and provided at least one PK sample.
The primary efficacy analysis used the last observation carried forward (LOCF) approach for imputation
of data for subjects who did not complete the study.
Sensitivity analyses using baseline observation carried
forward (BOCF), BOCF/LOCF Hybrid and observed
cases (OC) data for noncompleters, were also performed. Finally, a mixed-model repeated measures
(MMRM) analysis was performed as an additional
sensitivity analysis for the primary efficacy variable
using the OC data for the ITT population.
For endpoints assessed as a change from baseline,
including the primary efficacy endpoint, each dose of
GEn was compared with placebo using an Analysis of
Covariance (ANCOVA) model, with body mass index
(BMI), baseline score for the endpoint being analyzed,
grouped centre, and randomized treatment as terms in
the model. The proportion endpoints (eg proportion of
subjects who are “much improved” or “very much
improved” per the PGIC and CGIC) were analyzed
using logistic regression with grouped centre and randomized treatment as terms in the model (PGIC), or
with randomized treatment as the only term in the
model (CGIC).
RESULTS
Subject Disposition and Baseline Characteristics
There were 421 subjects randomized in a 2:1:1:1:2 ratio
(GEn 3,600 mg/day:GEn 2,400 mg/day:GEn 1,200 mg/
day:PGB 300 mg/day:Placebo) in the study (n = 117
GEn 3,600 mg/day, n = 56 GEn 2,400 mg/day, n= 62
GEn 1,200 mg/day, n = 66 PGB 300 mg/day, n = 120
placebo). One subject in the GEn 3,600 mg group, who
was randomized in error, did not take study medication
and therefore was excluded from the Safety population.
Of the 420 subjects in the Safety population, all were
included in the ITT population.
The majority of subjects enrolled in the study were
white (80%) and male (59%). Mean age ranged from
57.5–60.8 years across treatment groups. Across treatment groups, the majority of subjects (61% [GEn
2,400 mg/day], 66% [GEn 3,600 mg/day], 74% [GEn
1,200 and PGB], and 78% [PBO]) were obese as defined
by a BMI > 30 kg/m2
.
Demographics and baseline characteristics were similar among treatment groups (Table 2).
Efficacy—Pain Measures
The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from
baseline to EOMT for the mean 24-hour average
pain intensity score based on an 11-point PI-NRS.
A decreased mean 24-hour average pain intensity score
at EOMT, as compared to baseline, was noted in all
treatment groups (Table 3, Figure 1).
For the primary analysis (using LOCF data), there
were no statistically significant differences when
comparing each active daily dose of GEn (1,200 mg,
2,400 mg, and 3,600 mg) vs. placebo, P = 0.295,
0.946, and 0.105, respectively, at EOMT. The unadjusted P-values (ie not adjusted for multiple comparisons of active treatment vs. placebo) were 0.295, 0.946,
and 0.052, respectively.
Consistent with the primary LOCF analysis, the
supportive analyses of the ITT population using BOCF,
BOCF/LOCF hybrid, OC, the MMRM analysis of the
ITT population using OC data, and the PP population
analyses all resulted in a decreased 24-hour pain
intensity score at EOMT, as compared with placebo
(Table 4). When considering the BOCF and MMRM
Gabapentin Enacarbil in DPN  489
analysis, the magnitude of the improvement was greater
in the GEn 3,600 mg/day treatment group than in the
placebo treatment group, with the confidence intervals
(not multiplicity-adjusted) indicating a benefit for GEn
3,600 mg/day over placebo.
Per the predefined testing strategy, GEn 1,200 mg vs.
placebo was only to be tested if both GEn 2,400 mg and
GEn 3,600 mg were significantly better than placebo at
an alpha (a) level of 0.05. Thus, the results for the
1,200 mg group are included in Table 4 for reference
and should only be considered descriptive. The active
control, PGB (300 mg/day), did not differentiate from
placebo. Neither the method of imputation, statistical
analysis technique, nor the population had a significant
impact on the primary efficacy measure.
The secondary efficacy analyses were performed on
the ITT population, and as shown in Tables 5 and 6,
overall, the analyses of the secondary endpoints showed
comparable results across treatment groups. Additionally, the time to sustained improvement was defined as
the time to the first of two or more consecutive days of at
least 2-points reduction in the 24-hour average pain
intensity score relative to baseline. Fifty percent of
subjects in the GEn 3,600 mg treatment group achieved
sustained improvement within 15 days of first dose of
investigational product as compared to PBO (24 days),

GEn 1,200 mg (25 days), GEn 2,400 mg (22 days), and
PGB 300 mg (29 days) treatment groups.
Safety and Tolerability
The majority of subjects across all treatment groups
reported at least one TEAE. Overall, the rate of AEs (any
event) reported across the GEn groups and the PGB
group was comparable. The most commonly reported
TEAEs that occurred at a rate  5% in any active
treatment group included dizziness, somnolence, nausea, and peripheral edema (Table 7).
The majority of subjects in each treatment group
completed the study. A slightly higher percentage of
subjects in the GEn daily doses of 2,400 mg and
3,600 mg withdrew from the study, as compared with
the other treatment groups (Figure 2). This difference
was driven by a higher rate of AE withdrawals in
the higher dose GEn treatment groups (21% in the
GEn 2,400 mg treatment group and 18% in the
GEn 3,600 mg treatment group). The GEn 3,600 mg
treatment group had the smallest proportion of subjects
withdraw from the study due to protocol deviations.
For all other categories of withdrawal, the treatment
groups were comparable in the percentage of subjects
withdrawn.
No AE led to the withdrawal of > 5% of subjects in
any treatment group. Additionally, there was no consistent pattern of AEs related to dose or treatment across
treatment groups. There was one report of suicidal
ideation in the study; it occurred in the GEn 3,600 mg
group. It was reported as moderate in severity, not
serious, and was considered to be related to the
investigational product by the investigator. The subject
had no history of psychiatric conditions including
suicidal ideation, behavior, or self-harm. Reported
stressors included job loss and domestic stress. The
event occurred 51 days after starting GEn and lasted
1 day. GEn treatment was discontinued, and the likelihood of reoccurrence was reported as unlikely.
During the study, 22 subjects reported 29 nonfatal
SAEs and no clear differences were noted between
treatment groups. No deaths occurred during this study.
There were no clinically significant mean changes in
blood pressure or HR in the GEn, PGB, or placebo
treatment groups. At the end of maintenance treatment,
subjects in the PGB treatment group experienced the
most weight gain. Of the GEn groups, weight gain
increased by dose with subjects in the GEn 3,600 mg/
day group experiencing the most weight gain and
subjects in the GEn 1,200 mg/day group experienced
the least gain. Subjects in the placebo group showed the
least change in weight across all treatment groups. The
proportion of subjects who had weight gain of at least
7% at any visit postrandomization was greatest in the
PGB group (15%), followed by the GEn 3,600 mg
group (11%) compared with the GEn 2,400 mg (7%),
GEn 1,200 mg (5%) and PBO (3%). There were no
systematic changes noted in laboratory parameters or
ECG findings across the treatment groups.
Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics
Gabapentin plasma concentration data in DPN subjects
were collected in accordance with the protocol. Only
four subjects were excluded from the PK analysis. The
distribution of sampling times during the treatment was
homogeneous between doses, which allowed capture of

the PK profile of gabapentin during the dosing interval at
steady state.
An exposure–pain reduction response was established
for gabapentin following administration of GEn. The
pharmacodynamic effects of GEn were modelled as a
linear function of daily gabapentin exposure (AUC0-24).
After placebo correction, the net drug effect was small,
as shown in Figure 3. For the highest gabapentin
AUC0-24ss (312–758 µg*h/mL) obtained in the study,
the median net effect was a 0.9-point reduction in pain
score on a [0–10] scale. The net drug response ranged
0.4 to 3; four subjects had a net drug effect > 3.
However, these subjects were considered outliers.
DISCUSSION
In this randomized clinical study of patients with
neuropathic pain associated with DPN, all treatment
groups experienced a reduction in pain intensity scores
(baseline to EOMT) as measured on the 11-point
PI-NRS with scores ranging from 1.66 with PGB to
2.54 with GEn 3,600 mg. However, comparisons

between GEn and placebo failed to reach statistical
significance with adjusted mean differences ranging
from 0.02 (GEn 2,400 mg; P = 0.946) to 0.55
(GEn 3,600 mg; P = 0.105). The results were consistent
across multiple methods of adjusting for missing values
(ie LOCF, BOCF, BOCF/LOCF hybrid, OC [ITT, Perprotocol and MMRM]). When compared to placebo,
the active-control arm of the study, PGB 300 mg, also
failed to reach statistical significance with the adjusted
mean difference actually favouring the placebo treatment group.
Gabapentin, which is approved for the treatment of
postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), has been prescribed
extensively over the past 15+ years for the treatment of
neuropathic pain and has been investigated in numerous
neuropathic and nonneuropathic pain conditions11.
While gabapentin has demonstrated efficacy in reduction in perioperative pain and opioid use, several reviews
of pharmacological management in neuropathic pain
have concluded that gabapentin should be considered a
first-line drug in neuropathic pain conditions12,13. In a
well-designed prospective, randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled study, Backonja et al. examined the
Figure 2. Summary of subject disposition and reasons for premature withdrawal (randomized population).
Figure 3. Drug effect (corrected for placebo) estimated as a
function of gabapentin systemic exposure (PK population).

efficacy of gabapentin in neuropathic pain associated
with diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN). Gabapentin
demonstrated significant efficacy in this study of 165
patients with DPN; pain in the gabapentin group
decreased from 6.4 to 3.9 (Likert scale: 0–10) vs.
placebo, 6.5 to 5.1 (P < 0.001), and all secondary
endpoints statistically favored gabapentin over
placebo14.
A study of DPN patients (n = 40), by Gorson et al.,
failed to show efficacy in a placebo-controlled, doubleblind, crossover design. A secondary endpoint, the
McGill pain questionnaire, demonstrated statistically
significant benefit of gabapentin vs. placebo (P = 0.03).
The dose of gabapentin did not exceed the daily dose of
900 mg15.
Numerous drugs studied in neuropathic pain have
reported negative outcomes. It has often been difficult to
interpret these results when juxtaposed with other
positive trials or clinical practice12,13. Are there differences in neuropathic disease states that might explain
the conflicting reports? Dworkin et al. recently compared clinical trial results in the two most commonly
studied neuropathic disease states: DPN and PHN. The
authors found that the placebo group improvements
were greater in painful DPN trials when compared with
PHN trials. When compared with results in groups
receiving active medication, the placebo benefits could
not be attributed to greater overall improvement in
subjects with DPN12.
Pregabalin and duloxetine have both received regulatory approval for the treatment of DPN. As stated
above, gabapentin had mixed efficacy trials in two
well-designed RCTs. However, gabapentin is listed as
first-line treatment for DPN in several guideline publications. Many clinicians, following these guidelines,
have reported and discussed the benefits of gabapentin
in their patients with DPN.
Given the backdrop described above, one should be
well acquainted with the nuances of clinical trials and
drug development. These nuances appear enhanced in
the particular population of patients with DPN. The
current trial of gabapentin enacarbil (GEn) clearly failed
to meet its primary efficacy endpoint or any of its
secondary endpoints. An active comparator, pregabalin
(approved for the indication of DPN), performed as
poorly or worse compared to the study drug. How does
one interpret these results? Does this represent a failed
trial or a failed drug (negative trial)?
In the current study of GEn, subjects receiving
placebo reported possibly significant pain relief (> 2
point reduction on a 0–10 point Likert scale) at the end
of the maintenance phase (13 weeks of double-blind
conditions). While this level of placebo response has
occurred in other chronic pain trials, it presents an
enormous burden for an active drug to overcome. There
may be several reasons to explain this degree of placebo
response.
First, the natural history of painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy waxes and wanes. Some patients
develop spontaneous improvements in their pain, more
commonly early in the disease process. If more of these
patients happen to be receiving placebo, they will
accurately report significant improvements in their pain,
despite the lack of a pharmacologically active compound being received. Results would expect to skew in
favor of the placebo group.
Second, there are differences between PHN and DPN
regarding underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms.
DPN is a disease of the peripheral nervous system while
PHN patients often have lesions in the dorsal horn of the
spinal cord. It has been hypothesized that intact
descending inhibitory pathways in the spinal cord dorsal
horn are required for the placebo response16. This could
explain the differences in placebo responses seen
between these two study groups and further explain
the placebo response seen in the current trial.
Third, the current study randomized subjects into one
of five treatment groups. Randomization occurred such
that subjects had only a two in seven chance of receiving
placebo. As this information was provided in the
informed consent form, subjects knew that the chances
of receiving an active compound were greater than 70%.
A familiar maxim states, “Results follow expectations.”
Unknowingly, subjects receiving placebo could overstate the analgesic efficacy they perceived during the
trial.
The current study was designed with a placebo group,
three fixed doses of GEn, and the active comparator,
pregabalin (PGB) for various reasons. The US FDA
routinely wants to know the minimum effective dose of
a drug. Phase II clinical trials are commonly designed to
study doses and are often referred to as dose ranging
studies. Earlier work had suggested that 1,200 mg/day
of GEn would be inferior to the higher doses. Maximally
tolerated dose is another concept often explored in
Phase II studies. The 3,600 mg daily dose of GEn was
thus included in the current trial as the highest dose. To
adequately explore the dose response of GEn in subjects
with DPN, it was necessary to include several groups in
the study design.
Gabapentin Enacarbil in DPN  495
The active comparator, PGB, was included in the
current trial to provide a descriptive assessment of the
assay sensitivity of the study. However, this added an
additional treatment group who received a pharmacologically active drug and possibly increased the placebo
response stated above. In retrospect, the decision to
include pregabalin may have emphatically demonstrated
the failed aspect of this trial. Pregabalin has performed
very well in DPN and has an FDA approved indication
in DPN. The fact that pregabalin performed worse than
placebo in the current trial further supports the idea of
flaws in either the trial design or the specific population
included in the trial.
In conclusion, one will never unequivocally know
whether the current results represent a failed trial or a
failed drug. Previous studies of gabapentin in DPN and
the overwhelming clinical impression of analgesic efficacy of this compound in treating patients with DPN
support the notion that these results support a failed
trial. Previous pharmacologic information of GEn supports that gabapentin would have been in the plasma in
similar and higher concentrations to studies with the
parent compound. Future research will undoubtedly
help answer these lingering questions.
