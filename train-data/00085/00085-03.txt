Abstract
Background. The efficacy of gabapentin in some
patients with postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) may be
limited by suboptimal drug exposure from unpredictable and saturable absorption. Gabapentin enacarbil
(GEn) was designed for absorption by high-capacity
transporters expressed throughout the intestine and
undergoes rapid postabsorption hydrolysis to gabapentin. GEn extended-release tablets provide sustained, dose-proportional gabapentin exposure. This
study assessed the efficacy of GEn vs placebo and
compared the pharmacokinetics of gabapentin after
oral dosing of GEn or gabapentin in patients with
PHN.
Methods. In this double-blind, randomized study,
115 patients with PHN completed a 7-day baseline
period and 11-day gabapentin run-in period. Eligible
patients were randomized and 101 received doubleblind GEn 1,200 mg (624 mg-equivalents gabapentin)
(n = 47) or placebo (n = 54), twice daily for 14 days.
We evaluated patient-reported pain, sleep, mood,
global improvement, and adverse events, plus gabapentin pharmacokinetics.
Results. The improvement in mean weekly pain
scores from baseline to the end of treatment
(primary endpoint) was significantly greater for
GEn (-2.1) vs placebo (-1.2), P = 0.0321. Significant
improvements from GEn vs placebo were also seen
in sleep, mood, and patient global assessment
(P < 0.05). With a 31% lower daily dose of gabapentin equivalents, GEn tablets provided a significant
increase in average steady state gabapentin concentrations vs gabapentin capsules in the same
patients (n = 42; P = 0.0050).
Conclusions. GEn was effective in providing PHN
pain relief, improved gabapentin exposure compared
with gabapentin capsules, and was generally safe
and well tolerated in patients with PHN.

Introduction
At present, over 90% of the US adult population has been
infected with varicella-zoster virus during their lifetime and
20–30% will develop acute herpes zoster infection in the
form of shingles later in life [1]. Of these, 10–15% will
develop the distressing complication of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) from this infection, which is characterized by
persistent neuropathic pain occurring at the site of the
original shingles pain and cutaneous lesions [1]. PHN
symptoms may take on various forms including pain, paresthesia, dysesthesia, hyperalgesia, and allodynia, and
may persist for many years, often disrupting sleep, altering
mood, and adversely affecting the patient’s quality of life
[2–4]. Drug treatment options for the care of patients with
PHN include tricyclic antidepressants, anticonvulsants,
opioids, and topical agents [5–6]. Despite the use of these
Pain Medicine 2011; 12: 1098–1108

therapies, many patients with PHN do not respond
adequately and continue to endure chronic debilitating
pain.
In numerous clinical study reports, gabapentin has been
shown to improve pain scores in patients with PHN
[7–10]. However, in two randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled studies, not all patients with PHN had
adequate pain relief [7–8]. This may be in part the result
of suboptimal gabapentin exposure in some patients
[11,12].
Studies in healthy volunteers and in patients with epilepsy
have shown that bioavailability of gabapentin is highly
variable and dose dependent, decreasing from about 60%
to less than 30% over the dose range of 300 to 4,800 mg
daily customarily used for treatment of pain [13,14]. This
phenomenon is likely the result of the limited absorption
pathway of gabapentin, which utilizes a low-capacity
transporter localized in a narrow region of the upper small
intestine [15]. The level of expression of this transporter
may vary between individuals and, as a result, uptake of
gabapentin may be saturated in some patients at clinically
relevant doses. Transit time through the upper intestine
also varies greatly from patient to patient [16], leading to
unpredictable residence time of gabapentin in the absorption window, and hence wide variation in the overall extent
of absorption [13]. These factors combine to produce
unpredictable plasma levels after gabapentin dosing in
some subjects [13], which may in turn affect therapeutic
response. The relatively short elimination half-life of gabapentin from the blood (5 to 7 hours) [14] further exacerbates the problem, requiring dosing regimens of three to
four times daily in some patients to maintain therapeutic
blood levels [17].
Gabapentin enacarbil (GEn, XP13512) is an actively
transported prodrug of gabapentin designed to produce
dose proportional gabapentin blood level exposure
[18,19]. GEn is absorbed by high-capacity pathways,
including active uptake by nutrient transporters (monocarboxylate transporter type 1 and the sodiumdependent multivitamin transporter) that are expressed
throughout the gastrointestinal tract. Once absorbed
from the intestinal lumen, GEn is rapidly hydrolyzed to
gabapentin by high-capacity, nonspecific carboxylesterases, primarily in the enterocyte. GEn has a much
wider window of absorption than gabapentin, the uptake
pathways involved are not saturable at clinically useful
doses, and gabapentin exposure provided by GEn is
proportional to the GEn dose [20]. GEn has been successfully formulated as extended-release tablets, further
prolonging the absorption of GEn and providing sustained systemic exposure to gabapentin.
The primary objective of the present study was to
assess the efficacy of GEn vs placebo in reducing pain
associated with PHN. The secondary study objectives
were to assess the following: 1) the effects of GEn for
improvement in sleep, quality of life, and mood; 2) pharmacokinetics of GEn and oral gabapentin; 3) the relationship between gabapentin concentrations produced
from GEn and treatment response; and 4) GEn safety
and tolerability.
Methods
Patients
After signing an informed consent form, PHN patients
were assessed for eligibility. Eligible patients 18–89 years
of age were those who had experienced pain at the site
of their herpes zoster rash more than 3 months after
healing and who had a self-reported average pain score
of 4 and <10, on a scale of 0 to 10, in the week prior
to screening, and an average pain score of 4 during
the 7-day baseline period [21]. Eligible patients must
have also completed at least six diary entries during the
7-day baseline period. Anticonvulsant medication
(including gabapentin), muscle relaxants, mexiletine, and
topical analgesics were discontinued 1 week prior to
baseline; previously prescribed tricyclic antidepressants
and/or narcotic analgesics could have been continued if
therapy had been stabilized at least 1 month prior to
study entry and had remained constant throughout. To
minimize the potential to confound treatment response
assessment, patients were excluded if they had received
neurolytic or neurosurgical treatment for PHN, a condition causing pain more severe than the pain associated
with PHN, a history of an unexplainable type of pain,
intolerance or hypersensitivity to gabapentin, moderate
or severe depression, clinically significant or unstable
medical conditions, a body mass index of >32 kg/m2
,
or an estimated creatinine clearance of <60 mL/min.
Pregnant patients were excluded. The study was
conducted in accordance with good clinical practice and
the 1996 version of the Declaration of Helsinki [22]. Independent Review Board (IRB) approvals for 15 investigators were obtained from Copernicus Group IRB, 118
MacKenan Drive Suite 400, Cary, NC 27511, while additional investigators were approved by either the University of Wisconsin Health Sciences IRB, B3088 VA
Medical Center, 2500 Overlook Terrace, Madison WI

Diego Human Research Protections Program, 9500

(1 investigator).
Study Design
This study (XenoPort, Inc. protocol XP009) had three
sequential periods including baseline, open label gabapentin run-in period, and double-blind, randomized GEn vs
placebo in patients with PHN, as shown in Figure 1. It was
conducted between June 21, 2004 and March 15, 2005
by investigators at the 17 US study sites listed in the
Appendix. Following a 7-day baseline period, all patients
received an open-label gabapentin for 11 days. The gabapentin dose was titrated over 4 days starting with 300 mg
at bedtime to the target dose of 600 mg three times daily.
Patients were maintained at this dose for 7 days. Patients
who completed this period were then randomized to 2

weeks of double-blind treatment with either 1,200 mg
GEn (2 ¥ 600 mg tablets) twice daily or matching placebo
using a block randomization stratified by study site. GEn
or placebo was taken every 12 hours with or without food,
except on pharmacokinetic sampling days, when the
doses were administered with food. Patients who experienced pain during the study, which in the opinion of the
investigator required additional treatment, were given
rescue treatment with acetaminophen up to 2 gm/day.
Clinic visits for endpoint and safety assessments were
conducted on study Days 0, 8, 19, 23, 27, 30, and 33
(end of treatment).
Efficacy Assessments
Pain intensity rating scores were recorded daily at the
time of the morning and evening doses of study drug
beginning 1 week before screening and continuing until
the end of the study. Patients’ self-reported scores were
recorded in an electronic diary (LogPad; PHT Corp.,
Charlestown, MA, USA) using an 11-point numerical pain
scale (0 = no pain, 10 = worst pain imaginable) [21];
negative changes from baseline indicated improvement.
The primary efficacy assessment was the change in
mean weekly pain score from baseline to the final week
on double-blind treatment for GEn compared with
placebo. To calculate each patient’s pain score, the
morning and evening scores for each day were averaged
together to derive the mean daily pain score, and the
mean weekly pain score was the average of the mean
daily pain scores for each week. For patients not completing 14 days of double-blind treatment, the mean of
daily pain scores from the 7 days preceding discontinuation was used. Secondary efficacy endpoints for GEn
compared with placebo included the change in mean
weekly pain score from baseline to Week 1 of doubleblind treatment, change in mean weekly pain score from
baseline to Week 2 double-blind treatment, and the proportion of patients showing either a 30% or 50%
reduction in mean pain score between baseline and
the end of treatment. A post hoc pharmacokinetic/
pharmacodynamic assessment was performed using
change in mean weekly pain score from baseline to the
end of each treatment (GEn or gabapentin) for patients
randomized to GEn in the double-blind study period who
had pharmacokinetics assessed.
Other Assessments
Sleep interference scores were also recorded by patients
in the electronic diary each morning, from the beginning
of the baseline period until the end of the study. These
scores assessed the extent to which pain interfered with
sleep during the previous night on an 11-point scale
(0 = pain did not interfere with sleep, 10 = pain completely interfered with sleep). To assess mood, patients
completed the Profile of Mood States (POMS) assessment [23] at the end of the baseline period (Day 8) and
the end of treatment. At the end of the study, both the
patient and investigator used the 7-point Clinical Global
Impression of Change (CGI-C) scale to rate the patient’s
change from baseline (1 = very much improved, 7 = very
much worse) and a responder was defined as any patient with a rating of “very much improved” or “much
improved.”
Pharmacokinetic Assessments
The gabapentin pharmacokinetic parameters were determined from plasma and urine concentrations at steady
state. Blood samples were collected prior to dosing and
over the course of a single dosing interval for gabapentin
treatment at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 hours and after
GEn or placebo treatment at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10,
and 12 hours. Blood samples were processed immediately and the plasma separated for storage. Complete
urine output was obtained over the same time periods.
Plasma and urine samples were stored at -20°C and
shipped frozen to MDS Pharma Services (Lincoln, NE,
USA) for analysis. Gabapentin levels were determined by
validated liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry/
mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) methods. The
LC–MS/MS method was validated for gabapentin in
plasma over the range 80–10,000 ng/mL. The lower limit
of quantitation was 80 ng/mL. The interbatch precision
(% coefficient of variation [%CV]) and accuracy (% bias)
for gabapentin in plasma were 9.5% and 5.1%,
respectively. The LC–MS/MS method was validated for
gabapentin in urine over the range 50–12,500 ng/mL.
The limit of quantitation was 50 ng/mL. The interbatch
%CV and accuracy for gabapentin in urine were 8.0%
and 2.0%, respectively. Concentration data for gabapentin in plasma were analyzed by noncompartmental
methods using WinNonlin (Pharsight Corporation, MounFigure 1 Diagrammatic presentation of patient flow

tain View, CA, USA). The steady-state maximum concentration (Cmax,ss) and time to Cmax,ss (Tmax,ss) values were
obtained by observation. The apparent elimination halflife was determined by linear regression of three or more
log-transformed data points in the terminal phase. The
area under the plasma concentration–time curve at
steady state was obtained by the linear trapezoidal
method using concentration data over the corresponding
dosing interval.
Safety and Tolerability Assessments
Treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) and serious
adverse events (SAEs) were assessed at each patient
visit and by spontaneous reports throughout the study
with dates of onset and resolution, severity, and relation
to the study drug recorded. Vital signs were measured
and clinical laboratory tests were performed at screening
and each patient visit. A 12-lead electrocardiography
(ECG) was performed at screening, just prior to randomization, and at the last visit. Complete physical and neurological examinations were conducted at screening and
at the last visit.
Data Analysis
The sample size required for the primary efficacy assessment GEn vs placebo was predicted using the results of
two published gabapentin studies in the treatment of PHN
[7,8]. A sample size of 120 evaluable patients (60 per
treatment group) was considered likely to be sufficient to
detect, with 80% power, a treatment difference of 1.03
between GEn and placebo in the change from baseline in
mean weekly pain score, using a two-sided t-test at a
significance level of 0.05 and assuming a standard deviation (SD) of 2.0. A prospectively planned unblinded interim
analysis by the Data and Safety Monitoring Board was
conducted when approximately 50% of subjects were
enrolled. The goals of this analysis were confirmation that
the study was adequately powered and to review the safety
data. The interim analysis revealed that the number of
patients to be enrolled could be reduced to 100 (50/group)
and still assure detecting with 80% power a treatment
difference, if one existed, and it was safe to continue.
Demographic and baseline data were summarized
descriptively. All efficacy analyses were performed on the
intent-to-treat population defined as all patients who
received at least one dose, or portion of a dose, of the
study drug and who reported at least one daily pain score
after randomization. Changes from baseline in mean
weekly pain score, weekly morning sleep interference
score, and POMS domains were analyzed using analysis
of covariance model with fixed effects for treatment, study
site (pooled), and treatment-by-site interaction and baseline score as covariate. Responder categories (30%
improvement and 50% improvement) were assessed
using the Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel test, adjusted for
study site (pooled).
Results from the pharmacokinetic analyses were summarized descriptively and treatment differences were determined using paired t-tests. Safety and tolerability analyses
were performed on the safety population, defined as all
patients who were randomized and who received at least
one dose, or portion of a dose, of study drug. Exploratory
analyses were performed on the subset of patients randomized to receive GEn to compare the efficacy data within
patients for the treatment periods on gabapentin and GEn.
Mean weekly pain scores, response to treatment, and
mean weekly morning sleep interference scores were analyzed using paired t-, Fisher, and McNemar tests.
A post hoc exploratory analysis of the relationship
between improvement in gabapentin plasma level exposure (average steady-state gabapentin plasma concentrations or Css,ave) after switching from gabapentin to GEn and
resulting changes in efficacy was performed. GEn-treated
patients were assigned to subgroups, based on the magnitude of improvement in gabapentin exposure. Group I
was defined as patients who had a >30% increase in
gabapentin Css,ave after switching to GEn. Group II was
defined as those patients with minimal change in gabapentin exposure (i.e., within <20% of initial Css,ave) after
switching to GEn. Change in mean weekly pain scores
and mean weekly morning sleep interference scores for
these two subgroups were analyzed using paired t-tests.
P values not adjusted for multiple comparisons have been
provided for all secondary endpoints as additional
descriptive statistics.
Results
Patient Population
A total of 221 adults aged 23–87.2 years with a history of
herpes zoster infection and PHN were assessed for study
eligibility. Of these, 105 patients were excluded for not
meeting eligibility criteria. A total of 116 patients were
enrolled and received gabapentin treatment, 115 patients
completed this period, and 101 patients were randomized
and received at least one dose of either GEn 1,200 mg
(n = 47) or placebo twice daily (n = 54). The remaining
patients discontinued from the study before randomization for the following reasons: AEs, not eligible, not adhering to the protocol, and patient request, as shown in
Figure 2. Patient demographics and baseline characteristics are shown in Table 1 and were similar between the
randomized treatment groups except the mean duration
of PHN for the GEn group compared with placebo group
was 3.7 vs 2.7 years, respectively, and the mean time
since herpes zoster onset was 3.7 vs 2.9 years, respectively. Two patients in the placebo group and no subjects
in the GEn group were on a tricyclic and two patients (one
placebo, one GEn) were on venlafaxine.
Efficacy Outcomes
The pain score results are summarized in Table 2. From
baseline to the end of the gabapentin period, the
mean  SD pain scores decreased to -1.7 for N = 101

patients. After randomization, patients treated with
GEn (n = 47) had a significantly greater decrease in
mean  SD weekly pain scores from baseline to the final
week on double-blind treatment compared with placebo (n = 54); -2.1  1.63 vs -1.2  1.69, P = 0.0321,
respectively. In addition, the decrease in mean  SD
weekly pain scores from baseline to the end of the first
week on double-blind treatment were significantly greater
for GEn vs placebo, -1.7  1.40 vs -1.0  1.49,
P = 0.0299, respectively.
A significantly greater proportion of patients receiving GEn
had a 30% improvement in weekly pain score from
baseline to the final week on double-blind treatment, compared with placebo (55.3% vs 27.8%, P = 0.0073). The
treatment difference observed for the proportion of

patients with a 50% improvement was 9.2% in favor of
GEn, but did not reach statistical significance (GEn 27.7%
vs placebo 18.5%, P = 0.2582).

However, once patients were randomized to the study

to the final week on double-blind treatment of -0.4  1.35
compared with worsening pain scores in placebo patients

Sleep Interference
Patients receiving GEn had significantly greater improvement in mean  SD weekly sleep interference scores from
baseline through the end of treatment compared with
placebo (GEn -2.2  1.76) vs placebo -0.9  1.75,
P = 0.0010). A statistically significant difference between
the treatment groups was also noted in the mean  SD
change from end of gabapentin treatment to the final
week of double-blind treatment, with the GEn group
showing a further improvement of GEn -0.4  1.31 vs
placebo +0.6  1.56, P = 0.0052.
POMS
GEn produced significantly greater improvement from
baseline to the final week of double-blind treatment in four
of the seven POMS domains vs placebo, as shown in
Table 3. These included total mood disturbance,
depression–dejection, anger–hostility, and vigor–activity.
Patient CGI-C
At end of treatment, the GEn group had significantly
greater improvement compared with placebo in the
patient global impression of change (P = 0.0003). “Very
much” or “much improved” was reported by 42.6% of
patients in the GEn group compared with 13.5% of
patients in the placebo group.
Short Form-McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ)
Results of the SF-MPQ showed statistically significant
improvement in the GEn vs placebo group from baseline
to the final week of treatment for total score and three of
four components of this measure (GEn vs placebo,
respectively): total score (-8.2 vs -3.6; P = 0.0209),
sensory score (-7.2 vs -2.8; P = 0.0073), affective score
(-1.0 vs -0.8; P = 0.6807), 0 to 100 visual analog pain
scale score (-26.5 vs -11.0; P = 0.0121), and present
pain intensity score (-0.8 vs -0.2; P = 0.0257).
Pharmacokinetics
The gabapentin pharmacokinetic parameters for n = 42
(n = 38 for urine data) patients who received both gabapentin and GEn are compared in Table 4. As the molecular
weights of GEn and gabapentin are 329.39 and 171.24,
respectively, 600 mg GEn can potentially provide 312 mg
of gabapentin upon hydrolysis. The GEn-treated patients
received 2,400 mg daily, which provides 1,248 mgequivalents of gabapentin. This GEn dose represents 31%
less gabapentin than the 1,800 mg daily dose of gabapentin capsules (1,800 mg-equivalents of gabapentin).
The mean  SD gabapentin concentration vs time profiles
at steady state for GEn vs gabapentin are shown in

Figure 3. After dosing of 1,200 mg GEn tablets twice daily,
average steady-state gabapentin concentrations in plasma
were increased 17% compared with gabapentin capsules
600 mg three times daily within the same patient
(P = 0.0050; paired t-test). Notably, the duration of drug
exposure following each dose was more sustained for GEn,
with peak levels occurring an average of 4.63 hours after
the dose compared with 2.31 hours after the dose for
gabapentin capsules. Gabapentin is excreted unchanged
in the urine; therefore, recovery of gabapentin in the urine
was used to estimate bioavailability as shown in Table 4.
Gabapentin bioavailability from GEn tablets was 77%
greater than from gabapentin capsules (P < 0.0001; paired
t-test). The interpatient variability in bioavailability for GEn
(CV = 34%) was lower than gabapentin (CV = 46%).
Pharmacokinetic Subgroup Post Hoc Analysis
Of the patients randomized to GEn and for whom gabapentin pharmacokinetic data were available after both
GEn and gabapentin treatments (n = 42), 15 patients
(35.7%) had an increased Css,ave of >30% with GEn treatment compared with gabapentin treatment (Group I),
whereas 13 patients (31.0%) had an increased gabapentin Css,ave of up to 20% (Group II), as shown in
Figure 4. Group I had a significant decrease in
mean  SD weekly pain scores (-0.9  1.2, P = 0.0126)
comparing GEn treatment with gabapentin treatment, as
well as significant improvements in mean  SD weekly
sleep interference scores (-0.9  1.4, P = 0.0318) from
the gabapentin period to the end of the GEn treatment
period. Changes in mean  SD weekly pain scores of
-0.2  1.1 and sleep interference scores -0.1  1.0
were not significantly different for Group II. In Figure 4,
11 patients in the GEn group had lower gabapentin
levels compared with gabapentin because they were
good gabapentin absorbers and received a 31%
lower gabapentin-equivalent GEn dose (as did all the
patients).
Safety and Tolerability
A total of 50/101 (49.5%) patients reported at least one
treatment emergent AE during the randomized treatment
period. The most common AEs in the GEn group were
dizziness, nausea, and headache as shown in Table 5.
These AEs were reported as generally mild or moderate in
intensity. Severe AEs occurred in a total of five patients
(GEn n = 1, placebo n = 4). One GEn-treated patient

reported a severe AE of blurred vision considered possibly
related to treatment. The four placebo-treated patients
reported severe AEs of dyspepsia, fatigue, noncardiac
chest pain, increased heart rate, hypoaesthesia, severe
PHN, dyspnea, and pruritus, all possibly related to treatment with placebo. During the gabapentin period, four
patients withdrew due to AEs of dizziness (n = 2), lethargy
(n = 1), and tachycardia (n = 1). Four additional patients, all
placebo treated, withdrew due to AEs of increased PHN
pain (n = 2), dizziness (n = 1), and noncardiac chest pain
(n = 1) during the randomized treatment period. No GEntreated patients withdrew due to AEs. There were no
deaths during the study and no SAEs occurred during the
treatment periods.
Changes in vital signs and ECG measurements from
baseline to the end of randomized treatment were clinically insignificant and similar between treatment groups.
During the gabapentin treatment period, two patients had
increased in clinical laboratory test results that were
considered AEs: increased alanine aminotransferase
levels (n = 2) from 51 to 75 U/L and from 55 to 73 U/L
(normal 0–45 U/L), and elevated aspartate transaminase
levels (n = 1) from 66 to 71 U/L (normal 0–41 U/L). During
the double-blind treatment period, there were no clinically
relevant changes in laboratory test results for either treatment group.
Discussion
As people age into and beyond the 6th decade of life,
there is an ever increasing likelihood of reactivating
varicella-zoster virus and subsequently developing PHN.
Various drug therapies are available to treat PHN, though
few have been used as long, and with the same safety and
effectiveness, as gabapentin. Not all patients with PHN
respond completely to gabapentin and the magnitude of
beneficial effect is related to the plasma concentrations of
gabapentin [11,12]. Gabapentin has a saturable absorption pathway in a narrow region of the gastrointestinal
tract, which may lead to variable, unpredictable, and suboptimal plasma concentrations in some patients [13].
In this study, GEn significantly reduced PHN pain levels in
a clinically meaningful way as assessed by various standard measurement methods. In addition, GEn reduced
pain interference with sleep and mood state assessment
variables and resulted in a greater percentage of patient
impression of change ratings as “much” or “very much”
improved. These positive PHN pain efficacy results produced by treatment with GEn are encouraging and are
likely related to the improved gabapentin blood levels produced by GEn.
The pharmacokinetic results from this study in patients with PHN show that GEn tablets improved gabapentin bioavailability relative to gabapentin capsules
and produced sustained drug exposure. These pharmacokinetic data are consistent with GEn results in healthy
volunteers, where single doses have been studied
ranging from 300 mg to 6,000 mg and multiple doses
from 300 mg to 2,100 mg twice daily [20,24]. In the
present study, comparisons within the same patient
with PHN found that on average twice daily GEn
administration provided greater exposure to gabapentin
in the blood than did the Food and Drug Administrationapproved three times daily regimen of gabapentin
capsules. This improved gabapentin exposure is remarkable considering the GEn dose administered potentially
provides 31% less active drug than the gabapentin
dose. It is also noteworthy that interpatient variability
in bioavailability was greater for gabapentin than for
GEn.
One of the limitations of this study is the use of sequential gabapentin and GEn treatments; therefore, clinical
outcome comparisons between these two drugs must
be interpreted cautiously. As expected, from the end of
the gabapentin treatment period to the end of the study,
the pain scores decreased for patients randomized to
GEn and increased for placebo-treated patients.
Whether the GEn-treated patients would have continued
to improve to a similar degree if they had continued on
gabapentin is unknown. In addition, the treatment duration was 2 weeks, limiting our ability to assess the use of
GEn in long-term management of PHN. It should be
noted that the change from baseline in average daily
pain score over a week for gabapentin vs placebo is
known to significantly improve after 2 weeks of therapy
[7,8].
To provide some insight into this question, a post
hoc analysis was conducted in the GEn-treated
patients whose gabapentin exposure improved more

than 30% when switched from gabapentin to GEn
(Group I) and patients whose gabapentin exposure did
not change more than 20% (Group II). Group II was
intended to serve as a surrogate for continued dosing
of gabapentin. At end of GEn treatment, patients in
Group I exhibited significantly improved pain scores,
while Group II patients did not improve. Owing to the
small number of patients and the post hoc nature of
this analysis, these results must be viewed as only
informative and should be confirmed in a prospective
study.
Overall, GEn was generally safe and well tolerated during
the study and the reported AEs were similar to those
reported during other clinical studies of gabapentin [7,8]
and GEn [20,25]. These findings are notable in a patient
population with an average age of 65 years who is likely to
be more sensitive to AEs. A limitation of these safety data
is that the initial gabapentin treatment prior to randomization may have influenced the AEs reported during GEn
treatment period.
Conclusion
This study in patients with PHN demonstrated that GEn
was superior to placebo in reducing pain and improving
sleep, mood, and global impression scores. GEn
extended release tablets provided a greater and more
sustained gabapentin systemic exposure than gabapentin
capsules. In addition, GEn was generally safe and well
tolerated.
