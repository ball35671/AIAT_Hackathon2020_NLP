Study Design. Prospective, randomized, double blind,
placebo-controlled, crossover clinical trial.
Objectives. To determine the efficacy of gabapentin in
the treatment of neuropathic pain related to spinal cord
injury.
Summary of Background Data. Neuropathic pain is
initiated or caused by a primary lesion or dysfunction in
the nervous system. Neuropathic pain associated with
spinal cord injury is quite refractory, and current treatments are not effective. Gabapentin, an anticonvulsant,
has become the first choice in the treatment of neuropathic pain. The place of gabapentin in the treatment of
spinal cord injury-related neuropathic pain was questioned in only a few recent reports; however, they are
retrospectively designed, nonstandardized, and uncontrolled studies, or involve a very small series of patients
using less than optimum doses.
Methods. A total of 18-week study period included a
4-week medication/placebo titration period. This was followed by a 4-week stable dosing period when the patients
continued to receive maximum tolerated doses, a 2-week
washout period, then a crossover of 4 weeks of medication/placebo titration, and another 4 weeks of stable dosing period. Twenty paraplegic patients (female/male:
7/13) with complete spinal cord injury at the thoracic and
lumbar level, aged between 20 and 65 years, with neuropathic pain for more than 6 months were recruited for the
study.
Results. All patients completed the study. Gabapentin
reduced the intensity as well as the frequency of pain,
relieved all neuropathic pain descriptors except the itchy,
sensitive, dull, and cold types, and improved the quality
of life (P  0.05).
Conclusions. Gabapentin can be added to the list of
first-line medications for the treatment of chronic neuropathic pain in spinal cord injury patients. It is a promising
new agent and offers advantages over currently available
treatments. [Key words: neuropathic pain, spinal cord injury, gabapentin] Spine 2004;28:743–751
Mechanical or inflammatory stimuli from any cause of
tissue destruction can cause pain (nociceptive pain).
However, the nervous system itself can also generate and
perpetuate pain without any ongoing stimuli from injury
(neuropathic pain). Neuropathic pain (NP) is defined
formally by the International Association for the Study
of Pain as “pain initiated or caused by a primary lesion or
dysfunction in the nervous system.”1 Neuropathic pain
is ultimately generated by excessive firing of painmediating nerve cells, insufficiently controlled by segmental and nonsegmental inhibitory circuits.1,2 It is commonly described as burning, stabbing, stinging,
shooting, aching, or electric shock-like in quality, most
commonly affecting the distal extremities, and the pain is
more severe at night.2
Neuropathic pain is often puzzling and frustrating for
both patients and physicians because it seems to have no
cause, responds poorly to standard pain therapies, can
last indefinitely, and even escalate over time, resulting in
severe disability.2 Successful pain control is enhanced
with the use of a systemic approach consisting of disease
modification, local or regional measures, and systemic
therapy.2 However, local and regional measures alone
are usually insufficient. In systemic pain management,
pharmacotherapy is the cornerstone. Commonly suggested pharmacologic approaches for NP are tricyclic
antidepressants, anticonvulsants, opioids, and nonopioid analgesics.3
Examples of NP include diabetic neuropathy, phantom limb pain, trigeminal neuralgia, and pain in spinal
cord injury (SCI).2 Pain is a frequent and major consequence of traumatic SCI, causing emotional and physical
discomfort, often hindering rehabilitation therapies. It is
estimated to occur in 11% to 94% of patients, 30%
manifesting as NP, and can be disabling.3–8 Neuropathic
pain associated with SCI is quite refractory, and current
treatments are not effective.3 Nepomuceno et al9 found
that 23% of quadriplegic patients and 37% of paraplegic
patients were willing to trade possible recovery for pain
relief. Thus, the problem of pain after SCI is of such
magnitude that efforts to identify effective treatment options should be a major research priority.
Many similarities between the pathophysiologic phenomena observed in some seizure disorders and NP models justify the rationale for the use of anticonvulsant
drugs in the symptomatic management of NP disorders.2,3,10–12 Among many drugs used to manage NP,
gabapentin (GBP), an anticonvulsant, has become the
first choice, although its mechanism of action is not yet
well understood.10 It is relatively well tolerated with a
few transient side effects, lack of organ toxicity, and no
evidence of significant interaction with other medicaFrom the Departments of *Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, †Anesthesiology and Intensive Care, and ‡Orthopedics and Traumatology,

However, the place of GBP in the treatment of SCIrelated NP was questioned in only a few recent clinical
trials.4,5,7,8 These studies are either retrospectively designed, nonstandardized, and uncontrolled studies or involve a very small series of patients using less than optimum doses, and the patients were allowed to use
additional medications.
This study was undertaken to determine the efficacy,
effective dose, and side effect profile of GBP in the treatment of NP related to SCI.
Methods
Ethics committee approval of the study protocol and written
informed consent from all patients before study participation
were provided.
The study was designed as a prospective, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, crossover clinical trial, lasting 18
weeks in total. This period included a 4-week medication/
placebo titration period, during which maximum dose was
reached for each subject. This was followed by a 4-week stable
dosing period when the patients continued to receive maximum
tolerated doses, a 2-week washout period, then a crossover of 4
weeks of medication/placebo titration, and another 4 weeks of
stable dosing period. Patients were hospitalized during titration periods.
Twenty paraplegic patients with complete traumatic SCI at
the thoracic and lumbar level, aged between 20 and 65 years,
with NP for more than 6 months confirmed by a physician,
were recruited for the study. Exclusion criteria included: severe
cognitive impairment, pregnancy, seizure disorder, the use of
anticonvulsants and antidepressants, major depression or a
score above 16 on the Beck Depression Inventory, and hypersensitivity to GBP. Concurrent analgesic medications were not
allowed at least 15 days before and during the study. A complete blood count and liver and renal function tests were done
before initiating treatment and at weekly intervals during the
study.
Patients meeting the inclusion criteria completed a Neuropathic Pain Scale (NPS),14 as well as a Short Form Beck Depression (Harcourt Brace & Co., San Antonio, TX). A score
above 4 on the 11-point Neuropathic Pain Scale (0–10), representing moderate to severe pain, was required for the study.
The patients were randomized into initially GBP treated group
(group A) or an initially placebo control treatment group
(group B) with equal numbers. Both GBP and placebo were
provided as identically appearing capsules. During the first 4
weeks of the study, patients received gradually titrated dosages
of GBP/placebo administered orally 3 times a day. Total dose at
the end of each week was: week 1, 900 mg/day; week 2, 1800
mg/day; week 3, 2400 mg/day; and week 4, 3600 mg/day. Before increasing the dose at each interval, the subject was seen by
a blinded physician to document any adverse side effects. If no
significant side effects were noted, the increase of dose was
made. Adverse effects of GBP were monitored and recorded.
Because this was one of the first prospective trials to evaluate
GBP’s efficacy in the patients with SCI population, all patients’
dosages were titrated to tolerability up to 3600 mg/day regardless of any efficacy achieved at lower dosages. In the event of
intolerable adverse reactions, the dosage was decreased one
dose step to 900, 1800, or 2400 mg/day. The decision to lower
the dosage was dictated by the patients for all types of side
effects except sedation in order not to produce inappropriate
consequences. Higher than second grade of sedation, according
to the Ramsay Sedation Scale5 (grades between 1 and 6), indicated a one step back move in dosage.
The baseline pain level was recorded twice a day for 3 consecutive days using the NPS and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS),
which ranged from 0 (no pain) to 100 (worst pain imaginable),
before initiating medication/placebo treatment. In addition, a
questionnaire derived from the Lattinen test17 (LQ) evaluating
subjective intensity and frequency of as well as disability due to
pain and quality of sleep was also performed. During the study
period (18 weeks), patients were asked to document pain levels
on the NPS every night in their daily diaries in which the morning and afternoon pain levels on the same day, as well as the
previous day’s nighttime pain level, were documented. The
evaluation of these NPS scores was done at baseline times
(weeks 0 and 10), at the end of titration periods (weeks 4 and
14), and at the end of stable dosing periods (weeks 8 and 18).
The LQ and VAS were performed at biweekly intervals beginning from the 2nd week through the 18th week.
Power and Statistical Analyses. Data from previous studies,7,12 including standard deviations of intensity scores of
NPS, and VAS scores of GBP treatment were used for power
analysis. To detect 3-point differences in intensity using NPS
and 30-point differences in VAS scores between placebo and
GBP (two-sided  of 5% and  of 20%), a group size of 16 to
17 was necessary.
Statistical analyses were performed by using SPSS 10.0 version for Windows 2000. Wilcoxon signed rank test was used
for evaluating NPS, VAS, and LQ scores within and between
the groups. Side effects were analyzed with 2 test. Different
varieties of neuropathic pain were tested including “intense,”
“hot,” “sharp,” “dull,” “cold,” “sensitive,” “itchy,” “unpleasant,” and “deep” versus “surface pain.” Demographic data
and data obtained from NPS scores are presented as mean
SD. The significance level was set at P  0.05.
Results
All patients completed the study (female/male: 7/13).
The mean age was 35.9  9.8 years (range 23–62 years).
The mean trauma time was 18.5  9.2 months (range
7–48 months). The mean pain onset time after trauma
was 2.7  1.4 months (1–8 months). The mean pain
duration was 15.8  9.0 months (6–45 months).
Baseline scores of VAS, NPS, and LQ both at the beginning of the study and at the end of washout period
were similar (P  0.05).
The changes in VAS scores during both phases of
treatment are presented in Figure 1.
The results of LQ evaluation are given in detail in
Figures 2 through 5.
Overall NPS scores throughout the treatment are
given in detail in Table 1. Both placebo and GBP did not
affect NPS scores for cold, itchy, sensitive, and dull varieties of NP (P  0.05). All other types of NP decreased
significantly with placebo at the fourth week compared
to baseline and remained so at the eighth week (P 

0.05). Except itchy, dull, sensitive, and cold types of NP,
GBP treatment provided statistically significant reduction for all varieties of NP at the fourth week compared
to baseline and continued to decline until the eighth week
(P  0.05). Although the response to GBP treatment and
placebo of the itchy, dull, sensitive, and cold types of NP
did not differ, GBP treatment ensured more relief for all
other descriptors of NP compared to placebo, which was
statistically significant (P  0.05).
The mean dose of GBP without side effects was 2235
500.8 mg/day (900–2700), and the mean maximum tolerated dose was 2850.0  750.7 mg/day (1200–3600).
The mean percentages of pain relief with GBP and
placebo for each pain descriptor of NPS are presented in
detail in Table 2. Pain relief indicated by VAS scores
from baseline to the end of GBP treatment is presented in
Figure 6. Mean pain relief with GBP treatment and placebo at the end of the stable dosing periods according to
Figure 1. Visual Analogue Scale
scores were decreased at the
second week of GBP treatment
compared to baseline values and
continued to decline until the sixth
week (P  0.001). At the eighth
week of GBP treatment, VAS
scores were similar to those of
sixth week (P  0.05). During the
placebo period, VAS scores decreased gradually, although minimally, until the sixth week compared to the baseline values (P 
0.05), and remained unchanged at
the eighth week. Visual Analogue
Scale scores were significantly
different between the GBP-treated
group and placebo group at all
times (P  0.001).
Figure 2. Subjective intensity of
pain decreased significantly during GBP treatment compared to
baseline values (P  0.001); however, the change was not significant during the placebo period
(P  0.05). The values of subjective intensity of pain differed significantly between the GBPtreated group and placebo group
at all times (2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks)
(P  0.001).

VAS scores were 60.7  12.7% and 10.3  2.8%, respectively (P  0.000).
All side effects are listed in detail in Table 3. Five
patients (25%) in the placebo group and 13 patients
(65%) in the GBP group, out of 20, experienced side
effects (P  0.05). These side effects did not lead to discontinuation of treatment. One patient in placebo group
and four patients in GBP group had more than one side
effect. Although there was no significant difference between placebo and GBP treatment regarding each individual type of side effect, the total number of side effects
with GBP treatment was significantly more than placebo
(P  0.05).
Discussion
Chronic pain is a common and significant problem occurring after SCI. In two recent postal surveys of community-dwelling people with SCI, current problematic
pain was reported by 80.5% of a sample of 164 individuals and 79% of a second sample of 384 individuals.18,19
Numerous studies have also provided evidence that SCIFigure 3. The decrease in frequency of pain was continuous
from the second until the sixth
week (P  0.05), and the eighth
week values were similar to
those of the sixth week with GBP
use. During the placebo period,
only the second week values for
frequency of pain were significantly lower than the baseline
values (P  0.05), but pain frequency at the fourth, sixth, and
eighth weeks were similar to the
baseline (P  0.05). Pain frequency was significantly lower
at all times with GBP treatment
than with placebo (P  0.05).

week. Placebo did not affect the
quality of sleep (P  0.05). The

Dysesthetic pain (also known as central pain, spinal
cord pain, or deafferentation pain) is reported to be the
most common form of NP in patients with SCI.2,11 It
occurs in a nonradicular pattern and is more likely to
occur in patients with paraplegia. It usually takes weeks
or months to develop after injury and is generally present
in 1 year.13,19,24 We included paraplegic patients with
dysesthetic pain in our study in order to investigate the

response to GBP in a standard group of patients with a
similar type of chronic pain.
Current pain measures, such as the VAS,25,26 McGill
Pain Questionnaire (MPQ),24,27 and Verbal Descriptor
Scale (VDS)28,29 have significant limitations as measures
of neuropathic pain.7 The VAS and VDS have proven to
be reliable and valid measures of pain intensity and unpleasantness, but they do not adequately cover the domain of the neuropathic pain experience. The MPQ assess a variety of pain qualities; however, it does not
provide quantitation of each distinct pain quality. Another drawback of existing pain measures is that they do
not identify potential subgroups of patients with neuropathic pain that may benefit from specific therapies.
Global measures may be less sensitive to treatments if
those treatments affect only a subset of specific pain experiences. The NPS30 is the first pain measure specifically
designed to assess NP. It addresses the need for a measure
that is sensitive to the variety of pain qualities most common to neuropathic pain syndromes. Thus, we utilized
the NPS to measure GBP’s efficacy on various types of
NP, but also added VAS to double check subjective responses to treatment with GBP and placebo. In addition,
part of the Lattinen test4,31 was used in order to evaluate
better the measures of quality of life. This test provides
information about the intensity and frequency of pain as
well as disability, sleep, and analgesic intake. Because we
did not permit additional analgesics, we could not test
this last category.
A variety of therapies for NP have been reported in
reviews, but relatively few studies have evaluated specific
treatments. Commonly, reviews have grouped treatments according to the type of approach to the pain
problem. Such categories include pharmacologic approaches, surgical approaches, psychosocial methods,
electrical stimulation procedures, neurolytic injections,
and physical methods.3,32–34 In addition, one review
names “alternative therapies” as another group of treatment options.34
Nonopioid analgesics are generally effective for nociceptive pain but less effective against the constant burning pain in patients with painful neuropathies, and there
is considerable controversy over the use of opioid maintenance therapy for people with nonmalignant pain, except for refractory cases.11,35 One review of scientific
data concluded that administration of antidepressants or
anticonvulsants should be first-line therapy.35 However,
the effectiveness of tricyclic antidepressant therapy is ofTable 2. Percentage of Pain Relief (Difference Between

ten limited by intolerable adverse effects or a delayed
onset of action.13,17
There is a notable similarity between the pathophysiologic and biochemical mechanisms observed in seizure
disorders and neuropathic pain.10,36 Anticonvulsants
suppress abnormal neural discharge via their action on
sodium conductance.6 On the strength of evidence, the
most effective anticonvulsant agent with the least side
effects for the treatment of NP is GBP.10 Initially approved in 1994 for treatment of seizures, it has shown
efficacy in the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia, painful diabetic neuropathy, and complex regional pain syndrome.1,7,10,13,14,37 The reported helpfulness of GBP for
NP was reported to be second only to that of opioid
medications, but NP has a tendency to be refractory to
opioid medications except in extremely high doses,
where unacceptable sedation becomes an intolerable side
effect.3 Studies have suggested that NP is often related to
the hypoactivity of -aminobutyric acid (GABA) and hyperactivity of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) in the
spinal cord, along with dysfunction of pain modulation
from the monoaminergic system from the higher central
nervous system.20,38–40 Gabapentin is an anticonvulsant, structurally related to the neurotransmitter GABA;
however, it does not interact with GABA receptors or
GABA metabolism, and it has no effect on sodium channels like other anticonvulsants. Recent data suggest that
GBP blocks a subtype of calcium channels on neurons,
and the mechanism of GBP’s anticonvulsant and analgesic actions are believed to be different from other
anticonvulsants.12,37
In recent years, GBP has been shown to be effective in
patients with SCI in several case reports or in studies that
depend on retrospectively driven data.1,2,4,5,7,8,37,41 To
date, pertinent literature has been lacking standardized
studies validating the efficacy of GBP in patients with
SCI. One recent study7 demonstrated that GBP had a
beneficial effect on NP after SCI via a prospective, placebo-controlled clinical trial, but this study has been criticized for its small sample size and suboptimal dosing.
Our study is the first prospective, randomized, double
blind, placebo-controlled, crossover clinical trial to reveal GBP’s efficacy with sufficient number of patients and
dose regimen. In order to get the most dependable results
possible, we excluded the factors that may contribute to
perception of pain, such as major depression. Also, concurrent analgesic medications were not allowed at least
15 days before and during the study. This restriction did
not arouse any problems, because none of the patients
was receiving regular and systematic medications. This
way, we eliminated the possible role of additional analgesics in relieving pain.
The highest dose of GBP achieved in controlled, high
quality studies is up to 3600 mg/day.10,37 In contrast, the
vast majority of the primarily uncontrolled studies used
very low daily doses (100–1200 mg/day).1 Although
positive effect was reported even with small daily doses,
one wonders about potential treatment failures at low
doses. Similarly, the speed of dose escalation was quite
variable in the uncontrolled studies.1 Rapid dose escalation might be responsible for increased side effects. Studies suggest that if the drug is ineffective at low doses, a
time-limited course of high doses (up to 3600 mg/day)
may be attempted before the drug is abandoned, and that
slower titration may reduce central nervous system side
effects.1 Therefore, we aimed to reach the dose of 3600
mg/day, and 9 out of 20 patients did so, without significant side effects, which may be attributed to the slow
titration method we used. The therapeutic dose of GBP is
reported in a wide range, but controlled studies concentrate on a 1800 mg/day dose, after which therapeutic
effects were noted.10,37 Among patients with SCI, GBP
started reducing NP at 300 mg three times daily.29 In
Salas et al’s
42 retrospective study, 77% of patients (10 of
13) had some relief of their NP at an average dose of
1580 mg/day. Tai et al7 used GBP 1800 mg/day for treating NP among patients with SCI and found it suboptimal, as pain relief started at the fourth week of treatment, and concluded that the relatively low maximal
dosage of GBP might have underestimated the efficacy of
GBP in the treatment of NP among patients with SCI. We
observed relief of pain with GBP use from the beginning
of the study; however, statistically significant pain relief
started from the second week (i.e., at the time of first
statistical evaluation), and this corresponds to a dose of
1800 mg/day. A clinically relevant outcome in determining the efficacy of treatment in relieving pain, a measure
equivalent to more than 50% relief is desired.12,43 Significant improvement was evident during the titration
phases in our study (about 50% pain relief at the end)
and continued to accrue over the course of stable dosing
periods of treatment (about 60% pain relief at the end).
Patients frequently have more than one subtype of
NP. Although the studies indicated that GBP might be
useful in several types of pain, they noted the need for
well-designed trials to provide true insight into differential responses of pain types to GBP.28,44 Tai et al7 found
a significant decrease of unpleasant feeling following
GBP treatment and noticed a trend toward statistical
significance in the pain intensity and hot sensation. No
significance was detected in the remainder of pain descriptors. In our study, GBP provided statistically significant reduction for all varieties of NP, except itchy, dull,
sensitive, and cold types. This difference may be explained by the small sample size and perhaps the use of
lower doses in Tai et al’s
7 study. The low baseline levels
of itchy, dull, sensitive, and cold varieties of pain might
have been the cause of unresponsiveness to GBP. Improvement in the measures for quality of life, such as
sleep comfort and disability due to pain, designated by
LQ, is another favorable aspect of GBP treatment.
Adverse effects of GBP have been reported as minor
and well tolerated, consisting primarily of somnolence,
dizziness, weakness, edema, vertigo, and headache,
whereas placebo has led to weakness, nausea-vomiting,
headache, and vertigo.1 Despite doses of GBP up to 3600
Gabapentin for Neuropathic Pain • Levendog˘lu et al 749
mg/day in a population with an average of 73 years, no
serious drug-related adverse events were reported.37 Side
effects have been reported to be experienced by about
55% to 62% of patients in controlled studies and 30% in
uncontrolled ones.1 This number is similar to the incidence of side effects experienced by the placebo treated
groups (28%).1 Intolerable side effects resulting in withdrawal from the study were reported in 10.5% of the
patients who received GBP in the controlled trials and in
4.4% in the uncontrolled studies.1 The frequency of side
effects in our study in the GBP and placebo groups were
65% and 25%, respectively, but these were reversible by
decreasing the dose one step back and did not lead to
withdrawal of patients. In clinical practice, adverse effects can be managed by a slower upward titration, dose
reduction, and use of lower maximum doses than allowed in the clinical trial protocol. In our study, the
mean dose of GBP without side effects was about 2235
mg/day, and the mean maximum tolerated dose was
about 2850 mg/day. In between these doses, GBP reduced NP in our patient with SCI population with very
acceptable adverse effect profiles. Thus, we may conclude that starting at too high a dose or titrating too
quickly can lead to early discontinuation of the drug
because of side effects, and that GBP appears a better
tolerated alternative for the treatment of NP.
Our study addressed the effective dose interval and side
effects, but not the length of GBP treatment. Although, the
majority of our patients are still on medication after 18
months, we do not have analyzed data regarding this. So, it
would only be speculation to comment on this.
The cost of GBP is covered by social security funds in
our country, but it may be an issue in others. The costs
vary, but the average is $150 to $250 per month for a
dose of 2400 mg per day in the United States. However,
the improvement in quality of life, provision of adequate
pain relief, and potential reintegration to a more active
lifestyle with less disability are worth the price. In summary, GBP can be added to the list of first line medications for the treatment of chronic NP in patients with
SCI. It is a promising new agent and offers advantages
over currently available treatments. Gabapentin monotherapy produced rapid onset of clinically meaningful
pain relief with relatively minor and potentially avoidable adverse effects in this trial.
Key Points
● NP associated with SCI is quite refractory, and
current treatments are not effective.
● GBP monotherapy produced rapid onset of clinically meaningful pain relief with relatively minor and
potentially avoidable adverse effects in this trial.
● GBP can be added to the list of first-line medications for the treatment of chronic NP in SCI patients.
