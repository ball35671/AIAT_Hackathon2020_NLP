Nortriptyline and gabapentin, alone and in combination
for neuropathic pain: a double-blind, randomised controlled
crossover trial
Ian Gilron, Joan M Bailey, Dongsheng Tu, Ronald R Holden, Alan C Jackson, Robyn L Houlden
Summary
Background Drugs for neuropathic pain have incomplete effi cacy and dose-limiting side-eff ects when given as
monotherapy. We assessed the effi cacy and tolerability of combined nortriptyline and gabapentin compared with each
drug given alone.
Methods In this double-blind, double-dummy, crossover trial, patients with diabetic polyneuropathy or postherpetic
neuralgia, and who had a daily pain score of at least 4 (scale 0–10), were enrolled and treated at one study site in
Canada between Nov 5, 2004, and Dec 13, 2007. 56 patients were randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio with a balanced Latin
square design to receive one of three sequences of daily oral gabapentin, nortriptyline, and their combination. In
sequence, a different drug was given to each randomised group in three treatment periods. During each 6-week
treatment period, drug doses were titrated towards maximum tolerated dose. The primary outcome was mean daily
pain at maximum tolerated dose. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered, number
ISRCTN73178636.
Findings 45 patients completed all three treatment periods; 47 patients completed at least two treatment periods and
were analysed for the primary outcome. Mean daily pain (0–10; numerical rating scale) was 5·4 (95% CI 5·0 to 5·8)
at baseline, and at maximum tolerated dose, pain was 3·2 (2·5 to 3·8) for gabapentin, 2·9 (2·4 to 3·4) for nortriptyline,
and 2·3 (1·8 to 2·8) for combination treatment. Pain with combination treatment was signifi cantly lower than with
gabapentin (–0·9, 95% CI –1·4 to –0·3, p=0·001) or nortriptyline alone (–0·6, 95% CI –1·1 to –0·1, p=0·02). At
maximum tolerated dose, the most common adverse event was dry mouth, which was signifi cantly less frequent in
patients on gabapentin than on nortriptyline (p<0·0001) or combination treatment (p<0·0001). No serious adverse
events were recorded for any patients during the trial.
Interpretation Combined gabapentin and nortriptyline seems to be more effi cacious than either drug given alone for
neuropathic pain, therefore we recommend use of this combination in patients who show a partial response to either
drug given alone and seek additional pain relief. Future trials should compare other combinations to their respective
monotherapies for treatment of such pain.

Introduction
First described by the International Association for the
Study of Pain in 1994 as pain ‘‘initiated or caused by a
primary lesion or dysfunction in the nervous system’’,1
neuropathic pain aff ects more than 2–3% of the general
population,2,3 and its precise defi nition continues to be
reassessed.4
 Disorders causing neuropathic pain
include cervical or lumbar radiculopathy, diabetic polyneuropathy, post-traumatic neuropathy, and postherpetic neuralgia. Neuropathic pain impairs patients’
mood, quality of life, daily activities, and occupational
performance, and generates health-care costs three
times higher than in matched controls.5
 Such pain
costs an estimated US$40 billion per year in the USA
alone.6
Gabapentin and nortriptyline are two of several fi rstline drugs with the most favourable therapeutic profi les.7,8
However, when given as monotherapy, the maximum
tolerated doses of these drugs rarely reduce pain by more
than 60% and provide relief in only 40–60% of patients
because of incomplete effi cacy and dose-limiting sideeff ects.7,8 Combination of diff erent drugs could provide
additive or synergistic analgesia thus leading to increased
effi cacy or tolerability, or both. The merits of this strategy
were shown in a previous trial in which combined
morphine and gabapentin had superior analgesic effi cacy
to either drug given alone.9
Gabapentin is a 3-alkylated analogue of γ aminobutyric
acid; it modulates α-2-δ calcium channel subunits, which
are thought to be important in neuropathic pain.10
Nortriptyline is a metabolite of amitriptyline with several
putative pharmacological mechanisms including blockade of norepinephrine and serotonin uptake, blockade of
sodium channels, and sympathetic blockade and antagonism of N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptors.11 A
preclinical study in a nociceptive pain model suggests
that synergistic interactions could occur between these
two drug classes.12

We aimed to assess the effi cacy of combined gabapentin
and nortriptyline compared with monotherapy using
either drug for patients with neuropathic pain. Although
diabetic polyneuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia are
aetiologically and pathologically distinct diagnostic
entities, they are both associated with the type of
neuropathic pain that has similar response to treatment
with opioids, tricyclic antidepressants, and anti convulsants
(eg, gabapentin).7,8 Thus, we have expanded the trial to
include these two neuropathic disorders to broaden
generalisability, as in previous trials.9,13

Nov 5, 2004, and Dec 13, 2007. Patients with diabetic
polyneuropathy satisfi ed diagnostic criteria for diabetes
mellitus,14 and suff ered from distal, symmetric, sensory
diabetic polyneuropathy. Diabetic polyneuropathy was
established by at least a moderate decrease in pinprick,
temperature or vibration sense in both feet, or by
bilaterally decreased or absent ankle jerk refl exes. Patients
with postherpetic neuralgia had had an eruption of a
herpes zoster rash, which was recorded by a clinician,
6 months or more before enrolment. After telephone
screening, patients were invited to the clinic for recording
of history, physical examination, detailed neurological
examination, laboratory tests, and an electrocardiogram.
Eligible patients had daily pain (score ≥4 on a scale of
0–10) for at least 6 months directly preceding the start of
the trial, aspartate aminotransferase and alanine
aminotransferase concentration of 120% of the upper
limit of normal or less, serum creatinine concentration of
150% of the upper limit of normal or less, and haemoglobin
A1c concentration of less than 13%. Patients had suffi cient
cognitive function and language skills for telephone
communication and completion of study questionnaires.
Exclusion criteria included patient history or laboratory
results that suggested the presence of an inherited
neuropathy or neuropathy attributable to other causes,
such as hypothyroidism, vitamin B12 defi ciency,
connective tissue disease, amyloidosis, and toxic
exposure. Other exclusions were any major organ system
disease, cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy, baseline
postural hypotension of more than 20 mm Hg, sedation
or ataxia due to concomitant drugs or other cause, urinary
symptoms attributable to benign prostatic hypertrophy
in male participants, psychiatric or substance abuse
disorder, hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs, or a
coexisting disorder causing pain as severe as the
neuropathic pain. Women of childbearing potential were
required to receive a highly eff ective form of
contraception.
Trial-related health care was provided free of charge
and trial participants were reimbursed for trial-related
travel expenses. No other compensation was off ered to
trial participants at any time during the study. All
participants supplied written informed consent. This
trial received institutional ethics approval from Queen’s
University, Kingston, ON, Canada.
Procedures
This randomised trial of three treatments—gabapentin,
nortriptyline, and combined gabapentin and nor trip tyline—had a three-period (A, B, and C) crossover design
with 6 weeks per treatment period. As per a balanced
Latin square crossover design, patients were randomised
(double-blind) in a 1:1:1 ratio and allocated to one of three
possible treatment sequences to be taken in treatment
period A, B, and C, respectively: gabapentin, combined
treatment, and nortriptyline (GCN); nortriptyline,
gabapentin, and combined treatment (NGC); or
combined treatment, nortriptyline, and gabapentin
(CNG). A trial pharmacist prepared a concealed allocation
schedule by computer randomisation of these three
sequences, in blocks of three, to a consecutive number
series; the pharmacist had no further participation in the
trial. Patients were assigned in turn to the next
consecutive number, and the corresponding series of
study drugs was dispensed.
Drugs were given as yellow and orange capsules to
maintain double-blinding. Capsules were identical in
appearance for all treatments as per a double-dummy
design. Yellow capsules were given twice daily and
orange capsules were given three times daily. For each
treatment, yellow and orange capsules contained,
respectively, placebo and 400 mg gabapentin, 10 mg
nortriptyline and placebo, or 10 mg nortriptyline and
400 mg gabapentin. Target daily dose ceilings were
3600 mg gabapentin and 100 mg nortriptyline, either
singly or in combination.
Patients completed a diary at baseline with pain
intensity ratings for 7 days after discontinuation of
tricyclic antidepressants, or gabapentin or pregabalin,

or both before starting to take the study drug. Patients
taking, and perceiving benefi t from, sustained-release
opioids, non-steroidal anti-infl ammatory drugs, or
paracetamol were allowed to continue these drugs at a
steady dose for the entire study. However, procedural
pain treatments (eg, nerve blocks or acupuncture) were
forbidden. The dose-escalation schedule for each set of
tablets was identical for every treatment period. During
the fi rst 24 days of each 6-week period, the dose was
escalated towards a maximum tolerated dose or the
target ceiling dose, whichever was reached fi rst.
Days 25–31 of each treatment period were classed as
the patients’ maximum tolerated dose for that treatment.
Days 32–35 of each treatment period were classed as
the dose taper phase, and days 36–42 were the drug
washout phase.
A research nurse telephoned patients twice weekly to
record and assess adverse events by open-ended
questioning, and guide drug dose titration; the nurse
was masked for the entire trial. With each dose increase,
adverse events were rated by the patient (mild, moderate,
or severe), and patients were asked if they could tolerate
the present dose for another 2–3 days. If so, this dose
was continued with the expectation that tolerance to
side-eff ects would develop. If side-eff ects were
intolerable or did not improve, or both, the dose was
decreased to the previous dose-titration step until the
next scheduled telephone call. At a subsequent telephone
call, an increase to the dose at which side-eff ects were a
problem was attempted. If the increased dose resulted
in intolerable side-eff ects, at the next telephone call the
dose was decreased back to the previous dose, which
was then defi ned as the maximum tolerated dose. If
adverse events or lack of effi cacy necessitated withdrawal
from the study treatment, patients were off ered the
opportunity to pursue the next drug treatment in
sequence in the next treatment phase, after taper and
washout of the treatment from which they withdrew.
Outcome measures were consistent with Initiative on
Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in
Clinical Trials (IMMPACT) guidelines,15 and included
measures of pain intensity, interference with function,
mood, quality of life, and global pain relief. The primary
outcome was pain intensity (0–10 on a numerical rating
scale [NRS]), which was rated three times daily, and the
mean was taken over 7 days at the maximum tolerated
dose. Secondary outcomes were maximum tolerated
dose of study drug, serum concentration of study drug,
brief pain inventory,16 patient-reported nocturnal pain
(rated 0–10, for the preceding night during each
telephone contact), short-form McGill pain questionnaire
(SF-MPQ),17 short-form 36-item general health survey
(SF-36),18 Beck depression inventory,19 adverse events,
serious adverse events, global pain relief (rated pain
worse, no relief, slight relief, moderate relief, a lot of
relief, or complete relief), results of blinding
questionnaires completed by patients and the research
nurse, and bodyweight.

Statistical analysis
The preplanned main analysis compared pain scores for
combination treatment versus monotherapy for patients
on the maximum tolerated dose. On the basis of previous
variance estimates and accounting for two pairwise
comparisons (combination treatment vs gabapentin or
nortriptyline), we calculated that 40 patients would
provide an 80% probability of detecting a mean diff erence
between treatments of about half of a clinically
signifi cant20 amount of pain reduction (α=0·05, twosided). Dropout rates in previous studies were about 10%
per 4–6-week treatment period, therefore we anticipated
that enrolment of 58 patients would yield 40 who
completed the study.
Patients completing at least two study treatment
periods (providing one pairwise comparison) were
included in the effi cacy analysis; analysis was by intention
to treat. Patients receiving at least one dose of any study
drug were included in analyses of adverse events. Mean
pain intensity was calculated from patient diaries while
patients were on the maximum tolerated dose. For
inclusion, more than 50% of the scores had to be
available; otherwise, the mean daily pain intensity was
treated as missing. A linear mixed model21 was formed
with fi xed eff ects of drug treatment, treatment sequence,
treatment period, and the fi rst-order carryover term, and
the random eff ect as patient (nested in sequence); the
model was fi rst fi tted with the pain intensity data. If the
carryover eff ect was not signifi cant, then a reduced model
excluding the carryover term was refi tted.
According to Jones and Kenward,21 the extent of the
carryover factor in the second and third treatment
period was defi ned as treatment received in the fi rst
and second period, respectively; the extent of carryover
in the fi rst period was the same but an arbitrary
treatment for all patients. The model was identifi able
since treatment period was another factor in the model.
The eff ect of carryover was fi rst tested, and if it was not
statistically signifi cant, this term was dropped from the
linear mixed model. The least-square mean (SD)
estimated from the initial or reduced model was
calculated for every drug treatment. For treatment
eff ects, according to Fisher’s least signifi cant diff erence
method for multiple comparisons,22 the global diff erence
between all the treatment groups was fi rst tested in the
model. Only when this test was signifi cant, all three
pairwise comparisons were made with the estimated
contrast from the initial or reduced model. As a
secondary analysis, change in pain during each
treatment period was calculated as the diff erence
between pain at treatment period baseline (mean of last
3 days of baseline before study start, or mean of last
3 days of washouts preceding periods B and C) and pain
on treatment (mean of last 3 days on maximum
tolerated dose). The percentage change in pain (change
in pain/treatment period baseline) was analysed as per
the above linear mixed model. Secondary continuous
outcome measures were analysed in the same way with
baseline scores included as an additional fi xed eff ect
in the model. Proportion data were analysed by
Fisher’s exact method.23 All reported p values are twosided. All analyses were done with SAS software
(version 8.0).

Results
Figure 1 shows the trial profi le. Of 73 patients screened
for eligibility, almost a quarter were excluded. 56 patients
with either diabetic polyneuropathy (71%) or postherpetic
neuralgia (29%) were enrolled and randomised. 47 (84%)
patients completed at least two treatment periods and
were included in effi cacy analyses; 11 patients withdrew
from at least one treatment period, and therefore
45 (80%) completed all treatment periods. Table 1 shows
the demographic characteristics of patients at baseline.
Allodynia was recorded in about three-quarters of
patients which, in the case of the diabetic polyneuropathy
group, was somewhat higher than was reported in
previous studies.9,24
Figure 2 shows the primary outcome of mean daily
pain intensity throughout the trial for each treatment
sequence group. No signifi cant eff ects of treatment
sequence, treatment period, or carryover were recorded
in the main analysis, but eff ects of drug treatment were
statistically signifi cant (p=0·0043). Pain intensity at
baseline and maximum tolerated dose is shown in
table 2; pain with combination treatment was
signifi cantly lower than with gabapentin (–0·9, 95% CI
–1·4 to –0·3) or nortriptyline alone (–0·6, 95% CI –1·1
to –0·1). For patients with diabetic polyneuropathy, pain
with combination treatment (2·2, 95% CI 1·5–2·8) was
signifi cantly lower than with nortriptyline (2·9,
2·3–3·6, p=0·018) or gabapentin alone (3·1, 2·4–3·7,
p=0·009). For patients with postherpetic neuralgia,
pain with combination treatment (2·5, 1·4–3·6) was
lower than with nortriptyline (2·9, 1·7–4·0) or
gabapentin alone (3·4, 2·2–4·5), but the overall eff ect
of drug treatment was not signifi cant (p=0·054),
possibly because of small sample size. Analysis of mean
percentage change in pain intensity for all patients
indicated greater pain reduction with combination
treatment (52·8% [SE 4·6]) than with nortriptyline
(38·8% [4·6], p=0·01) or gabapentin alone (31·1% [4·6],
p=0·0002).
In analysis of secondary outcomes, mean maximum
tolerated dose of gabapentin was 2433 mg (SE 106) as
monotherapy versus 2180 mg (108) in combination
(p=0·0009). For nortriptyline, maximum tolerated dose
was 61·6 mg (3·6) as monotherapy versus 50·1 mg (3·5)
in combination (p=0·0006). At maximum tolerated dose,
mean serum drug concentration of gabapentin was
9·57 mg/L (SE 0·53) as monotherapy versus 9·42 mg/L
(0·72) in combination, and nortriptyline was 0·047 mg/L

combination, but eff ect of drug treatment was not
signifi cant (p=0·37 for diff erence between combination
treatment and gabapentn; p=0·11 for diff erence between
combination treatment and nortriptyline).
Brief pain inventory scores for worst pain and average
pain were signifi cantly lower with combination
treatment than with gabapentin or nortriptyline alone,
and pain relief with combination treatment was
signifi cantly higher (table 2). Brief pain inventory scores
also indicated that sleep interference was signifi cantly
lower with combination treatment than with gabapentin
or nortriptyline alone. For mood and enjoyment of life,
combination treatment had signifi cantly lower
interference than nortriptyline alone. Interference with
mood was lower for gabapentin than nortriptyline, but
the diff erence was not signifi cant (table 2). Nocturnal
pain at maximum tolerated dose was lower with
combination treatment (1·4 [SE 0·4]) than with
gabapentin (2·2 [0·4]) or nortriptyline alone (2·0 [0·4]),
but the overall eff ect of drug treatment was not
signifi cant (p=0·13).
SF-MPQ results indicated that combination treatment
had a reduced sensory eff ect and total pain score (p=0·08
and p=0·07, respectively, for overall eff ect of drug
treatment) compared with gabapentin or nortriptyline
alone (table 3). Signifi cantly higher vitality was recorded
for combination treatment and gabapentin alone than
for nortriptyline alone in SF-36; moreover, SF-36 total
score showed weak evidence that combination treatment
was better than monotherapy (p=0·057 for overall eff ect
of drug treatment). Combination treatment was also
associated with a signifi cantly lower Beck depression
inventory score than nortriptyline alone; gabapentin also
had a lower score than nortriptyline, but the diff erence
was not signifi cant (table 3).
Table 4 describes adverse events reported by patients
during drug dose titration and at maximum tolerated
dose. During dose titration, moderate or severe dry
mouth was signifi cantly more frequent with nortriptyline
or combination treatment than with gabapentin,
whereas inability to concentrate was signifi cantly less
frequent with nortriptyline than with gabapentin. At
maximum tolerated dose, moderate or severe dry mouth
was signifi cantly more frequent with nortriptyline or
combination treatment than with gabapentin. No other
signifi cant diff erences in adverse events were recorded.
No serious adverse events were recorded for any patients
during the trial.
Of the patients who completed a given treatment
period and reported at least moderate pain relief at
maximum tolerated dose, 65% (30/46) were on
gabapentin, 76% (38/50) were on nortriptyline, and 84%

signifi cant diff erences between these treatments.
According to blinding questionnaire responses, correct
guesses by patients with respect to their treatment
assignment were achieved by 10 (21%) patients on
gabapentin, 18 (35%) on nortriptyline, and 15 (29%) on
combination treatment. The research nurse correctly
guessed patients’ treatment assignments for 28 (58%)
patients on gabapentin, 24 (47%) on nortriptyline, and
25 (48%) on combination treatment. Mean bodyweight
for all participants at baseline was 91·7 kg (SE 2·9), and
at maximum tolerated dose, mean bodyweight with
nortriptyline (92·5 kg [0·4]) was signifi cantly lower than
with gabapentin (93·8 kg [0·5], p=0·01) or combination
treatment (93·5 kg [0·4], p=0·04).
Discussion
This trial shows that combination of an antidepressant
and an anticonvulsant drug seems to be superior to
monotherapy for neuropathic pain. We have shown that
treatment with combined gabapentin and nortriptyline
results in lower mean daily pain intensity than does
monotherapy with either drug. Combination treatment
also results in increased percentage change in pain, and
reduced pain intensity and increased pain relief according
to the brief pain inventory. At maximum tolerated dose,
frequency of adverse events was similar across all
treatment groups, except for increased dry mouth with
combination treatment and nortriptyline compared with
gabapentin. Although signifi cant diff erences in pain
intensity between combination treatment and
monotherapy were moderate, these diff erences are within
the same range of magnitude as those reported in our
previous trial comparing combination of morphine and
gabapentin with monotherapy.9
Combined gabapentin and nortriptyline resulted in
clinically signifi cant improvement in sleep interference,
a major complication of neuropathic pain.25 Since
combination treatment improved both pain and sleep
more than monotherapy, the weak evidence that quality
of life was improved (according to SF-36 total scores) is
notable. Combination treatment reduced pain more than
monotherapy in both subgroups of diabetic polyneuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia, although the
reduction was not signifi cant for postherpetic neuralgia.
Reduction in both subgroups suggests that the interaction
of the drugs—each of which as monotherapy have similar
effi cacy for diabetic neuropathy and postherpetic
neuralgia—was favourable in both these disorders. Our
trial used common antidepressant and anticonvulsant
drugs for the treatment of common disorders associated
with neuropathic pain, but these results might not be
generalisable to all combinations of antidepressants and
anticonvulsants, or to all neuropathic pain disorders.
We designed the trial as double-blind but blinding
questionnaire responses from the research nurse were
correct more often than might be expected by chance,
which suggests the possibility of partial unmasking of the
nurse, perhaps because of clinical observations. However,
we do not believe that this unmasking would have been
substantial enough to aff ect the course of patients’
treatment, particularly since patients maintained a high
degree of masking.
The trial was designed to use simultaneous combination
treatment as opposed to sequential treatment, which is
more often used in clinical practice.26 Sequential
combination treatment restricts exposure of patients to
more than one drug if they report incomplete relief with
the fi rst drug tried, but it might lead to suboptimum dose
ratios for combination treatment if both drugs have
common overlapping side-eff ects. For example, titration
of the fi rst drug to maximum tolerated dose might lead to
substantial sedation, thus restricting the attainable dose
of a second sedating drug so that the dose-ratio is
imbalanced in favour of the fi rst drug. Therefore, if
optimum analgesic interaction requires balanced ratio of
the two drugs, simultaneous dose titration of these drugs
might be preferable.
In view of the inadequate effi cacy and tolerability of
drugs for neuropathic pain,7,8 researchers continue
eff orts to identify new treatments.27 However, neuropathic
pain is transmitted via several complex pathways, and
new monotherapies might fail to provide improvements.28
Combination of drugs to enhance effi cacy and tolerability
is a recognised strategy for disorders such as asthma,29
hypertension,30 and cancer.31 However, the insuffi cient
evidence base for combination treatment in neuropathic
pain has meant that potentially useful combinations
have not been recognised, whereas futile or even harmful
combinations continue to be used. For example, use of
combined amitriptyline and fl uphenazine has been
shown to provide inferior effi cacy and greater sedation
than amitriptyline alone.32 Furthermore, for patients
with lumbar radiculopathy, no signifi cant analgesia was
reported with morphine or nortriptyline as monotherapy,
and combination treatment failed to show effi cacy.33
Thus, although this trial and a previous trial of combined
morphine and gabapentin9
 have shown positive results
with combination treatment, not all combinations are
benefi cial.
We used a fi xed-time method in this trial, whereby drug
doses were titrated towards the maximum limit of
tolerability, and found that maximum tolerated doses of
nortriptyline and gabapentin were signifi cantly lower as
combination treatment than as monotherapy, which
suggests at least some additivity of adverse events from
drug combination. However, superior effi cacy was
achieved with combination treatment at reduced doses
without increased frequency of adverse events, suggesting
that additivity for analgesia was higher than for adverse
events. Unlike complex preclinical interaction studies
with isobolographic analyses,34 the methods used in our
trial cannot distinguish between additive versus
synergistic eff ects since only the maximum tolerated
dose was assessed rather than several diff erent drug

doses. However, we can infer that the overall therapeutic
profi le favours combined treatment with nortriptyline
and gabapentin. By contrast with diff erences in maximum
tolerated dose, diff erences in serum drug concentrations
of gabapentin and nortriptyline between combination
and monotherapy were not signifi cant, which could be
due to increased pharmacokinetic variability and the
small magnitude of diff erences.
Combination treatment was superior to nortriptyline,
but not gabapentin, for improvements in mood
interference and Beck depression inventory scores;
improvements on gabapentin were higher than on
nortriptyline although the diff erence was not signifi cant.
The result seems puzzling since an antidepressant
would be expected to improve mood more than an
anticonvulsant would, but depressed patients were
excluded from our study, and nortriptyline doses were
well below those used to treat depression.11 The
possibility that treatment-related mood changes are a
secondary eff ect of pain improvement fails to explain
these results since lower pain scores were recorded for
nortriptyline than gabapentin. Of previous chronic pain
trials comparing gabapentin with a tricyclic
antidepressant, the only one which included mood
outcome measures reported no diff erence between
treatments.35 Notably, Beck depression inventory and
mood interference scores from the brief pain inventory
in our previous trial with combined morphine and
gabapentin also showed reduced mood interference
with gabapentin, despite lower pain scores with
morphine.9
 These fi ndings suggest that gabapentin has
a mild mood elevating eff ect independent of analgesia,
which is an eff ect also reported in patients with
epilepsy.36 Therefore, combination of gabapentin with
nortriptyline can improve mood compared with
nortriptyline alone.
As might be expected in a real-world pragmatic trial, a
subset of patients (27–32%) were receiving a tricyclic
antidepressant, or gabapentin or pregabalin at some
point before enrolment. This subgroup was heterogeneous
with respect to drug taken, simultaneous receipt of both
antidepressant and anticonvulsant drug classes before
the start of the study, method of dose titration (done by
their physician before the trial), magnitude of response
to the drug, and timing of discontinuation before start of
the trial. However, previous experience with these drug
classes could have aff ected treatment response during
the trial, thus introducing an element of partial
enrichment.
The design of our trial includes a direct head-to-head
comparison of each monotherapy. This provides
important additional information since the merits of
diff erent treatments are generally compared with the use
of numbers needed to treat which have several limitations.8
In this respect, in addition to mood diff erences mentioned
previously, we noted that the effi cacy of nortriptyline and
gabapentin were statistically similar with respect to pain,
dry mouth occurred signifi cantly more frequently with
nortriptyline, and weight gain was greater with
gabapentin. Overall, these fi ndings are consistent with
those reported in previous trials comparing a tricyclic
antidepressant to gabapentin.24,35,37
In view of the potential benefi ts and drawbacks of any
given drug combination, continued research is needed
to develop the evidence base for rational combination
treatment in neuropathic pain and other neuropathic
disorders. Furthermore, no data are available to guide
the choice of sequential versus simultaneous
combination treatment and innovative trial designs are
needed to address this issue. Although development of
more eff ective and better tolerated monotherapies is
much anticipated, our fi ndings suggest that drug
combinations represent the most eff ective strategy for
many patients with neuropathic pain. On the basis of
our results, we recommend combined gabapentin and
nortriptyline for patients who have a partial response to
either drug alone and seek additional pain relief.
