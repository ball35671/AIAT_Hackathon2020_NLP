Gabapentin and Venlafaxine for the
Treatment of Painful Diabetic Neuropathy
David A. Simpson, DO
Abstract
Objective: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of gabapentin and venlafaxine in the treatment of painful diabetic
neuropathy in patients whose pain did not improve with gabapentin monotherapy.
Methods: (1) A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 8-week clinical trial comparing gabapentin
versus placebo to define a patient population whose pain did not improve with monotherapy; (2) a second
8-week trial comparing gabapentin plus venlafaxine with gabapentin plus placebo; (3) a third uncontrolled
8-week trial of patients who did not improve on gabapentin monotherapy and then received venlafaxine in
addition to gabapentin.
Results: (1) Gabapentin-treated patients showed statistically significant improvement in pain reduction as well
as improvement in quality of life and mood disturbance when compared with placebo-treated patients; (2)
patients who received gabapentin plus venlafaxine showed significant improvement in pain reduction, mood
disturbance, and quality of life when compared with patients treated with gabapentin plus placebo; (3)
patients who received gabapentin plus venlafaxine showed significant improvement in pain reduction, mood
disturbance, and quality of life.
Conclusions: (1) Gabapentin is efficacious in the treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy; (2) and (3) in
patients who do not respond to gabapentin monotherapy, the addition of venlafaxine is also efficacious.

Pain from acutely painful diabetic neuropathy is frequently
difficult to control and is often complicated by sleep disturbance and secondary depression. Tricyclic antidepressants, especially amitriptyline, have proven partially effective in relieving neuropathic pain. Within the last decade,
however, anticonvulsants have become the focus of increased attention in treating neuropathic pain.
A large multicenter trial conducted in 1996–1997 and
reported in 1998 by Backonja et al. demonstrated the efficacy and safety of gabapentin in reducing pain attributed
to the peripheral neuropathy of diabetes.1 Statistically significant scores were noted on both the primary efficacy
measures as well as numerous secondary outcome measures
of pain for those patients treated with gabapentin versus
those receiving placebo. Approximately 60% of patients
receiving gabapentin noted at least a moderate improvement on the Patient Global Impression of Change
(PGIC).1
The present study was undertaken in an effort to determine if those patients who did not improve with gabapentin monotherapy would improve with the addition of a
second drug. Venlafaxine was used because it has been
shown to be a potent inhibitor of neuronal serotonin and
norepinephrine reuptake as well as a weak inhibitor of
dopamine reuptake, all important in pain control.
Following the protocol outlined in the Backonja et al.
study,1 this study was conducted initially in two parts: (1)
gabapentin monotherapy versus placebo and (2) gabapentin with venlafaxine versus gabapentin with placebo. Based
on the encouraging results of part 2, a third uncontrolled
trial of patients was undertaken using gabapentin plus
venlafaxine.
Methods—Part 1 of Study
Study Population
At screening, eligible patients had pain attributed to diabetic neuropathy for 3 months to 1.5 years, a diagnosis of
diabetes mellitus from 6 months to 17 years, a pain score
of at least 40 mm on the 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS)
of the Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ),
and an average score of 4 on an 11-point Likert scale in
daily pain diaries over the next week.

Exclusion criteria included severe pain other than that
attributed to diabetic neuropathy, amputations other than
toes, and renal failure with a creatinine clearance of less
than 60 mL/min. The following medications taken within
30 days before screening precluded patients’ inclusion in
the study: tricyclic antidepressants, mexiletine, carbamazepine, phenytoin, valproate, dextromethorphan, opioids,
capsaicin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, skeletal
muscle relaxants, benzodiazepines, and over-the-counter
centrally acting agents. These drugs were likewise prohibited during the trial.
Study Design
This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
study consisting of two phases, a 7-day screening phase and
an 8-week double-blind phase with titration of either gabapentin or placebo over 4 weeks followed by a 4-week
fixed-dose period.
Screening Phase
Informed consent was obtained at the first visit. A physical
and neurologic examination was performed, as well as laboratory evaluation including an Hb AlC and 24-hour urine
for creatinine clearance. Patients meeting inclusion criteria
were instructed on completing daily pain and sleep diaries
that were reviewed at the end of that week. A second
SF-MPQ was completed at the end of the screening phase.
Randomization
Sixty patients who remained eligible for the study were
randomized in a double-blind fashion, 30 to receive gabapentin and 30 to receive placebo. Patients filled out a
Short-Form-36 Quality of Life (SF-36 QOL) Questionnaire and Profile of Mood States (POMS).
Double-Blind Treatment Phase
Titration Period
During the first 4 weeks, gabapentin or placebo in white
gelatin capsules were titrated as follows: week 1, 300 mg
per day for 2 days, 300 mg twice per day for 2 days, then
300 mg three times per day for 3 days; week 2, 300 mg
2-1-1 for 1 day, 300 mg 2-2-1 for 1 day, then 300 mg
2-2-2 for 5 days; week 3, 300 mg 3-2-2 for 1 day, 300 mg
3-3-2 for 1 day, then 300 mg 3-3-3 for 5 days; week 4, 300
mg 4-3-3 for 1 day, 300 mg 4-4-3 for 1 day, then maintained at 300 mg 4-4-4. If adverse effects were experienced,
the dosage was decreased by one increment to 900, 1800,
or 2700 mg per day. Patients completed the SF-MPQ at
weeks 2 and 4.
Fixed-Dose Period
Patients remained at their maximum tolerated dosages and
daily diaries were continued. At study end (week 8), the
SF-MPQ, SF-36 QOL Questionnaire, and POMS were
completed. The daily pain and sleep interference diaries
were turned in. Patient Global Impression of Change
(PGIC) and Clinical Global Impression of Change
(CGIC) were also completed.
Efficacy and Safety Measurements
The primary efficacy parameter was a pain severity rating,
using an 11-point Likert scale (0, no pain; 10, worst possible pain), which patients had recorded on a daily basis.
Mean pain scores from the screening phase and at study
end were compared and statistically analyzed.
Secondary efficacy parameters included sleep interference scores, PGIC, CGIC, POMS, and the SF-36 QOL
questionnaire. Sleep interference was also rated on an
11-point Likert scale (0, did not interfere, 10, unable to
sleep). The PGIC and CGIC were based on a 7-point
scale in which overall status was described as much improved, minimally improved/no change, or worsened.
POMS included measures of mood: tension/anxiety,
depression/dejection, anger/hostility, vigor/activity,
fatigue/inertia, confusion/bewilderment, and total mood
disturbance. SF-36 QOL measured eight health concepts:
physical functioning, role limitations due to physical problems, social functioning, bodily pain, general mental
health, role limitations due to emotional problems, vitality,
and general health problems.
All patients randomized to treatment were monitored
for safety. The incidence of dizziness, somnolence, headache, diarrhea, confusion, and nausea were examined in
both groups.

Methods—Part 2 of Study
Study Population
There were 12 patients from the gabapentin-treated group
in part 1 of the study who had minimal improvement/no
change or worse as determined by the PGIC and CGIC.
One patient chose not to continue in the study at this
point for unspecified reasons.
Study Design
This was a randomized, double-blind study composed of a
3-week titration period followed by a 5-week fixed-dose
period.
Randomization
Patients were randomized in a double-blind fashion to receive gabapentin and venlafaxine or gabapentin and placebo. Of the 11 patients randomized, 6 were randomized
to gabapentin and venlafaxine and 5 to gabapentin and
placebo. The patients filled out a SF-36 QOL Questionnaire and POMS, and received their blinded medication
and additional diaries.
Double-Blind Treatment Phase
Titration Period
During the first 3 weeks of the study, 6 patients received
the maximum tolerated dosages of gabapentin as taken
in part 1 of the study and titrating doses of venlafaxine
over 3 weeks (week 1, 37.5 mg slow release per day; week
2, 37.5 mg extended release twice per day; week 3, 75 mg
extended release twice per day). The other 5 patients
received gabapentin at their maximum tolerated dosages
as taken in part 1 of the study and titrating doses of placebo over 3 weeks. Venlafaxine and placebo were supplied
in identical white capsules. Daily pain and sleep interference diaries were maintained. POMS and QOL questionnaire were completed before the treatment and titration
phase.
Fixed-Dose Period
During the next 5 weeks, treatment remained at maximum
tolerated dosages and daily diaries were continued. At
study end (week 8) or on early termination, the SF-MPQ,
SF-36 QOL Questionnaire, and POMS were completed.
Patients turned in their daily pain and sleep interference
diaries and completed the PGIC. The clinician completed
the CGIC.
Efficacy and safety measurements were as outlined in
part 1 of the study.

Methods—Part 3 of Study
Study Population
Forty-two additional patients who failed to improve on
maximum tolerated doses of gabapentin were considered
for treatment with venlafaxine.
Study Design
This was an uncontrolled study consisting of three phases.
A 4-week titration of gabapentin to maximum tolerated
dose, as outlined in part 1 of the study, was followed by a
3-week titration of venlafaxine, and then followed by a
5-week fixed-dose period. Venlafaxine was added to the
maximum tolerated dose of gabapentin and titrated over 3
weeks from 37.5 mg per day in week 1, 37.5 mg twice per
day in week 2, and 75 mg twice per day in week 3. Over
the next 5 weeks, the maximum dose of venlafaxine was
maintained. If adverse effects were experienced, venlafaxine
was decreased one increment to 37.5 mg twice per day or
37.5 mg per day.

Efficacy and safety measures were as outlined in part 1 of
the study.
Results—Part 1 of Study
Patient demographics and baseline characteristics were
similar between the two groups (Table 1). The mean pain
score at baseline was similar between the two treatment
groups (Table 2).
Efficacy
The difference in mean pain score at end point was significantly greater in the gabapentin-treated group compared with the placebo-treated group (−2.4 in the gabapentin group vs. −0.5 in the placebo group; Table 2; Fig. 1).
Change in mean sleep interference scores, SF-McGill
total pain scores, SF-McGill Present Pain Intensity (PPI),
and SF-VAS also revealed significant improvement in the
gabapentin-treated group. PGIC and CGIC revealed
55.5% (n  15) much/moderately improved in the
gabapentin-treated group compared with 25.9% (n  7)
in the placebo group; 41% (n  11) minimally
improved/no change in the gabapentin group compared
with 59.3% (n  16) in the placebo group; and 3.5%
(n  1) worse in the gabapentin-treated group compared
with 14.8% (n  4) in the placebo-treated group (Fig. 2).
POMS and SF-36 QOL Questionnaire revealed statistically significant improvement in the gabapentin-treated
group (Figs. 3 and 4).
Safety
Ninety percent of patients in both groups completed the
study. Premature discontinuation (n  3; 10%) occurred
in each group. Treatment failure resulted in withdrawal of
one patient from each group (3.3%), and adverse events
caused withdrawal of two patients from each group
(6.6%). Adverse effects consisted of dizziness, somnolence,

Efficacy
The difference in mean pain score was −2.0 in the
gabapentin- and venlafaxine-treated group and −0.5 in the
gabapentin- and placebo-treated group (Table 4;
Fig. 5).
Change in sleep interference scores, SF-McGill total
pain scores, SF-McGill PPI, and SF-McGill VAS also revealed significant improvement in the gabapentin- and
venlafaxine-treated group. PGIC and CGIC revealed 3
patients (75%) much/moderately improved in the
gabapentin- and venlafaxine-treated group compared with
1 patient (33.3%) in the gabapentin- and placebo-treated
group; 1 patient (25%) had minimal/no improvement in
the gabapentin- and venlafaxine-treated group compared
with 2 (66.6%) in the gabapentin- and placebo-treated
group; no patients in either group reported worsening (Fig.
6). POMS and SF-36 QOL revealed statistically significant
improvement in the gabapentin- and venlafaxine-treated
group (Figs. 7 and 8).

Safety
Four patients (66.7%) in the gabapentin- and
venlafaxine-treated group and 3 patients (60%) in the
gabapentin- and placebo-treated group completed the
study. One patient (8.3%) in the gabapentin- and
venlafaxine-treated group and 2 patients (16.7%) in
the gabapentin- and placebo-treated group reported
treatment failure and withdrew from the study. Premature
discontinuation by one patient in the gabapentin- and
venlafaxine-treated group was reported because of adverse
reaction. No patients in the gabapentin- and placebotreated group withdrew because of adverse reaction. Adverse effects were similar in the two groups, and included
dizziness, somnolence, headache, diarrhea, confusion, and
nausea (Table 5).
Results—Part 3 of Study
Efficacy
The final mean pain score declined 2.1 from the baseline
mean (Table 6; Fig. 9).
Sleep interference scores, SF-McGill total pain scores,
SF-McGill PPI, and SF-McGill VAS were also significantly improved comparing baseline with study end at
week 8. PGIC and CGIC revealed 29 patients (75%)
much/moderately improved, 8 patients (21%) had minimal improvement, and 1 patient (2%) reported worsening
(Fig. 10). POMS and SF-36 QOL revealed significant
improvement comparing baseline with study end (Figs. 11
and 12).

Safety
Ninety percent of the patients enrolled in part 3 of the
study completed the 8-week trial. One patient (2.4%)
withdrew secondary to treatment failure, and 3 patients
(7.2%) withdrew secondary to adverse events which included dizziness, somnolence, headache, diarrhea, confusion, and nausea (Table 7).
Discussion
The ideal treatment for painful peripheral diabetic neuropathy has yet to be found. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)
have long been used to treat neuropathic pain, but only
50% of patients respond to such treatment.2–6 The effectiveness of TCAs, however, is often limited by sedation,
confusion, constipation, urinary retention, seizures, postural hypotension, and arrhythmias, especially in elderly
patients. Because of these efficacy and safety issues, a search
for alternative medications has led in the last decade to the
use of anticonvulsants as monotherapy as well as in combination with TCAs.7–9
Gabapentin is one anticonvulsant that has shown effectiveness in the present and previous studies.1,10–12 When
used as monotherapy, like in part 1 of the present study
and the most recent study,1 it is statistically superior to
placebo in the reduction of pain. Secondary outcome measures of pain relief and sleep interference also demonstrate
significant improvement. The onset of improvement is alFig. 12. Patients treated with gabapentin
and venlafaxine reported improvement in
bodily pain, mental health, and vitality on
the SF-36 Quality of Life.

total mood disturbance scores were significantly lower in patients receiving gabapentin and venlafaxine. Scores in vigor/activity

ready evident by week 2 of treatment and statistically significant by the end of these studies. The side effect profile
makes gabapentin a favorable choice, because only 10% of
patients in the present study and 17% in the previous
study1 withdrew secondary to treatment failure or adverse
effects. These side effects include dizziness and somnolence
which occurred at higher doses.
Although gabapentin monotherapy produced rapid onset of improvement clinically in a high percentage of patients (55.5%), still a significant number of patients had
only minimal to no reduction in pain. Part 2 of the study
was therefore carried out to determine whether the addition of venlafaxine would be of benefit to these patients.
Venlafaxine, a structurally novel antidepressant, is
chemically unrelated to tricyclic antidepressants.13 Its
mechanism of action is thought to be associated with its
potentiation of neurotransmitter release in the central nervous system. Preclinical studies have shown that venlafaxine and its active metabolite, O-desmethylvenlafaxine, are
potent inhibitors of neuronal serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake and weak inhibitors of dopamine reuptake.
In vitro studies have shown no significant activity for muscarinic, cholinergic, H1-histaminergic, or alpha-1 adrenergic receptors.
In part 2 of the present study, gabapentin and venlafaxine proved to be statistically superior to gabapentin and
placebo in reducing pain and improving secondary outcome measures. Part 3 of the study gave similar results in
a larger uncontrolled population of patients. The magnitude of pain relief was evident by week 2 and statistically
significant by study end, suggesting a rapid onset of action
of both medications. Improvement in quality of life and
mood disturbance was also more significant in the
gabapentin- and venlafaxine-treated groups.
The combination of medications is well tolerated, although adverse effects of dizziness, somnolence, and nausea
were slightly more frequent in the gabapentin monotherapy groups (parts 1 and 2). With 75% of patients in
the larger uncontrolled trial of part 3 reporting significant
improvement in pain relief, this combination of medications proved to be an effective treatment protocol.
For the remaining 25% of patients not responding to
gabapentin and venlafaxine, further controlled trials are
required to find alternative medications and combinations
of medications to treat neuropathic pain in association
with diabetic peripheral neuropathy.
