1. Introduction
Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is among the most
common long-term complications of diabetes mellitus,
affecting between 20% and 50% of all patients. The pain due
to DPN can affect the feet and ankles, the lower extremities
above the knees, and the upper extremities. If inadequately
treated the pain can be severe, and is frequently associated
with mood and sleep disturbances [1,2].
Improved glycemic control is the most important factor in
modifying the onset and progression of diabetic neuropathy

Aims: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted in 147 patients
to determine the efficacy and safety of a gastroretentive formulation of gabapentin (G-GR) in
treating painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN).
Methods: Diabetic patients with symmetrical painful symptoms in distal extremities for 1–5
years and a baseline average daily pain (ADP) score of 4 received G-GR 3000 mg, as a single
evening daily dose (G-GR-QD) or a divided dose (G-GR-DD, 1200 mg AM/1800 mg PM), or
placebo for 4 weeks. G-GR was titrated from 300 to 3000 mg/day over 2 weeks, followed by 2
additional weeks at 3000 mg/day. Efficacy measures included changes from baseline to
Week 4 in ADP score and average daily sleep interference score (SIS).
Results: A significantly larger decrease in ADP score was observed in the G-GR-QD dose
group compared with placebo (2.50 versus 1.30; p = 0.002). A 50% reduction in ADP score
was achieved in 34.8% of G-GR-QD recipients compared with 7.8% of placebo recipients
( p = 0.001). Similar results were observed for changes in SIS. The incidences of dizziness and
somnolence, commonly associated with gabapentin, were low.
Conclusions: Once-daily G-GR was effective and well tolerated for the treatment of pain due
to DPN.

[3]. Various medications (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants, anticonvulsants, opioids, and lidocaine) have been used to treat
painful DPN [4–6]. The anticonvulsant drugs gabapentin and
pregabalin have also demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in
patients with painful DPN. While gabapentin and pregabalin
have a more favorable adverse event profile than the tricyclic
antidepressants, they also have a relatively high incidence of
somnolence and dizziness at efficacious doses for the
treatment of painful DPN [7–11].
The current study examines a gastroretentive formulation
of gabapentin (G-GR) for the treatment of painful DPN. G-GR
employs a polymer based technology [12,13] allowing the
tablets to swell to a size that promotes gastric retention in the
fed state while gradually releasing the drug over approximately 10 h to the upper gastrointestinal tract where
gabapentin is best absorbed [14]. This slow release of drug
attenuates the saturation of the transport mechanism of
gabapentin which is responsible for the lack of dose
proportionality observed with gabapentin [14]. This enables
the drug to be administered once- or twice daily while
providing equivalent or improved bioavailability compared
to immediate release (IR) gabapentin administered three or
more times daily [15,16].
The study involved administering 3000 mg of G-GR as
either a single dose (QD) with the evening meal or as an
asymmetric divided dosing (DD) regimen with the larger dose
given in the evening (1800 mg PM; 1200 mg AM). It was
hypothesized that this would provide maximum pain relief at
night, when it is most needed, and that the commonly
observed adverse events (AEs) of dizziness and somnolence
would be less burdensome as the highest plasma concentrations would occur in the late evening or when the patient
is asleep.
2. Research design and methods
This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
fixed-dose, multicenter clinical trial conducted at 24 United
States sites between March and November of 2006 (Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT00712439). The protocol was approved
by a central institutional review board, and the study was
conducted in accordance with the International Conference
on Harmonization Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice.
Written informed consent was obtained from each patient
or a legal representative prior to undergoing any study-related
procedures.
2.1. Patients
The trial enrolled male and female patients 18 years of age,
with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, who had reported symmetrical
painful symptoms attributable to sensorimotor DPN in distal
extremities for 1–5 years prior to enrollment. Key inclusion
criteria were an average daily pain (ADP) score  4 on a 0 (no
pain)to 10 (worst possible pain) numerical rating scale (NRS) at
screening and baseline, a stable regimen of antidiabetic
medication prior to enrollment, hemoglobin A1C  11%,
fasting plasma glucose  310 mg/dL, and creatinine clearance  60 mL/min at screening. A negative urine pregnancy test
at screening and randomization, and use of a medically
acceptable method of birth control were required from all
female patients of childbearing potential. For ethical reasons,
patients were excluded from the study if they had previously
not responded to gabapentin doses  1200 mg/day, had
experienced dose-limiting AEs, or were hypersensitive to
gabapentin. Patients who were immunocompromised, or who
had hepatic or renal insufficiency, significant hematological
disease, severe pain from causes other than DPN, gastrointestinal disease or symptoms, or clinically significant abnormal
laboratory results were also excluded.
Patients taking stable doses of the following medications
for 30 days prior to screening were allowed to continue the
medications without change during the study: selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); tricyclic antidepressants; acetaminophen up to 4 g/day; non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) including cyclo-oxygenase
2 (COX-2) inhibitors; and aspirin for myocardial infarction or
transient ischemic attack prophylaxis up to 325 mg/day.
Patients were required to undergo washout of at least 5 times
the half-life of other pain medications, including benzodiazepines, skeletal muscle relaxants, oral steroids, capsaicin,
mexiletine, centrally acting analgesics, opiates, topical
lidocaine, anticonvulsants, and serotonin-norepinephrine
re-uptake inhibitors.
2.2. Study design
Following screening and washout of other pain medications,
patients who met the required ADP score of 4 on the NRS
during a 1-week baseline period were randomly assigned in a
1:1:1 ratio to treatment with G-GR-QD, 3000 mg as a single PM
dose, G-GR-DD as an asymmetric divided dose (1200 mg AM
and 1800 mg PM), or placebo. Patients were titrated from
300 mg/day to 3000 mg/day over 2 weeks, remained at
3000 mg/day for an additional 2 weeks, and then were tapered
off of G-GR over a 1-week period. All patients received an
appropriate combination of active and placebo tablets to
achieve the required dosing and maintain the study blind. All
tablets were taken with a meal (not specified).
Patients were evaluated at: screening, the end of the
baseline week, the end of Weeks 2 and 4 of treatment, and
the end of the study. ADP scores and daily sleep interference
scores (SISs) rated for the previous 24 h using the NRS were
recorded each morning using an electronic diary (DiaryPRO,
invivodata, Pittsburgh, PA) from the beginning of the baseline
week to the end of the efficacy treatment period (Week 4). The
NRS is an 11-point scale (0–10) with 0 indicating ‘‘no pain’’ or
‘‘pain does not interfere with sleep’’ and 10 indicating ‘‘worst
possible pain’’ or ‘‘pain completely interferes with sleep’’ for
ADP and SIS, respectively [17]. The patient global impression of
change (PGIC) and the clinical global impression of change
(CGIC) were completed at the end of Week 4 [17,18].
The primary efficacy endpoint was the change in least
square (LS) mean ADP score from baseline to Week 4.
Secondary efficacy variables included the percent change in
ADP score from baseline to Week 4, the proportion of
responders (patients with at least 50% decrease in pain score
from baseline to Week 4), changes from baseline to Week 4 in
average daily SIS, and Week 4 assessment of CGIC and PGIC.

Adverse events were recorded throughout the study.
2.3. Statistical analysis
The primary null hypothesis tested in this study was that there
was no treatment difference in the LS mean change in the
baseline observation carried forward (BOCF) ADP score from
baseline week to Week 4 between each G-GR treatment group
and the placebo group. Assuming a 90% study completion rate
and a significance level of a = 0.025 for two pairwise comparisons (primary endpoint), it was determined that a sample size
of 150 patients (50 per treatment arm) would have 80% power
to detect a difference of 0.8 in the LS mean change in ADP
score from baseline to Week 4 between each G-GR group and
the placebo group. For analysis of demographics and baseline
characteristics, data were pooled for all study centers, a oneway analysis of variance (ANOVA) model including the
treatment factor was used to analyze the numeric data and
the Fisher’s exact test was used to analyze the categorical data.
Efficacy analyses were performed on the intent-to-treat
(ITT) population (all randomized patients who received study
medication). The BOCF or last observation carried forward
(LOCF) methods were used to impute missing data. For the
primary efficacy outcome the LS mean baseline values were
estimated from an ANOVA model that included treatment and
center, and treatment by center interaction factors. For the
Week 4 ADP score and the change in ADP score from baseline
to Week 4 an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) parallel
lines model that included treatment and center factors, and
baseline ADP score as covariates was used. Calculations
included the LS estimate ofthe mean change in ADP score with
each treatment and its 95% confidence interval (CI) as well as a
95% CI of the pairwise difference between each treatment
group and placebo (treatment minus placebo) for the mean
change in ADP score.
For analyses of the change in daily SIS, the same procedure
as outlined above for the primary endpoint was used. When a
review of the data suggested a gender-related difference in
pain response, a post hoc ANCOVA analysis on the primary
endpoint data was conducted which included treatment and
gender factors, and baseline values as a covariate.
For the analysis of the proportion of responders, the
Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel test stratified by the baseline pain
score category (ADP score < 8 versus 8) was used for the
overall comparison. For the analysis of ordinal categorical data
(CGIC and PGIC), a two-sided Fisher’s exact test was used to
test the difference in the proportion of patients feeling
‘‘much’’ or ‘‘very much improved’’ with the CGIC and PGIC
between each G-GR treatment group and placebo. The
statistical tests for the analysis of the primary efficacy
parameter were performed at the a = 0.025 significance level
due to two pairwise comparisons between each G-GR
treatment groups and the placebo group. The statistical tests
used for the analysis of baseline variables and secondary
efficacy parameters were performed at the a = 0.05 significance level. All tests were two-sided.
The safety population included all patients who received at
least one dose of study medication. Adverse events (AEs) were
coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities
(MedDRA; Version 9.0). The number and percentage of patients
reporting one or more AEs were categorized by AE preferred
term and AE system organ class and summarized by treatment
group.
3. Results
A total of 182 patients were screened; 35 withdrew during the
baseline period. Thus, 147 patients were randomized, received
study drug, and were included in the ITT and safety
populations (Fig. 1). Nine patients (6.1%) (n = 4 in the G-GRQD group; n = 3 in the G-GR-DD group; and n = 2 in the placebo
group) prematurely discontinued study medication due to:
adverse events (6 patients; n = 2 in each treatment group),
protocol violation (n = 1 in G-GR-DD group), and withdrawal of
consent (n = 2 in G-GR-QD group). The AEs leading to
discontinuation of study medication (blurred vision, dizziness,
headache, somnolence, and tremor in the G-GR-QD group;
dizziness and hypoesthesia in the G-GR-DD group; fall,
muscular weakness, and urinary incontinence in the placebo
group) were mild or moderate in severity, and resolved
without additional treatment.
Additionally, four patients received non-randomized treatment. For the efficacy evaluation they were included in the
group in which they were originally randomized to, while for
the safety evaluation they were assigned to actual medication
received (Fig. 1).
Characteristics of the study population are presented in
Table 1. Most patients (92.2–97.8%) were diagnosed with type 2
diabetes. Demographics and baseline characteristics were
similar between treatment groups except that there were
approximately twice as many female patients in the G-GR-QD
group compared to the G-GR-DD and placebo groups.
3.1. Efficacy
The primary BOCF LS mean change in ADP score from baseline
to Week 4 demonstrated that G-GR-QD was significantly more
effective than placebo ( p = 0.002) (Table 2). In contrast, G-GRDD was not superior to placebo. Upon further examination of
the study data, male patients, in general, reported smaller
changes in ADP scores than female patients. This was noted in
both the G-GR groups and the placebo group. Given the
difference in response between males and females and the
fact that the G-GR-QD group had a higher proportion of female
patients (63% versus 36% for the G-GR-DD group and 37% for
the placebo group), post hoc analyses using a gender-stratified
ANCOVA model were performed to investigate whether this
gender imbalance had influenced the results. The results of
the gender-stratified analysis were similar to the primary
analysis (Table 2).
Change in BOCF LS average daily SIS from baseline to Week
4 demonstrated that the G-GR-QD group was significantly
more effective than placebo ( p = 0.010), while the G-GR-DD
group was not ( p = 0.146) (Table 2). LOCF analyses of these
endpoints yielded similar results (Table 2).
At each week, the LS mean change in ADP score (Fig. 2A)
and the LS mean change in average daily SIS (Fig. 2B) were
significantly different from placebo for the G-GR-QD group but
not for G-GR-DD group.

Significantly more patients in both G-GR groups had atleast
a 50% decrease in pain score (responders) than in the placebo
group for both BOCF ( p = 0.001 and p = 0.015 for G-GR-QD and
G-GR-DD groups, respectively, versus placebo) and LOCF
( p < 0.001 and p = 0.024 for G-GR-QD and G-GR-DD groups,
respectively, versus placebo) (Table 2).
A significantly higher proportion of patients rated themselves as very much or much improved at Week 4 on the PGIC
in both G-GR groups (55.3%, p = 0.049 in the QD group; 67.4%,
p = 0.001 in the DD group) compared to the placebo group
(34.0%) (Table 2);this finding, however, was not replicated with
the CGIC (Table 2).
3.2. Safety
A summary of AEs is presented in Table 3. Dizziness,
somnolence, nausea, and headache were the most frequent
AEs in both G-GR groups (Table 3). There were no serious AEs
among patients receiving G-GR. A myocardial infarction SAE
was reported in a placebo patient. This SAE was assessed as
severe, not related to study drug, and was resolved. No deaths
occurred during the study.
4. Discussion
The results of this randomized, placebo-controlled trial
demonstrate that gastroretentive gabapentin tablets,
3000 mg/day taken once daily with the evening meal, were
significantly more effective than placebo in treating pain
associated with painful DPN. The 3000 mg/day dose of G-GR
used in this study was lower than the 3600 mg/day (1200 mg
TID) that was effective in a clinical trial of immediate release
(IR) gabapentin in painful DPN [7] and higher than the 2400 mg/
day (800 mg TID) of IR gabapentin that did not demonstrate a
significant difference from placebo for reduction in pain scores
in another study [8].
There were significant improvements in both pain and
sleep interference scores over the 4-week efficacy period in the
G-GR-QD group compared to the placebo group. At Week 4, the
mean change from baseline in ADP score in the G-GR-QD
group and the difference in change from baseline between
G-GR-QD and placebo were comparable to those reported in
other studies of IR gabapentin and pregabalin [7,9]. The
difference in the percentage of patients with a 50% or more
reduction from baseline between G-GR-QD and placebo was
also comparable to those reported for IR gabapentin and
placebo, and pregabalin and placebo [8,9]. The magnitude of
the reduction in sleep interference scores and the difference
from placebo at the end of the study were similar to that
observed in a study where IR gabapentin was administered at
1200 mg TID as were the proportions of patients rated much or
very much improved on the PGIC and CGIC [7]. Gabapentin GR
3000 mg QD achieved a significant reduction in pain as well
as sleep interference scores as early as the first week of
treatment.
The administration of the divided dose of G-GR was less
effective than that of the single dose and although the
decrease in reduction of pain and sleep interference scores
were numerically larger than placebo, they were not significantly different. The reasons for this are not readily apparent.
Three previous studies investigated single or divided doses of
1800 mg of G-GR in postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) patients. The
first (4-week) study [19] showed better efficacy with the
divided dose (600 mg AM, 1200 mg PM). However, this was not
confirmed in a, longer (10-week) study which showed greater
efficacy of G-GR given as a single dose versus a divided dose
[20]. Since pain due DPN increases throughout the day and
usually reaches a peak in the evening [21,22] taking the full
dose of G-GR once daily with the evening meal results in peak
gabapentin concentrations when pain may be the greatest.
This may ameliorate the evening pain and allow the patients
to have a better night’s sleep.
The significantly higher female to male ratio in the G-GRQD group versus the G-GR-DD and placebo groups may have
influenced both pain perception and response to the medication [23–25]. However, when a gender factor was included in
the ANCOVA, the change of ADP scores for the G-GR-QD group
was still significantly different from placebo, while for the
G-GR-DD group, it was not.
The apparent difference in effectiveness of G-GR reported
with the PGIC versus the CGIC scales may result in part from
perception variations between patients and clinicians. Additionally, a higher percentage of patients and clinicians rated
the G-GR-DD better than the G-GR-QD. The reason for this
disparity from the pain and sleep interference scores where
G-GR-QD, but not G-GR-DD, was significantly improved
compared to placebo is not readily apparent.
Gabapentin GR was well tolerated at 3000 mg/day, even
with a rapid titration schedule, with 94% of patients completing the 4-week treatment period and only 6 patients (4%)
discontinuing due to an adverse event. The overall types of
AEs were as expected for gabapentin and this patient
population. The incidence of AEs typically increases with
increasing doses of IR gabapentin and may prevent titration of
drug to an effective dose. In a controlled clinical study of IR
gabapentin only 67% patients with DPN achieved the target
dose of 3600 mg/day [7] and 8% withdrew due to AEs. In the

current study, greater than 90% achieved the target dose and
only 2 patients (4%) in each G-GR treatment and placebo group
discontinued due to AEs.
The gradual release of gabapentin over 8–10 h along with
the evening dosing of G-GR may have contributed to the
reduced incidence of somnolence and dizziness in this study.
The peak plasma levels of gabapentin occur about 8 h after
dosing with dinner [15] when the patient is likely to be asleep.
Additionally, during the day when the patient needs to be
active and pain scores are lower [21] the lower gabapentin
plasma levels may be less likely to cause dizziness and/or
somnolence.
This study has several limitations. The short, 4-week
duration of treatment with only 2 weeks at full dose may have
been insufficient to demonstrate a persistent beneficial effect
on pain and to observe any additional side effects from G-GR.
Both gabapentin and pregabalin are associated with peripheral edema with longer use. The exclusion of patients if they had
previously not responded to treatment with gabapentin at
doses of 1200 mg/day or pregabalin at doses  300 mg/day or
had experienced dose-limiting adverse effects with gabapentin is a limitation that should be considered when interpreting
the results. While this exclusion criterion may have enriched
the study population, that was not the intent as it would be
unethical to require a patient to enroll in a 4-week study
investigating a gastroretentive formulation of gabapentin if
they had previously not been able to tolerate gabapentin or
previously had not been able to obtain pain relief with
gabapentin or pregabalin. The pregabalin DPN clinical trials
also excluded patients if they had previously not responded to
treatment with gabapentin at doses of 1200 mg/day [9–11].
In conclusion, the results of this study indicate that once
daily dosing of gastroretentive gabapentin at 3000 mg/day is
effective and well-tolerated for the treatment of painful DPN.
