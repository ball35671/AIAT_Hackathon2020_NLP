Abstract
A double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled 8-week study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of gabapentin in the
treatment of neuropathic pain, using doses up to 2400 mg/day. The study used a novel design that was symptom- rather than syndrome-based;
an approach that aimed to reflect the realities of clinical practice. Participants had a wide range of neuropathic pain syndromes, with at least
two of the following symptoms: allodynia, burning pain, shooting pain, or hyperalgesia. Patients were randomised to gabapentin ðn ¼ 153Þ or
placebo ðn ¼ 152Þ. Gabapentin was given in three divided doses, initially titrated to 900 mg/day over 3 days, followed by two further
increases, to a maximum of 2400 mg/day if required by the end of week 5. The primary outcome measure was changed in average daily pain
diary score (baseline versus final week). Over the 8 week study, this score decreased (i.e. improved) by 1.5 (21%) in gabapentin treated
patients and by 1.0 (14%) in placebo treated patients (P ¼ 0:048, rank-based analysis of covariance). Significant differences were shown in
favour of gabapentin ðP , 0:05Þ for the Clinician and Patient Global Impression of Change, and some domains of the Short Form-McGill
Pain Questionnaire. Improvements were also shown in patient-reported outcomes in quality of life, as seen by significant differences in
favour of gabapentin in several domains of the Short-Form-36 Health Survey. Gabapentin was well tolerated and the majority of patients
completed the study (79 versus 73% for placebo). The most common adverse events were mild to moderate dizziness and somnolence, most
of which were transient and occurred during the titration phase. This study shows that gabapentin reduces pain and improves some quality-oflife measures in patients with a wide range of neuropathic pain syndromes. q 2002 International Association for the Study of Pain. Published

1. Introduction
Neuropathic pain affects approximately 1% of the population of the UK, and is one of the most difficult types of
pain to treat (Karlsten and Gordh, 1997). It can arise from a
wide variety of causes, such as trauma, disease, infection, or
it may be idiopathic in origin. Common examples of neuropathic pain include diabetic neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), nerve root pain due to degenerative spine
disease, phantom limb pain following amputation, and
neuropathic pain subsequent to severe trauma or surgery.
Neuropathic pain is typically severe, slow to resolve, and
extremely distressing. Like other forms of chronic pain, it
can have a devastating impact on patients’ psychological
health, social functioning, and other aspects of healthrelated quality of life (Guerje et al., 1998).
Neuropathic pain usually responds poorly to the standard
treatments described in the World Health Organization’s
analgesics ladder, such as non-steroidal antiinflammatory
drugs (NSAIDs) and opioids (Karlsten and Gordh, 1997).
Antidepressants have been shown to be of benefit in diabetic
neuropathy, with the best effects achieved with tricyclic
antidepressants (TCAs) (McQuay and Moore, 1998).
However, the adverse events of TCAs are frequently severe
enough to lead to drug withdrawal (Karlsten and Gordh,
1997), and no antidepressant is currently licensed for the
treatment of neuropathic pain in the UK.
Antiepileptics have also demonstrated efficacy in some
types of neuropathic pain. Systematic reviews have reported
carbamazepine to be of significant benefit in trigeminal
neuralgia, diabetic neuropathy, and central neuropathic
pain (McQuay et al., 1995; Sindrup and Jensen, 1999). In
March 2000, the antiepileptic gabapentin became the first

agent to be licensed in the UK for the treatment of all neuropathic pain conditions, based on evidence from large randomised trials in two types of neuropathic pain: diabetic
neuropathy (Backonja et al., 1998) and PHN (Rowbotham
et al., 1998; Rice and Maton, 2001).
Case reports, pilot studies, and retrospective reviews also
suggest efficacy for gabapentin in a variety of neuropathic
pain syndromes (Wetzel and Connelly, 1997), including
trigeminal neuralgia (Sist et al., 1997; Carrazana and
Schachter, 1998; Valzania et al., 1998), complex regional
pain syndromes (CRPS, Mellick et al., 1995; Mellick and
Mellick, 1997), neuropathic pain associated with multiple
sclerosis (Houtchens et al., 1997; Samkoff et al., 1997;
Khan, 1998), neuropathic cancer pain (Caraceni et al.,
1999), and other types of neuropathic pain (Rosenberg et
al., 1997).
We conducted a randomised, double-blind, placebocontrolled study to examine the safety and efficacy of gabapentin at doses of up to 2400 mg/day in a wide range of
neuropathic pain syndromes. This study used a novel
approach in which the inclusion criteria were based on the
presence of specific symptoms, allowing patients with
diverse neuropathic pains to participate in the study. This
approach reflects not only the realities of clinical practice,
but also the recent trend towards defining neuropathic pain
in terms of common symptoms and mechanisms rather than
as a group of disparate syndromes (Woolf and Mannion,
1999).
2. Methods
2.1. Subjects
This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
parallel group, multicentre study in 35 hospital outpatient
pain clinics in the UK and Republic of Ireland was
conducted between June 1999 and February 2000.
The aim of patient recruitment was to reflect common
clinical conditions and practice in many chronic pain
clinics. Patients were male or female, aged at least 18
years, and of any race. All were required to have a definite
diagnosis of neuropathic pain, made and confirmed by an
experienced, practicing chronic pain specialist and based on
clinical grounds of history, examination, and appropriate
investigation of symptoms and signs expressed by the
patient. All investigators utilised the definitions of diagnostic criteria documented in the International Association for
the Study of Pain (IASP) Classification of Chronic Pain to
support their clinical judgement (Merskey and Bogduk,
1994). In addition to a definite diagnosis of neuropathic
pain, all subjects were required to have at least two of the
following non-specific symptoms, which are frequently seen
but are not diagnostic of different underlying mechanisms of
neuropathic pain: allodynia (pain from a non-noxious stimulus, e.g. touch), burning pain, shooting pain, or hyperalgesia
(increased sensitivity to a noxious stimulus). These symptoms could be associated with any neuropathic pain
syndrome, and were selected because two common signs
of nerve dysfunction are allodynia and hyperalgesia (Boureau et al., 1990; Galer and Jensen, 1997; Bennett, 2001;
Serra, 1999) and because patients commonly use ‘burning’
or ‘shooting’, or similar words, to describe their pain. Allodynia and hyperalgesia were demonstrated and explained to
the patient by physical examination and reinforced by a
written definition.
Patients had to complete at least 4 daily pain diaries
during the 7 days prior to randomisation, yielding an average score $4 out of 11 over this period. Women were
required to be non-pregnant (using barrier or hormonal
contraception where appropriate), non-lactating, postmenopausal, or surgically sterilised.
Exclusion criteria included: failure to respond to previous
treatment with gabapentin at $900 mg/day or failure to
respond to gabapentin at any dose level due to side effects;
known creatinine clearance #60 ml/min or known renal
impairment; clinically significant hepatic, respiratory,
haematological illnesses or unstable cardiovascular disease;
significant neurological or psychiatric disorders unrelated to
causes of neuropathic pain, which, in the opinion of the
investigator, might impair the assessment of pain; other
severe pain that might impair the assessment of neuropathic
pain; any other serious or unstable conditions that might
compromise participation in the study; illicit drug or alcohol
abuse within the past year.
2.2. Study design
Using a centrally held, computer generated randomisation list, patients were randomised sequentially to gabapentin or placebo in a 1:1 ratio, in block sizes of four.
Gabapentin and placebo were provided in the form of identical capsules.
The study included a 1-week baseline period, after which
patients randomised to gabapentin entered a 5-week titration
period, in which the initial dose for all patients was 900 mg/
day (titrated up over 3 days). Patients who did not show at
least 50% reduction in overall pain were increased to
1800 mg/day, and again, where necessary, to 2400 mg/day
(dose level changes were made at two weekly intervals).
Patients received therapy for a total of 8 weeks (Fig. 1).
Various specified drugs, physical therapies, and complementary remedies for the relief of neuropathic pain were
prohibited prior to and during the study. Guanethidine or
sympathetic blocks could not be used for the 3 months
preceding the study or during the study; strong opioids,
acupuncture, and homoeopathic remedies could not be
used for 30 days prior to the study; a washout period of
14 days prior to screening was required for benzodiazepines,
skeletal muscle relaxants, steroids, capsaicin, mexiletine,
dextromethorphan, NSAIDs (used for the treatment of
neuropathic pain), and antiepileptics; and the use of trans558 M.G. Serpell et al. / Pain 99 (2002) 557–566
cutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) machines
was prohibited throughout the study.
Patients were, however, allowed to continue on antidepressants (TCAs or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors)
if stable on treatment for 30 days preceding the study, but
antidepressant treatment could not be started during the
study. Existing treatment with aspirin (up to 300 mg/day)
for cardiovascular prophylaxis and with NSAIDs for the
treatment of conditions other than neuropathic pain was
permitted, as were mild opioids (e.g. codeine phosphate,
co-dydramol). Patients were permitted to take paracetamol
(up to eight 500-mg tablets per day) or codeine/paracetamol
(30 mg/500 mg) up to eight tablets per day as rescue medication.
2.3. Efficacy outcomes
The primary efficacy parameter was the change in mean
weekly pain diary score from baseline to the final study
week. On waking each morning, patients assessed the pain
of the previous 24 h, using an 11-point Likert scale with 0 as
‘no pain’ and 10 as ‘worst possible pain.’ Baseline score was
the mean of the last 4–7 pain diary entries preceding visit 1.
The final weekly mean pain score (end point) was the mean
pain score from the last 7 days preceding visit 5, or the final
7 days on study medication for patients who did not
complete the study.
Secondary efficacy parameters were the diary assessment of
individual pain symptoms (allodynia, burning pain, shooting
pain, and hyperalgesia), the Short Form-McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ); the Clinician Global Impression of
Change (CGIC); and Patient Global Impression of Change
(PGIC). Quality of life was assessed using the Short Form36 (SF-36) Health Survey (Ware, 1993).
Allodynia and hyperalgesia were measured by asking the
patient to self-evaluate according to the definition (written
and explained to all patients) and then respond by visual
analogue scale (VAS) of 0–10.
Patients were assessed every 2 weeks at scheduled visits
or by telephone (Fig. 1) for reports of pain and adverse
events (elicited by non-specific questioning). Data for the
SF-MPQ, SF-36, CGIC, and PGIC were collected at week 7.
The protocol was approved by the South and West Multicentre Research Ethics Committee; each centre’s Local
Research Ethics Committee and patients provided written
informed consent.
2.4. Data analysis
Patients were regarded as evaluable in the statistical analysis if, once randomised, they took at least one dose of study
medication, and had both baseline and post-randomisation
data available. Additionally, patients with baseline diary
scores of ,2 for any symptom were excluded from analysis
of that symptom. All statistical tests were two-sided and
performed at a 5% significance level.
The analysis of pain diary data, the primary efficacy variable, used analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), fitting treatment, geographic cluster (centre), and mean score from the
final seven pre-treatment measurements as covariates. The
primary analysis was based on a rank-based ANCOVA
(Conover and Iman, 1982), since the planned analysis
using raw data did not satisfy the required statistical
assumptions and this situation could not be resolved by
transformation.
Secondary analyses were of change in mean pain scores
from each week of treatment, weekly and final diary scores
for the four individual symptoms, each analysed using the
same model as in the primary analysis. The CGIC and PGIC
and percentage of patients with a .50% reduction in mean
overall pain scores were analysed using a Mantel–Haenszel
Chi-square test (an extension of the Chi-squared test for
comparing proportions in the presence of confounding
factors), adjusting for centre (Fleiss, 1981). Centres recruiting relatively lower numbers of participants were grouped
together for the purposes of the analyses. Changes in each
domain score of the SF-MPQ and SF-36 were analysed
using ANCOVA.
In addition, an interaction test was performed to establish
whether or not treatment effects differed among the various
pain syndromes reported by this cohort. This required that
data be grouped into five categories: back pain, CRPS, PHN,
postsurgical pain, and other pain.
3. Results
3.1. Subjects
Of 351 patients screened, 307 were randomised. Twentyfour of the screened patients did not meet the entry criteria,

and 20 were withdrawn for other reasons. Two randomised
patients withdrew before receiving any medication and 305
patients received active treatment (153 with gabapentin and
152 with placebo) (Fig. 2). Patient characteristics at baseline
are summarised in Table 1. The treatment groups were well
matched at baseline in terms of age, sex, duration of disease,
and previous drug treatment (Table 1).
The numbers and percentages of patients suffering from
different neuropathic syndromes are shown in Table 2. Of
the four main symptoms of neuropathic pain, at baseline 211
(69%) reported allodynia, 245 (80%) burning pain, 262 (86%)
shooting pain, and 217 (71%) hyperalgesia. The four main
symptoms were reported by 111 (36%) patients; 103 (34%)
and 91 (30%) reported three and two symptoms, respectively.
At week 5 (the end of the titration period), 101 patients
were prescribed gabapentin 2400 mg/day; 19 were
prescribed 1800 mg/day; and 27 were prescribed 900 mg/
day (28 had been withdrawn by this point). In four gabapentin-treated patients the dosage was reduced during the
study due to adverse events, and in one it was reduced due to
adequate efficacy. The median duration of treatment was 57
days for both treatments (range 3–70 days for gabapentin
and 5–71 days for placebo).
The most commonly reported concomitant medications
during the study were paracetamol, 85 patients (28%);
amitriptyline, 68 (22%); co-proxamol, 58 (19%); co-codamol, 51 (17%); co-dydramol, 30 (10%); dihydrocodeine, 20
(7%); and paracetamol plus codeine, 20 (7%). Forty-five

patients (15%) reported taking no additional medication for
neuropathic pain. Six patients were reported as taking
prohibited medications (carbamazepine, morphine, and
sodium valproate) during the study. In two cases these
continued at a steady dose throughout the study, but in
four cases, they were started or stopped during the baseline
or treatment evaluation periods and may have affected the
estimates of efficacy.
3.2. Efficacy outcomes
3.2.1. Pain diary scores
The primary efficacy variable, change in average daily
pain score from baseline to the final week, showed significant differences between the gabapentin and placebo groups
(Fig. 3). In gabapentin treated patients the mean pain diary
score decreased by 1.5 (21%), from 7.1 to 5.6. In placebotreated patients it decreased by 1.0 (14%), from 7.3 to 6.3.
There was a significant difference between the treatments
(P ¼ 0:048, rank-based ANCOVA).
Analysis of the mean pain scores on a week-by-week
basis showed that the difference between the treatment
groups was statistically significant at weeks 1, 3, 4, 5, and
6 (P , 0:05 for weeks 1, 3, 5 and 6; P ¼ 0:01 for week 4).
At weeks 7 and 8 the gabapentin scores remained constant
and there was an improvement in the mean placebo scores,
resulting in a non-significant difference.
Tests for interaction of the treatment effect with baseline
pain score and cluster were not significant, confirming the
generalisability of the results across study centres and the
range of baseline pain severity.
3.2.2. Response rate
Response to treatment was defined as a .50% reduction
in mean pain score between baseline and the end of treatment. Patients withdrawing from the study due to lack of
efficacy were classified as non-responders irrespective of the
pain score. In the gabapentin-treated group, 21% of patients
were classified as responders, compared with 14% of the
placebo group ðP ¼ 0:16Þ.
3.2.3. Individual pain symptoms
At each weekly assessment, all four symptoms (allodynia,
burning pain, shooting pain, and hyperalgesia) improved
more in gabapentin-treated patients than in those on placebo
(Fig. 4). There were significant differences in burning pain
(weeks 1 and 3) and hyperalgesia (weeks 3, 4, 5, and 6).
However, there was no significant difference in the lastobservation-carried-forward (LOCF) analysis. There were

no interactions of treatment with baseline or centre.
Response rates for individual symptoms were consistently
higher in the gabapentin group than in the placebo group: 23
versus 15% for allodynia; 32 versus 24% for shooting pain;
23 versus 15% for burning pain; 26 versus 17% for hyperalgesia.
3.2.4. Short Form-McGill Pain Questionnaire
All parameters of the SF-MPQ improved during treatment. Greater improvement was seen in gabapentin-treated
patients. The difference between gabapentin and placebo
was statistically significant (P , 0:05, ANCOVA) for the
sensory score and total score.
3.2.5. Patient and CGIC
At the end of treatment, 34% (48/141) of gabapentin-treated
patients categorised their pain as very much or much
improved, compared with 16% (22/138) of placebo-treated
patients (P ¼ 0:03, Mantel–Haenszel). In the CGIC, investigators categorised 38% (53/142) of gabapentin-treated
patients as very much or much improved, compared with
18% (25/142) of placebo-treated patients (P ¼ 0:01,
Mantel–Haenszel).
3.2.6. Health-related quality of life questionnaire (SF-36)
Two hundred ninety-seven patients completed the SF-36
questionnaire at baseline, and 270 had evaluable SF-36
results from the treatment period. Patients receiving gabapentin scored significantly higher for the bodily pain, social
functioning, and role-emotional domains (P , 0:05,
ANCOVA) than those receiving placebo (Fig. 5).
3.2.7. Interaction test
Data were grouped according to five major pain categories
to allow an interaction test for assessment of differences in
treatment effect according to type of pain. This test found no
significant difference ðP ¼ 0:29Þ in treatment effect among
the various pain syndromes analysed in this cohort.
3.3. Safety
The most commonly reported adverse events (reported by
.5% of gabapentin-treated patients), are shown in Table 3.
All reported occurrences of dizziness started during titration; 86% of occurrences were mild or moderate in intensity
and 46% resolved prior to withdrawal. Ninety-one percent
of cases of somnolence occurred during titration; 82% of
reports were mild or moderate in intensity and 36% resolved
prior to withdrawal.

None of the serious, non-fatal adverse events that
occurred were considered to be related to the study drug,
except for one gabapentin-treated patient. This patient
experienced a fainting episode, which resulted in a fractured
wrist that was thought to be related to study medication.
Overall, the percentage of withdrawals due to adverse
events was similar (at 16%) in the two treatment groups
(Table 3). Seven patients withdrew from gabapentin treatment because of dizziness, compared with five from
placebo. Four patients withdrew from gabapentin and two
from placebo because of somnolence. Two additional
patients withdrew from gabapentin, reporting both dizziness
and somnolence.
4. Discussion
This double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled,
multicentre study indicates that gabapentin at doses up to
2400 mg/day reduces pain in patients with a wide range of
neuropathic pain syndromes, selected on the basis of specific symptoms. There was no evidence that treatment effect
differed according to pain syndrome. The primary outcome
variable, mean pain diary score for the last 7 days of the

study, decreased by 1.5 (21%) in gabapentin-treated
patients, compared with 1.0 (14%) in placebo-treated
patients (P ¼ 0:048, rank-based ANCOVA). There were
also significant differences in the PGIC and CGIC, and in
some domains of the SF-MPQ and SF-36.
This demonstration of the beneficial effect of gabapentin
in a population selected on the basis of symptoms, rather
than syndromes, comes in the wake of three recent, large,
placebo-controlled studies in specific neuropathic pain
syndromes: PHN and painful diabetic neuropathy (Backonja
et al., 1998; Rowbotham et al., 1998; Rice and Maton,
2001). The first randomised, double-blind, placebocontrolled clinical trial in 165 patients in USA showed
that gabapentin (up to 3600 mg/day) significantly reduced
pain caused by diabetic neuropathy, as measured by daily
pain diaries and a variety of other outcome measures (Backonja et al., 1998). Another double-blind, placebo-controlled
trial in 229 patients also found that gabapentin (up to
3600 mg/day) significantly reduced pain caused by PHN
(Rowbotham et al., 1998). Most recently, a double-blind,
placebo-controlled study in 334 patients in the UK and the
Republic of Ireland has demonstrated the efficacy and safety
of gabapentin in PHN at doses of 1800 and 2400 mg/day
(Rice and Maton, 2001).
To our knowledge, ours is the first large randomised,
placebo-controlled trial in which the inclusion criteria
were symptom-based. As a result, it included patients with
a wide variety of neuropathic pain syndromes, representing
the typical range of neuropathic pain disorders encountered
in pain clinics. We also found, by interaction test analysis,
that there were no differences in treatment effect among the
various pain syndromes studied, with all types of pain showing responsiveness to gabapentin. Our study was also
unusual in that it examined overall pain scores and scores
for individual pain symptoms; a symptom-based analysis of
neuropathic pain is increasingly regarded as important in the
assessment of disease progression and treatment outcome
(Woolf and Mannion, 1999). It has been demonstrated in
humans that even a single disease entity such as PHN can
produce at least two separate subsets of patients based on
different symptoms and signs (Rowbotham and Fields,
1996). These symptoms and signs are presumably due to
different neural abnormalities and hence will respond to
different mechanistic approaches (Serra, 1999).
For ethical reasons, the study excluded patients who had
previously failed to respond to gabapentin at $900 mg/day
or to gabapentin at any dose due to side effects. Although no
data are available for the number of gabapentin non-responders, it could not have been very large (only 24 of 351
patients screened did not meet the entry criteria), suggesting
this was unlikely to affect the overall evaluation of the efficacy of gabapentin. In addition, excluding patients already
known to be non-responders to a proposed treatment regimen reflects the reality of clinical practice.
All four symptoms (allodynia, burning pain, shooting
pain, and hyperalgesia) showed a consistently greater
improvement in gabapentin-treated patients than in those
on placebo (Fig. 4), although the difference was only statistically significant for burning pain (visits 1, 3, and 4) and
hyperalgesia (visits 3, 4, 5, and 6). While, for each pain
symptom, the percentage of responders was higher in the
gabapentin group than in the placebo group, there is no
evidence from this study to indicate that gabapentin is
more beneficial in one pain symptom than another.
In an open-labelled series of 18 patients with mixed
neuropathic pain, gabapentin demonstrated significantly
better improvement in paroxysmal pain versus ongoing
pain and in certain signs such as dynamic versus static
mechanical allodynia (Attal et al., 1998). Thus, evidence
that specific symptoms and signs should be evaluated is
beginning to emerge, as these symptoms and signs may
respond differently to treatment.
Due to the design of the study, it is not possible to draw
any conclusions regarding a dose–response effect of gabapentin. In practice, the majority of patients (101 of 126)
were titrated up to the maximum dose of 2400 mg/day
after 4 weeks. Most patients tolerated gabapentin well
enough to allow titration up to 2400 mg; only four gabapentin-treated patients required dose reduction during the study
due to adverse events.
However, it is important to note that the clinical benefits
of gabapentin were apparent early in treatment, before the
dose had been titrated up to the maximal level. The effect on
overall pain was significant during the first week, while all
patients in the gabapentin-treatment group received only
900 mg/day. There was also a statistically significant effect
on overall pain at weeks 3 and 4, before any of the patients
had been titrated up to 2400 mg/day. This confirms the efficacy of gabapentin within the licensed dose range (up to
1800 mg/day in the UK). One reason pain scores did not
further improve after week 6 may be that patients might
have become more active toward the end of the study.
This is supported by the improvements in SF-36 scores in
the areas of social functioning and emotions, both at home
and at work.
Although the reduction in mean pain scores and the
response rates obtained with gabapentin in this study were
modest, the refractory nature of the pain and its duration
should be borne in mind. Previously, 66% of patients had
tried amitriptyline and 32% had tried antiepileptics. A mean
baseline pain score of 7.2 (indicating severe pain) suggests
that these standard treatments for neuropathic pain were not
particularly successful in this population. In addition, 22%
of patients continued to take a stable dose of amitriptyline
throughout the study. A recent editorial highlights the fact
that some patients can rate the global impression of change
in pain as ‘much improved’ with changes in pain VAS of as
little as 0.5 because improvement is measured in other
domains, e.g. sleep and function (Rowbotham, 2001).
The efficacy of treatments for neuropathic pain can be
measured not only in terms of the amount of pain the patient
experiences, but also in terms of their overall physical and
564 M.G. Serpell et al. / Pain 99 (2002) 557–566
emotional well-being (quality of life). Neuropathic pain is
known to reduce quality of life, including mood and physical and social functioning (Haythornthwaite and BenrudLarson, 2000). This study used a validated instrument, the
SF-36 Health Survey, to measure quality of life. Gabapentin-treated patients scored significantly better than placebotreated patients for all eight domains. For three of the
domains (bodily pain, social functioning, and role
emotional), the difference was statistically significant. The
beneficial effect of gabapentin on the social functioning and
role emotional subscores is of particular interest, as the
questions included in these domains focus on patients’ ability to take part in everyday activities at work and at home.
Gabapentin was well tolerated in this study. The most
common adverse events, which were more frequent in gabapentin-treated patients, were dizziness and somnolence.
These events were usually mild to moderate in intensity,
occurred early during treatment, and tended to resolve
with continued treatment. The titration rate for this study
was slower than in other trials, (Backonja et al., 1998;
Rowbotham et al., 1998) which may partially explain the
low rate of withdrawals due to adverse events. For some
patients, gabapentin may offer advantages in terms of tolerability compared with TCAs or antiepileptics.
Gabapentin is currently the only agent licensed specifically for neuropathic pain in the UK, and offers clinicians a
new useful option in the management of this group of disorders. This study supports the evidence from studies in PHN
and painful diabetic neuropathy (Backonja et al., 1998;
Rowbotham et al., 1998), and provides further evidence of
the clinical utility of gabapentin, with significant beneficial
effects on overall pain scores and quality of life. With slow
titration to a dose of 2400 mg/day, the clinical benefits of
gabapentin in this study were not compromised by side
effects.
Perhaps as important as the efficacy outcome in this
study, however, is its innovative design. It aimed to reflect
the real-life management of neuropathic pain by including
patients with a broad spectrum of both common and uncommon neuropathic pain syndromes, included on the basis of
their symptomatology. Traditionally, neuropathic pain is
classified on the basis of the aetiology of the insult to the
nervous system or the anatomical distribution of the pain.
This may be useful for differential diagnosis, epidemiological studies, or for treatment aimed at modifying the progression of the underlying diseases. However, it offers no
framework for clinical management of the pain (Woolf
and Mannion, 1999). Moreover, not all cases of neuropathic
pain fall into precise diagnostic categories.
In the future, it may be possible to identify the mechanisms responsible for pain in a particular individual, and to
tailor treatment to match the specific mechanisms. In the
meantime, there is a clear clinical requirement for treatments that are effective not only in individual syndromes,
but also across the broader range of neuropathic pain
syndromes encountered in everyday clinical practice.
