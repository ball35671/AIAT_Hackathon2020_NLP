Abstract
Gabapentin is prescribed for analgesia in chronic low back pain, yet there are no controlled trials supporting this practice. This
randomized, 2-arm, 12-week, parallel group study compared gabapentin (forced titration up to 3600 mg daily) with inert placebo.
The primary efficacy measure was change in pain intensity from baseline to the last week on treatment measured by the Descriptor
Differential Scale; the secondary outcome was disability (Oswestry Disability Index). The intention-to-treat analysis comprised 108
randomized patients with chronic back pain (daily pain for $6 months) whose pain did (43%) or did not radiate into the lower
extremity. Random effects regression models which did not impute missing scores were used to analyze outcome data. Pain
intensity decreased significantly over time (P , 0.0001) with subjects on gabapentin or placebo, reporting reductions of about 30%
from baseline, but did not differ significantly between groups (P 5 0.423). The same results pertained for disability scores. In
responder analyses of those who completed 12 weeks (N 5 72), the proportion reporting at least 30% or 50% reduction in pain
intensity, or at least “Minimal Improvement” on the Physician Clinical Global Impression of Change did not differ significantly between
groups. There were no significant differences in analgesia between participants with radiating (n 5 46) and nonradiating (n 5 62) pain
either within or between treatment arms. There was no significant correlation between gabapentin plasma concentration and pain
intensity. Gabapentin appears to be ineffective for analgesia in chronic low back pain with or without a radiating component.

1. Introduction
Chronic low back pain is a prevalent, disabling condition for which
there are few effective interventions.6,10 Antidepressants, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, and opioids are often
employed, but there are questions about their long-term efficacy
or safety.6 Gabapentin has some evidence of efficacy for
fibromyalgia, a musculoskeletal pain syndrome,1 and has been
recommended as a first line treatment for neuropathic pain in
many recent clinical practice guidelines, but the number-neededto-treat is relatively high for these conditions (eg, Refs. 12,25,33).
Gabapentin is prescribed frequently for chronic back pain
syndromes in both primary care and specialty pain clinics,
particularly when there is a “radicular” or neuropathic component
with pain radiating into the upper or lower legs.6 Although case
reports, single dose, and open-label studies suggest potential
benefits,28,42 there are no randomized, placebo-controlled trials
supporting its efficacy.29 This is unfortunate because gabapentin
differs structurally from other analgesics, and is thought to differ
mechanistically by reducing stimulated release of transmitters by
binding at calcium channel alpha2–delta proteins.38
We conducted a 12-week, 2-arm, randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled trial to examine the efficacy of gabapentin in
patients with chronic low back pain with or without leg pain. We
attempted to address some of the methodological limitations of
back pain analgesic studies in terms of biases in sampling and
duration of the trial, and potential confounding by comorbid pain
and depression.24,40 We recruited patients from primary care and
community settings rather than pain specialty centers to enhance
generalizability and guard against a bias toward enrolling treatment
“failures.” A 12-week design was used to guard against a trend
toward analgesic efficacy associated with brief trials, because this
is the minimum to claim an indication for a chronic pain condition
with most regulatory agencies.23 Patients with mood disorders
were excluded, to limit potential effects of gabapentin on
depressed or anxious mood independent of analgesia.

Healthcare System, San Diego, California, and the University of
California, San Diego, California. Written informed consent was
obtained before entry into the study. Participants were compensated for travel expenses, at $5 per study visit or up to $50 for
completion of the 12-week trial, but there were no other financial
incentives to participate. Individuals were recruited by posting of
flyers at VA San Diego and University of California, San Diego
primary care clinics, and by announcements in metropolitan area
newspapers. Potential enrollees were told they would be
assigned by chance to an inert placebo (“sugar pill”) or to
a licensed medication customarily used to treat seizures. It was
noted that the research was investigating if gabapentin might
have pain-relieving properties because of possible effects on
nervous system neurotransmitters involved in pain.
Inclusion criteria were (1) ages 21 to 70, (2) nonspecific low
back pain primarily in the lumbar region, present on a daily
basis for the previous 6 months or longer, adjectivally
described as, of at least “mild” intensity ($2 on a “0” to “10”
Numeric Rating Scale) and having an impact on 2 or more
aspects of everyday life, (3) English-speaking, literate, able to
understand the study, and communicate with the study team,
(4) presently not a candidate for back surgery (1 prior back
surgery permitted if it was .5 years ago), (5) agreement to
discontinue muscle relaxants, antidepressants, and opioids
at least 2 weeks before eligibility assessment and throughout
the study (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]
were permitted), and (6) if female, not pregnant or lactating,
and has a negative pregnancy test at screening.
Exclusions were (1) a major coexisting medical illness (eg, renal
or hepatic disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
cancer, or class III or IV organic heart disease) that might increase
risks of gabapentin, or major surgical or nonsurgical intervention
for any disorder within the past 12 months, because rehabilitation
from treatment may confound study outcomes; (2) significant
coexisting orthopedic or pain problems or back pain due to other
disorders (eg, fibromyalgia, vertebral fracture, osteomyelitis,
metastatic cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, and spinal stenosis); (3)
meeting DSM-IV criteria for alcohol or other substance use
disorder (within the previous 12 months or with positive urine
toxicology at eligibility assessment); or current major depression
or dysthymia; or lifetime diagnosis of bipolar disorder, psychosis
or cognitive impairment disorder (eg, dementia); (4) history of
multiple adverse drug reactions or known allergy to gabapentin;
(5) use of psychotropics (eg, antidepressants, anxiolytics), which
would be continued during the study, or other drugs or agents (ie,
herbal preparations) which might interact with the study drug; (6)
prior treatment with the study drug; (7) use of systemic corticosteroids or corticosteroid injections within 3 months of screening;
or concurrent behavioral therapies, chiropractic treatment, or
transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation unit; (8) renal impairment (creatinine .1.8 mg/dL); (9) hepatic impairment (bilirubin
.1.53 upper normal limit, or aspartate aminotransferase or
alanine aminotransferase .23 upper normal limit); (10) hematologic abnormality (hemoglobin ,9.4 gm/dL; absolute white blood
cells count ,3000/mm3
, platelets ,100,000); (11) pregnancy;
and (12) use of experimental drugs or participation in other clinical
trials within 2 months of screening for eligibility. There was no
revision of inclusion or exclusion criteria or other methods during
the study.
After an individual was enrolled and randomized, research
visits occurred weekly for weeks 1 to 5, then at weeks 7, 9, and
12. Visits consisted of monitoring of vital signs, completion of
standardized questionnaires on pain, mood, function, and life
quality, and an interview by the study physician to assess for
adverse effects, adherence, and a clinical rating of change in
overall impact of back pain.
2.2. Intervention
Treatment with study drug or inert placebo commenced generally
within 48 hours of baseline assessment. Consistent with most
trials of gabapentin in chronic pain, we used a forced titration
design to achieve a target daily dose (3600 mg) or maximum
tolerable dose, based on the argument that maximum dosing
improves likelihood of therapeutic effect.3,30 Participants received 300 mg q.i.d. on day 1, 300 mg b.i.d. on day 2, and
300 mg t.i.d. on days 3 through 7. In week 2, gabapentin was
escalated in 300 mg increments to a target dose of 600 mg t.i.d.
In week 3, the target was 800 mg t.i.d., and in week 4 and
thereafter, the aim was to achieve 1200 mg t.i.d. Dose titration
was controlled by the research pharmacist, taking into account
safety and tolerability assessments by the blinded study
physician. If an adverse effect was reported, and was not
intolerable, the daily dose was decreased to one at which the
participants had experienced no adverse effects. The mean daily
dose of gabapentin at the end of week 5 was 3265 mg (N 5 43).
Study drug and inert placebo were packaged in identicalappearing gelatin capsules. Placebo was directed to be taken
on a schedule, consistent with that of the study drug.
2.3. Measures
We followed recommendations of the Initiative on Methods,
Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials in chronic
pain (IMMPACT, Ref. 39) by measuring pain intensity, mood, and
everyday function as outcomes. These assessments were
obtained by blinded research personnel in a testing session
separate from the session with the blinded study physician. The
primary outcome measure was pain intensity as determined by
the Descriptor Differential Scale (DDS).17 This measure was
chosen over other (eg, numeric rating scales) because it is
thought to have superior psychometric properties,17 and
because of concerns that patients may apply idiosyncratic
meanings to numeric rating scales.9 The DDS17 contains 24
words that describe the intensity and unpleasantness of pain.
Individuals rate their pain relative to these descriptors. Ratings are
aggregated to provide a 0 to 20 point rating separately for pain
magnitude and unpleasantness. The DDS demonstrates good
internal consistency, reliability, objective correlation with experimentally induced pain, and sensitivity to detect analgesic
intervention in clinical pain.11 The Descriptor Differential Scale
verbal descriptors of pain intensity correspond to pain magnitude
ratings over a wide range (eg, DDS intensity 6-7 5 very weak pain;
8 5 mild pain; 9 5 moderate pain; 10-11 5 slightly intense pain;
12-13 5 strong pain; and $14 5 intense to extreme pain).11 We
also employed several supplemental measures of outcome. At
baseline and 12-week exit, patients were asked to rate pain
intensity on a standard Numeric Rating Scale (0 5 “no pain,” 10 5
“worst pain imaginable”). At exit, patients were also asked to
describe their pain as “improved,” “the same,” or “worse” and to
rate the percentage of change from baseline. Another supplemental outcome was the physician-rated Clinical Global Impression, which asks the blinded study physician to rate clinical
change since baseline on a 7-point scale (1 5 very much
improved; 2 5 much improved; 3 5 minimally improved; 4 5 no
change; 5 5 minimally worse; 6 5 much worse; 7 5 very much
worse). The physician rated overall change, combining pain
intensity and function.18

The main secondary outcome of everyday functioning was
assessed using the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI, Version 2.0).14
The Oswestry surveys 10 areas of daily life (ie, use of analgesics,
personal hygiene, lifting, walking, sitting, standing, sleeping,
social life, traveling, and sex), with responses describing levels of
performance on a 1 to 6 scale, where 1 5 no interference due to
pain, while 6 5 complete interference. Scores range from 0 (best
state of health) to 100 (worst). It is sensitive to change in mild-tomoderately affected samples.8
Mood was assessed at baseline and exit, using the Beck
Depression Inventory II (BDI-II).4 This is a standard index of selfreported mood. It consists of 21 sets of questions, each having 4
or 5 graded statements ordered to show increasing depression
symptoms; total scores range from 0 to 63. Scores below 10 are
considered to reflect minimal depression symptoms. The items of
the BDI are clinically derived and have undergone extensive
reliability and validation studies.4 Beck Depression Inventory II
scores were used to characterize the sample and clarify
interpretation of results (eg, relating analgesia and mood).
The assessment for qualification at study entry included review
of medical records, routine blood count and tests of hepatic,
renal, and thyroid function, urine toxicology for opioids and drugs
of abuse, and a standardized orthopedic evaluation.41 Orthopedic diagnoses were rendered by the study physician in
consultation with the research orthopedic surgeon, by using all
available information, including history, directed physical examination relevant to spine disease, and laboratory data, which
usually included review of plain radiographs or magnetic
resonance imaging. Because of the acknowledged limitations
of an anatomic diagnosis in most chronic back pain, we primarily
used a regional descriptive approach according to the Quebec
Nomenclature on Activity-Related Spine Disorders.37 Using this
system, back pain was described as I 5 pain without radiation;
II 5 pain with proximal (above knee) radiation; and III 5 pain with
distal (below knee) radiation. Subjects with other Quebec
Classifications (ie, IV 5 pain and radiation above or below knee
with neurologic signs; and V 5 presumptive compression of
a spinal nerve root) were excluded based on their low frequency
(,5%) in primary care back pain. To examine if response differed
according to pain location,24 patients were asked to estimate
what proportion of pain could be attributed to each site (eg, 80%
back, 20% leg). At each research visit, a standardized questionnaire was used to record nonprotocol medical or other treatments
for back pain.
The study physician used the Structured Clinical Interview for
DSM-IV36 to examine for excluded psychiatric conditions (eg,
bipolar disorder and major depression or a substance use
disorder within the previous 12 months). To monitor for threats to
internal validity and confounding by prescription or illicit drugs, we
obtained urine toxicology by dipstick (for ethanol, amphetamines,
methylphenidate, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cocaine and
benzoylecgonine, methaqualone, phencyclidine, cannabis,
opioids, and methadone) at baseline and at weeks 3, 7, and 12
(LifeSign LLC, Skillman, NJ).
Concentrations of gabapentin were determined from samples
obtained at the week 5 and week 12 visits. Gabapentin in plasma
was assayed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.
The dynamic range of the assay was 0.1 to 500 ng/mL, and
precision and accuracy within the dynamic range were #7.4%
and #63.2%, respectively. To maintain blinding, all participants
underwent venipuncture.
Because adverse effects are often not mentioned if left to
spontaneous self-report, we employed the UKU Side Effect
Rating Scale (Udvalg for Kliniske Undersoegelser: Committee for
Clinical Investigations), a manualized, structured interview,
administered by the study physician, which systematically
inquires about 48 potential psychological, neurological, autonomic, sexual, dermatological, and other symptoms.20 The UKU
records the presence and severity of the symptom (0 5 none or
doubtful; 1 5 mild; 2 5 moderate; 3 5 severe) and the likelihood
of causal relationship to the psychotropic medication (0 5
improbable; 1 5 possible; 2 5 probable).
2.4. Statistical analysis
Study data were electronically entered into a database and
analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for the
Social Sciences program (SPSS-PC, Windows V10.0) and the R
statistical software (version 2.15.1, 2012; The R Foundation for
Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). Descriptive analyses and
group comparisons examined the baseline demographic and
clinical characteristics of the gabapentin and placebo intervention
groups. Two-sample Welch t tests or Wilcoxon rank–sum tests
were used to compare placebo and gabapentin groups on
continuous and ordinal variables. Fisher’s exact test was used to
compare the 2 groups on gender and treatment emergent
adverse effects. Because we specifically did not want to obscure
any initial or side-effect–based differences between the 2 groups,
the critical alpha level was set at 0.05 for statistical significance,
without an adjustment for multiple comparisons. All comparisons
were 2-tailed. The primary hypothesis was evaluated by an intentto-treat analysis including all randomized participants who
received 1 dose of study drug. For the primary analysis of
analgesia, a mean-matching variance-stabilizing transformation
was applied to the DDS pain scores, because these data were not
normally distributed. Descriptor Differential Scale scores are
a sum of answers to “more than or less than” type questions
about pain intensity, and have a range from 0 to 20. The
distribution for this type of variable is quasi-binomial rather than
Gaussian. The mean-matching variance-stabilizing transformation we applied is an order-preserving symmetrizing transformation for count data such as this, which allows use of
a linear regression model rather than a more complicated Poisson
regression model to address the primary question.5 Transformed
pain intensity scores were modeled as a function of time (week)
and group (gabapentin treatment vs placebo). Random (subjectspecific) intercept and slopes were fitted to the data. Both weeks
before the treatment/placebo administration (screening and
week 1) were treated as time 0. The statement of the main model
is as follows: Zij 5 ai 1 bi (tj 2 1) I (tj . 1) 1 g I (Group 5 Treatment)
1 Єij where Zij is the transformed pain core for subject “i” at time
“j.” The main variable of interest in this regression analysis is the
treatment/placebo group indicator. As a secondary analysis, the
addition of several covariates to the model above was evaluated
as well. Covariates included age, gender, days per week of back
pain, and proportion (ie, percentage of pain due to back rather
than leg). Covariates were modeled as fixed effects in additional
mixed effects regression models. Because we used random
effects regression models to analyze the DDS data, we did not
impute missing scores. In follow-up analyses, we employed the
same approach using DDS pain “unpleasantness” scores as the
outcome.
The analysis of the secondary outcome used the same
approach with Oswestry scores (untransformed) as the outcome.
Additionally, we conducted exploratory analyses. It has been
recommended that chronic back pain randomized trials report
“responder” analyses, based on participants who complete an
efficacy phase and meet a “response” criterion to gauge if

treatment provides a “useful” level of pain relief with tolerable
adverse effects.23 In one responder analysis, we used a x2 test of
proportions to compare the treatment groups on the simple
percentages of patients attaining $30% and $50% decrease in
DDS pain intensity. In another analysis, we compared proportions
of patients who rated themselves as “improved” by $30% and
$50% in terms of reduced pain intensity ($30% was N 5 23
assigned gabapentin and 21 placebo; $50% was N 5 16
assigned gabapentin and 13 assigned placebo). These cutpoints were based on reports suggesting that they reflect
patients’ perception of change of moderate to substantial clinical
importance.13,15. The same approach was used to assess the
Physician’s Global Impression of Change, examining the proportion of completers who were rated as having at least “minimal”
benefit (score $1). In a separate supplemental analysis of
patients completing the study, we used t tests to compare
baseline and exit Numeric Pain Rating (0-10) scores of pain
intensity between groups.
Mood measured by the BDI-II was compared between
gabapentin and placebo groups at the start and end of the
study. A mixed effects model, similar to the one used for the
primary analysis was used to model the total score as a function of
group and time.
We conducted a power analysis for the study based on
moderate effect sizes (0.5-0.7 SD) noted in prior reports
comparing placebo and cyclic antidepressants as analgesics in
back pain, and data that 4.4 DDS pain units is equal to 1 standard
deviation.2 We hypothesized that gabapentin would be superior
to placebo (mean 1 . mean 2). With a 5 0.05 and sizes of 53 and
55 per group, standard power analyses7 indicated power of 80%
or greater to detect a difference across groups if the standardized
effect size is comparable to our prior studies (0.55 SD). Moreover
the power was 64% for population differences 5 0.45 SD. This
corresponds to a decrease in DDS verbal descriptors from
“moderate” to “mild” pain or “strong” to “moderate” pain.11 This
corresponds to a .30% reduction in pain intensity, and would be
clinically meaningful.15 A similar approach was used to address
effects on improving daily function as measured by the Oswestry.
In our prior work, nortriptyline improved function 0.5 SD
compared to placebo. Using the same assumptions as above,
standard power analyses (a 5 0.05, N 5 108) indicated power
.80% for the analysis of variance to detect an overall difference.
2.5. Assignment
The VA San Diego Healthcare System Research Pharmacy
conducted a one-to-one allocation to gabapentin or placebo
using a stratified block computer-generated randomization
scheme. To ensure equivalence between groups on the presence
of a radiating component of back pain, the allocation system
stratified for presence or absence of pain radiating into the leg
(above or below the knee).
2.6. Masking
Gabapentin and placebo were prepared in identical-appearing
gelatin capsules. They were directed to be taken on the same
schedule of dose escalation during the titration and maintenance
phases of the trial. The code for participant assignment was held
by the research pharmacy until completion of data analysis.
Participants and the blinded study physician were asked to guess
treatment (gabapentin or placebo) after the first week on
treatment and at the week 12 exit visit.27 The overall proportion
of correct guesses by patients who received at least 1 week of
treatment (N 5 98 with data) was 51% (P 5 0.920). Guessing by
the physician was not significantly different from chance for the
placebo group (45%, P 5 0.575), but was significantly better than
chance for the treatment group (78%, P , 0.0001) and because
the treatment group was significantly better overall (62%, P 5
0.018). Because more informed guesses might result from study
completers, we also analyzed data on 72 individuals who
completed the study (38 were assigned to gabapentin and 34
were assigned to placebo). Of individuals assigned gabapentin,
22 of 38 guessed they were on the active study drug, and for
those assigned placebo, 16 of 34 guessed placebo treatment
(53% overall proportion guessing correctly, x2
, P 5 0.724). This
suggests that participant masking was successful. Data on
physician guesses for completers were obtained for all 38
individuals assigned to gabapentin, and 33 of 34 persons
assigned to placebo. Of 38 individuals assigned to gabapentin,
the physician correctly guessed that 29 were on the active study
drug, and of those assigned placebo, 14 of 33 were guessed to
be on the active study drug (61% overall proportion of correct
guesses, x2
, P 5 0.097). Again the proportion of correct guesses
for assignment to placebo was not significantly different from
chance (P 5 0.486), but physician guesses for active treatment
were significant (P 5 0.002). This suggests that masking of
physicians was only partly successful.
At the exit visit, the blinded study physician presented the
participant with a sealed envelope which was to be opened after
leaving the research site. This envelope, prepared by the research
pharmacist, contained 2 weeks’ supply of capsules labeled with
treatment assignment (gabapentin or placebo). An enclosed
letter provided instructions on how to continue on active study
drug if desired, or to discontinue gabapentin by tapering over 2
weeks. The letter also mentioned that patients could request
a trial of gabapentin from their personal physician if the
assignment were to placebo. This procedure was explained
verbally beforehand by the study physician.
3. Results
3.1. Participant flow and follow-up
Figure 1 depicts the progress of volunteers through the trial.
During the period of funding and performance of the study
(January 1, 2004 to December 31, 2009), we conducted
telephone screening of individuals who responded to announcements of the study. From these inquiries, 310 individuals were
identified as potentially eligible; of these, 119 declined an
invitation to be further interviewed, and 191 possibly eligible
individuals were evaluated in person. Of these, 83 (43.5%) either
declined participation or were disqualified for meeting 1 or more
exclusion criteria. A total of 108 individuals were randomized
(56.5% of those evaluated in person): 55 were assigned to
gabapentin and 53 to placebo; of those randomized, 72 (71.3%)
completed all 12 weeks on study.
Demographic and clinical characteristics of the randomized
participants are presented in Table 1. There were no statistically
significant differences between gabapentin and placebo groups
in background demographics or clinical characteristics. There
were also no statistically significant differences between those
who were and were not randomized (N of 108 and 83,
respectively) after assessment of eligibility in terms of age,
education, gender, height, weight, duration or intensity of back
pain, or of disability in everyday function.
In general, the sample consisted of white, married men (about
10% were African American, 9% Hispanic, 6% Asian, and 5%

Other) in their mid-50s who were at least high school educated
(about 2% reported less than high school education, 54% high
school or some college, 18% a college degree, 26% some
postcollege education). Back pain was of very longstanding
duration and was present on an almost daily basis (an average of
6.7 [60.37] days per week). Mean DDS pain intensity scores
indicated pain of “moderate” intensity, and ODI scores reflected
mild to moderate adverse impact of back pain on everyday
function. In terms of regional Quebec Classification, 54% (n 5 58)
reported back pain only (Classification I), 24% (n 5 26) had back
and lower extremity pain above the knee (Classification II), and
22% (n 5 24) had back and lower extremity pain below the knee
(Classification III). Mean (SD) pain intensity did not differ
meaningfully across these classifications: Classification I 5 8.98
(3.62); Classification II 5 10.23 (4.86); Classification III 5 9.38
(5.43) (Kruskal–Wallis P-value 5 0.3684). As might be expected in
sample with nonspecific chronic low back pain few (n 5 5; 5%)
had a prior back surgery. At baseline, a majority of individuals (n 5
66; 61%) were taking NSAIDs for analgesia. As part of the
enrollment process, any of the participants who were prescribed
opioid analgesics were asked to discontinue these agents at least
2 weeks before baseline, and to refrain from opioids during the
study. No participant was taking muscle relaxants. About a third

of participants (n 5 34; 31%) were involved in some form of selfcare for pain (eg, exercise, meditation, and heat/ice). There were
no significant differences at entry between treatment arms with
respect to current use of NSAIDs or other adjunctive therapies for
chronic back pain. None of the urine toxicology samples obtained
on study revealed opioids or drugs of abuse.
Of those who withdrew before completing 12 weeks, 19 were
assigned to gabapentin and 17 to placebo. The major primary
reason for attrition was similar in both groups, and most often was
for adverse effects or lack of efficacy; a sizeable proportion was
lost to follow-up and no reason could be obtained for withdrawal
(Table 2). Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics (eg,
pain duration, intensity, and presence of radicular pain) of
individuals who completed 12 weeks on study did not differ from
the entire randomized sample (all P values nonsignificant).
3.2. Analyses
The intent-to-treat analysis, consisting of all individuals who were
randomized and received 1 dose of study drug, revealed that pain
intensity decreased significantly over time for all participants (P ,
0.0001) with subjects on gabapentin or placebo reporting pain
reductions of about 30% from baseline. On the primary outcome
measure of DDS pain intensity, there were no significant
differences between treatment groups (P 5 0.423). Similarly,
there were no significant differences between groups with regard
to change in pain unpleasantness (P 5 0.523). There was no
effect of age or gender on these outcomes. Figure 2 illustrates
the specific results for pain intensity. The same pattern of
significance was observed in an additional mixed model, with
Oswestry score as the secondary outcome (eg, P 5 0.804). Only
time was a significant factor (there was significant improvement
with time). We also conducted an exploratory analysis using only
those who completed 12 weeks on study (N 5 72). In one analysis
we used the 0 to 10 Numeric Rating Scale of pain intensity, as
assessed at screening and exit. There were no significant
differences in pain intensity scores between gabapentin and
placebo groups either at the start or at the end of study (5.8 vs 5.7,
P 5 0.759 and 3.5 vs 4.1, P 5 0.234, respectively). Scores were
significantly lower at exit relative to baseline (P , 0.0001) for both
groups, but the reduction was not significantly different between
groups (2.2 vs 1.6, P 5 0.253). This agrees with the primary result
of pain reduction over time overall, but no difference between
treatment and placebo groups. The responder analyses limited
the sample to study completers. The proportions of patients with
either a $30% or a $50% decrease in DDS pain intensity did not
differ significantly by group (36% vs 36%, P 5 1, and 26% vs
29%, P 5 0.924, respectively). The proportions of patients at exit
who estimated their pain had “improved” by $30% and by $50%
also did not differ significantly by group (43% vs 38%, P 5 0.722,
and 23% vs 20%, P 5 0.920, respectively). Likewise the
proportion of individuals who were rated by the study physician
as having at least “Minimal Improvement” (score $1) on the
Physician Clinical Global Impression of Change did not differ
significantly between groups (gabapentin 5 14 of 38, 36.8%;
placebo 5 11 of 33, 33.3%; P 5 0.95; one participant was
missing a rating).
Because the potential for interventions to be effective might
vary according to the presence of leg pain,24 participants were
grouped according to presence of pain confined to the low back
(Quebec I), or pain with a radiating component (Quebec II or III).
Reduction in pain intensity was similar between participants with
radiating (n 5 46) and nonradiating (n 5 62) pain both within and
between treatment arms (all mixed model analysis P-values not
significant).
We assessed for a relationship of gabapentin concentration to
pain intensity. Week 5 concentrations of gabapentin were
obtained on 39 of 55 individuals who were assigned study drug,
and at week 12 on 34 of 38 who completed the study. At
beginning of week 5 mean plasma concentrations were 6.8 6 3.7
(median 6.1), and for study completers the mean week 12 exit
serum concentration of gabapentin was 9.6 6 7.1 mg/mL
(median 8.9 mg/mL). There was no significant correlation
between gabapentin plasma concentration and pain intensity at
beginning of week 5 (r 5 0.09, P 5 0.585) and at exit week 12
(r 5 0.21, P 5 0.232).
Mood was measured at baseline and exit. By design, none of
the participants met criteria for major depression, which is
consistent with the low mean scores for the BDI-II (Table 1) for
both groups. There were no significant differences in mood
scores between gabapentin and placebo groups either at the
start or at the end of study (P 5 0.719 and 0.519, respectively),
however, scores were significantly lower at exit relative to baseline
(P 5 0.0007). There was no significant correlation between
change in mood and pain intensity.
3.3. Adverse drug effects
Most participants (49 of 55 on gabapentin and 35 of 53 on
placebo) experienced treatment emergent adverse effects determined as “possibly” or “probably” attributable to study drug by
the UKU physician rating during the trial (Table 3). Six adverse
effects were significantly (P , 0.05) more likely to be experienced
by individuals assigned to gabapentin (fatigue, dry mouth,
difficulties with mental concentration, memory, or visual accommodation, and loss of balance), but in general the frequency of
specific adverse effects was comparable between treatments.
No participants reported suicidal ideation.
Most adverse effects were rated as being of “mild” or
“moderate” severity. For gabapentin, 6 of 55 experienced “no”
adverse effects, 19 of 55 experienced “mild” adverse effects, 21
of 55 reported adverse effects of “moderate” intensity, and 9 of 55
experienced at least 1 “marked” adverse effect. For placebo, 18
of 53 reported no adverse effects, 18 experienced at most
a “mild” adverse effect, 12 reported at most a “moderate”
intensity adverse effect, and 5 noted at least 1 “marked” adverse
effect. A higher proportion of subjects in the gabapentin group
experienced at least 1 adverse event than in the placebo group
(89% vs 66%, Fisher’s exact P 5 0.008), and a higher proportion

4. Discussion
4.1. Main findings
This randomized phase II clinical trial in chronic nonspecific low
back pain did not detect analgesic effects for gabapentin
compared with placebo. Adverse effects were higher than
expected, given that gabapentin is often considered to have
a benign side effect profile. Because of evidence that gabapentin
is efficacious for neuropathic pain syndromes, we also examined
whether back pain with a radiating component into the legs was
differentially responsive. Again, there was no support for
gabapentin analgesia. The secondary outcome of disability in
everyday function because of back pain also indicated no
difference between gabapentin and placebo. Reasons for this
lack of effect are not clear, but may be related to the etiopathogenesis of back pain, to characteristics of our back pain sample,
to dosing or plasma concentration, or to methodological
limitations of the research.
The etiopathogenesis of chronic low back pain syndromes is
not clear, and it is likely a heterogeneous phenomenon, with both
neuropathic and somatic components. Several large-scale
randomized trials suggest gabapentin is analgesic in neuropathic
pain states,4,30,32,34 and is associated with improved life quality
and functioning.4 Pregabalin, an analogue of gabapentin with
arguably the same mechanism of action, is reported to be
analgesic for fibromyalgia, a condition of widespread musculoskeletal or soft tissue pain.25,31 To the extent that aspects of
chronic back pain might reflect either neuropathic16 or
musculoskeletal components, one might have expected an
analgesic effect in this study. An effect of dosing on our negative
results is possible. We used forced-titration to maximum tolerable
dose, a design that can be criticized for failing to detect possible
lower concentration “therapeutic windows.”21 Nevertheless, this
forced titration approach is methodologically consistent with
most of the chronic pain literature, and the daily doses of
gabapentin (and pregabalin equivalents) employed in successful
trials in neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia were in the same range
as used in our study. Our negative results are consistent with
a prior low dose trial (1200 mg daily).22 Although there is no
agreed upon plasma concentration for analgesia, and concentrations are not reported in studies of neuropathic pain and
fibromyalgia (eg, Ref. 12), our obtained values were in line with
expectations based on prescribed daily doses, and provide
a validity check on the experimental manipulation. The study
featured a 4-week dose escalation phase and 8 weeks on
treatment. Based on previous data on time to onset of efficacy in
trials of anticonvulsants in neuropathic pain, and antidepressants
in chronic back pain, this treatment duration is likely to have been
adequate to observe onset of a therapeutic effect (eg, Refs.
12,35). At the same time, we acknowledge that one must be
cautious in concluding that gabapentin is ineffective: there was
a large placebo effect, and carefully controlled trials may not
reflect real life clinical experience.24
4.2. Study limitations
Our study has important limitations which impact the generalizability of the results. The sample size is small, and on average pain
intensity was in the mild-to-moderate range, making it possible
that a “basement” effect precluded detection of an overall
therapeutic effect. Attrition was high. On the other hand, our

sample size was adequate to detect a clinically meaningful effect,
and attrition was similar to that reported historically for other
recent clinical trials in chronic back pain (eg, 25%-30%)35. Pain
radiating into the lower extremities may be a proxy, but we did not
use a standardized instrument to ascertain specifically for
neuropathic pain, which has been reported to affect one-third
of patients with chronic back pain.16 Our sample is not likely to be
purely neuropathic, and our design and power estimates did not
address this issue. Short-term studies suggest gabapentin may
be efficacious in rigorously defined lumbar root pain (sciatica),44
a treatment-resistant and disabling subset of the chronic back
pain population.19 One open-label study concluded that compared with usual care, gabapentin reduced pain intensity and
improved walking distance in lumbar spinal stenosis, a condition
associated with neurologic intermittent claudication, manifest as
symptoms of leg pain, numbness, and cramping precipitated by
standing or walking.43 In any event, the inclusion of nonradiating
and radiating pain in the same trial may have underpowered an
ability to detect efficacy if only 1 form was responsive.
Furthermore, we did not assess pain intensity at rest and upon
movement, and we therefore may have missed differential
effects. Other limitations are that we did not explore effects on
sleep, or of coprescribed opioids. Current formulations of
gabapentin allow for single night-time dosing, may impact sleep,
and might exert beneficial effects indirectly through these effects.
Gabapentin might be effective when combined with opioids.26
The generalizability of our results is limited by our exclusion of
patients receiving opioid analgesics.
4.3. Perspective
Effective and safe pharmacotherapy of chronic low back pain
remains elusive. Some antidepressants may be efficacious (eg,
duloxetine), but there are questions about other agents in this
class. The longer term effectiveness of NSAIDs and opioids is not
established. They have known safety hazards. In hopes of
identifying an alternative, this study assessed the efficacy of
a compound with a novel mechanism of action in a sample not
confounded by opioids or benzodiazepines. Such approaches
are reasonable, but limited by the lack of a clearer definition of
chronic back pain phenotypes and mechanisms.
4.4. Conclusions
The calcium channel alpha2–delta ligand gabapentin, which is
analgesic in selected neuropathic pain conditions and perhaps
widespread pain disorders (fibromyalgia), was expected to be
effective in chronic back pain, given its overlap with both
neuropathic and diffuse musculoskeletal pain syndromes.
Results did not support its use in a general low back pain sample
with and without pain radiating to the legs. Future studies, with
larger sample sizes in chronic back pain specifically selected for
neurologic syndromes (eg, sciatica) may be able to define
a therapeutic role for gabapentin.
