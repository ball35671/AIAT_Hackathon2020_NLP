Abstract
Neuropathic pain is difficult to diagnose and difficult to treat with certainty. So the aim of the study was to evaluate comparative
clinical efficacy of pregabaline with amitriptyline and gabapentin in neuropathic cancer pain. A total of 120 patients with cancer
having severe neuropathic cancer pain were enrolled in the study after taking approval from Institutional Ethics Committee
and divided in to 4 groups: group AT—amitriptyline, group GB—gabapentin, group PG—pregabalin, and group PL—placebo.
Oral morphine was used for rescue analgesic for continued pain. Pain score (Visual Analogue scale) and secondary outcome
measures such as intensity of lancinating, dysesthesia, and burning on numerical rating scale, Global satisfaction score (GSS),
Eastern Co-operative Oncology Group scoring (ECOG), and adverse effects were assessed. At the end of study there was significant decrease in pain score in group PG as compared to the other groups; group AT (P ¼ .003), group GB (P ¼ .042), and group
PL (P ¼ .024). Percentage of patients with lancinating pain and dysesthesia were significantly less in group PG as compared to
groups GB and PL. All the patients in group PL needed rescue morphine. After 4 visits, maximum improvement in ECOG
scoring and GSS scoring was observed in group PG patients. Our results suggested that all antineuropathic drugs are effective
in relieving cancer-related neuropathic pain. There was statistically and clinically significant morphine sparing effect of pregabaline
in relieving neuropathic cancer pain and neuropathic symptoms as compared to other antineuropathic drugs.

Introduction
Neuropathic pain is a common cause of chronic pain. According to the International Association for the study of pain
(ISAP), neuropathic pain is defined as pain following a primary
lesion or dysfunction of the nervous system.1 Neuropathic pain
is a challenge to clinicians because of its nonspecific
clinical characteristics. Pharmacotherapy including antiepileptic, antidepressants, and opioids forms the main stay of treatment.2 But their use may be limited by side effects. Tricyclic
antidepressants have been the first choice therapy for neuropathic pain. There are several studies available in literature
where the analgesic efficacy of gabapentin has been established
in nonmalignant neuropathic pain,3-8 and in few studies it was
effective in cancer-related neuropathic pain.9,10 Pregabalin is
an a-2-delta ligand that has analgesic, anxiolytic, and anticonvulsant activity. It is 6 times more potent than gabapentin. Efficacy of pregabalin has been found in the treatment of diabetic
neuropathy and post herpetic neuralgia.11,12
We did not find any study use of these drugs in cancerrelated neuropathic pain. The present study had been designed
to know the efficacy of pregabalin in neuropathic cancer pain
and its comparative clinical efficacy with amitriptyline and
gabapentin in neuropathic cancer pain.
Materials and Methods
A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled was conducted.
A computerized random list was prepared and the patients were
randomized into 4 groups. Approval for the study was obtained

from the local Institutional Ethics Committee. Written informed
consent was taken from all patients before participation.
Patient Selection
The present study was conducted by the Unit of Anesthesiology
and Pain and palliative care; Institute Rotary Cancer hospital,
All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.
Patients with cancer having neuropathic pain were enrolled
in the study. Patients with unstable cardiovascular, respiratory,
hepatic or hematological disease or psychological disorder, and
drug abuse were excluded from the study.
Procedure
Patients from group AT (amitriptyline) were given amitriptyline 50 mg/d for 1 week. There was weekly increase in dose
as fixed dose schedule: 75 mg/d (2nd week), 100 mg/d
(3rd week) at bed time.
Patients from group GB (gabapentin)were given gabapentin
900 mg/d for 1 week in divided doses then there was weekly
increase in dose as fixed dose schedule, that is 1200mg/d
(2nd week); 1800 mg/d (3rd week) in 3 divided doses.
Patients from group PG (pregabalin) were given pregabalin
(Lyrica) 150 mg/day for one week. Thenthere was weeklyincrease
in dose as fixed dose schedule, that is 300 mg/d (2nd week),
600 mg/d (3rd week) for one week in two divided doses.
Patients from group PL (placebo)were given Placebo
Capsules. All drugs (amitriptyline, gabapentine, pregablin, and
for placebo sugar powder) were placed in gelatin capsules prepared by pharmacist to maintain the blindness. In the subsequent visit, irrespective of the neuropathic symptoms, if the
patient had a Visual Analogue scale (VAS) >3, immediate
release morphine was given orally for rescue analgesia. Total
study period was 4 weeks.
Assessment
Patients were asked to rate their global intensity of pain on 100-mm
VAS13 (VAS: 0 mm, no pain; 100 mm, unbearable pain) daily and
maintained a pain diary. Ratings were averaged over 7 days.
Secondary outcome measures were intensity of burning,
shooting/lancinating, and dysesthesia on numerical rating scale
(0 no pain to 10 maximum pain). Adverse effects were also
enquired and depending upon the intensity these were categorized as mild (score 1), moderate (score 2), and severe (score 3).
Patient functional capacity was evaluated according to Eastern
Co-operative Oncology Group (ECOG)14 scoring (0 ¼ fully
active, 1 ¼ capable of light activity, 2 ¼ in bed for less than
50% of the time, 3 ¼ in bed for more than 50% of the time, and
4 ¼ completely bed ridden). Maximum tolerated dose of study
drugs were also measured. Global satisfaction was based on a
5-point Verbal Ratinng Scale [VRS] (1, very satisfied; 2 satisfied; 3, indifferent; 4, dissatisfied; and 5, very dissatisfied) at
the end of the study.
Statistical Methods
The exploratory analysis was performed to decide the
appropriate distribution for each of the covariates. The normal
continuous covariates were presented as mean þ standard
deviation (SD) and other categorical variables were presented
in the form of proportion and number. Further, nonnormal covariates were shown as median and interquartile range.
Repeated measure analysis of variance was used to find out the
effect of time as well as drug on continuous normal variable
with bonferroni post hoc analysis. Chi-square/Fisher exact test
was used for identifying the association of categorical variables. Other biostatistical tools were used for observing the
effect of variables on outcome per requirements. The P values
less than 5% level of significance was considered significant.
Results
We included 120 patients with neuropathic pain and categorized the patients into 4 groups of 30 each. Three different kinds
of antineuropathic pain medication was given to patients of
group AT, GB, and PG and placebo was given to group PL. It
was a double-blind, prospective study and data were compared.
Demographic data and baseline data were described in the
Table 1. In the first visit, all groups were comparable regarding
the characteristics of patients. Patients were comparable regarding ECOG scoring, Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms
and Signs (LANSS) scoring, level of pain (VAS), burning,
allodynia, dysesthesia, and lancinating pain (Table 1). Patient
characteristics were studied for the next 4 weeks.
There was significant decrease in VAS value in all the
4 groups as compared to baseline (Figure 1). Over the period

of 4 weeks, in group AT the mean VAS decreased from
7.77 (+1.0) to 3.23 (+0.70), in group GB from 7.5 (+1.1) to
3.07 (+0.80), in group PG from 7.77 (+0.81) to 2.5(+0.70),
in group PL from 7.47 (+1.0) to 3.4(+0.66; Figure 1).
In all the 4 groups, over the time period of 4 weeks, VAS
was significantly less in every visit as compared to previous
visit (Figure 1). In the third visit, the mean VAS in group PG
was significantly less than mean VAS in group AT(P value
¼ .003) as well as group 4 (P value ¼ .024). In the fourth visit,
the mean VAS in group PG was significantly less than VAS in
group GB (P value ¼ .042).
In the second visit, only 30% patients required extra morphine as rescue drug in group AT, but all the patients in group
PL required extra dose of morphine after 1 week of treatment.
In the third visit, the number of patients increased in all the
4 groups who required extra dose of morphine that is 46.7%,
23.3%, 16.7%, and 100% patients in group AT, GB, PG, and
PL, respectively. In the third visit, none of the patient in group
3 required further increment in morphine doses. Percentage of
patients requiring rescue morphine were 56.7, 33.3, 16.7, and
100 in group AT, GB, PG, and PL, respectively, in the fourth
visit. Based on our findings regarding the requirement for extra
morphine doses in all groups, it can be clearly stated that all the
study drugs had morphine-sparing effect. Moreover requirement of morphine increment was minimum in group PG. So
morphine-sparing effect is statistically and clinically significant with pregabalin (Figure 2).
As far as lancinating pain is concerned, percentage of
patients with lancinating pain 73.3, 66.75, 70.05, and 70.05
were decreased to 56.7, 26.7, 3.3, and 43.3, respectively, in
groups AT, GB, PG, and PL, respectively. In the fourth visit,
the patients with lancinating pain were significantly less in
group PG as compared to group GB (P value ¼ .026), group
PL (P value ¼ .004), and group AT (P value ¼ .009). Similarly
the percentage of patients with lancinating pain was significantly less in group GB as compared to group AT (P value ¼
.018) and group PL (P value ¼ .095).
As far as dysesthesia is concerned, all groups were
comparable initially except group PL because the percentage
of patients with dysesthesia was significantly less in group
PL (66.7) as compared to group AT (93.3%) and group
GB (93.3%) in the first visit. In the second visit, patients
with dysesthesia were decreased in group GB as compared
to groups AT and PL. There were significantly less
number of patients with dysesthesia in group PG (6.7%) as
compared to group GB (33.3%; P value ¼ .021) and group
PL (P value ¼ .014) after the 4 visits. Other group
differences were insignificant.
The percentage of patients with allodynia was comparable
in the first visit in all the 4 groups, although decrease in percentage of patients with allodynia was maximum in group
GB. The percentage of patients with allodynia decreased to
1.10, 0.97, 1.13, and 1.87, respectively, in groups AT, GB,
PG, and PL (Figure 3).
Similarly, the percentage of patients with burning decreased
from 4.70, 4.00, 4.87, and 4.17 to 2.47, 1.47, 1.37, and 2.87,
respectively, in groups AT, GB, PG, and PL (Figure 4).
Functional capacity was comparable among all the 4 groups in
the first and second visit. After 4 visits maximum improvement
in ECOG scoring was found in PG group patients, and this

improvement was statistically significant as compared to all the
other 3 groups AT, GB, and PL (P value < .001).
Satisfaction level ofthe patients was comparable among all the
groups in the second visit that is 1 week after the start of the treatment. In the third visit, satisfaction level grossly dropped in group
PL. In group PL, the number of patients in the category Global
satisfaction score 2 (GSS-2) was significantly less as compared
to all the 3 groups AT, GB, and PG (P values < .001). Similarly,
group PL had maximum number of very dissatisfied patients and
the difference was statistically significant as compared to groups
AT, GB, and PL (P values < .001). In the fourth visit, the number
of satisfied (GSS-2) patients was significantly less in group PL as
compared to group GB. Only in group PG none of the patients
belonged to category GSS-5 or -4 (ie, very dissatisfied or dissatisfied patients). Group GB also had significantly less number of
very dissatisfied patients as compared to group PL.
The most common adverse events in our study were somnolence, dizziness, and dryness of mouth, nausea, and constipation. There was gradual increase in adverse effects in all the
groups. In group PG, the maximum number of patients had
only mild adverse (score 1) effects as compared to other groups
where the maximum number of patients had either mild (score
2) or moderate (score 3) adverse effects. Patients with moderate
side effects were maximum in group PL and significantly high
as compared to all the 3 groups AT, GB, and PG (Figure 5).
Discussion
Recent advances in pain research indicate multiple mechanisms
underlying the initiation and maintenance of neuropathic pain.
The available therapies shown to be effective in managing
neuropathic pain include anticonvulsants, tricyclicantideprassants, opioids, topical lidocaine, and so on. Pregabalin, like
gabapentin, is an amino acid derivative of g-amino butyric acid
(GABA analogue) and has a similar pharmacological profile to
gabapentin. It also binds with high affinity to a2d subunits of
voltage-activated calcium channels, blocks Ca2þ influx into
nerve terminals, and decreases transmitter release.15,16 In our
study, we have shown that pregabalin has better efficacy in neuropathic cancer pain management.
In the present study, VAS was significantly less in every visit
as compared to previous visit in all the 4 groups over the time
period of 4 weeks. The findings were similar to the study done
by Lesser et al and found that pregabalin at 300 and 600 mg/d
was safe and effective for the treatment of neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN).17 In this
study, 46% and 48% of patients in the 300 and 600 mg/d groups
achieved a >50% reduction in mean score from study baseline to
end point, 27% of patients in the 600 mg/d groups achieved a
>70% reduction in score compared with 16% in the 300 mg/d
groups. Similar findings were also observed by Rainer Sabatowski et al.18 In their study also there was statistically and clinically significant improvements in mean pain score of patients
receiving 150 or 300 mg/d pregabalin compared with placebo
group. The first randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
clinical trial in 165 patients in United States showed that gabapentin (up to 3600 mg/d) significantly reduced pain caused by
diabetic neuropathy.4 Similar findings were observed in our
study.
It is important to clarify significant reduction in VAS
score in all the groups over the time in spite of getting different medication. Although the study drug was different, as
specified previously patients received extra doses of morphine based on requirement for rescue analgesia in all the
groups. So keeping ethics in mind we observed changes in
occurrence of neuropathic symptoms in relation to the drug
given and simultaneously could keep the VAS score as low
as possible.
In the present study, pregabalin provided significantly
higher reduction in burning, lancinating pain, and dysesthesia
as compared to group GB, AT group, and opioid monotherapy.
However, GB group also showed significantly better response
in burning and lancinating pain compared to groups AT and
PL but not as good as PG group. Although incrementally dosed
opioids in group PL also provided clinically meaningful
decreases in terms of pain scores compared to baseline, no significant improvement occurred in neuropathic symptoms.
Decosterd et al also compared the effects of morphine,
gabapentin, amitriptyline, and carbamazepine in 2 distinct neuropathic pain models and showed that both gabapentin and carbamazepine reversed and prevented stimulus-induced progressive
tactile hypersensitivity.19

Our results showed a reduction in mechanical allodynia in all
the 3 groups. Although GB group showed slightly better response
than pregabalin, but this difference was statistically insignificant.
Thus, the combination of gabapentin and pregabalin provided earlier improvement in allodynia. Anticonvulsants and opioids are 2
major classes of drugs used often in combination for neuropathic
pain of both noncancer and cancer origin, for many years.20 In a
recent review, Bennett and Simpson indicated that higher
response rates might be observed with gabapentin when administered with opioids because of a synergistic interaction.21 More
recently Gilron et al used a 4-period crossover trial to assess the
efficacy of morphine and gabapentin alone, and in combination,
and an active placebo (in the form of low-dose lorezepam). They
concluded that the trial unequivocally showed that gabapentin
significantly enhanced the efficacy of morphine and suggested
that further studies of combination drug trials are warranted.22
This study was unique in that it examined overall pain
scores and scores for individual pain symptoms in patients with
cancer; a symptom-based analysis of neuropathic pain is
increasingly regarded important in the assessment of disease
progression and treatment outcome, and we compared all the
3 drugs that is pregabalin, gabapentin, and amitryptilline.
Serpel et al in their study showed a consistently greater
improvement in all 4 symptoms (allodynia, burning pain, shooting
pain, and hyperalgesia) in gabapentin-treated patientsthaninthose
on placebo.23 In this study, 66% patients had tried amitryptillin
previously. A mean baseline pain score of 7.2 (indicating severe
pain) in patients taking amitryptilline suggests that these standard
treatments for neuropathic pain were not particularly successful in
this population. In the present study, all patients treated with amitriptyline had significantly less improvement in all 4 symptoms
(allodynia, burning pain, lancinating pain, and dysesthesia) as
compared to patients treated with pregabalin and gabapentin.
In the present study for each pain symptoms, the percentage
of responders was higher in the PG group than in the other 3
groups; there was no evidence from this study to indicate that
pregabalin is more beneficial in one pain symptom than in
another. In a crossover study comparing opioids and tricyclic
antidepressant drugs in patients with postherpetic neuralgia,
they observed similar reductions in pain intensity with the use
of opioids and antidepressant, but patients reported greater
satisfaction with opioid therapy.24 In the second visit, only
30% patients required extra morphine as rescue drug in AT
group, but all the patients in the PL group required extra dose
of morphine after 1 week of treatment. In the third visit, the
number of patients increased in all the 4 groups who required
extra dose of morphine that 46.7%, 23.3%, 16.7%, and 100%
patients in group AT, GB, PG, and PL, respectively. In the third
visit, none of the patients in PG group required further increment in morphine doses. Percentage of patients requiring rescue morphine were 56.7, 33.3, 16.7, and 100 in groups AT,
GB, PG, and PL, respectively, in the fourth visit. Based on our
findings regarding the requirement of extra morphine doses in
all groups, it can be clearly stated that all the study drugs had
morphine-sparing effect. Moreover the requirement of morphine increment was minimum in group PG and that to in the
second visit only. So the morphine-sparing effect is statistically
and clinically significant with pregabalin.
The most common adverse events in our study were somnolence, dizziness, and dryness of mouth, nausea, and constipation. Difference in the percentage of patients with mild,
moderate, severe, or no adverse effects was insignificant among
the 4 groups in the second visit. In group PG, the maximum number of patients had only mild adverse effects as compared to
other groups where the maximum number of patients had either
mild or moderate adverse effects. Patients with moderate side
effects were maximum in the PL group and significantly high
as compared to all the 3 groups AT, GB, and PG. In the PL group,
66.6% patients had either moderate adverse effects and this was
significantly high as compared to groups GB and PG (which otherwise was comparable). In the fourth visit, PG group had significantly less (3.3% only) number of patients with moderate
Adverse Effects (AE) were as compared to AT, GB, and PG
groups. None of the patients in our study discontinued treatment
because of adverse effects. Our findings were similar to the
study done by Lesser et al where higher doses of pregabaline
600 mg/d were well tolerated, and 85% of patients completed the
study in each of these groups and almost all elected to continue
in the open-label phase of the study.17 Treatment with pregabalin was not associated with serious adverse effects such as orthostatic hypotension and other risks common in elderly patients
and patients with cardiac arrhythmias as associated with some
tricyclic antidepressants.25 In the PHN trial, relatively few
pregabalin-treated patients discontinued treatment due to an
adverse event, and only 2 patients discontinued treatment
because of dizziness and 2 because of somnolence. Otherwise
pregabalin was well tolerated; adverse events were generally
mild to moderate.18 The high rate of study completion reflecting
both safety and alterability in patients treated with pregabalin
may be suggestive of potential advantage in terms of effectiveness over therapeutic options that are not well tolerated.11 In a
study by Serpel et al the most common adverse events that were
more frequent in gabapentin-treated patients were dizziness and
somnolence.23 These events were usually mild to moderate in
intensity, occurred early during treatment, and tended to resolve
with continued treatment. The titration rate for this study was
slower than our study, which may partially explain the low rate
of withdrawal due to adverse events. In our study 6.7% patients
in the GB group had severe adverse effects like dizziness and
somnolence and 20% patients in AT group had severe adverse
effects. Trindade et al caution that the well-documented Tri
Cyclic Antidepressants/ Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor
(TCA/SSRI) adverse effect profile limits their use and effectiveness in the long term and that pain relief is rarely complete.25
Pregabalin has been shown in studies to provide equivalent
efficacy to gabapentin, however, at much lower doses.26,27
Because lower dosages can be used to treat neuropathic pain, it
is likely that pregabalin will be associated with fewer doserelated adverse events.26,27 Part of the reason why pregabalin
requires lower dosages is that it has a much higher bioavailability
(90% vs 33%-66%) and is rapidly absorbed (peak: 1 hour). Also,
plasma concentrations increase linearly with increasing dose.26
Mishra et al 181

This is not true with gabapentin. Our study in accordance with the
above mentioned studies suggests that pain relief with pregabalin
may be obtained relatively rapidly and with fewer limiting
adverse reactions than other treatment modalities available in
chronic pain syndromes, which provides an advantage for patients
as compared with frequently used therapies, such as tricyclic antidepressants and anticonvulsants, including gabapentin.
Our results suggested that all antineuropathic drugs are effective in relieving neuropathic pain in patients with cancer. But
pregabaline has statistically and clinically significant morphinesparing effect in relieving neuropathic cancer pain and neuropathic symptoms as compared to other antineuropathic drugs.
