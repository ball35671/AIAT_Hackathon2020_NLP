Abstract
Introduction: Post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) is a common complication of herpes zoster. Pain
medications have shown benefit, however many patients do not achieve adequate pain relief. Oral
Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) has been used for people with PHN but its benefit is unclear. This
review examined the efficacy and safety of oral CHM alone or as add-on therapy for PHN.
Methods: Nine English and Chinese databases were searched from their inceptions to March 2016.
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating oral CHM for PHN were included. Methodological
quality was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration’s risk of bias tool. Data were analysed using
Review Manager software.
Results: Twelve RCTs involving 853 participants were included with low to moderate quality based
on risk of bias assessment. Oral CHM as an add-on intervention to pharmacotherapy improved visual
analogue scale (VAS) pain score (MD -1.88 cm [-3.34 to -0.42], I2=98%), and scores on the Hamilton
Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) (MD -2.45 points [-3.70 to -1.20], I2=13%) compared with
pharmacotherapy alone. Significant changes from baseline were seen for all groups. No severe
adverse events were reported.
Conclusions: These findings suggested that oral CHM in addition to pharmacotherapy may be
beneficial for patients with PHN. Oral CHM alone or combined with pharmacotherapy appeared to
be safe. More high quality trials with rigorous research methods are needed.

1. Introduction
Post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) is a common complication of herpes zoster (HZ), affecting between 10
and 20% of people over 50 years of age [1]. The incidence rises with advancing age, and has been
reported to be nearly 80% in people 80 years or older [2]. Pain may be present continuously or 
4
intermittently, and is usually limited to the same dermatome in which the herpes zoster rash
occurred [3]. Pathological changes of both central nervous system and peripheral nervous system
may contribute to the neuralgia [4-6]. Pain is described as burning, aching, throbbing, lancing or
electric-shock like [7] and can be associated with other symptoms such as sleep disturbance, loss of
appetite, weight loss, and depression [8].
The impact of PHN is significant [4], due to decreased quality of life, and increased costs associated
with the treatments [9]. People with PHN experience worse general wellbeing than those without
PHN. The impact of chronic pain on mental health is considerable, with up to 43% of people suffered
from chronic pain were reported with moderate levels of anxiety or depression [10]. Health care
utilisation in people with PHN is also high, with an average of 11.9 visits to general practitioners to
manage pain [11].
Clinical practice guidelines for PHN [12] and chronic pain (which include specific reference to PHN)
[13-15] recommend tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), gabapentin, and pregabalin as first line
treatment for PHN. Variation exists in additional first line treatments and second line therapies, and
include opioid analgesics, tramadol and topical lidocaine. All medications have been shown to be
effective, however the individual response varies considerably. Between 40 and 50% of people with
PHN do not respond to any treatment [16], and many people taking multiple medications continue
to experience pain most or all of the time [17]. Many of the guideline recommended
pharmacotherapies used in the included studies have established safety profiles and known adverse
events (AEs). For example, sedation, dry mouth, blurred vision, weight gain and urinary retention
were reported with TCAs; dizziness, sedation and peripheral edema were seen with anticonvulsants
(gabapentin and pregabalin); and nausea, vomiting, constipation, sedation, dizziness, seizures and
postural hypotension were common with tramadol [4].
5
Effective pain relief is difficult to attain for patients and clinicians, and is an area of unmet clinical
need [8]. Some authors have included a minimum threshold for clinically important pain of three on
a 10-point scale [18, 19]. Dubinsky et al [12] considered that a reduction in VAS or Likert scale to
below four, or by 50%, was adequate pain relief. Currently, no minimal clinically important
difference (MCID) has been defined for PHN.
Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) has a long history of use in China. CHM has been used to treat a
range of pain related conditions, and has been evaluated in a Cochrane systematic review of
neuropathic pain [20]. In people with diabetic peripheral neuropathy, CHM produced greater global
improvements in pain and numbness than conventional medicine [20], although the review authors
noted the poor methodological quality of included studies and lack of objective outcome measures.
One systematic review evaluating Chinese medicine (CM) for PHN was identified in Chinese
databases [21]. It showed that the CM group had a better improvement in VAS score than the
pharmacotherapy group (WMD -1.73 points, 95% CI -2.12 to -1.35, I2=0%). However, the details of
interventions in both groups weren't specified. The results were not able to be interpreted in a
meaningful way. This review aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral CHM for PHN in
randomised controlled trials (RCTs).
2. Methods
2.1 Data sources and search strategy
Nine electronic databases were searched from inceptions to February 2014, and an update search
was conducted in March 2016. English databases included PubMed, which was used to search
MEDLINE, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Cochrane Central
Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Embase, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database 
6
(AMED) and Chinese databases included China BioMedical Literature (CBM), China National
Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), the Chongqing VIP Chinese Scientific Journal database (CQVIP) and
WanFang database. As PHN is a sequela of herpes zoster, search terms for both conditions were
used. Search terms included neuralgia, postherpetic; PHN; post-herpetic pain; postherpetic pain;
herpes zoster, varicellovirus, shingles, and variants. Search terms for Chinese herbal medicine
included Traditional Chinese Medicine; Chinese Drugs, Plants; Plants, Medicinal; Herbs; and variants.
Search terms for study designs included randomized controlled trial, controlled clinical trial, placebo,
drug therapy, and variants. Both subject heading and keyword searches were conducted. Terms
were also searched in the titles and abstracts. No restrictions were applied. The search was part of a
comprehensive search for PHN with CM interventions, which included CHM, acupuncture,
moxibustion, and other therapies of CM. This approach was aimed to ensure the largest sample of
CHM was included.
2.2 Study selection criteria
The definition of PHN is still controversial. There have been many definitions of PHN reported in the
literature, including pain at four weeks, six weeks, eight weeks, twelve weeks and six months after
the resolution of the rash [3]. To date, no consensus definition of PHN has been reached [8]. Two
clinical practice guidelines for HZ have proposed differing definitions, with the German Dermatology
Society defining PHN as pain persisting for longer than four weeks [22], and Dworkin et al [4]
proposing PHN is pain persisting for at least 120 days after rash onset. The definition proposed by
Dworkin and Portenoy [23] of pain persisting three or more months after resolution of the rash is
generally used for diagnosis and in research.
As the pharmacological management of PHN is the same irrespective of PHN duration, PHN defined
as pain persisting for one month or more after the resolution of the rash [22] was used as a 
7
diagnostic criteria for participants in the studies. Inclusion criteria were randomised controlled trials
(RCTs) of oral CHM in adults with PHN. Interventions included oral CHM with or without
pharmacotherapy. Studies were eligible for inclusion where the comparators were treatments
recommended in international guidelines for PHN [12] or neuropathic pain [13-15], placebo or no
treatment/waitlist control. Studies which used another form of Chinese medicine as the comparator
were excluded, as were studies of acute stage herpes zoster, neuropathic pain, and PHN in patients
under 18 years old, immunocompromised patients, and pregnant or breastfeeding females. The
primary outcome was pain severity, measured on visual analogue scale (VAS) or other scales.
Secondary outcomes included health related quality of life (HRQoL) measured using the disease
specific questionnaires Zoster Brief Pain Inventory or Initial Zoster Impact Questionnaire [18], or
other wellbeing questionnaires eg the MOS 36-item short-form health survey (SF-36), EuroQol 5
Dimension questionnaire (EQ-5D), Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D); and adverse
events.
2.3 Data selection and extraction
Identified citations were exported to Endnote reference management software for duplicate
removal and further review. Titles and abstracts were screened initially to exclude irrelevant articles,
and where this could not be determined from the title and abstract, the full text was retrieved. Once
eligibility was confirmed, data extraction of study characteristics, intervention and comparator
details, results and adverse events were entered into EpiData Version 3.1 software.
2.4 Quality assessment and statistical analyses
Methodological quality was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration’s risk of bias tool [24].
Assessment of risk of bias for individual studies was done at the study level. Information gathered
from risk of bias assessment was used for sub-group analyses where possible. Two researchers 
8
independently assessed the risk of bias (H. Liang and K. Wang). If disagreement was seen in the
assessment it was resolved by discussion with a third researcher (M.E. Coyle).
Study results were entered into Review Manager Software (version 5.3), provide by the Cochrane
Collaboration, for further analysis and meta-analysis where possible. Results were presented as
mean difference (MD) or risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI), and analyses were
performed using a random effects model. Heterogeneity was considered substantial where the I2
statistic was greater than 50% with a p value of less than 0.10 in the Chi square test for
heterogeneity. Sub-group analyses were planned according to comparators, duration of treatment
and risk of bias assessment for sequence generation. Where 10 or more studies were included in
one meta-analysis, we planned to visually assess funnel plot symmetry.
3. Results
3.1 Description of Studies
The comprehensive search of Chinese and English language databases and other sources identified
37,717 related citations, of which 17,440 citations remained after duplicates were removed. After
screening titles and abstracts, 12,653 articles were excluded, with 4,787 studies requiring full text
review. Fourteen (14) RCTs of Chinese herbal medicine for PHN were identified. One RCT used
intravenous CHM as the intervention, and the other used topical CHM. Both studies were excluded
from this review, resulting in 12 RCTs eligible for inclusion [25-36]. Figure 1 presents the details of
the study selection process.
All studies were conducted in China and were identified from the Chinese databases. In total, 853
participants were included in these studies, with 460 receiving CHM and 393 receiving guideline
recommended pain treatments. The majority (10 studies) were conducted in outpatient hospital 
9
departments. The number of male participants (426) was similar to the number of females (427).
Sample sizes of studies ranged from 40 [32] to 112 [30]. The majority of studies defined a clear
timeframe for PHN, either one month [25-29, 31, 35] or three months [33, 34, 36] after the
resolution of rash. Two articles [30, 32] stated the definition of PHN as pain persisting after the rash
healed. Since the duration of PHN in both studies was over one month, both were considered
eligible. Duration of treatment ranged from 10 to 30 days. Three studies reported follow-up
assessment, at 1, 2, and 4 weeks [36], 4 weeks [27] and 3 months [26].
Ten studies were two-arm RCTs [25-33, 36], and two studies were multiple-arm trials [34, 35]. One
study included two intervention arms, with one using CHM alone and the other using oral CHM plus
pharmacotherapy (CHM as add-on therapy) [34]. The other was a multiple-arm RCT [35], with two
CHM arms (one CHM alone and one CHM as add-on therapy) and one arm which combined CHM
with acupuncture (not included in analysis). Most of the RCTs administered CHM as a decoction,
with one using patent CHM (Liu Shen Wan – pills). Formulas developed by researchers were
commonly used, thus there was no overlap in formulas across studies. Chinese medicine syndrome
differentiation was indicated in one study [27] as an inclusion criterion to guide treatment, which
used pattern/syndrome of qi stagnation and blood stasis. The most frequently used herbs in the
included RCTs were dang gui, yan hu suo, chai hu, chuan xiong, tao ren, hong hua, huang qi, and gan
cao (see Table 1).
Four studies compared oral CHM alone with pharmacotherapy [25, 27, 32, 36], while six studies
compared oral CHM plus pharmacotherapy with the same pharmacotherapy [26, 28-31, 33]. Two
studies included two treatment arms, one of oral CHM alone and one of oral CHM as add-on therapy
[34, 35]. Comparators included TCAs alone [27, 28] or with other treatments [25, 26, 30, 32, 36],
tramadol alone [29], TCAs with tramadol [31], and anticonvulsants alone [33, 34] or with other 
10
treatments [35]. Other treatments used with guideline recommended treatments were mainly
vitamins B1 or B12 or derivatives. Study characteristics are presented in Table 2 & 3.
3.2 Risk of Bias assessment
In most aspects, risk of bias is unclear in the included studies (see Figure 2). One study mentioned
random number was generated by computer [31], and another study mentioned using a random
number table [36], both studies were assessed as low risk for sequence generation. None of the
studies provided the details of the method of allocation concealment and were all assessed as
unclear risk. Considering none of the studies stated double-dummy and the blinding could be easily
broken by different forms between interventions (CHM formula decoctions) and comparators
(pharmaceutical pills and/or injection), all studies were assessed as high risk for blinding method of
participants and personnel. None of the studies mentioned the blinding method of outcome
assessors and were assessed as unclear risk. Three studies were assessed as low risk for incomplete
outcome data, as they all reported no dropout or withdraw [31-33]. The other studies had unclear
risk, for the reason that there was no mention of dropout or withdraw. None of the studies provided
any information of trial registration and protocol, and they were assessed as unclear risk in selective
outcome reporting. Since none of the analyses included ten or more RCTs, publication bias was not
assessed.
3.3 Outcome Measures
3.3.1 Pain score
All included studies reporting VAS used an 0 to 10 cm scale. For oral CHM alone, two studies
reported pain score on VAS at end of treatment [27, 35], which was not statistically different to
pharmacotherapy (MD -0.30 cm, 95% CI -1.12 to 0.52, I2 = 0%). One study evaluated pain
improvement on a 10-point numerical rating scale (NRS), with higher scores indicating more severe 
11
pain [36]. The result favoured oral CHM alone, with NRS score reduced by 0.79 points (95% CI -1.25
to -0.33) at one week after the end of treatment (EoT) and 0.85 points (95% CI -1.24 to -0.46) at four
weeks post EoT.
Five studies measured pain score with oral CHM as an add-on therapy [26, 28, 29, 33, 35]. Oral CHM
plus pharmacotherapy reduced VAS score by 1.88 cm (95% CI -3.34 to -0.42, I2=98%) compared to
pharmacotherapy alone (see Figure 3). Considerable statistical heterogeneity was detected, so
subgroup analyses were conducted. Subgroup analysis was performed according to the duration of
treatment (see Figure 3). Trials with 4-week treatment duration favoured oral CHM as add-on
therapy with no statistical heterogeneity (MD -1.09 cm, 95% CI -1.37 to -0.81, I
2 = 0%). Patients who
received oral CHM as add-on therapy for less than 4 weeks didn’t show a significant improvement
(MD -2.85cm, 95% CI -6.65 to 0.96, I2 = 99%) and heterogeneity was considerable. Subgroup analysis
was planned according to types of CHM formulae. Studies which used investigator developed
formulae were the same studies as those which used a treatment duration of 4 weeks, and studies
which used traditional formulae were the same as those which used a treatment duration less than 4
weeks.
Further analysis was carried out according to definition of PHN (one month or more after resolution
of the rash) (Figure 4). Positive effects on pain relief were seen with oral CHM as add-on therapy,
with no statistical heterogeneity (MD -1.01 cm, 95% CI -1.22 to -0.80, I2=0%). One study which used a
definition of PHN of three months or more after resolution of the rash [33], also achieved a
significant improvement on pain relief (MD -4.79 cm, 95% CI -5.27 to -4.31) when compared to
pharmacotherapy.
12
Within group analysis was performed to assess the change in pain score between baseline and EoT,
and to determine whether the end of treatment scores met suggested thresholds for clinically
meaningful pain/adequate pain relief (see Table 4). The means of mean scores of all groups (oral
CHM alone, oral CHM as add-on therapy, and pharmacotherapy) were similar at baseline. All groups
showed significant reductions in pain score between baseline and EoT. The largest change within
groups was seen in people who received oral CHM as add-on therapy (reduction of 5.78 cm [95% CI -
6.31 to -5.24]), followed by oral CHM alone (MD -4.97 cm, 95% CI -5.64 to -4.30), and
pharmacotherapy (MD -3.93 cm, 95% CI -5.45 to -2.40). Considerable heterogeneity was seen in the
pharmacotherapy group. Possible reasons may include different kinds of guideline recommended
medications used as comparators, duration of PHN, or duration of treatment. No heterogeneity was
seen in results for oral CHM alone, suggesting that despite different formulas being used the overall
treatment effect was consistent. At end of treatment, the mean of mean scores for all three groups
were below the threshold of four out of 10 for clinically significant pain, as suggested by Dubinsky et
al [12]. However, only oral CHM alone and as add-on therapy met the threshold of three out of 10
for clinically significant pain as suggested by Coplan et al [18] and Oxman et al [19].
3.3.2 Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D)
Three studies reported on the outcome HAM-D, with two using the 17-item version [26, 28] and one
not specifying which version of HAM-D was used [27]. In the studies which reported on the 17-item
HAM-D, one used doxepin alone [28], while the other used doxepin in combination with vitamin B1
and adenosylcobalamin (a derivative of vitamin B12) [26]. The result favoured oral CHM as add-on
therapy (MD -2.45 points, 95% CI -3.70 to -1.20, I2=13%) when compared to pharmacotherapy (see
Figure 5). The study which didn’t specify the version of HAM-D used oral CHM alone [27]. Compared
to amitriptyline, no improvement was seen at the end of treatment (MD -1.49 points, 95% CI -3.23
to 0.25).
13
3.3.3 Other health related quality of life outcomes
One study which used oral CHM alone reported HRQoL on the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI),
Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), as well as self-rating depression scale (SDS) [36]. Oral CHM
alone significantly improved DLQI by 4.10 points (95% CI -5.49 to -2.71) at one week post EoT and
0.89 points (95% CI -1.16 to -0.62) at four weeks post EoT when compared to pharmacotherapy. The
result showed a significant improvement on PSQI at one week post EoT (MD -2.50 points, 95% CI -
3.18 to -1.82) and four weeks post EoT (MD -2.21 points, 95% CI -2.66 to -1.76) for patients who
received oral CHM therapy. There was also a significant reduction on SDS for oral CHM by 6.44
points (95% CI -8.89 to -3.99) at one week post EoT and 6.12 points (95% CI -8.01 to -4.23) at four
weeks post EoT.
3.3.4 Adverse Events
Five studies which compared oral CHM alone to pharmacotherapy reported on adverse events [25,
27, 32, 34, 35], and one study did not [36]. One study reported that no adverse events occurred [34].
The others reported a total of 12 adverse events in the intervention groups, including five cases of
diarrhoea, three cases of discomfort associated with medicine taste, two cases of upper abdominal
discomfort, and one case each of nausea and vomiting. Sixty-eight adverse events were reported in
the control groups, which included drowsiness (16 cases), dry mouth (15), constipation (9),
drowsiness, blurred vision plus sweating (9), poor appetite plus dizziness (9), nausea plus acid reflux
(3), difficult urination (3), dizziness (2) and one case each of sweating and orthostatic hypotension.
Causality was assessed in one study [25]. This study indicated that in the intervention group nausea
and vomiting were certainly related to oral CHM, and upper abdominal discomfort was likely related
to oral CHM. In the control group, dry mouth, drowsiness, sweating and two cases of dizziness were
certainly related to pharmacotherapy (which included amitriptyline, vitamin B1 and B12, and 
14
paracetamol plus codeine), while one case each of dizziness and orthostatic hypotension were likely
related to pharmacotherapy. No severe adverse events were reported.
Seven out of the eight trials using oral CHM as add-on therapy reported on adverse events [26, 28,
30, 31, 33-35], with three of them reporting no adverse events occurred [30, 33, 34]. There were 18
adverse events in the intervention group and 16 in the pharmacotherapy group. Adverse events
included poor appetite and dizziness (intervention group: 8 cases, control group: 9 cases), mild
dizziness (intervention group: 1, control group: 3), nausea and acid reflux (intervention group: 3,
control group: 3), and mild nausea (intervention group: 2, control group: 1). Two cases of
gastrointestinal reactions, and one case each of nausea plus vomiting and mild diarrhoea occurred in
the intervention group. No causality assessment was conducted for these adverse events. No severe
adverse events were reported.
4. Discussion
This systematic review showed that oral CHM as an add-on therapy to pharmacotherapy had better
outcomes for PHN, based on VAS pain score and HAM-D, when compared to pharmacotherapy
alone. The result favoured oral CHM as an add-on therapy, with a reduction of VAS score by 1.88cm.
One single study showed a greater improvement for patients who received oral CHM alone on NRS,
another scale for pain assessment. Oral CHM, either being used alone or as add-on therapy, reduced
mean of mean pain scores to below 3/10 at the end of treatment. This result can be considered as
clinically adequate pain relief, and may benefit patients, since higher pain score has been associated
with lower QoL with greater negative impact on activities of daily living [18].
As high heterogeneity was seen in the meta analyses for pain score, subgroup analyses were
conducted according to the duration of treatment, types of CHM formulae, and definition of PHN. 
15
But considerable statistical heterogeneity was still detected. From visual inspection of the forest plot,
it appears that one study (MX Zhang et al, 2014) [33] is contributing to the high heterogeneity. First,
this study had pain score in the control group much higher than the others at the end of treatment.
Second, it was the only one to use the definition of PHN three or more months after resolution of
the rash. These two aspects indicate that the condition or severity of PHN from this study may be
different from the other studies. The longer PHN duration may mean there is less effect with
pharmacotherapy. If this study is excluded from the analysis, the heterogeneity reduces to 0%.
Patients receiving oral CHM as an add-on therapy for four weeks obtained a significant improvement
in pain compared with those who received treatment for less than four weeks. This suggests that
longer duration of treatment is needed to achieve meaningful pain relief for people with PHN. Trials
of short duration are not uncommon in PHN, with most trials of pharmacotherapy in neuropathic
pain being less than 12 weeks [14]. Finnerup et al [37] recommend that trials of 12 weeks or more
are needed in the future; this recommendation is not limited to pharmacotherapy. Considerable
heterogeneity seen in the subgroup analysis for duration of treatment less than four weeks may be
due to the variation of duration, ranging from two to three weeks. While CHM for four weeks
produced greater short-term reduction in pain score than pharmacotherapy, the long term effects
are unknown.
Since there is no MCID defined for PHN yet, a minimum threshold for clinically important pain may
be one approach to evaluate the treatment effects. All three groups met the threshold of four out of
10 for clinically important pain relief [12] at end of treatment, but only oral CHM alone and as addon therapy were below the three out of 10 threshold for clinically important pain [18, 19]. This
finding indicates oral CHM therapy may have an important role in improving pain scores for patients
of PHN.
16
As well as neurological changes and concomitant disease, it is essential to assess psychosocial status
of PHN [7]. DLQI, PSQI and SDS were assessed in one study which compared oral CHM alone with
pharmacotherapy. The result favoured oral CHM therapy in these three outcomes. This may indicate
that oral CHM therapy can improve outcomes related to quality of life, but as only one study
contributed this data the reliability remains unclear. HAM-D was evaluated in three included RCTs.
One study which used oral CHM alone didn’t improve HAM-D scores more than pharmacotherapy.
Two studies reported on the 17-item HAM-D, finding oral CHM as add-on therapy was significantly
effective when compared to pharmacotherapy. There is promising evidence that oral CHM as add-on
therapy may improve patients’ symptoms of depression. This is an important finding, as PHN, and
chronic pain more broadly, has been known to have a large negative impact on mood and mental
well-being [10]. The reasons why oral CHM as add-on therapy produced a statistically significant
result on HAM-D when oral CHM alone did not are unclear. Possible reasons may include the add-on
effect when CHM was combined with pharmacotherapy, differences in comparators used, variants
of the outcome measure itself, or may be a product of small numbers of studies and participants in
these analysis. Further research is needed to clarify the potential benefit of CHM compared with
TCAs and other guideline recommended treatments.
Based on included studies, oral CHM therapy was safe for PHN and well-tolerated. Adverse events
reported in the intervention groups where oral CHM was used alone were much fewer than those in
the pharmacotherapy group. Diarrhoea was the most common AE in the treatment group when oral
CHM was used alone. Other discomforts were more likely related to the medicine taste. All these
AEs didn’t have much impact on participants and were resolved as the trials went on. The number of
adverse events that occurred in trials using oral CHM as an add-on therapy was similar to the
pharmacotherapy group. The AEs such as dizziness and nausea are known to be common in the 
17
pharmacotherapies. Even though no causality was assessed, the AEs were considered to be
associated with pharmacotherapies. None of the symptoms were considered severe, and resolved
with time. No patient dropped out because of adverse events.
In Chinese medicine (CM), patients suffering from pain in the acute stage of herpes zoster or in PHN
usually manifest with the syndrome of qi stagnation and blood stasis [38]. The treatment principle is
to activate qi and blood circulation and remove blood stasis. Seven of the eight most frequently used
herbs (dang gui, yan hu suo, chai hu, chuan xiong, tao ren, hong hua, and huang qi), have the
function of promoting qi and blood circulation, an important therapeutic aim with Chinese medicine
treatment of pain. The inclusion of gan cao as one of the most frequently used herbs was not
surprising, as one of its main functions is to harmonize ingredients in a formula. With the exception
of huang qi, the most frequently reported herbs are all included in the formulas Xue fu zhu yu tang
combined with Jin ling zi san, which are recommended for treating the syndrome of qi stagnation
and blood stasis in acute stage of herpes zoster or in PHN [38]. This suggests that there was clinical
homogeneity in the treatment principles in included studies, with similar effects seen.
In order to examine the potential mechanisms of key herbs, experimental studies were reviewed to
identify relevant actions. Several studies showed mechanisms that may be relevant to post-herpetic
neuralgia and/or chronic pain. Ligustilide is a major component of dang gui and reported to have
anti-inflammatory and anti-nociceptive effects [39]. Certain kinds of alkaloids, which are the main
chemical constituents of yan hu suo, were found to elicit profound effects on the dopaminergic
system in the central nervous system and play an important role in regulating nociception [40]. The
ethanol extract of chai hu was reported to have a similar effect of analgesia when compared with
rotundine [41]. The extract of chuan xiong was reported to have significant effects on reducing
neuropathic pain and protecting nerve system in rats [42]. Persicae semen extract (PSE), which is one 
18
main extract of tao ren, was found to lower blood viscosity and inhibit thrombosis [43].
Hydroxysafflor yellow A (HSYA), as one of the main active component of hong hua, was indicated to
have anti-inflammatory function through regulating inflammation-related factors [44]. Topical gels of
hong hua were reported to have effects on regulating inflammation and relieving pain [45]. Analgesic
and anti-inflammatory effects were demonstrated for astragalus hamosus (HAAH) in animal models
[46], which showed that huang qi could have an important function in treating pain and
inflammatory conditions. These experimental evidences support that the herbs which were most
frequently used in the included studies have important clinical functions in treating PHN.
Limitations of this review should be considered since methodological shortfalls were seen in the
included studies. Only two trials mentioned the details of random sequence generation, and none
reported on allocation concealment. Blinding of participants and personnel was not performed in
any of the studies. Sample sizes were small and no calculation of sample sizes could be found in all
the studies. Previous studies showed that subjective outcomes such as VAS pain scale could be easily
influenced by placebo effect (lack of or unclear double-blinding studies) [47], which probably yielded
larger estimates of intervention effects [48, 49]. Therefore, the result of this review should be
interpreted with caution. The methodological shortfalls are likely to influence the reliability of the
conclusion. The potential benefits of oral CHM for PHN need to be further evaluated through
rigorously designed and adequately powered clinical trials which use proper randomisation and
allocation concealment. Blinding should be applied on participants, personnel, and outcome
assessors where possible.
As all the included studies were conducted in China, it remains unclear whether the finding would be
influenced by inclusion of studies published outside of China. No studies conducted outside of China 
19
met the inclusion criteria, which is another limitation of this review. In addition, the grey literature
was not searched, which gives room to publication bias influencing the study.
5. Conclusions
Oral CHM as an add-on therapy appeared to be effective in treating PHN by improving VAS pain
score and HAM-D. Oral CHM used alone or combined with pharmacotherapy produces significant
reductions in mean pain scores from baseline to end of treatment. Future trials should address
methodological shortcomings identified including group allocation and blinding. Overall, oral CHM
appeared to be safe, and may be beneficial for patients of PHN.
