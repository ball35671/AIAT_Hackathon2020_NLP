Abstract—Twenty-four adults with phantom limb pain (PLP)
and/or residual limb pain (RLP) participated in a double-blind
crossover trial. Participants were randomly assigned to receive
gabapentin or placebo and later crossed over to the other treatment, with a 5-week washout interval in which they did not
receive medication. Gabapentin was titrated from 300 mg to
the maximum dose of 3,600 mg. Measures of pain intensity,
pain interference, depression, life satisfaction, and functioning
were collected throughout the study. Analyses revealed no significant group differences in pre- to posttreatment change
scores on any of the outcome measures. More than half of the
participants reported a meaningful decrease in pain during the
gabapentin phase compared with about one-fifth who reported
a meaningful decrease in pain during the placebo phase. In this
trial, gabapentin did not substantially affect pain. More
research on the efficacy of gabapentin to treat chronic PLP and
RLP is needed.

INTRODUCTION
Both phantom limb pain (PLP) and residual limb pain
(RLP) are common chronic conditions in persons with
amputation. A number of studies suggest that as many as
55 to 85 percent of persons who have had amputations will
experience PLP at some point following the amputation
[1–6]. Of persons with chronic PLP, as many as onequarter are estimated to experience moderate to severe disability due to their PLP [2,7]. RLP is also quite common,
affecting more than half of persons with amputation
[2,6,8]. Unfortunately, although persons with limb loss

report trying a number of pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatments to alleviate pain, the literature lacks
controlled clinical trials of existing interventions [9].
Gabapentin, a drug originally developed as an antiepileptic medication, has become increasingly popular as a
treatment for chronic PLP and RLP. Gabapentin is derived
by addition of a cyclohexyl group to the backbone of
gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). In brain membranes,
gabapentin interacts with a high-affinity binding site,
which is an auxiliary subunit of voltage-sensitive calcium
channels. Human and rat brain nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopies indicate that gabapentin increases
GABA synthesis in vivo. In vitro, gabapentin increases
nonsynaptic GABA responses from neuronal tissues and
reduces the release of several monoamine neurotransmitters [10]. In rats, gabapentin increases the threshold for
mechanical allodynia after spinal nerve ligation [11].
Several studies suggest that gabapentin effectively
reduces pain associated with some chronic pain conditions in humans. These investigations include retrospective studies that suggest efficacy for sympathetically
mediated pain syndromes [12], PLP [12], and cancer pain
[13], as well as prospective studies for postherpetic neuralgia [14] and neuropathic pain secondary to multiple
sclerosis [15]. For example, a prospective, double-blind,
randomized study of pain due to diabetic neuropathy
found a significantly greater reduction in daily pain in
patients who received an 8-week trial of gabapentin (up to
3,600 mg/day) than in patients who received 8 weeks of
placebo [16]. Quality of life (as measured by the 36-Item
Short-Form Health Survey) and sleep were also significantly improved in the gabapentin-treated group compared with the placebo group. However, a study
comparing gabapentin with amitriptyline showed little
difference between the two for relief of pain associated
with diabetic neuropathy, although relatively low doses of
gabapentin (900 or 1,800 mg/day) were used [17].
Although gabapentin is commonly prescribed for
chronic PLP and RLP, only one published randomized
clinical trial of its efficacy was identified [18]. In the
study, 19 multidisciplinary pain clinic patients with PLP
were entered into a randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled, crossover trial comparing gabapentin with an
inert placebo. Each treatment phase was 6 weeks long
with a 1-week washout period in between. During the
active medication phase, gabapentin was titrated in increments of 300 mg to either the maximum tolerated dose or
2,400 mg. For the 14 participants who completed both
phases of the study, both gabapentin and placebo treatments resulted in reduced pain intensity scores, as measured by a 100 mm visual analog scale (VAS). Analyses
revealed that PLP intensity change scores were significantly greater for gabapentin as compared with placebo;
however, the two treatment groups did not significantly
differ on measures of sleep interference, mood, or activities of daily living. The authors reported that gabapentin
was generally well tolerated, with few side effects. This
study did not examine RLP; thus whether gabapentin
effectively relieves this type of pain is unknown.
Given the potential for gabapentin to relieve PLP and
RLP, as well as the fact that it is already commonly prescribed for these conditions, we performed a doubleblind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover trial to
test its efficacy in persons with chronic PLP and RLP.
The primary study hypothesis was that gabapentin would
be superior to placebo in reducing PLP and RLP intensity. A secondary hypothesis was that gabapentin would
be superior to placebo in increasing activity levels and
participation and in reducing distress and use of painrelated medical services in persons with PLP and RLP.
METHODS
Participants
We solicited participants from several sources.
Notices of the study were placed in area clinics and prosthetists’ offices serving patients with amputation. Potential
study participants were asked to contact the investigators
to learn more about the study. Patients being seen for
amputation-related clinical care at Good Samaritan Hospital in Puyallup, Washington, were also approached about
possible study participation. Survey respondents from a
previous study of patients treated for amputation at Harborview Medical Center (a regional trauma center) or
Department of Veterans Affairs Puget Sound Health Care
System who indicated interest in future research participation were called on the telephone and asked if they might
be interested in participating [2].
Study inclusion criteria were as follows:
1. Lower-limb amputation at least 6 months prior.
2. Average pain rating in the last month of at least 3 on a
0 to 10 numerical rating scale (NRS) in either the
phantom or residual limb.
3. Agreement with medication schedules and protocols.
4. Ability to read and speak English.

SMITH et al. Efficacy of gabapentin for amputation-related pain
Individuals were excluded if they were younger than
18 years; taking other antiepileptic medication or cimetidine (Tagamet); consuming more than two alcoholic
drinks per day; if female, pregnant or breast-feeding a
baby; found to have a high serum creatinine clearance
level or low estimated creatinine clearance in a screening
serum creatinine; or found to have a history of kidney
disease. The University of Washington Human Subjects
Review Committee approved the study, and each subject
gave informed written consent.
Among 78 individuals screened for potential participation, 25 were ineligible. The most common reasons for
ineligibility were not enough pain (less than 3 on the 0 to
10 NRS, sporadic pain) and abnormal serum creatinine
levels. Twenty-nine participants declined to participate.
The most common reasons for declining were not wanting to take the study medication and prior negative experience with gabapentin. A total of 24 persons (45% of
those eligible) enrolled in the study.
Measures
Primary Outcome
Participants rated PLP, defined as painful sensations
in the part of the limb that had been amputated, and RLP,
defined as pain in the residual limb (also known as the
stump), using a 0 (no pain) to 10 (pain as bad as it could
be) NRS. During both phases, participants were called
three times during pretreatment and the last week of
treatment and asked to use the NRS to rate their average
and worst PLP and RLP in the previous 24 hours. These
three ratings were then averaged to produce composite
scores of average and worst PLP and RLP pain within
each 7-day assessment window.
Secondary Outcomes
Following each phase, participants were asked to rate
the meaningfulness of change in pain from pre- to posttreatment using the following 5-point categorical scale:
1. “My pain decreased to a meaningful extent.”
2. “There was some decrease in my pain but not enough
to be meaningful.”
3. “There was no change in my pain.”
4. “There was some increase in my pain but not enough
to be meaningful.”
5. “My pain increased to a meaningful extent.”
Similarly, to assess overall benefit from the study
medication, participants were asked after each treatment
phase and before unblinding to choose one of the following descriptors:
1. “The benefits far outweighed the negative side
effects.”
2. “The benefits somewhat outweighed the negative
side effects.”
3. “There were no benefits or side effects, or there were
very mild benefits and side effects.”
4. “Although there were both benefits and side effects,
they were about equal.”
5. “The negative side effects somewhat outweighed the
benefits.”
6. “The negative side effects far outweighed the
benefits.”
Participants were also asked after each treatment
phase to guess which medication they had just received
and on what they had based their guess (i.e., based on
pain relief, side effects, or other reasons).
Pain interference was assessed with a modified version of the pain interference scale of the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) [19], which asks respondents to rate the degree
to which pain has interfered during the past week with
seven daily activities, including general activity, mood,
walking, normal work, relations with other people, sleep,
and enjoyment of life. The walking item was changed to
“mobility (ability to get around)” to be relevant to participants who were unable to walk, and three items pertaining
to self-care, recreational activities, and social activities
were added to gain a more thorough perspective of pain
interference. The pain interference scale of the BPI has
demonstrated its validity through strong associations with
pain intensity across diverse pain conditions [19].
The short-form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ)
consists of 15 pain descriptors that respondents rate on a
scale from 0 (none) to 3 (severe) [20]. The SF-MPQ total
score correlates highly with the original MPQ total score
and is sensitive to the effects of treatments for pain [20].
Depressive symptoms were measured using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D),
a 20-item scale assessing how often participants have felt
various depressive symptoms during the past week [21].
The CES-D has been shown to be a reliable and valid
measure of depressive symptoms [21]. In addition, the
CES-D has been shown to be a valid measure of depression among patients with chronic pain [22].
648
JRRD, Volume 42, Number 5, 2005
The Functional Independence Measure (FIM) is an
18-item measure that was developed by the American
Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine and the American
Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Task
Force to Develop a National Uniform Data System for
Medical Rehabilitation. The FIM rates the severity of
patient disability and assesses outcomes of medical rehabilitation [23]. The FIM assesses independent functioning in self-care, sphincter control, mobility, transfers,
locomotion, communication, and social cognition. An
interview version of the FIM [24] was used in this study.
The Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) is a 5-item
scale that measures global life satisfaction [25]. Diener et al.
demonstrated that the SWLS assesses a single factor and has
excellent test-retest stability and internal consistency [25].
To assess disability, we used an interview version of
the Craig Handicap Assessment and Reporting Technique (CHART) [26]. The CHART is a 27-item measure
that assesses six dimensions: orientation, physical independence, mobility, occupation, social integration, and
economic self-sufficiency. Respondents indicate the time
spent in various activities, as well as their level of independence when performing these activities. Test-retest
stability of the interview responses to the CHART is
excellent [26].
Finally, participants were asked to indicate the temporal pattern of any PLP before and after each treatment
phase by rating their PLP as—
1. “Constant with little or no variation.”
2. “Constant with variations in intensity.”
3. “Some pain-free periods.”
Based on their response to this question, participants
were classified into three groups: those who reported a
change from constant pain at pretreatment to intermittent
pain at posttreatment (improved), those who reported a
change from intermittent pain at pretreatment to constant
pain at posttreatment (worse), and those who reported the
same pattern of PLP from pre- to posttreatment (no
change). This process variable helped us understand the
impact of gabapentin on the meaningfulness ratings (see
analyses that follow).
Study Design and Procedures
The study was a double-blind, randomized, placebocontrolled, crossover trial of gabapentin for the treatment
of pain in persons with amputations. All participants
received 6 weeks of therapy with gabapentin and 6 weeks
of therapy with placebo (lactose) in random order. After
being screened and enrolled in the study, participants
underwent a full medical history and physical examination. Telephone interviews were conducted during the
pretreatment week prior to both phases of treatment. During the interviews, participants were asked to complete
the primary and secondary outcome measures described
in the methods section. Participants were then randomly
assigned to receive either gabapentin (n = 11) or placebo
(n = 13) during the first phase of treatment. The study
pharmacist conducted the randomization technique using
computer-generated random numbers. The Harborview
Medical Center pharmacy compounded gabapentin and
placebo capsules that were identical in appearance so that
study investigators and participants could not determine
study assignment by the capsules.
The research study nurse contacted each participant
to assess pain intensity and side effects. If a participant
continued to report pain with few or no side effects, the
dose was titrated to the next standardized level. Dose
increases followed a standardized titration schedule
(300 mg increases every 2 to 3 days) unless the pain
intensity rating was 0 or uncomfortable side effects were
reported. In the case of side effects, doses were either
decreased or maintained at the same level, depending on
the severity of the side effects. Participants receiving
gabapentin were titrated from an initial dose of 300 mg
on day 1 to the maximum tolerated dose or 3,600 mg
maximum, taken in three divided doses. Seventy-nine
percent (19) achieved the maximum dose of 3,600 mg
(82% during Phase 1 and 77% during Phase 2). Identical
dosing procedures were used for the placebo phase of
treatment; that is, the number of placebo capsules taken
was titrated so that it matched the standardized titration
schedule of the gabapentin phase. Similarly, if participants reported side effects or a pain intensity of 0 during
the placebo phase, the number of capsules was either
decreased or maintained at the same level. Phase 1 posttreatment telephone interviews were completed during
week 6 in which participants again completed all primary
and secondary outcome measures. Participants in both
groups were gradually titrated off of the medication during week 7. After a washout period of 5 weeks, Phase 2 of
the study was conducted following the same procedures
as Phase 1: pre- and posttreatment telephone interviews
(during weeks 12 and 18, respectively), weekly contact
with the research study nurse, and 6 weeks (weeks 13–18)
of whichever study medication was not received during
Phase 1, following the same titration schedule.

At the end of Phase 2 of treatment, a study investigator who was not involved in data collection or analyses
unblinded the participants.
Overview of Data Analyses
We examined the significance of changes in pain
intensity during the gabapentin phase compared with the
placebo phase by first calculating change scores (posttreatment minus pretreatment) for each participant during
each phase. We then calculated change scores for average
and worst PLP intensity and average and worst RLP intensity. For each of the four measures of pain intensity, we
used a paired samples t-test to compare each participant’s
change score while receiving gabapentin with his or her
change score while receiving placebo. We used the same
procedures to test the significance of changes in pain interference (BPI), pain sensations (SF-MPQ), depressive
symptoms (CES-D), satisfaction with life (SWLS), and
functional ability (FIM, CHART).
In addition, we tested for possible order effects by performing four two-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs),
with treatment order (first vs second phase) and drug (gabapentin vs placebo) as the independent variables and pain
intensity change score (examined separately for average
and worst PLP and average and worst RLP) as the dependent variable. In this way, we were also able to test for
interactions between treatment order and drug for each of
the four pain intensity change scores. Because amputationrelated pain is often intermittent, we believed that constancy of pain (constant vs intermittent) was another potentially important outcome. We hypothesized that gabapentin
would change the pattern of pain such that pain episodes
would be experienced less often. Therefore, we conducted
Pearson’s chi-square analyses to examine any differences in
the proportions of participants who reported constant versus intermittent pain at pre- and posttreatment. We conducted exploratory analyses, described in more detail in the
results section, to further investigate several interesting
findings that emerged regarding reported meaningfulness
of changes in pain and reported benefits of the drug.
RESULTS
Participant Characteristics
Table 1 presents sociodemographic and amputation
characteristics for the 24 participants. The majority of participants (n = 21) had lower-limb amputations. Table 2
presents characteristics of the participants’ PLP and RLP
at enrollment.
At the end of each phase, participants were asked to
guess which medication they had been receiving. Of the
21 participants who answered this question after the
gabapentin phase, 15 (62.3%) correctly guessed gabapentin, while 6 (25.0%) incorrectly guessed placebo. Of the
15 participants who guessed accurately, 7 based their
guess on pain relief, 3 on side effects, 4 on both pain
relief and side effects, and 1 on other reasons. Of the 6
who guessed incorrectly, 2 based their guess on pain
relief, 2 on side effects, and 2 on both pain relief and side
effects. Of the 20 participants who answered this question after the placebo phase, 12 (50.0%) correctly
guessed placebo, while 8 (33.3%) incorrectly guessed
gabapentin. Of the 12 participants who guessed accurately, 4 based their guess on pain relief, 0 on side effects,
5 on both pain relief and side effects, and 3 on other reasons. Among the 8 who guessed incorrectly, 2 based their
guess on pain relief, 3 on side effects, 2 on both pain
relief and side effects, and 1 on other reasons (i.e., “random guess”). The proportions of participants who
guessed correctly in the gabapentin phase compared with
the placebo phase were not significantly different (χ2 =
0.60, p = 0.44).
Of the participants who reported that their pain
decreased to a meaningful extent during the gabapentin
phase, eight correctly guessed gabapentin, three incorrectly guessed placebo, and two did not answer the question. Of the participants who reported a meaningful pain
decrease during the placebo phase, only one correctly
guessed placebo, three incorrectly guessed gabapentin,
and one did not answer the question. These analyses support the conclusion that participants could not easily
identify whether they were receiving gabapentin or placebo and therefore the blinding process was successful.
Pain Intensity
As shown in Table 3, no significant differences in preto posttreatment pain intensity change scores while receiving gabapentin versus placebo were found for any of the
four types of pain intensity (average and worst PLP and
average and worst RLP). Effect sizes for these analyses
ranged from 0.31 to 0.36, values usually interpreted as
small [27]. In addition, Table 4 shows that no significant
differences were found for change scores in pain sensations (SF-MPQ), depressive symptoms (CES-D), or pain
interference (BPI). Satisfaction with life (SWLS) and
650
JRRD, Volume 42, Number 5, 2005
functional ability (FIM, CHART) change scores were also
not significant (not shown). Results of two-way ANOVAs
with drug (gabapentin vs placebo) and treatment order
(first vs second phase) as the independent variables and
pain intensity change scores as the dependent variable
were not significant for average and worst PLP and RLP.
We ruled out order effects because neither a main effect for
treatment order nor a significant interaction between drug
and order was found.
Meaningfulness of Change in Pain
As described earlier, participants were asked at the
end of each phase to rate the meaningfulness of any PLP
or RLP change on a scale from 1 (My pain decreased to a

meaningful extent) to 5 (My pain increased to a meaningful extent). More than half of the participants reported a
meaningful decrease in pain during the gabapentin phase
compared with about one-fifth who reported a meaningful
decrease in pain during the placebo phase (Table 5). A
Pearson’s chi-square analysis revealed that significantly
more participants reported a meaningful pain decrease
during the gabapentin phase (χ2
 = 5.69, p < 0.05).
To investigate this finding further, we performed a
two-way analysis of covariance with drug (gabapentin vs
placebo) and treatment order (first vs second phase) as
the independent variables and meaningfulness of change
score as the dependent variable, while controlling for
type of PLP (constant vs intermittent) at posttreatment.
The covariate, type of PLP, was significant (F1, 46 = 5.70,
p < 0.05); specifically, participants with intermittent pain
rated their pain decrease as significantly more meaningful (mean = 1.82) compared with participants with constant pain (mean = 3.00). Even after controlling for type
of PLP, we still found a significant treatment effect on
meaningfulness (F1, 46 = 4.71, p < 0.05) such that participants during the gabapentin phase rated their pain
decrease as significantly more meaningful (mean = 1.69)
compared with participants during the placebo phase
(mean = 2.35). We found no main effect for treatment
order and no significant interaction between drug and
treatment order.
Reported Drug Benefits
Participants also rated the overall benefit from the
drug at the end of each treatment phase. Similar to the
meaningfulness question, more than half of the participants of the gabapentin phase reported that the benefits of
the drug outweighed the side effects compared with onethird of the placebo participants who reported this level of
benefit. Pearson’s chi-square analysis of this difference,
however, was not statistically significant (Table 5). Of
participants in the gabapentin phase, approximately
17 percent reported that the side effects outweighed the
benefits of the drug compared with approximately 8 percent of participants in the placebo phase, but again, the
chi-square analysis was not significant.
Intermittent Versus Constant
Table 6 reports the number and percentage of participants reporting intermittent versus constant pain during
each phase. Regarding changes in the temporal pattern of
PLP, 6 participants improved (i.e., reported a change from
constant to intermittent pain), 16 had no change, and 0 got
worse (i.e., reported a change from intermittent to constant

pain) during the gabapentin phase. In the placebo phase,
2 participants improved, 19 had no change, and 1 got
worse. We conducted a chi-square analysis of the proportions of participants in each of these three groups during
the gabapentin phase compared with the placebo phase.
Although more participants in the gabapentin phase
appeared to move from constant to intermittent pain, a
comparison of the proportion of participants in each phase
was not statistically significant (χ2
 = 3.26, p = 0.20).
DISCUSSION
In contrast to previous studies on the use of gabapentin for neuropathic pain, this study did not find significant
differences between gabapentin and placebo on measures
of pain intensity. Specifically, pre- to posttreatment
change scores for gabapentin versus placebo were not
significantly different for any of the four types of pain
intensity (average and worst PLP and average and worst
RLP). This contrasts with Bone et al.’s study in which
PLP pain intensity ratings significantly decreased during
the gabapentin phase as compared with the placebo phase
[18]. Several important differences between the present
study and Bone et al. may account for this discrepant
finding. We recruited the present study sample from a
wide range of resources, including the community. In
contrast, Bone et al.’s participants were persons attending
a multidisciplinary pain clinic and thus may have had
more room for improvement with gabapentin treatment.
In addition, their inclusion criteria required pain intensity
ratings of at least 40 on a 100 mm VAS, whereas ours
required a 3 or greater on the 0 to 10 NRS. Given the
sample sources, the Bone et al. sample not surprisingly
had a baseline pain rating (VAS of 67 in placebo first
phase, 61 in gabapentin first phase) that was 18 to
35 percent higher than our sample (4.36 in placebo first
phase, 5.00 in gabapentin first phase, 4.65 for whole sample). In addition, Bone et al. only studied PLP, whereas
we included participants with either PLP or RLP. Gabapentin is possibly more effective in patients reporting
greater pretreatment pain intensities (moderate to severe)
or in patients specifically with PLP than in patients with
RLP or patients who experience only mild pain. Future
research must examine the differential effects of different
pain severities and pain locations, but our current sample
size and design precluded such analyses.
One notable finding is that the pain intensity change
scores, the primary outcome variable, varied widely
within groups during each phase, as one can see when
comparing the mean change scores with their standard
deviations (Table 3). Why the pain intensity change
scores varied so greatly is not clear; however, betweengroup (or in this case, between-phase) differences are
certainly more difficult to detect and effect size is smaller
when score variance is high within groups. It may indeed
be necessary to conduct a larger trial with more power to
detect moderate but still potentially meaningful differences or to identify subgroups of responders.
Interestingly, although we did not find significant differences on the primary outcome measure, exploratory
analysis of the secondary measures did demonstrate a
significantly greater proportion of participants reporting a
meaningful decrease in pain during the gabapentin phase
compared with the placebo phase. Participants with intermittent pain rated their pain decrease as significantly more
meaningful compared with participants with constant pain,
and when we controlled for type of PLP (constant vs
intermittent), a significant treatment effect on meaningfulness was still observed. This finding is particularly interesting given that participants did not more accurately guess
that they were receiving gabapentin than placebo. Thus, a
placebo effect alone does not seem to account for these differences. Several explanations may account for this interesting but very exploratory finding. One possibility is that

SMITH et al. Efficacy of gabapentin for amputation-related pain
the meaningfulness measure was more sensitive to
changes in pain than the pain intensity measure used as the
primary outcome in this study. In the pain field, the limitations of the 0 to 10 NRS as the only primary outcome measure in trials have been acknowledged [28]. Recently, a
consensus panel recommended that participant ratings of
global improvement and satisfaction with pain treatment
be included as core outcomes in randomized clinical trials
of pain treatments [28]. Such measures aggregate multiple
aspects of the pain experience, including pain relief, side
effects, changes in functioning, and convenience of treatment use, into a single measure. This explanation, while
intriguing, is only hypothetical and in need of further
study. Future studies of gabapentin should include participant ratings of global improvement and satisfaction with
treatment as core outcomes. Another plausible explanation
for the differences in meaningfulness of change is that,
given the multiple analyses conducted, the finding was
simply due to chance and not to an effect of gabapentin.
Several limitations of this trial must be considered in
the interpretation of its results. First, the sample size of
this study was relatively small and therefore the study was
underpowered. Given the increasing popularity of gabapentin treatment for PLP during the study period (1999–
2003), we had growing difficulty finding potential participants who had never taken gabapentin. As mentioned earlier, a larger sample size might have increased our power
to detect possible significant differences. Another issue to
consider is that the participants in the present study may
have had different mechanisms underlying their pain; for
example, pain from nerve damage directly related to
amputation versus pain from muscle cramping in the
residual limb. Gabapentin is possibly more effective for
one type of pain problem than for others, and these effects
may have been washed out in the current sample.
CONCLUSIONS
Despite certain limitations, the current study is the
largest reported trial studying gabapentin for chronic PLP
and is the only study that has included persons with RLP.
The findings suggest that, on average, gabapentin does
not provide strong pain relief for these chronic pain conditions. However, the fact that participants reported
greater “meaningfulness” of pain relief after receiving
gabapentin supports the need for further study of gabapentin in PLP and RLP treatment. Further investigation is
warranted to better elucidate the efficacy of gabapentin
beyond any placebo effects and to determine if subgroups
of persons with amputation respond to its use.
