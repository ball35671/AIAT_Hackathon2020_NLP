A placebo-controlled trial of gabapentin
for painful HIV-associated
sensory neuropathies
JON 1529
Introduction
Since the introduction of highly active antiretroviral
therapy (HAART) and the subsequent decrease of opportunistic CNS-infections HIV-associated polyneuropathy is one of the most frequently observed neurological complications in HIV-seropositive patients.
There are several subtypes of neuropathies, which can
be differentiated by clinical and electrophysiological criteria and which have different incidences in the stages of
HIV-infection.
The HIV-associated sensory neuropathies (HIV-SN)
include both the HIV-induced distal-symmetric
polyneuropathy (DSP) due to the HIV infection by itself
and the antiretroviral toxic neuropathy (ATN) [8]. With

■ Abstract Background Painful
HIV-associated sensory neuropathies (HIV-SN) are a common
complication of HIV infection. The
pathogenesis is unknown and the
treatment very limited. Gabapentin
(GBP) is effective in painful diabetic neuropathy and postherpetic
neuralgia and its effectiveness on
painful HIV-SN has been reported
anecdotally.Design Multicenter,
prospective, randomised, doubleblind, placebo-controlled study.
Methods Patients were followed for
a 1-week screening, a 4-week double-blind and a 2-week open treatment phase. GBP was initiated at
400 mg/d, titrated over 2 weeks to
1200 mg/d, and then either maintained at this level or – if not beneficial – titrated to 2400 mg/d. After
4 weeks the medication was unblinded and the patient had the
choice to begin, to maintain or to
increase GBP to 3600 mg/d. The
primary outcome measure was an
improvement in median pain on
the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)
from the screening week compared
to the 4th treatment week. A secondary efficacy measure was the
median sleep score (VAS). Results
15 patients received GBP and 11
placebo. In each group one patient
dropped out during the doubleblind phase. Median pain (GBP 5.1;
placebo 4.7) and sleep score (GBP
4.5; placebo 5.6) did not differ between both groups at baseline. In
the GBP-group there was a significant decrease of the pain to 2.85
(–44.1 %) as well as of the sleep
VAS to 2.3 (–48.9 %). No significant
decrease in the pain (median
VAS =3.3, –29.8 %) as well as in the
sleep score (median VAS = 4.95,
–11.6 %) was observed in the
placebo-group. GBP was generally
well tolerated. The most frequent
side effect was somnolence reported in 80 % of GBP-treated patients. Conclusions GBP was more
effective than placebo in reducing
pain and sleep interference in patients with HIV-SN.

a prevalence between 35 and 88 % [4, 7, 10, 12] the DSP
is the most frequent subtype occurring particularly in
later stages of infection. Its progression is subacute to
chronic and the patients develop predominantly sensory
symptoms such as neuropathic pain. The pain is bilateral and described as numbness or burning, is usually
most severe on the soles and is the most debilitating
symptom for the patients. The ATN which is caused by
dideoxynucleoside therapy (especially ddC, ddI and
d4T) has similar clinical characteristics. However, these
dideoxynucleosides may be essential in the antiretroviral treatment and discontinuation thus aggravates the
risk of virological failure.
The pathogenesis of DSP and ATN is not known in
detail. It is presumed that the sensory neurons in the
dorsal root ganglia (DRG) could be the primary site of
lesion, which leads secondarily to a dying back process
with axonal degeneration. This results in a length-dependent degeneration of peripheral nerve fibers with
prominent involvement of small myelinated and unmyelinated fibers conducting nociception [6]. Changes
in small nerve fibers proximal to the epidermis [16] or
the formation of aberrant central connections [27]
could be possible explanations for the neuropathic pain
experienced by patients with DSP and ATN.
Treatment of painful neuropathy in HIV infection is
difficult.Numerous symptomatic therapeutic trials have
been performed with limited success, including peptide
T [22], amitriptyline [9, 21], acupuncture [21], mexiletine [9], topical capsaicin [17] and lamotrigine [23].
The anticonvulsant gabapentin (GBP) has been
demonstrated to be effective in painful diabetic neuropathy [2] and postherpetic neuralgia [19] and its effectiveness on painful HIV-SN has been published in
anecdotal series [5, 11, 15].
The mechanisms of GBP treatment effect on neuropathic pain have not been fully elucidated. As a structural analogue of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) it does
not have any direct GABAergic activity. There is evidence for a possible effect of GBP on α2-δ calcium channels, which could explain its pain relieving effect [26]. In
addition to its central allodynic effect [1], GBP has also
been shown to inhibit ectopic discharge activity from
injured nerves [18].
GBP, with its low adverse effect and drug interaction
profile, may offer an effective treatment for neuropathic
pain in HIV-infected patients. Previous studies investigating GBP in HIV-SN were open trials. Consequently,
we performed a controlled clinical trial to investigate the
efficacy of GBP in managing pain in HIV-SN.
Subjects and methods
■ Study design
We conducted a multicenter, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the effect of GBP in the treatment of painful
HIV-SN. The study was performed in an outpatient setting. Patients
of 5 clinical centers participated. The protocol and informed consent
were approved by the institutional review board of each participating
center.
Patients were observed for 3 phases: a 1-week screening phase, a
4-week double-blind phase and a 2-week open treatment phase. Patients were seen at 5 visits: an initial envollment visit (screening), a
randomisation visit (week 0, at the end of a baseline week), and 3 subsequent visits 2, 4 and 6 weeks after randomisation. After the screening phase the subjects were randomised to receive either GBP or
placebo in a double-blind design. Gabapentin dosage and matching
placebo were titrated (400 mg/day every four days) over 2 weeks up to
1200 mg/d in three divided doses. In the case of sufficient improvement the dosage was maintained at this level, but if beneficial effects
were not sufficient, the dosage was increased up to 2400 mg/d over
further 2 weeks in the same manner. After this 4-week period the
study medication was unblinded and the patient had the choice to begin, to maintain (1200 mg/d or 2400 mg/d) or to increase the GBP
dosage up to 3600 mg/d. Fig. 1 summarises the study design.
To be eligible, subjects had to have symptoms of painful HIV-SN,
diagnosed by a neurologist based on history, as well as clinical and
neurophysiological examination, had to give informed written consent, had to be aged 18 years or over and they had to have completed
a baseline pain diary over one week prior to randomisation. HIV-SN
was diagnosed according to the standard definition [3] including distal sensory symptoms (paresthesia, dysesthesia or pain), abnormal
sensory signs (elevated vibratory threshold or pin hyperalgesia), decreased or absent ankle reflexes.
Patients were excluded if they were pregnant or were taking tricyclic or tetracyclic antidepressants, other anticonvulsants, topical
capsaicin, mexiletine, alpha-liponic acid, systemic corticosteroids or
immune modulators, central analgesics or had received nerve blocks
or acupuncture. Other exclusion criteria included alternative causes
for neuropathy (i. e. diabetes mellitus, alcohol and/or drug abuse, vitamin B12 deficiency), acute or chronic pancreatitis or chronic renal
insufficiency (to avoid the necessary dosage reduction) and elevated
parameters of lipase and/or amylase. All other regular use of analgesics was discontinued or reduced to a minimum of non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (i. e. paracetamol, diclofenac). No
patient was treated with opiates during the course of the study.
■ Outcome measures
The primary outcome measure was the efficacy of GBP in improving
the painful symptoms in HIV-SN. The pain was measured twice daily
by patients in a diary using the 10-cm Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) of
Fig. 1 Study-design
1262
the Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ) ranging from
0 =no pain to 10 cm = maximal pain intensity. The primary endpoint
for assessing efficacy was the difference in the weekly median pain
score between the 4th week of treatment and the baseline week. Additionally, we assessed the range of change of weekly median pain score
over the course of the trial.
A secondary efficacy measure was the median sleep interference
score as recorded in the patients’ daily diary measured by VAS (0 = excellent sleep; 10 cm = no sleep due to pain). The safety of GBP was assessed using adverse event data in a table in the diary (somnolence,
dizziness, gait ataxia, nausea and others) ranging from mild, moderate to severe. Laboratory safety tests were assessed during visit 1 and
5 (glucose, lipase).
■ Randomisation
Randomisation was performed by producing a randomisation schedule that assigned each patient to GBP or a matching placebo. GBP and
placebo were provided as identically appearing capsules and were
packaged in subject-specific repositories from a central pharmacy.
Patients enrolled were sequentially assigned a patient number.
■ Statistical analysis
The primary efficacy parameter – change in the median pain score
from the baseline week to the 4th treatment week – was evaluated from
daily pain diaries. The score was determined by calculating the median pain score for the baseline and the 4th treatment week. The sleep
interference – the change from the baseline in median daily sleep rating score – was determined in the same manner. Differences in baseline parameters between both groups were tested with the MannWhitney U-test. Differences in change of the median pain score were
analysed using the Wilcoxon test. All statistical tests were two-tailed
and 95 % confidence intervals are provided for the primary endpoint.
We compared also both treatment regimes (GBP and placebo) for the
slope of change from the pain and sleep interference score over the
course of 5 weeks (baseline to the 4th week of treatment) by an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model.
Results
■ Baseline characteristics of study subjects
A total of 26 subjects were enrolled at baseline. 15 were
randomised to GPB and 11 to a placebo. Demographic
and baseline clinical characteristics at randomisation
are shown in Table 1. There was no statistically significant difference in distribution of sex, age, CD 4 cell
count, duration of painful neuropathy and VAS baseline
pain and sleep interference score (Mann-Whitney-Utest). The groups were well balanced also with respect to
the use of dideoxynucleoside antiretrovirals and analgesics. Table 2 summarises the details of the antiretroviral treatment of all patients at baseline.
DSP was due to HIV itself in 16 patients (no concomitant or prior [last 3 months] use of neurotoxic antiretroviral agents) and potentially associated with or
caused by neurotoxic antiretroviral drugs in 10 cases.
The latter included 7 patients with an actual concomitant antiretroviral treatment of d4T and/or ddI (GBP
n = 4; placebo n =3) and 3 patients, who had had neurotoxic antiretroviral drugs (d4T and/or ddI) in the period
of 3 months before starting the study (GBP n = 2;
placebo n = 1). Patient 15 who was initially treated with
D4T stopped the antiretroviral therapy at day 8.
■ Study experience
Fig. 2 gives an overview of the study course. From the 26
patients one patient dropped out during the doubleblind phase in each group (patient 5 and 19). The patient
in the GBP-group discontinued the study because of adverse effects (dizziness, somnolence) two days after
treatment with 400 mg GBP. There were 2 patients (paCharacteristics GBP placebo p value

tient 20, 22) in the placebo group, who did not start GBP
treatment after unblinding the study in visit 4 for personal reasons.One patient in the GBP-group (patient 10)
discontinued after 6 weeks owing to inefficacy. Thus, 24
patients (92.3 %) completed the blinded treatment period (GBP n = 14, placebo n = 10) and 21 patients
(80.8 %) completed the whole 7-week study (GBP n = 13,
placebo n = 8).
■ Outcome
GBP-treated patients had notable pain relief measured
by their weekly median pain score after four weeks of
treatment (n = 15, median baseline week = 5.1, median
4th week of treatment = 2.85, –44.1 %). The pain VAS in
the 4th week compared with the baseline was significantly lower (Wilcoxon-test; p < 0.05). We observed also
a decrease of the pain score in the placebo-treated patients (n = 11, median of the baseline week = 4.7, median
4th week of treatment = 3.3, –29.8 %) but this was not significant (Wilcoxon-test, p = 0.646). Fig. 3 illustrates the
curve of the pain for the baseline week and the 4-week
blinded-phase.
The GBP effect included a significant decrease of the
sleep interference score (median baseline week = 4.5,
median 4th week of treatment = 2.3, –48.9 % [Wilcoxontest, p < 0.05]) compared with the placebo-group (median baseline week = 5.6, median 4th week of treatment = 4.95, –11.6 % [Wilcoxon-test, p = 0, 575]) as
shown in Fig. 4. Thus GBP was more effective than
placebo in reducing pain and sleep interference in patients with HIV-SN.

terference score from the baseline week to the 4th week
of treatment. In this analysis the change of the pain and
also the sleep interference score in the GBP-treated
group was significant (pain and sleep score p < 0.05).
This did not apply to the placebo-group (change of pain
score p = 0.175, change of sleep score p = 0.243). However, a comparison of the changes between GBP and
placebo-group over 5 weeks did not show a significant
difference for the pain score or for the sleep interference
score.
■ Effects on analgesic use
The concomitant analgesic self-treatment of the patients
was low. At visit 1 patients were instructed to discontinue or to reduce all regular use of analgesics. In the
baseline week there were 2 patients (18.2 %) in the
placebo-group, who took NSAID and 3 (20 %) in the
GBP-group. The situation was similar after 4 weeks of
treatment. There was one patient in the placebo-group
and one in the GBP-group who took NSAID. The differences between both groups were not significant
(p = 0.931).
■ Adverse events
The most frequent adverse effects are shown in Table 3.
There was only one patient in the GBP-group, who discontinued the study because of severe dizziness and somnolence two days after the initiation of a daily treatment
of 400 mg GBP.Apart from this patient GBP was generally
well tolerated in the study subjects. Somnolence was the
most frequently reported side effect in 80 % of GBPtreated patients in a range from mild to severe. This was
significant (p < 0.05) compared with the placebo-group.
Dizziness,gait ataxia and nausea were also more frequent
in the GBP-group, but compared with placebo-treated
patients not statistically significant.
There were also no significant changes in lipase or
blood glucose after 4 weeks of treatment with GBP
(n = 12). We observed only a slight increase of lipase to
88 U/l and to 94 U/l in two patients and a slight elevation
of the blood glucose to 135 mg/dl in two patients.
Discussion
We have assessed the efficacy and safety of GBP in reducing pain attributed to HIV-SN by conducting a multicenter, prospective, randomised, double-blind,
placebo-controlled trial.
The trial did not depend on electrophysiological data
because DSP as well as ATN show a predominant pathological involvement of the small sensory fibers [25] of
the intradermal nerve endings, which include both ADelta and C fibers that convey slow nociception. The
small fibers cannot be evaluated with standard electrodiagnostic studies,because nerve conduction studies assess only large sensory and motor fibers. Thus, the diagnosis is predominantly a clinical one made by a
neurologist.
The results of our study show that GBP was more effective in reducing the pain and the sleep interference
score in HIV-SN than placebo. Notably, we found also a
placebo response in the pain score (–29.8 %) in this trial
but the response to GBP was much larger (–44.1 %).
High and variable placebo responses are typical of pain
studies [14].
Two large, randomised clinical trials including patients with diabetic neuropathy [2] and patients with
postherpetic neuralgia [19] have demonstrated the efficacy of GBP in treating neuropathic pain titrated up to

3600 mg/day. The most common adverse effects were
somnolence (up to 27.4 %), dizziness (23.9 %), ataxia
(7.1 %), nausea (8.3 %) and peripheral edema (9.7 %).
Dizziness and somnolence led in a few patients to withdrawal from the study. We observed a higher rate of adverse effects. Of the patients in the GBP-group 80 % reported somnolence, 60 % dizziness, 46.6 % ataxia and
33.3 % nausea at a maximum GBP dosage of
2400 mg/day. There was only one patient, who discontinued the study because of adverse effects and this patient was treated with the very low dosage of 400 mg
daily only. Therefore, the high dosage chosen for study
cannot sufficiently explain the high rate of adverse effects.We also observed a higher rate of adverse effects in
the placebo-group (somnolence 18.2 %, dizziness
45.5 %, ataxia 27.3 % and nausea 18.2 %) than described
in the above cited studies. The detailed information provided to the patients before commencing the study may
have subconsciously drawn their attention to these
symptoms. No serious adverse effects were observed.
The principal limitation of this study is the small number of enrolled subjects because of the very strict inclusion criteria, so that reported adverse effects of only a
few subjects have a greater influence for the whole study
group.
The study population included 10 patients with a
neuropathy potentially associated or caused by neurotoxic antiretroviral drugs. One patient stopped the antiretroviral neurotoxic exposure after 8 days, but it is
known that the symptoms of an ATN continue or even
worsen for up to approximately 6–8 weeks despite withdrawal of the offending drug. Because of the small number of enrolled subjects we did not differentiate the efficacy of GBP between patients with a DSP or ATN
further.
At present there is no standard regimen for treatment
of painful HIV-SN. Agents commonly applied in neuropathic pain including amitriptyline, mexiletine and topical capsaicin did not show any advantage over placebo
[9, 17, 21] in double-blind trials, neither did peptide T
[22] or acupuncture [21]. Carbamazepine should be
used only very cautiously in HIV-infected patients who
are treated with protease inhibitors or non-nucleoside
analogue antiretroviral agents, because of its interaction
spectrum.GBP, conversely, can be easily applied because
of its lack of interaction with antiretroviral therapy.
Lamotrigine up to 300 mg was significantly effective
compared with placebo in HIV-associated neuropathy
but not in ATN [23], but 25 % of the lamotrigine-treated
patients discontinued the study because of allergic skin
reactions. In a new prospective, double-blind, placebocontrolled trial in a larger cohort [24] lamotrigine was
well tolerated and effective for neuropathic pain in patients with neurotoxic antiretroviral therapy. An alternative treatment could be also recombinant human
nerve growth factor which is reported to be effective in
painful HIV-SN [13, 20].
Previous studies investigating GBP in HIV-SN were
open trials [5, 11, 15]. Therefore, the reported effectiveness of GBP needed to be confirmed using a controlled
study design. The present double-blind, placebo-controlled trial closed this gap, although a small number of
patients were included.
In summary, the present study demonstrates the efficacy of GBP in relieving pain and sleep interference in
patients with HIV-SN.
