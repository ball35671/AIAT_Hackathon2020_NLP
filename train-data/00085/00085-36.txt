Abstract Background: Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is a neuropathic pain syndrome
that may develop subsequent to healing of herpes zoster rash.
Objectives: This study aimed to determine the efficacy and safety of gabapentin extended-release (gabapentin ER) tablets for the treatment of patients
with PHN and to determine whether optimal benefits might be achieved with
once-daily (QD) or divided-dose (DD) administration.
Methods: This was a 10-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
multicentre trial comparing gabapentin ER (total daily dose 1800 mg) either
QD or as an asymmetrical DD with placebo in 407 patients with post-zoster
pain for ‡3 months and a baseline average daily pain score (ADP) ‡4 on a 0–10
Likert numerical rating scale. The primary efficacy outcome was the ADP score
mean change from baseline to week 10 using baseline observation carried
forward (BOCF). Secondary efficacy outcomes included changes to week 10
in last observation carried forward (LOCF) ADP score, LOCF average daily
sleep interference score, Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire score,
Neuropathic Pain Scale score, and Brief Pain Inventory score.
Results: Of 407 randomized patients, 400 were included in the intent-to-treat
population (gabapentin ER QD, n = 134; gabapentin ER DD, n = 135; placebo,
n = 131). Between-group differences in the least squares (LS) mean changes in
BOCF ADP scores did not reach statistical significance (gabapentin ER QD
-1.85 [p = 0.110 vs placebo]; gabapentin ER DD -1.72 [p = 0.255 vs placebo];
placebo -1.42). In the LOCF analysis, the LS mean ADP score for the gabapentin ER QD group, but not for the DD group, improved compared with
placebo (gabapentin ER QD, -2.28; p = 0.032 vs placebo). Improvements compared with placebo were also observed in the gabapentin ER QD group, but
not for the DD group, for mean daily sleep interference scores (gabapentin

ER QD, -2.49; placebo, -1.63; p < 0.001). Most adverse events (AEs) were
mild or moderate. Among gabapentin-treated patients, 12% and 11% withdrew due to AEs, most commonly for dizziness (2% and 3%), in the gabapentin ER QD and DD groups, respectively. Treatment-related AEs in the
gabapentin ER-treated groups occurred in 31% of patients. The most common AEs in the gabapentin ER QD and DD groups included dizziness (10%
and 15%), headache (4% and 7%), somnolence (3% and 7%) and peripheral
oedema (5% and 5%), respectively.
Conclusion: The primary efficacy endpoint for this study of gabapentin ER
was not met, most likely due to the unexpectedly large placebo response.
Outcomes on secondary endpoints suggest the potential efficacy of gabapentin ER QD. Gabapentin ER was well tolerated in this study.

Introduction
Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is a neuropathic
pain syndrome that often follows the resolution
of herpes zoster rash (shingles) and is usually defined by the persistence of pain for ‡3 months.[1]
The incidence of PHN among herpes zoster
patients is usually estimated at between 10% and
20%, with both the percentage of patients experiencing pain and the severity of the pain increasing with age.[2] The pain experienced by patients
with PHN may include constant burning, aching
or throbbing pain, intermittent sharp, shooting
pain, or allodynia,[2] and can profoundly affect
quality of life.[3]
PHN is often refractory to treatment with conventional analgesic therapies. Despite the availability of several treatments with demonstrated
efficacy, this condition is still challenging.[4,5] The
antiepileptic drug gabapentin has been shown to
be efficacious but the dosing regimen involves
‡3 daily doses.[6] In addition, gabapentin absorption occurs via a saturable transport mechanism,
and therefore diminishing returns on efficacy are
observed as the dosage is increased.[7]
An extended-release formulation of gabapentin
(gabapentin ER) that employs a gastric retentive
technology is being investigated for the treatment
of PHN.[8] The gradual release of gabapentin ER
from the stomach allows continuous delivery to
the optimal site of absorption in the intestine over
approximately 10 hours.[9] Drug exposure following administration of gabapentin ER 1800 mg once
daily (QD) or an asymmetrical divided dose (DD;
600 mg am, 1200 mg pm) was shown to provide
comparable exposure with an identical daily dose
of the immediate-release formulation administered three times per day.[9] In a 4-week, phase II
clinical trial, the DD of gabapentin ER was demonstrated to provide significant improvements
compared with placebo on a variety of pain scales.[10]
A similar trend was observed for the QD dose,
although it did not consistently reach statistical
significance, but patients in both the QD and DD
groups also demonstrated significant improvements in sleep interference compared with placebo.
The current study was conducted to investigate the efficacy and safety of gabapentin ER for
treatment of patients with PHN and to determine
whether optimal benefits might be achieved with
QD or DD administration.
Patients and Methods
This was a randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled, multicentre trial conducted at 95 US
study centres between May 2006 and July 2007
(Clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT00335933). The
study protocol was approved by the institutional
review board at each centre and was conducted in
accordance with the International Committee on
Harmonization of Good Clinical Practice (GCP).

Written informed consent was obtained from
each patient or a legal representative prior to
screening.
Patients
The study enrolled male and female patients
aged ‡18 years who had experienced neuropathic
pain for ‡3 months after the healing of acute
herpes zoster skin rash and who continued to
experience pain intensity of ‡4 on a Likert numerical rating scale (NRS) of 0 (no pain) to 10
(worst possible pain) at the end of a 1-week study
baseline. Patients were required to have a washout period of >5 times the half-life of any benzodiazepines, muscle relaxants, oral corticosteroids,
capsaicin, mexiletine, centrally acting analgesics,
opioids, topical lidocaine (lignocaine), antiepileptics and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors. Eligible patients being treated with gabapentin
or pregabalin at screening had their dose tapered
over 7 days and underwent a further washout period
of 2–3 days prior to the baseline week. Females of
childbearing potential were required to have a negative pregnancy test at screening/randomization,
and to use acceptable methods of birth control
throughout the study.
For ethical reasons, patients were excluded if they
had previously not responded to treatment with
gabapentin at doses of ‡1200 mg/day or pregabalin
at doses ‡300 mg/day, had experienced dose-limiting
adverse events (AEs) with gabapentin, or had hypersensitivity to gabapentin. Other exclusion criteria included neurolytic/neurosurgical treatment
for PHN, severe pain from causes other than PHN,
use of injected anaesthetics or corticosteroids
within 30 days of baseline, immunocompromised
state, creatinine clearance <50 mL/min, gastric reduction surgery, history of substance abuse within
the past year or any skin condition that could alter
sensation in the area affected by the neuropathy.
Study Design
After an initial screening visit and an appropriate period of washout of any medications that
were discontinued, patients underwent a 1-week
pretreatment period to establish baseline measurements. Patients who continued to meet the
pain score eligibility requirements at the end of
the baseline week were randomized to treatment
with gabapentin ER 1800 mg QD (taken with the
evening meal), gabapentin ER 1800 mg DD
(600 mg am with breakfast/1200 mg pm with the
evening meal) or placebo for the 10-week doubleblind treatment phase. The allocation sequence,
prepared by PPD Development LLC (Wilmington,
NC, USA), was a parallel 1 : 1 : 1 randomization
stratified by site. Allocation was performed by
assigning to each patient at the time of randomization the next available patient number corresponding to a blinded medication carton. To
maintain study blinding, the randomization code
was kept in a secure place and patients received
an appropriate combination of active drug and
placebo tablets in identical blister packs. For patients randomized to active treatment, doses were
gradually escalated from 300 to 1800 mg/day over
15 days, maintained at 1800 mg/day until the end
of week 10, and then tapered for 1 week.
Patients taking stable doses of antidepressants,
such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or
tricyclic antidepressants, or paracetamol (acetaminophen) up to 4000 mg/day for ‡30 days prior
to screening, were continued at their stable dose
throughout the study. Selective norepinephrine
reuptake inhibitors were not permitted.
Patients were assessed at screening, at the end
of the baseline week and at weeks 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10
(end of study period). Daily pain scores and daily
sleep interference scores rated for the previous
24 hours using the NRS were recorded by patients
each morning using an electronic diary (DiaryPRO, invivodata, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) from the
beginning of the baseline week to the end of the
efficacy treatment period (treatment week 10).
Patients also completed the Short-Form McGill
Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ)[11] and Neuropathic
Pain Scale (NPS)[12] at baseline and at weeks 2,
4, 8 and 10. The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI)[13]
was completed at baseline and every 2 weeks until
study end. The Patient Global Impression of
Change (PGIC) and the Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC) were completed at the
end-of-study assessment.
The primary efficacy endpoint was the least
squares (LS) mean change from baseline to week 10

using baseline observation carried forward (BOCF)
for the average daily pain (ADP) score. Comparisons were made for each treatment group with
placebo. Secondary efficacy variables included
LS mean changes to week 10 for BOCF daily sleep
interference score, last observation carried forward (LOCF) ADP score, daily sleep interference
score, SF-MPQ score, NPS score, BPI score and
the end-of-study assessments of PGIC and CGIC.
In addition, the proportion of responders (‡50%
reduction in ADP score at endpoint) was assessed.
Other analyses performed included betweentreatment comparisons of both the BOCF and
LOCF ADP scores by treatment week, as well as
analyses of the BOCF ADP score by age, sex and
time since resolution of the herpes zoster rash.
AEs were recorded throughout the study, and
physical examinations and laboratory tests were
performed at screening and study end.
Statistics
The primary null hypothesis tested was that
there was no treatment difference in the LS mean
change for the BOCF ADP score from baseline to
week 10 of the efficacy treatment period between
each gabapentin ER treatment group and the placebo treatment group. Assuming an 80% study
completion rate and a significance level of a = 0.025
for two pairwise comparisons (primary endpoint),
it was determined that a sample size of 378 patients (126 per treatment arm) would have 90%
power to detect a difference of 0.7 in the ADP
score from baseline to study end. For analysis of
demographics and baseline characteristics, data
were pooled for all study centres, an ANOVA
model including the treatment factor was used to
analyse the numerical data, and Fisher’s exact
test was used to analyse the categorical data. Efficacy analyses were performed on the intent-totreat (ITT) population (all randomized patients
who received study medication). The BOCF or
LOCF methods were used to calculate efficacy
endpoints with missing data. Analysis of the primary efficacy outcome was performed using an
analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) parallel lines
model that included treatment, centre and baseline ADP score as covariates. Calculations included the LS estimate of the mean change with
each treatment and its 95% confidence interval
(CI) as well as a 95% CI of the pairwise difference
between each treatment group and placebo (treatment minus placebo) for the mean change in
ADP score.
An ANOVA model including treatment and
centre or a parallel lines ANCOVA model including treatment, centre and baseline measurement
as the covariate was used for the analysis of continuous secondary efficacy measurements. Patients
from all study centres were pooled for the analysis of the categorical outcome data.
For the analysis of the proportion of responders, the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test stratified
by the baseline pain score category (ADP score
<8 vs ‡8) was used for the overall comparison.
For the analysis of ordinal categorical data (PGIC
and CGIC), a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test of
general association with modified ridit scores was
used for the overall comparison among all treatment groups. For the analysis of the dichotomous
outcome data, a two-sided Fisher’s exact test
was used for the overall comparison among all
treatment groups. In addition, a two-sample Z
test on two proportions between each gabapentin ER treatment versus placebo treatment was
performed.
The statistical tests for the analysis of the primary efficacy parameter were performed at the
a = 0.025 significance level owing to two pairwise
comparisons between each gabapentin ER treatment group and the placebo group (0.05/2 for two
comparisons). The statistical tests used for the
analysis of baseline variables and secondary efficacy parameters were performed at the a = 0.05
significance level. All tests were two-sided. The
safety population included all patients who received at least one dose of study medication.
Fisher’s exact test was used to compare the incidence of most frequent or severe AEs among
treatment groups.
Results
In total, 526 patients were enrolled and 407
were randomized (figure 1). Two patients did not
receive study medication and five patients from
768 Wallace et al.

one study centre were excluded from the ITT
population due to protocol deviation (GCP violations) but were included in the safety population.
Additionally, 11 patients received non-randomized
treatment. For the efficacy evaluation they were
included in the group in which they were originally randomized; for the safety evaluation they
were assigned to the actual medication received.
Thus, 400 patients were included in the ITT population (figure 1) and 405 in the safety population.
Among 82 patients who prematurely discontinued study medication during the efficacy treatment period, the most common reason was AEs
(n = 45; gabapentin ER QD, n = 16; DD, n = 15;
placebo, n = 14).
Baseline clinical and demographic characteristics were mostly similar between groups, although
there were fewer males in the gabapentin ER QD
group compared with both the gabapentin ER
DD and placebo groups (table I). Compared with
both the gabapentin ER DD and placebo groups,
numerically fewer patients in the gabapentin ER
QD group were using concomitant nonopioid
pain medications. There were no significant differences across treatment groups at baseline in LS
mean ADP score, mean SF-MPQ visual analogue
scale score or mean NPS score at screening. Most
randomized patients (291/407) did not require
any washout of pain medications prior to study
entry.

Efficacy
The LS mean BOCF ADP scores at baseline
were 6.50, 6.39 and 6.78 for the gabapentin ER
QD, gabapentin ER DD and placebo groups, respectively (table I). In the BOCF analysis, greater
numerical decreases in ADP score were observed
in both of the gabapentin ER treatment groups
compared with the placebo group, but these differences did not reach statistical significance
(table II). When analysed by treatment week,
BOCF ADP scores were reduced for the gabapentin ER QD group compared with placebo from
weeks 1–7, whereas they were reduced for the
gabapentin ER DD group only from weeks 1–4
(figure 2a).
Further analyses of BOCF ADP scores did not
demonstrate any differences at endpoint according to subject age (<65 vs ‡65 years) or sex (results
not shown). However, in the subgroup whose rash
had healed ‡6 months prior to study entry, the reduction in the LS mean ADP score for the gabapentin ER QD group was greater than for placebo
(table II). In addition, in the subgroup whose rash
had healed <6 months prior to study entry, the reduction in the LS mean ADP score was numerically greater in the placebo group compared with
either gabapentin ER treatment group (table II).

In the LOCF analysis, the change from baseline
in LS mean ADP score was greater for the gabapentin ER QD group (-2.28, p = 0.032), but not
for the gabapentin ER DD group (-2.08, p = 0.154),
compared with placebo (-1.69) [table II]. There
were no differences between the proportions of
patients in each group who had ‡50% decrease in
pain scores (gabapentin ER QD, 49/134 [p = 0.113
compared with placebo]; gabapentin ER DD,
46/135 [p = 0.244 compared with placebo]; placebo, 36/131). In the LOCF analysis by treatment week,
ADP scores were reduced for the gabapentin ER
QD group compared with placebo during all
study weeks except week 9, whereas they were
reduced for the gabapentin ER DD group only
during weeks 1–4 (figure 2b).
The LOCF average daily sleep interference
scores were reduced from baseline in the gabapentin
ER QD group compared with placebo (table II).
In the analysis by treatment week, LOCF average
daily sleep interference scores were reduced for
the gabapentin ER QD group compared with
placebo during all study weeks, whereas they
were reduced for the gabapentin ER DD group
only during weeks 1, 2 and 4 (figure 2c).
Among other secondary efficacy endpoints,
differences between gabapentin ER QD and placebo were observed for SF-MPQ visual analogue
scale and present pain intensity scores; for the
NPS on the average of all ten pain items, average
of eight descriptors, non-allodynia items and peripheral pain items; and for the BPI on the worst
pain score in the last 24 hours, average pain score
and current pain score (table II). No significant
differences on these endpoints were observed for
gabapentin ER DD. For the PGIC, 55/125, 44/
115 and 32/116 of patients in the gabapentin ER
QD, gabapentin ER DD and placebo groups, respectively, were rated as very much or much improved (p = 0.008 and p = 0.084 for gabapentin
ER QD vs placebo and gabapentin ER DD vs
placebo, respectively). For the CGIC, 58/123,
46/120 and 32/116 of patients in the gabapentin
ER QD, gabapentin ER DD and placebo groups,
respectively, were rated as very much or much
improved (p = 0.002 and p = 0.081 for gabapentin
ER QD vs placebo and gabapentin ER DD vs
placebo, respectively).
Safety
At least one AE was experienced by 78/138, 77/
134 and 64/133 patients in the gabapentin ER QD,
gabapentin ER DD and placebo groups, respectively.

These AEs were judged to be treatment-related in
41/138, 44/134 and 29/133 patients, respectively
(table III). The majority of AEs were mild to moderate in severity. The most frequent treatmentemergent AEs were nervous system disorders
(affecting 27/138 patients receiving gabapentin
ER QD, 34/134 patients receiving gabapentin ER
DD and 16/133 patients receiving placebo) and
gastrointestinal disorders (affecting 19/138 patients
receiving gabapentin ER QD, 21/134 patients receiving gabapentin ER DD and 22/133 patients receiving placebo). Among the most common AEs (‡5%
in any treatment group), there were differences across treatment groups in the incidence of dizziness (p = 0.002) and peripheral oedema (p = 0.017)
[table III].
Serious AEs were reported for 14 patients
(table III). All except one (severe headache in a
patient in the gabapentin ER DD group) were
considered unrelated to study drug. One patient
in the placebo group experienced a myocardial
infarction 3 days after randomization and died
2 days later.
Forty-six patients (16/138, 15/134 and 15/133
in the gabapentin ER QD, gabapentin ER DD and
placebo groups, respectively) experienced AEs
that led to study discontinuation (table III). The
most common AEs leading to discontinuation
were dizziness (gabapentin ER QD, n = 3; gabapentin ER DD, n = 4; placebo, n = 2) and headache (gabapentin ER QD, n = 1; gabapentin ER
DD, n = 2; placebo, n = 2). All except one of these
AEs (headache) were considered possibly or probably related to study drug.
Discussion
Although ADP scores were reduced with gabapentin ER treatment in this study, the BOCF
primary efficacy endpoint did not reach statistical significance. This was probably due to the unexpectedly large reduction in LS mean ADP scores
in the placebo group (-1.42 BOCF, -1.69 LOCF).
In fact, the magnitude of treatment-associated
decreases in LOCF daily pain scores (-2.3 gabapentin ER QD; -2.1 gabapentin ER DD) was similar to LOCF observations from previous studies
of gabapentin immediate release (total daily dose
1800 mg, -2.2; 2400 mg, -2.3;[14] 3600 mg, -2.1[15])
despite differences in drug formulation (short
acting vs extended release) and study designs (e.g.
duration and dose). However, the responses of
the placebo groups in those previous trials were
substantially smaller (average change in daily
pain scores, -0.5[15] and -0.9[14]).
The placebo response has complicated other
recent trials of agents to treat neuropathic pain,
and the potential contribution by such factors as

patient recruitment and trial duration has been
suggested.[16,17] Unlike in some other neuropathic
pain syndromes, spontaneous resolution of pain
in PHN also has the potential to interfere substantially with demonstration of treatment effects.
The possibility that this confounded the results of
the current study may be supported by the especially robust placebo response in the subset of
patients whose rash had healed more recently
(<6 months). In a study of herpes zoster vaccine,
almost half of the placebo patients (36/81) with
PHN at 3 months after onset of the herpes zoster
rash were no longer considered to have PHN at
6 months.[18] Thus, patients with a shorter history
of PHN might be more likely to demonstrate spontaneous resolution of pain.
Despite missing statistical significance on the
primary endpoint, treatment-associated improvements were observed on many of the secondary
endpoints. The magnitude of treatment effects
observed was greater in the group of patients who
received a QD dose compared with those who
received DD therapy. This contrasts with the results from an earlier study of shorter duration
(4 weeks), in which the DD appeared to demonstrate advantages compared with the QD dose.[10]
This difference between the studies might be attributable in part to the duration of each, because
outcomes in the earlier study were not significantly different over the 4-week duration and
treatment responses in the current study were similar over the first 4 weeks. On the other hand, it
is not possible to exclude a contribution by a potential imbalance in randomization. For example,
the difference between studies might conceivably
be related to the inclusion in the current study of
fewer males in the gabapentin ER QD group
compared with both other groups. However, sex
did not appear to contribute to differences in responses to treatment. Alternatively, since numerically fewer patients in the QD group of the current
study used concomitant analgesic medications
compared with both other groups, this might have
reflected an imbalance in another unidentified
characteristic.
Gabapentin ER was well tolerated in this
study, and the incidence and nature of AEs were
those expected for this patient population. In
addition, the total rates of AEs, treatment-related
AEs and AEs leading to withdrawal were similar
among groups. The incidences of dizziness and
somnolence in the gabapentin ER QD group were
substantially lower than in the previous study
with gabapentin ER,[10] and there was no obvious
relationship between somnolence and gabapentin
ER QD dosing in this study. In fact, the overall
incidences of both dizziness and somnolence in
both studies with gabapentin ER were lower than
observed in previous studies of immediate-release
gabapentin.[14,15]
The extent to which these study results can be
generalized is limited by the enrichment protocol
that excluded patients who previously did not tolerate gabapentin or pregabalin. However, ethical
issues preclude enrolling patients who have experienced lack of efficacy or intolerable AEs with an
agent into another study evaluating the same agent.
Despite this enrichment design, the patient population was comparable with that of other PHN
studies and typical of the general PHN population in terms of patient age and other characteristics. Furthermore, notwithstanding this limitation,
the design of this study was very similar to that of
published studies of gabapentin and pregabalin,
so comparison of results with data for these treatments may be considered useful.
Conclusion
Although the BOCF analysis of the primary
endpoint of this study did not provide conclusive
support for gabapentin ER as a treatment for PHN,
many of the secondary endpoints suggested the
potential for benefits of gabapentin ER in these
patients. In addition, this study identified duration
of PHN as a potentially important confounder,
a finding that may prove useful in designing future studies of prospective therapies. Further studies are needed to clarify the potential efficacy of
gabapentin ER 1800 mg QD as a treatment for
PHN.
