Background and Objectives: Severe phantom limbpain after surgical amputation affects 50% to 67% of
patients and is difficult to treat. Gabapentin is effective in several syndromes of neuropathic pain. Therefore, we
evaluated its analgesic efficacy in phantom limbpain.
Methods: Patients attending a multidisciplinary pain clinic with phantom limbpain were enrolled into this
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study. Other anticonvulsant therapy was discontinued. Each treatment was 6 weeks separated by a 1-week washout period. Codeine/paracetamol was allowed as
rescue analgesia. The daily dose of gabapentin was titrated in increments of 300 mg to 2,400 mg or the
maximum tolerated dose. Patients were assessed at weekly intervals. The primary outcome measure was visual
analog scale (VAS) pain intensity difference (PID) compared with baseline at the end of each treatment.
Secondary measures were indices of sleep interference, depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression [HAD]
scale), and activities of daily living (Bartel Index).
Results: Nineteen eligible patients (mean age, 56 years; range, 24 to 68 years; 16 men) were randomized, of
whom 14 completed both arms of the study. Both placebo and gabapentin treatments resulted in reduced VAS
scores compared with baseline. PID was significantly greater than placebo for gabapentin therapy at the end of
the treatment (3.2  2.1 v 1.6  0.7, P  .03). There were no significant differences between placebo and
gabapentin therapy in terms of the number of tablets of rescue medication required, sleep interference, HAD
scale, or Bartel Index. The medication was well tolerated with few reports of adverse effects.
Conclusions: After 6 weeks, gabapentin monotherapy was better than placebo in relieving postamputation
phantom limbpain. There were no significant differences in mood, sleep interference, or activities of daily living,
but a type II error cannot be excluded for these variables. Reg Anesth Pain Med 2002;27:481-486.

Phantom limbpain is a form of neuropathic
pain, which affects a large proportion of amputees, with an incidence of 50% to 67% 6 months
after the amputation.1,2 It is associated with significant patient suffering and is notoriously difficult to
treat.3,4 A wide variety of treatments have been
proposed, but a review of the subject concluded
that evidence-based guidelines for treatment cannot be given because of an absence of properly
controlled clinical trials of available and currently
used treatment strategies.5
Gabapentin [1-(Aminomethyl) cyclohexane acetic acid] is a structural analogue of [Gamma]–aminobutyric acid [GABA], which was initially introduced in 1994 as an antiepileptic drug, particularly
for partial seizures.6 For many years, antiepileptic
drugs, such as carbamazepine, have been recognized as adjunctive drugs for treating neuropathic
pain syndrome.7 Small doses of tricyclic antidepressants have also been effective in certain types of
neuropathic pain, such as diabetic neuropathy.8
Gabapentin has been shown to be effective in a
number of neuropathic pain states, including postherpetic neuralgia and diabetic neuropathy.9,10
Data are lacking for gabapentin use in postamputation phantom pain patients. Accordingly, we evaluated its analgesic efficacy, effect on mood, sleep,
activities of daily living, and tolerability in patients
with an established surgical amputation using a ranFrom the Departments of Anaesthesia and Pain Management

clinical trial design.
Methods
Patients
After hospital Ethics Committee approval and
written informed consent, patients attending our
Disablement Services Clinic, with established phantom limbpain of a minimum of 6 months duration
after a previous surgical amputation, were invited
to participate in this study. The study period was
from February 1999 to March 2000. At screening,
eligible patients had phantom pain after surgical
amputation of at least 6 months duration, were
between 18 and 75 years, and had a pain score of at
least 40 mm on a 100-mm visual analog scale
(VAS). Patients with coexisting epilepsy or a known
allergy to gabapentin were excluded. Other exclusion criteria included significant hepatic or renal
insufficiency, severe hematologic disease, a history
of illicit drug or alcohol abuse, any serious psychiatric condition, and patients with other severe pain
that could confound the assessment. Concomitant
tricyclic antidepressants were continued if therapy
was stabilized before study entry and remained
constant during the study. Codeine (30 mg) and
paracetamol (500 mg) in a combination tablet was
allowed as supplementary rescue medication and
could be taken in doses of up to 2 tablets at 4 hourly
intervals. Patients were asked to document the
number of these tablets consumed during the study
period.
Study Design
This was a randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled, cross-over clinical trial. Eligibility was
confirmed and consent obtained at the patients’
first visit. Patients completed baseline assessments
of pain severity, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HAD), the Barthel Index (a score of
ability to perform activities of daily living independently) and a Sleep Interference Scale. A full medical history and physical examination were also
documented. Daily diaries facilitating self-documentation of these factors were issued to patients
during this first visit. During the screening phase (1
week), patients were asked to discontinue muscle
relaxants, other anticonvulsants, and topical analgesics. Previously prescribed tricyclic antidepressants in low dose were continued if therapy was
stabilized and remained constant throughout the
study. All patients were phoned at weekly intervals
to maximize compliance and visited in their homes
at 2 weekly intervals for data collection.
Randomization
Diaries kept during the screening phase were reviewed after 1 week. Patients who had an average
VAS pain score of 40 mm during episodes of phantom pain and who remained eligible for the study
were randomized in double-blind fashion to receive
either placebo or gabapentin medication. The randomization technique was by computer-generated
random numbers, which was organized by our hospital pharmacist. The hospital pharmacists were also
responsible for issuing identical, coded medication
bottles containing identical tablets of gabapentin or
placebo.
Treatment Phases
All participating patients received 2 periods of
medication: patients received both 6 weeks therapy
with gabapentin and a further 6 weeks therapy
with placebo. At the end of the first period, there
was a 1 week wash-out interval, in which patients
did not receive any trial medication. During this
time, patients were asked to take only any ongoing
medication, which they were allowed during the
trial and the prescribed rescue medication. In the
first week of the study, patients increased the number of tablets of medication consumed progressively
by 1 tablet per day. This was to enable gradually
titrated doses of gabapentin to be achieved, commencing at 300 mg on day 1 and increasing to the
maximum tolerated dose or 2,400 mg maximum,
taken in 3 divided doses. All patients were provided
with an equal number of capsules, and all patients
were phoned at weekly intervals to remind them to
complete their daily diaries.
Outcome Measures
Primary outcome measure was VAS pain intensity difference (PID) compared with baseline at the
end of each treatment. Categorical pain intensity of
episodes of phantom pain (0  none, 1  mild pain,
2  moderate pain, 3  severe pain) were also
documented daily. Secondary measures were indices of sleep interference, mood using the HAD scale,
and activities of daily living (Barthel index). The
amount of prescribed rescue medication consumed
was also a secondary outcome measure. The HAD
scale consists of a questionnaire in the form of 14
statements to which the patient could indicate the
extent to which they concurred or disagreed. Each
response received a score, with higher scores indicating greater degress of depression and anxiety. Its
reliability has recently been validated and normative data provided to enable given scores to be
placed in context.11 The Barthel index consists of
482 Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine Vol. 27 No. 5 September–October 2002
listing 10 activities of daily living and personal care
(e.g., combing hair, bladder, and bowel toileting,
etc.), with a 3-or 4-point scale depending upon the
level of assistance the patient required for each task.
Higher scores indicated a higher degree of dependence. Its reliability in measurement of basic activities of daily living and mobility has recently been
validated.12 The Sleep Interference scale described
how the phantom pain had interfered with the
patient’s sleep during the previous 24 hours. It was
rated on an 11-point scale, ranging from 0, “did not
interfere” to 10, “unable to sleep due to this pain.”
Statistical Analysis
The power calculation for this study was based on
VAS scores. Previous studies indicate that the worst
daily pain score during episodes of phantom limb
pain are on the order of 40 to 50 mm and that the
standard deviation of such pain is on the order of 25
mm.11-14 Taking a VAS improvement of 25 mm as
being clinically significant, n  16 patients would
be required to complete both arms of therapy for a
type 1 error  .05 and a type 2 error  .2 (power,
80%). All analyses were conducted using the intention-to-treat population, defined as all randomized
patients who received at least 1 dose of study medication. Patients with no data recorded for a parameter were automatically excluded from the analysis
of that parameter. Pain intensity difference is defined as the difference between the pain at baseline
and the pain at a particular time point subsequently. Daily PID scores were averaged on a
weekly basis. Mean PID values between gabapentin
and placebo periods were then compared by analysis of variance (ANOVA). Post hoc Dunnett’s test
was applied after repeat-measures ANOVA. All data
were tested for distribution using the KolmogorovSmirnov test. Secondary outcome data involving
sleep interference scores, Barthel index, and the
HAD scale were not normally distributed; therefore,
the Kruskal-Wallis test was used, with Mann-Whitney post hoc test. P  .05 was considered significant.
Results
Thirty-three eligible patients attending the Disablement Services Clinic were invited to be
screened for participation in the study. After the
initial 1-week screening period, n  19 were randomized, 10 to receive gabapentin as the first treatment and 9 to receive placebo as the first treatment.
The reasons for not randomizing patients are shown
in Fig 1. Data from these 19 patients were included
in the results presented, using intention-to-treat
analysis. Six patients who commenced placebo as
the first treatment completed both arms of the
study cycle compared with 8 patients who commenced with gabapentin.
The characteristics of the 19 randomized patients
are outlined in Table 1. Weekly VAS and categorical
pain scores are shown in Table 2. There was a
significant reduction in pain in weeks 2, 4, and 5 in
the placebo arm and in weeks 2, 3, and 5 in the
gabapentin arm compared with baseline pain
scores, indicating that a significant placebo effect
was observed. Categorical pain scores were not significantly different between the groups either at
baseline or at the end of therapy. Weekly PIDs are
shown in Table 3. There was no significant difference between placebo and gabapentin therapy up
to week 5. However, a significant difference in PID
was observed at week 6, indicating a greater degree
of pain relief in patients receiving gabapentin at the
end of the study period. The number of tablets of
rescue medication, sleep interference, HAD scale,
and Barthel index are shown in Table 4. There were
no significant differences in any of these variables
from baseline over the course of the study period.
Gabapentin was well tolerated, with few reported
adverse effects (Table 5). Seven patients reported an
increase in somnolence during gabapentin therapy;
however, this was not significantly different from
placebo and did not preclude them from continuing
to take trial medication. There was no difference in

Discussion
This study has shown that after 6 weeks therapy
with gabapentin, spontaneous phantom limb pain
is reduced compared with placebo in postamputation patients. No difference in PID was observed
earlier in the 6-week study period, and no differences were observed in indices of sleep interference, mood, and activities of daily living. The
cross-over design of this study demonstrates the
beneficial effect of gabapentin compared with placebo in this patient population, which is often difficult to treat. Most reports of an analgesic effect of
gabapentin in neuropathic pain involve doses of
900 to 3,600 mg,9,10,15 although higher doses have
occasionally been used.7 It is conceivable that if we
had chosen up to 3,600 mg as our daily dose limit,
we may have observed a greater analgesic effect of
gabapentin. Previous randomized, controlled trials9,10 were also able to show an improvement in
lifestyle indices. However, these studies were parallel group studies with larger patient numbers. It is
likely that our study numbers were too small to
exclude a type 2 error for these variables.
We chose our secondary outcome measures because we believed they required a practical assessment of affect and activities of daily living. We
avoided the McGill pain questionnaire because we
believed it would be tedious for the patients to
undertake it on a daily basis and is also difficult to
analyze. Intention-to-treat analysis was undertaken
because we believed it would yield the most reliable
analysis of the efficacy of the treatment group, although this may not have been as important in this
cross-over study, in which all patients were requested to experience both active and placebo
treatments.
Although there is growing acceptance of the beneficial role of gabapentin in neuropathic pain syndromes,7 the advantage of gabapentin compared
with other established therapy for neuropathic pain

is uncertain. A randomized double-blind study of
28 patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy
found no improvement in global pain scores between gabapentin and amitriptyline.15 This may reflect the fact that this trial and others9,10 focused on
global pain scores. However, our study focused on
episodic, spontaneous phantom pain as opposed to
stimulation-evoked pain. Whether gabapentin is
better tolerated than other anticonvulsant or antidepressant medication used for treatment of
chronic neuropathic pain is also uncertain. The major side effects of pain patients treated with gabapentin have included dizziness, somnolence, and
ataxia.9,10,15
The mechanism of action of gabapentin is undetermined. Several hypotheses have been proposed,
including that gabapentin may enhance GABA release, which, being an inhibitory neurotransmitter,
could result in an inhibitory effect on pain neurotransmission. There is independent data to suggest
that gabapentin may modulate certain types of calcium channels, and there is conflicting evidence as
to whether it affects sodium channels. Gabapentin
is also known to increase serotonin concentration
in human blood, which may be linked to its neurobehavioral actions.6,16
Despite initially promising results, pre-emptive
analgesia for postamputation pain, involving the
establishment of regional blockade (often epidural
analgesia), which is set up 1 to 3 days before the
surgical amputation, has generally been disappointing in preventing long-term phantom pain,5,17 although pre-emptive regional analgesia may have a
role in preventing preoperative ischemic pain and
immediate postoperative nociceptive pain.17-19 The
severity of preamputation pain has also been shown
to increase the incidence of phantom pain,3 but we
did not document the extent of preamputation pain
in the present study. However, given that we selected only patients with significant episodes of
phantom pain ( 40 mm VAS) and that this was a
cross-over study, the extent of preamputation pain
in our patients is unlikely to have altered our findings.
Nonpharmacologic treatments of phantom pain
include continuous regional analgesia,18 stimulation of the motor cortex of the brain,20 use of spinal
opioids,13 and even electroconvulsive therapy.21
Pharmacologic therapy represents the most noninvasive option for treatment of phantom limbpain.
Optimum treatment of this challenging condition
may involve combinations of pharmacologic and
nonpharmacologic treatments with novel strategies, including the use of N-methyl-D-aspartate
(NMDA) antagonists, with an open label study suggesting that infusion of the NMDA antagonist, ketamine, resulted in a decrease in phantom pain in 11
patients.14
In summary, a review of phantom limbpain and
its treatment has concluded that clear evidencebased guidelines for treatment are not available,
because of a lack of quality clinical trials on current
treatments.5 Although the numbers for our present
study are indeed small, data from this randomized,
double-blind placebo-controlled, cross-over, clinical study suggests that persistence with gabapentin
therapy for 6 weeks improves phantom pain compared with placebo. A recent, larger study of over
300 patients confirmed the efficacy of gabapentin
1,800 to 2,400 mg/d in postherpetic neuralgia.22
Our study has assessed the effect of gabapentin on
the distinct symptom of phantom pain as a manifestation of postamputation phantom limbneuropathic pain. A larger scale study in this patient
population is warranted to more fully evaluate its
efficacy on indices such as mood, sleep interference,
and activities of daily living. Future studies should
also compare gabapentin with existing pharmacologic therapies for phantom pain, particularly lowdose antidepressants.
