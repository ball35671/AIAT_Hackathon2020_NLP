Objective: To determine the efficacy and safety of a gastricretentive, extended-release gabapentin (gabapentin ER) taken once
or twice daily for treatment of postherpetic neuralgia.
Methods: Using an enrichment design, a randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled study was conducted in 158 patients who had
experienced pain for at least 3 months after healing of acute herpes
zoster skin rash and who had a baseline average daily pain (ADP)
score of Z4 on a 0 to 10 Numerical Rating Scale. Patients received
gabapentin ER either once daily (1800 mg PM) or twice daily
(600 mg AM, 1200 mg PM) or placebo for 4 weeks. Efficacy measures
included changes from baseline to end point in ADP score and
average daily sleep interference score.
Results: Mean (SEM) changes for ADP score were  1.93 (0.28),
 2.24 (0.29), and  1.29 (0.29) in the gabapentin ER once daily,
twice daily, and placebo groups, respectively (P= 0.089 and 0.014
for gabapentin ER once daily and twice daily, respectively, vs.
placebo), with 25.5%, 28.8%, and 11.8% of patients, respectively,
reporting Z50% decrease from baseline in ADP score. Mean
(SEM) changes in sleep interference scores were  1.94 (0.30),
 2.28 (0.30), and  1.16 (0.30), respectively (P= 0.048 and 0.006
for gabapentin ER once daily and twice daily, respectively, vs.
placebo). Common adverse events in the gabapentin ER once daily,
twice daily, and placebo groups, respectively, were dizziness (22.2%,
11.3%, and 9.8%) and somnolence (9.3%, 7.5%, and 7.8%).
Conclusions: Gabapentin ER administered twice daily is effective
and safe for the treatment of pain associated with postherpetic
neuralgia.

Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is a neuropathic pain
syndrome that follows an acute attack of herpes zoster
(shingles). Varying definitions of PHN have been proposed,
but one of the more frequently used is pain persisting or
recurring for at least 3 months after the healing of zoster
skin lesions.1 The reported prevalence of PHN among
herpes zoster patients varies between 10% and 40% and
increases rapidly with age, with up to 40%, 50%, and 75%
of herpes zoster patients over 50, 60, and 70 years of age,
respectively, developing PHN.2–5 Symptoms of PHN
include constant or burning pain, intermittent sharp,
shooting pain, allodynia, paresthesia, and hyperesthesia.1,2,6 The pain associated with PHN can be intense and
unremitting and may profoundly affect a patient’s quality
of life.3,5,7 In addition to the physical pain, patients with
PHN also report sleep disturbances, anxiety, mood
disturbances, loss of appetite, and decreased interest in
social interactions.3
As with other forms of neuropathic pain, PHN can be
refractory to treatment with conventional analgesics. Some
tricyclic antidepressants have shown efficacy for the
treatment of PHN, but are associated with significant
adverse effects, particularly among the elderly.8–10 More
recently, the antiepileptic drugs, gabapentin and pregabalin, have demonstrated efficacy in controlled clinical trials
in patients with PHN.11–14 Both gabapentin and pregabalin
have more favorable side-effect profiles than tricyclic
antidepressants, but have a relatively high incidence
of somnolence, dizziness, and peripheral edema.11–15 In
addition, there is a lack of dose proportionality between
increasing doses of gabapentin and plasma drug levels
owing to the drug’s saturable transport mechanism.16
Lidocaine patches 5% (up to 3 patches for 12 h/d), some
opioids, and topical capsaicin have also shown efficacy for
the treatment of PHN.17,18
The current study examined the use of a gastricretentive, extended-release gabapentin formulation
(gabapentin ER) for the treatment of PHN. The gabapentin
ER tablets use polymer-based AcuForm technology, which
is also used in marketed formulations of metformin
and ciprofloxacin.19,20 When administered with a meal,
the gabapentin ER tablet swells and is retained in the
stomach for up to 8 hours. It releases the drug gradually
allowing delivery of gabapentin to the optimal site of
absorption from the small intestines over 10 hours.16,21 This
slow release of drug may help to overcome the saturable

for increased bioavailability of the drug while decreasing
the dose frequency.22
The objective of this study was to determine whether
this extended-release formulation was effective for the
treatment of PHN with fewer daily doses (1 or 2/d) than
the 3 or more doses per day typically required for optimal
efficacy with gabapentin, an immediate-release formulation.
It was hypothesized that giving the once-daily dose in the
evening and the twice-daily dose asymmetrically (600 mg
AM and 1200 mg PM) could result in improved quality and
duration of sleep, while maintaining pain relief during the
day. It was also hypothesized that this dosing schedule
could result in a lower incidence of side effects such as
dizziness and somnolence than usually observed with
gabapentin, as these events would be more likely to occur
at night while the patient was asleep.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
fixed-dose, clinical trial was conducted at 33 centers in the
United States between April 2005 and November 2005. The
study protocol was approved by the institutional review
boards and the study was conducted in accordance with the
International Conference on Harmonization Guidelines for
Good Clinical Practice. Each patient provided written
informed consent before undergoing any study procedures.
Study Population
The trial enrolled male and female outpatients, at least
18 years of age, who had experienced pain for at least 3
months after the healing of a herpes zoster skin rash, with a
pain intensity of at least 4 on a 0 to 10 Numerical Rating
Scale (NRS) at screening. Patients must have had a
washout period >5 times the half-life of benzodiazepines,
tricyclic antidepressants, serotonin and norepinephrine
reuptake inhibitors, norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitors, muscle relaxants, oral steroids, capsaicin,
mexiletine, dextromethorphan, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs prescribed for PHN and a 14-day washout of
strong opioids. Anticonvulsants, benzodiazepines, and
antidepressants were tapered appropriately, using product
label instructions as a guide. The end of the tapering/
washout regimen must have included a true washout (drug
free) period equivalent to 5 half-lives of the drug before
allowing the patient to start the baseline week. Female
patients of childbearing potential must have had a negative
urine pregnancy test at screening and randomization and
had to use medically acceptable methods of birth control.
This was an enrichment design as patients were
excluded from the study if they had previously not
responded to treatment for PHN with gabapentin at doses
Z1200 mg/d, had experienced dose-limiting adverse effects
that prevented titration of gabapentin to an effective dose,
or were hypersensitive to gabapentin. Immunocompromised patients, patients with hepatic or renal insufficiency,
significant hematologic disease, severe pain from causes
other than PHN, gastrointestinal disease or symptoms, or
clinically significant abnormal laboratory results were also
excluded.
Study Design and Methods
After the appropriate washout of current pain
medications, patients underwent a 1-week baseline period,
during which time they recorded the daily pain and sleep
interference scores. Those patients who reported an
average daily pain score of Z4 on the NRS during this
baseline period were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to
treatment with gabapentin ER 1800 mg once daily in the
evening, gabapentin ER 1800 mg/d administered twice daily
as an asymmetric divided dose (600 mg AM and 1200 mg
PM), or placebo according to a computer-generated
list. Patients randomized to active treatment had a gradual
titration of gabapentin ER from 300 mg/d to 1800 mg/d
over 2 weeks and remained at 1800 mg/d for an additional 2
weeks. The efficacy-dosing period was followed by a 1-week
dose-tapering period. All patients received an appropriate
combination of active and placebo tablets to achieve
the required dosing and maintain the study blind. All
tablets were taken after a meal. Patients were allowed
to take acetaminophen (up to a maximum daily dose of
4000 mg) or acetaminophen with hydrocodone [up
to a maximum of 8 tablets (500 mg acetaminophen/5 mg
hydrocodone) per day] if required for pain relief during the
study.
Patients were evaluated at screening, at the end of the
baseline week, at the end of weeks 2 and 4 of treatment, and
at the end of the study. During the baseline and treatment
periods, patients recorded their daily pain score and daily
sleep interference score each morning using an electronic
diary (DiaryPRO, invivodata, Pittsburgh, PA). Pain and
sleep interference scores were rated using NRSs, where
0 = ‘‘no pain’’ and ‘‘pain does not interfere with sleep’’ and
10 = ‘‘worst possible pain’’ and ‘‘pain completely interferes
with sleep.’’ Pain and sleep interference scores were
recorded each morning for the previous 24 hours. Patients
completed the Short-form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SFMPQ)23 and Neuropathic Pain Scale (NPS)24 on paper
forms at the study site at baseline and the end of weeks 2
and 4. The Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC)
and the investigator-rated Clinical Global Impression of
Change (CGIC)25,26 were completed at the study site at the
end of week 4. Rescue medication use was recorded daily in
the electronic diary at the same time as the pain and sleep
interference scores.
The primary efficacy end point was the mean change in
the last observation carried forward average daily pain
score from baseline to week 4 of treatment (efficacy end
point). Secondary efficacy variables were the percentage
change in average daily pain score from baseline to end
point, the proportion of responders (patients with at
least 50% decrease in pain score), changes from baseline
to end point in average daily sleep interference score,
changes from baseline to each week in average daily pain
and sleep interference scores, SF-MPQ and NPS scores,
and end of study assessment of CGIC and PGIC. Adverse
events were recorded throughout the study by direct
questioning, laboratory tests, and physical examination of
the patients.
Statistical Methods
Efficacy and safety analyses were performed on the
intent-to-treat (ITT) population, defined as all randomized patients who received study medication. All ITT
patients with available data were included in the primary
and secondary efficacy analyses.
A parallel lines analysis of covariance (ANCOVA)
model was used for the analysis of the primary efficacy
measurement. This ANCOVA model included treatment
Irving et al Clin J Pain  Volume 25, Number 3, March–April 2009
186 r 2009 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins
and center factors and baseline average daily pain score as
the covariate. The least squares estimate of the mean
change in average daily pain score of each treatment and its
95% confidence interval was calculated. In addition, a 95%
confidence interval of the pairwise difference between
each gabapentin ER treatment versus placebo treatment
(gabapentin ER treatment minus placebo) for the mean
change from baseline in average daily pain score was
calculated.
An analysis of variance model or ANCOVA model
was used for the analysis of continuous secondary
efficacy measurements. The analysis of variance model
included treatment and center factors. The parallel lines
ANCOVA model included treatment and center factors and
baseline measurement as the covariate. An unequal slope
ANCOVA model included treatment and center factors and
baseline covariate by treatment interaction factor. The
treatment-by-center interaction factor was not included
in all the final models as the P value associated with this
factor was not significant at the 0.10 level. Patients from
all study centers were pooled for the analysis of the
categorical outcome data. For the analysis of the proportion of responders, the Cochran-Mantel-Haentzel test for
general association was used for the overall comparison.
For the analysis of ordinal categorical data (CGIC and
PGIC), a Cochran-Mantel-Haentzel test of general
association with modified Ridit scores was used for the
overall comparison among all treatment groups. For
the analysis of the dichotomous outcome data, a 2-sided
Fisher exact test was used for the overall comparison
among all treatment groups. In addition, a 2-sample Z
test on 2 proportions between each gabapentin ER
treatment versus placebo treatment was performed. The
number needed-to-treat (NNT) was based on the proportion of patients achieving at least a 50% reduction in pain
score.
Adverse event analyses were performed for the safety
population, which included all patients who received at
least 1 dose of study drug. The Fisher exact test was used to
compare the incidence of adverse events among treatment
groups.
A sample size of B156 patients (52 patients per
treatment group) was determined to ensure at least 138
patients (46 patients per treatment group) would be
available with primary efficacy data for analysis. This
sample size had a 90% power to detect a difference of at
least 1.5 points in the mean change in average daily pain
score from baseline week to final week of the efficacy
treatment period between 2 treatment groups. This
calculation was based on a 2-sided 2-sample t test with a
1-to-1 ratio of sample size allocation, a SD of 2 points,
and a significance level of a = 0.025. Statistical analyses
were performed using SAS version 8.0 (SAS Institute Inc,
Cary, NC).

RESULTS
Characteristics of Study Population
A total of 192 patients were enrolled and entered the
baseline period, 34 patients withdrew during the baseline
period and 158 patients were randomized, received study
drug, and were included in the ITT population. The more
common reasons for nonrandomization were baseline
average daily pain score <4 (16 patients) and withdrawal
of consent (8 patients). Fifteen patients prematurely
discontinued study medication during the efficacy treatment
period; the most common reason for discontinuation was
adverse events (11 patients: 4 gabapentin ER once daily, 6
gabapentin ER twice daily, and 1 placebo).
There were no significant differences among treatment
groups for any demographic or baseline variables (Table 1).
The mean age for all randomized patients was 70 years
(range: 26 to 90 y); approximately 71% of patients were at
least 65 years of age and 36% were at least 75 years of age.
Overall, 53% of patients were female and 86% were white.
The most common location of neuropathic pain at study
entry was the torso (54%). The mean average daily pain
score at baseline was 6.5 and a majority of patients (73%)
did not require any washout of pain medications before
study entry. The proportion of patients who used allowed
rescue medications (and average number of tablets used per
week) was 65.5% (1.7 to 1.9), 51.9% (2.8 to 3.2), and 60.8%
(2.6 to 2.8) in the gabapentin ER once daily, twice daily,
and placebo groups, respectively. Overall, more patients
used acetaminophen (57.6%) than acetaminophen/hydrocodone (16.5%).
Efficacy Results
All patients in the ITT population were included in the
primary and secondary efficacy analyses, regardless of
whether or not they completed the efficacy treatment
period. Decreases in average daily pain scores were
observed in all treatment groups, with a significant
difference between the gabapentin ER twice daily and

placebo groups for mean change from baseline to end point
(P = 0.014), but not for gabapentin ER once daily versus
placebo (P = 0.089) (Table 2). Improvements in pain score
were observed as early as week 1 and continued throughout
the treatment period, with statistically significant differences between the gabapentin ER twice-daily group and the
placebo group at all time points (Fig. 1). The mean
percentage change in average daily pain score from baseline
to end point was also significantly greater in the gabapentin
ER twice-daily group than in the placebo group
(P = 0.008), but not for gabapentin ER once daily versus
placebo (P= 0.052). More patients in the gabapentin ER
groups had at least a 30% or at least a 50% decrease in pain
score than in the placebo group (Table 2). The NNT was
7.30 and 5.9 for gabapentin ER once daily and twice daily,
respectively.
There was a significant difference between both
gabapentin ER groups and the placebo group for change
from baseline to end point in average daily sleep
interference scores (P = 0.048 and 0.006 for once daily
and twice daily, respectively, vs. placebo). Sleep interference
scores decreased in both gabapentin ER treatment groups
as early as week 1, with statistically significant differences
between the active and placebo groups at most time points
(Fig. 1).
Significant differences between gabapentin ER twice
daily and placebo treatments were also observed for other
secondary efficacy parameters, including SF-MPQ scores
for affective pain, total pain, and present pain intensity and
the averages of all 10 items and all 4 nonallodynia items on
the NPS (Table 3). For the CGIC, 34.6%, 52.3%, and
25.0% of patients in the gabapentin ER once daily, twice
daily, and placebo groups, respectively, were rated as very
much or much improved (P = 0.319 and 0.007 for once
daily and twice daily, respectively, vs. placebo). For the
PGIC, 32.7%, 40.8%, and 20.8% of patients, respectively,
rated their PHN as very much or much improved
(P = 0.181 and 0.033 for once daily and twice daily vs.
placebo) (Fig. 2).
Tolerability Results
The most frequent adverse events were nervous system
disorders (28.5% of all patients) and gastrointestinal
disorders (24.1%). There were no statistically significant
differences among treatment groups for the incidence of any
type of adverse event, including somnolence and dizziness
(Table 4). There was no apparent relationship between the
dose of gabapentin ER administered and the incidence of
any adverse event. One patient in the gabapentin ER twicedaily group died during the study after a cardiac arrest 13
days after randomization. This event was considered to be
unrelated to study drug. An additional 7 patients
(4 gabapentin ER once daily, 2 gabapentin ER twice daily,
and 1 placebo) had 1 or more serious adverse events
(respiratory failure, chest pain, pneumonia, syncope, and
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). All events were
resolved by the end of the study and were considered
unrelated to study drug. Eleven patients (4 gabapentin ER
once daily, 6 gabapentin ER twice daily, and 1 placebo) had
1 or more adverse events leading to discontinuation of

DISCUSSION
The results of this randomized, placebo-controlled
trial demonstrate that gabapentin ER 1800 mg/d, given as a
twice-daily asymmetric divided dose, was significantly more
effective than placebo in treating pain associated with PHN.
There was also a trend toward a greater decrease in pain
score with gabapentin ER 1800 mg once daily compared
with placebo. For the twice-daily gabapentin ER group, the
mean change (  2.24) and percentage change (  34.7%) in
average daily pain scores were comparable with those
observed in gabapentin studies (mean change:  2.1 to
 2.2; percentage change:  34.5%) given t.i.d. at doses of
1800 to 3600 mg/d.11,12 However, there was a relatively high
placebo effect (  18.6%) in the current study compared
with other gabapentin PHN studies,11,12 which may have
been partly owing to the use of opioid rescue medications
for pain that were not allowed in other studies.
The proportion of responders (patients with at least a
50% reduction in pain score) in the gabapentin ER twicedaily group (28.8%) was also similar to that reported in
studies on gabapentin (32.2%)11 and pregabalin 150 or
300 mg/d TID (26% and 28%, respectively).14 Likewise,
the NNT of 5.88 for twice-daily gabapentin ER was similar
to the NNT of 5.63 for both gabapentin 1800 mg/d and
pregabalin 300 mg/d.18 A 30% reduction in pain score is
considered to be clinically significant.26,27 On this basis,
nearly half of the patients who received gabapentin ER
twice daily had clinically significant pain relief compared
with 31% of placebo patients.
Once-daily dosing of gabapentin ER was less
effective than twice-daily dosing in providing pain relief
during the day, although it did provide significant reduction
in sleep interference scores. Pharmacokinetic studies of
gabapentin ER at steady state indicate that although the
total amount of drug absorbed over 24 hours is similar for
once-daily and twice-daily dosing, the minimum gabapentin
plasma concentration over a 24-hour period is lower
with once-daily than twice-daily dosing.22 Additionally,
with twice-daily dosing, the minimum gabapentin concentration was similar to gabapentin immediate release tablets,
600 mg administered 3 times/d, whereas the once daily
dosing of gabapentin ER was somewhat less than
gabapentin immediate release tablets. Thus, with oncedaily dosing, it is possible that plasma levels may fall below
the therapeutic range before the end of the 24-hour dosing
period.

The improvements in pain and sleep interference
scores were supported by improvements in all secondary
measurements of pain (SF-MPQ, NPS, CGIC, and PGIC),
which used a variety of pain descriptors. These data showed
a pattern of improvements similar to that observed for the
average daily pain score, with significantly greater improvements with gabapentin ER twice daily compared with
placebo and a trend toward greater improvements for
gabapentin ER once daily compared with placebo. For
gabapentin ER twice daily, these results were generally
similar to those reported for gabapentin. The proportions
of patients in the gabapentin ER twice-daily group who
were considered much or very much improved at the end of
treatment for CGIC and PGIC were 52% and 41%,
respectively, which compare favorably with reported
improvements for 44% and 41% of patients, respectively,
treated with gabapentin.11,12
Gabapentin ER was generally well tolerated. A
majority of patients completed study drug dosing for
the efficacy treatment period and only 11 patients
discontinued study drug owing to an adverse event (10 in
the active and 1 in the placebo group). The overall
incidence and types of adverse events were as expected for
this patient population and were generally similar for all
treatment groups.
This study has several limitations. First, it had a
relatively short duration of treatment with only 2 weeks at
full dose. Thus, it is not known whether the beneficial effect
would have continued or whether any long-term side effects
from gabapentin ER would have occurred had the study
been longer. Second, the study lacked an active control
group. Although the use of a placebo group is important to
demonstrate efficacy in pain studies, the lack of an active
control precludes a direct comparison with other pain
medications. Thus, additional studies will be needed before
the new formulation can be considered to provide a clinical
advantage over the current formulations. Third, this was an
enriched population; however, despite this study enrichment design, the patient population was comparable with
that of other PHN studies and typical of the general PHN
population in nonenriched studies in terms of patient age
and other characteristics. Fourth, the side-effect rate in our
study was substantially lower than has been reported in
other published studies of short-acting gabapentin.
Although it is possible that the extended-release formulation has a lower side-effect rate, it is possible that the
selection of a population of patients who had previously
tolerated the short-acting form of gabapentin may partially
explain the lower rate. Additional studies should be
considered to further evaluate a potential difference in
side-effect rates. Even in considering these limitations, the
design of this study was very similar to that of published
studies of gabapentin and pregabalin, so comparison of
results with data for these treatments may be considered
useful.
The extended-release profile of gabapentin ER allows
the larger of the 2 daily doses to be given in the evening to
improve the quality of sleep whereas still maintaining
acceptable pain control during the day. This evening dosing
likely contributed to the reduced incidence of somnolence
and dizziness in this study, as these events would be more
likely to occur during the night while the patient was asleep.
In addition, the decreased number of medications per day
could be important for elderly patients who are likely to be
taking multiple medications.
CONCLUSIONS
The results of this study indicate that gabapentin ER
administered twice daily is safe and effective for the
treatment of pain associated with PHN.
