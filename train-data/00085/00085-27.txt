Abstract
A multicentre double blind, randomised, placebo controlled 7-week study evaluated the efficacy and safety of gabapentin 1800 or 2400
mg/day in treating postherpetic neuralgia. Three hundred and thirty-four men and women aged at least 18 years (mean 73) received
gabapentin 1800 or 2400 mg daily or placebo in three divided doses with a forced titration schedule. The primary outcome measure was
change in average daily pain diary score (baseline week v final week). Secondary outcomes included mean weekly sleep interference score;
Short Form-McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ); Clinician and Patient Global Impression of Change (CGIC/PGIC); Short Form-36 Health
Survey (SF-36). From week 1, pain scores showed a significantly greater improvement with gabapentin: the final difference v baseline was
234.5% for the 1800 mg dose, 234.4% for the 2400 mg dose compared with 215.7% for the placebo group. The difference vs. placebo was
18.8% for the 1800 mg dose (95% confidence interval 10.9–26.8%; P , 0:01) and 18.7% for the 2400 mg dose (10.7–26.7%; P , 0:01).
Sleep interference diaries showed a similar pattern. There were significant differences in favour of gabapentin for number of patients
reporting .50% reduction in their pain intensity, in the CGIC and PGIC, in the sensory and total scores of the SF-MPQ (both doses), in
the visual analogue scale of pain of the SF-MPQ (2400 mg only) and in the vitality, bodily pain and mental health domains of the SF-36.
Overall gabapentin was well tolerated. The most common adverse events were dizziness and somnolence, particularly during the titration
phase. Thus, this study confirms the role of gabapentin as an efficacious and well-tolerated treatment for postherpetic neuralgia. q 2001

1. Introduction
Postherpetic neuralgia is a neuropathic pain syndrome
following an acute attack of herpes zoster (shingles). The
point at which acute herpes zoster pain becomes postherpetic neuralgia is the focus of disagreement in the medical
literature, although one definition is pain persisting for
longer than 3 months after the crusting of skin lesions,
following an acute attack of herpes zoster (Bowsher,
1997). Symptoms include constant aching, burning or itching with intermittent severe lancinating pain. Abnormalities
of sensation such as allodynia and hyperalgesia may also
occur. The incidence of postherpetic neuralgia increases
sharply with age. Up to 50% of acute herpes zoster patients
aged 60 years or more are affected, and the percentage
climbs further with increasing age (Volmink et al., 1996).
The overall incidence of postherpetic neuralgia is estimated
to be 9–34%. This wide variation is accounted for by the
differences in diagnostic criteria (Dworkin and Portenoy,
1996). Untreated, postherpetic neuralgia can be severe and
debilitating, with a major impact on patients’ quality of life
(Johnson, 1997).
Like other forms of neuropathic pain, postherpetic neuralgia can be refractory to treatment with conventional
analgesics. Some tricyclic antidepressants have been
shown to be efficacious in treating postherpetic neuralgia
in systematic reviews of controlled clinical studies with
small patient numbers (Volmink et al., 1996; McQuay and
Moore, 1998; Sindrup and Jensen, 1999; Collins et al.,
2000). However, the elderly may be more prone to the anticholinergic side effects of tricyclic antidepressants, which
include dry mouth, constipation and blurred vision (Collins
et al., 2000). Tricyclic antidepressants are also contraindiPain 94 (2001) 215–224

cated in various cardiovascular conditions, which makes
them inappropriate in many elderly patients.
There is some evidence that opioids can be efficacious in
certain types of neuropathic pain but evidence in postherpetic neuralgia is limited to a small single trial, in which
oxycodone was shown to be superior to placebo (Watson
and Babul, 1998). Topical capsaicin treatment is licensed
for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia, and was more
efficacious than placebo in two of three small studies
(Volmink et al., 1996). However, many patients experience
local stinging and burning (Rains and Bryson, 1995).
Recently, two small placebo controlled studies have indicated a beneficial effect of lidocaine patches in postherpetic
neuralgia (Rowbotham et al., 1996; Galer et al., 1999).
Other agents, including mixtures of local anaesthetics,
NMDA (n-methyl d-aspartate) antagonists, benzodiazepines, sympathetic nerve blocks and antivirals have also
been used, but with no clear evidence of benefit (Attal et
al., 1999; Sindrup and Jensen, 1999; Volmink et al., 1996;
Wu et al., 2000).
Recently, attention has focused on the potential role of
anticonvulsants in postherpetic neuralgia and other neuropathic pain syndromes (Backonja, 2000; Collins et al., 2000;
Ross et al., 2000; Kanazi et al., 2000; Tremont-Lukats et al.,
2000). No randomised controlled trials have been conducted
on the older anticonvulsant, carbamazepine, in postherpetic
neuralgia, though it has been shown to have beneficial
effects in diabetic neuropathy (Sindrup and Jensen, 1999).
Recent evidence shows, however, that a newer anticonvulsant, gabapentin, is efficacious in the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia (Rowbotham et al., 1998). Gabapentin’s
mechanism of action is yet to be fully elucidated. Gabapentin does not bind to g-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors
despite being a structural analogue of GABA (Nicholson,
2000). It has been shown to bind to calcium channel subunits and to modulate high threshold calcium currents in
brain neurons, implying that neuronal voltage-gated
calcium channels are a possible target of gabapentin (Gee
et al., 1996; Stefani et al., 1998).
A large ðn ¼ 229Þ, 8-week, multicentre, randomised,
placebo controlled trial in the USA has shown gabapentin
to be efficacious in postherpetic neuralgia (Rowbotham et
al., 1998). Gabapentin was administered at doses of up to
3600 mg/day (forced titration up to this dose, which could
be back titrated if the patients were unable to tolerate).
Treatment significantly reduced average daily pain scores
and sleep interference associated with postherpetic neuralgia and improved measures of mood and quality of life.
Gabapentin has also been shown to be efficacious in another
form of neuropathic pain, painful diabetic neuropathy
(Backonja et al., 1998).
On the basis of these findings, a large double blind
placebo controlled multicentre study was conducted in the
UK to evaluate the efficacy and safety of gabapentin in
postherpetic neuralgia. Our trial used two fixed doses of
gabapentin (1800 and 2400 mg/day, in contrast to the maximum of 3600 mg/day permitted in the US trial), with a
shorter titration period. Thus, we aimed to establish a
simpler dosing regimen and to minimise side effects by
using lower doses.
2. Methods
2.1. Subjects
Patients from 48 hospital out patient pain clinics and three
general practices in the UK and the Republic of Ireland
participated in this randomised, double blind, placebo
controlled, parallel group, multicentre study between April
and December 1999. The protocol was approved by the
South and West Multicentre Research Ethics Committee
and each centre’s Local Research Ethics Committee, and
patients provided written informed consent. The study was
conducted in accordance with ICH Good Clinical Practice
Guidelines and the Declaration of Helsinki with respect to
informed patient consent.
Men and women aged at least 18 years, of any race, were
included. Women were required to be non-pregnant (using
barrier or hormonal contraception where appropriate), nonlactating, postmenopausal or surgically sterilised. Pain had
to have been present for more than 3 months after the healing of the acute herpes zoster skin rash. Patients were randomised to the study if they yielded average pain scores of 4 or
more, based on an 11-point Likert scale, on the week before
commencing study medication.
Exclusion criteria included: failure to respond to previous
treatment with gabapentin at $1200 mg/day, failure to
respond to gabapentin at any dose level due to side effects
or contraindications to gabapentin treatment.
2.2. Study design
Patients were randomised sequentially to gabapentin
1800 mg, gabapentin 2400 mg or placebo, using a computer
generated randomisation list in block sizes of six. During the
study, the randomisation list was held securely, and released
only after study completion. Gabapentin and placebo were
provided as identical-appearing capsules.
Patients initially attended a screening visit during which
they underwent a medical examination with all vital signs
recorded and significant medical history, including that of
postherpetic neuralgia, taken. Patients meeting all the inclusion and exclusion criteria were eligible to enter the study
phase. The study phase included a 1-week baseline period,
after which eligible patients randomised to either gabapentin or placebo entered a 4-day forced titration, during which
the gabapentin dose was increased by 300 mg/day, over the
first 4 days, up to 1200 mg/day. From days 4 to 7, dosing
remained stable. After 1 week on treatment, the dose was
titrated up to 1800 mg/day (1500 mg/day on day 8 and 1800
mg/day on days 9–14), and after 2 weeks, patients randomised to gabapentin 2400 mg/day had their dose titrated up
216 A.S.C. Rice et al. / Pain 94 (2001) 215–224
to this final level (2100 mg/day on day 15 and 2400 mg/day
from day 16 onwards). During the study, patients adhered to
a strict titration schedule up to the dose level that they were
randomised to. Those patients who were unable to tolerate
the dose regimen were withdrawn from the study. A further
stable dosing period ensued for all patients (weeks 3–7).
Patients therefore received therapy for a total of 7 weeks.
Throughout the trial, all patients received their daily dose
of study medication in three divided doses. Patients randomised to placebo took the same number of capsules as those
assigned to gabapentin.
During the study, patients were not allowed to receive
specified treatments for the relief of postherpetic neuralgia.
A washout period of 14 days prior to screening was required
for benzodiazepines, skeletal muscle relaxants, steroids,
capsaicin, mexiletine, dextromethorphan, non-steriodal
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (where prescribed specifically for postherpetic neuralgia) and anticonvulsants. A
washout period of 30 days was required for ‘strong’ opioids
(e.g. morphine, fentanyl). Concomitant medications
allowed during the study included antidepressants, mild
opiates, for example codeine, aspirin (up to one tablet
daily (maximum 300 mg) for myocardial infarction and
transient ischaemic attack prophylaxis) and NSAIDs.
These medications were permissible as long as they were
at a stable dose prior to and during the study and could not
be initiated during the study. Patients were, however,
permitted to take paracetamol or paracetamol/codeine as
rescue medication.
2.3. Efficacy measures
The primary efficacy outcome was the change in average
daily pain score from the baseline week to the final study
week, evaluated from the daily pain diary. An 11-point
Likert scale was used with 0 as ‘no pain’ and 10 as ‘worst
possible pain’. Self-assessment of the previous 24 h pain
was performed daily on waking. The baseline score
consisted of the mean of the last seven pain diary entries
preceding randomisation. The final weekly mean pain score
(end point) was defined as the mean pain score from the last
7 days preceding the final visit or the last 7 days on study
medication for patients who did not complete the study.
Secondary efficacy parameters included the mean weekly
sleep interference score from the daily sleep diaries
(assessed on an 11-point Likert scale where 0 ¼ pain does
not interfere with sleep to 10 ¼ pain completely interferes
with sleep), the Short Form-McGill Pain Questionnaire (SFMPQ) (Melzack, 1987) and the Clinician and Patient Global
Impression of Change (CGIC/PGIC – assessed on a 7-point
scale where the clinician or patient, respectively, assessed
changes in their overall status, ranging from very much
improved to very much worse). Quality of life was
measured using the Short Form-36 (SF-36) Health Survey
(Ware, 1993).
Patients attended five scheduled visits: initial screening
(week 21), randomisation (week 0), and three further visits
at weeks 1, 2 and 7. Patients were assessed by telephone at
weeks 3 and 5. Data from patients’ pain and sleep diaries,
and for adverse events (elicited by non-specific questioning), were collected at each clinic visit. Data for the SFMPQ and SF-36 were collected at weeks 0 and 7, and the
CGIC and PGIC were assessed at week 7. Vital signs were
evaluated at screening and at week 7.
2.4. Data analysis
The study was estimated to have a 90% power to detect a
difference of 1.0 on the pain diary scale as statistically
significant (P , 0:05, two-sided), based on an estimated
standard deviation (SD) of 2.35 and a sample size of 118
evaluable patients per group. In fact, the study recruited 334
evaluable patients and the observed SD was 1.99, giving a
power of 95% to detect the specified difference.
Statistical analysis was conducted on the intent-to-treat
population (patients who, once randomised to treatment,
took at least one dose of study medication). All statistical
tests were two-sided and significance was assessed at the 5%
level.
Analysis of covariance was employed to assess between
treatment changes in terms of pain and sleep scores (1800
and the 2400 mg/day groups with placebo). To control the
overall type 1 error rate at 5% in the primary efficacy analysis, Dunnet’s procedure (two-sided) was employed (Dunnet,
1964).
The percentage of patients with a 50% or greater reduction in mean pain scores between baseline and the final 7
days of pain diary was assessed using a Mantel–Haenszel
Chi-square test adjusting for cluster.
The eight domains of the SF-36 and the five sub-scores of
the SF-MPQ (which consist of a sensory score, an affective
score, total score, visual analogue pain score and a present
pain intensity) were analysed using analysis of covariance.
PGIC and CGIC results were analysed using Mantel–Haenszel Chi-square tests adjusting for cluster.
3. Results
3.1. Subjects
Of 411 patients screened, 334 were randomised. Of the 77
patients withdrawn prior to randomisation, 52 did not meet
the entry criteria, three experienced an adverse event and 22
were withdrawn for other reasons.
In total, 111 patients were randomised to placebo, 115 to
gabapentin 1800 mg/day and 108 to gabapentin 2400 mg/
day. During the study, a total of 62 patients (18.6%) withdrew from the study (Fig. 1). The commonest reason for
withdrawal was adverse events, which prompted withdrawal
in seven patients receiving placebo (6.3%), 15 receiving
gabapentin 1800 mg (13.0%) and 19 receiving gabapentin
2400 mg (17.6%).

The treatment groups were well matched at baseline in
terms of their age, sex, weight, previous duration of disease
and previous drug treatment (Table 1). The mean duration of
treatment during the study was similar for all three groups:
placebo 46.0 days (range 1–61); gabapentin 1800 mg 43.3
days (2–57); gabapentin 2400 mg 43.7 days (1–63). The
most commonly reported concomitant medications taken
during the study were: paracetamol 130 patients (39%);
amitriptyline 85 (25%), dose range 10–120 mg/day; cocodamol (paracetamol and codeine phosphate) 44 (13%);
co-proxamol (paracetamol and dextropropoxyphene hydrochloride) 41 (12%); and co-dydramol (paracetamol and
dihydrocodine tartrate) (6%). During the study, 50 (15%)
patients took no medication for their postherpetic neuralgia
other than the study drug. The baseline pain scores (calculated as the mean of the last seven pain diary entries preceding visit 1) were similar for all three groups; these were 6.4,
6.5 and 6.5, respectively, for the placebo, gabapentin 1800
mg and gabapentin 2400 mg groups.
3.2. Efficacy measures
3.2.1. Average daily pain score
The primary efficacy measure, change in average daily
pain score from the baseline week to the final study week,
showed significant improvements in the gabapentin 1800
and 2400 mg groups compared with placebo. The average
score for the placebo group was 6.4 vs. 5.3 (a reduction of
15.7%), for the gabapentin 1800 mg group was 6.5 vs. 4.3 (a
reduction of 34.5%) and for the gabapentin 2400 mg group
218 A.S.C. Rice et al. / Pain 94 (2001) 215–224
Fig. 1. Profile of patients at each phase of the study.
was 6.5 vs. 4.2 (a reduction of 34.4%). The difference
between placebo and gabapentin 1800 mg was 18.8%
(95% confidence interval 10.9–26.8%; P , 0:01). The
difference between placebo and gabapentin 2400 mg was
18.7% (10.7–26.7%; P , 0:01). Differences between gabapentin and placebo were significant from week 1 (1200 mg)
onwards (Fig. 2).
3.2.2. Response rate
The proportion of patients showing a 50% or greater
reduction in mean pain score between baseline and the
end of treatment was significantly higher (P ¼ 0:001) in
both the gabapentin 1800 mg treatment group (32%) and
the gabapentin 2400 mg group (34%) than in the placebo
treated patients (14%).
3.2.3. Sleep interference
Sleep interference diaries showed a similar pattern of
improvement to the pain diary, with both gabapentin treatment groups showing greater improvement than placebo
treated patients from week 1 onwards. For the last week
of treatment, the difference between placebo and gabapentin
1800 mg was 0.9 (95% confidence interval 0.4–1.4;
P , 0:01). The difference between placebo and gabapentin
2400 mg was 1.1 (0.7–1.6; P , 0:01).
3.2.4. SF-MPQ
The SF-MPQ showed improvements in all parameters
during treatment, with greater improvements in gabapentin
treated patients. The difference between gabapentin and
placebo was statistically significant (P , 0:05) for the
sensory score (both doses); total score (both doses); and
visual analogue scale of pain during the previous week
(2400 mg only). Table 2 summarises the results.
3.2.5. Patient global impression of change
At the end of treatment, 23% (24/105) of patients on
placebo were categorised as very much or much improved
compared with 41% (44/107) of patients in the gabapentin
1800 mg treatment group (P ¼ 0:003 v placebo) and 43%
(42/98) in the 2400 mg treatment group (P ¼ 0:005 v
placebo).
3.2.6. Clinician global impression of change
At the end of treatment, 19% (20/107) of patients on
placebo were categorised as very much or much improved
compared with 44% (48/108) of patients in the gabapentin

Three hundred and twenty-one patients completed the
SF-36 questionnaire at baseline and 289 had evaluable SF36 results from the treatment period. Patients receiving
either dose of gabapentin experienced significantly greater
improvements in mean score for the vitality scale
(P , 0:05) than those receiving placebo (Fig. 3). Patients
receiving the 1800 mg dose of gabapentin also showed
significantly greater improvements in mean score for scales
of bodily pain (P , 0:01) and mental health (P , 0:05) than
those receiving placebo (Fig. 3).
3.3. Adverse events
Table 3 summarises adverse events reported as occurring
in .5% of study patients. Withdrawals due to adverse
events (both total and considered to be possibly/probably
study-related) were more common in both gabapentin
groups than the placebo group (Table 3). Whereas withdrawals due to adverse events among the placebo group were
evenly spread throughout the trial, 38% of withdrawals
among gabapentin treated patients occurred within the first

week, and 76% within the first 3 weeks. Dizziness and
drowsiness were the most common adverse events necessitating withdrawal among gabapentin treated patients; 7% of
patients in each dose group withdrew because of dizziness
and 5–6% because of drowsiness. There were five serious
non-fatal adverse events (SAEs) during the study. One SAE
occurred in the placebo group (depression), three in the
gabapentin 1800 mg group (fever, infection and retinal
vein thrombosis and haemoptysis), and one in the gabapentin 2400 mg group (congestive heart failure). All were
considered not to be related to the study drug.
4. Discussion
This study shows that gabapentin at doses of 1800 and
2400 mg/day is significantly more efficacious than placebo
in reducing the pain of PHN (Postherpetic Neuralgia). These
benefits arise early (1 week from start of treatment) and are
maintained throughout the study. For both doses, the
primary efficacy measure, change in average daily diary
score, showed significant reductions in pain scores
(P , 0:01) from week 1 (1200 mg) onwards.
Significant improvements were also observed in secondary efficacy measures. The response rate (percentage of
patients reporting .50% reduction in their pain intensity)
was significantly greater in the gabapentin treated groups,
and patients receiving gabapentin experienced significantly
less sleep interference as reported by patient diaries. The
SF-MPQ showed significant difference in sensory, total and
VAS (Visual Analogue Scale) scores in favour of gabapentin compared to placebo. Statistically significant differences
were seen in three out of eight domains of the SF-36. The
findings for bodily pain (significantly improved over
placebo for the gabapentin 1800 mg group only) support
the primary outcome measure.
Gabapentin treated patients also showed significant
improvements compared with placebo in scores for the
vitality for both the 1800 and 2400 mg group and mental
health scales for the 1800 mg group only. The SF-36 is a
validated tool for measuring patients’ quality of life and is
not specific to just pain. It examines eight aspects of a
patient’s quality of life and asks the patient to answer questions to rate each aspect. It is designed to take into account
all aspects of drug therapy balancing efficacy, tolerability
and ease of use. This provides a possible reason as to why
the 1800 mg group showed significant improvements over
placebo for the bodily pain and mental health scales whereas
the 2400 mg group did not. As the primary efficacy measure,
change in mean daily pain score, has shown no difference
between the 1800 and 2400 mg group, one might expect that
the quality of life score at the higher dose would be lower
that that of the lower dose when tolerability is taken into
account. The overall impression from the data suggests a
greater change in favour of the gabapentin treatment groups
(Fig. 3). These findings reflect the beneficial impact of an
efficacious treatment for neuropathic pain on patients’
general and psychological well being.
The primary efficacy analysis results were also supported
by similar results for the patient’s and clinician’s global
impression of change. The patient’s global impression has
recently been shown to be a reliable measure of clinical
usefulness, which correlates well with the number of
patients achieving .50% TOTPAR (TOTal PAin Relief
possible), at least for acute pain (Collins et al., 2001).
This study, involving 334 patients, is the largest reported
in postherpetic neuralgia to date. The study population
reflects the age distribution of postherpetic neuralgia, with
a mean age of 73 years. Newly diagnosed patients (diagnosed
within 6 months prior to screening) accounted for only 16%
(54) of the study population; the median duration of postherpetic neuralgia was about 4 years. In such a population, it

would be unrealistic to expect to conduct a trial in treatmentnaive patients. Most patients (61%) had already tried other
treatments; .70% had used three or more other treatments.
For ethical reasons, the study excluded patients who had
previously failed to respond to gabapentin at $1200 mg/day
or to gabapentin at any dose due to side effects. Excluding
patients already known to be non-responders to gabapentin
reflects the reality of clinical practice (we do not treat
patients who are already known to be non-responders to a
particular drug). It also allows a more sensitive comparison
between the two doses of gabapentin.
In reality, although no specific data are available for
patients excluded for gabapentin non-response, only 52 of
411 patients screened did not meet the entry criteria. This
suggests that the number of gabapentin non-responders
excluded could not have been very large. Thus, the treatment effects observed in our study are probably not very
different from those in the postherpetic neuralgia population
as a whole.
During the study, 85% of patients continued to take
concurrent medications for postherpetic neuralgia, including 25% who remained on amitriptyline. Thus, the significant improvement in pain intensity with gabapentin was
achieved in a largely refractory population. In view of
this, the proportion of patients showing a reduction in pain
scores of .50% (34% in the gabapentin 2400 mg group and
32% in the gabapentin 1800 mg group v 14% in the placebo
group) can be considered highly notable.
The study was not set up to show equivalence between the
two doses and no statistical comparison was made between
them. A visual inspection of the data suggests no difference
between 1800 and 2400 mg (Figs. 2 and 3). This suggests
that the current UK licensed dose of 1800 mg is likely to be
appropriate for most patients. However, it cannot be ruled
out that in some patients with postherpetic neuralgia, additional clinical benefit may be achieved by increasing doses
up to the maximum 3600 mg (Rowbotham et al., 1998).
Doses of gabapentin up to and over 3600 mg have been
shown to be well tolerated and safe (Morrell et al., 2000).
As in studies on gabapentin in epilepsy, the most common
drug-associated adverse events were dizziness and somnolence (McLean, 1999). However, most central nervous
system (CNS) adverse events were transient and mild to
moderate in intensity. Furthermore, despite the number of
reports of somnolence, the SF-36 vitality scale showed a
significant benefit of gabapentin, suggesting that the positive benefits of pain reduction and reduction in sleep interference outweigh the transitory CNS side effects.
Dizziness and somnolence were most common during the
titration period, which was relatively short. This is consistent with the well-tolerated incidence of dizziness and
somnolence in previous studies with gabapentin (Backonja
et al., 1998; Rowbotham et al., 1998).
Although there was a higher rate of withdrawals due to
somnolence and dizziness in the gabapentin-treated groups,
the proportion of patients completing the study was high in
all groups (81% for gabapentin 1800 mg, 79% for gabapentin 2400 mg and 85% for placebo). Most withdrawals
occurred early in treatment. None of the few serious adverse
events that occurred was considered to be associated with
gabapentin treatment. As in previous studies, no unexpected
adverse events were reported.
This study supports the findings of the US study on gabapentin in postherpetic neuralgia (Rowbotham et al., 1998),
which found a similar significant reduction in average daily
pain score. In that study, the titration schedule was slower
and the maximum dose higher (3600 mg). This slower titration may explain why a statistically significant benefit was
not seen until week 2, whereas in our study, patients started
to benefit from gabapentin treatment within the first week,
whilst maintaining a similar adverse event rate in both. The
placebo effect in this study was over twice that in the US
study. Such wide variability in placebo response is a
common feature of pain studies.
The comparative lack of adverse drug interactions, makes
gabapentin a suitable candidate for inclusion in multidrug
regimens to control chronic neuropathic pain. Future studies
could compare gabapentin with other regimens both alone
and in combination; the latter enabling the investigation of
any potential synergistic or additive effects. Two small
studies have recently directly compared gabapentin and
amitriptyline for efficacy and side effects for the relief of
pain in diabetic neuropathy (Morello et al., 1999; Dallocchio et al., 2000). Both studies reached a broadly similar
conclusion that both compounds achieved similar efficacy.
The Dallocchio et al. study indicated that the side effect
profile of gabapentin was superior to that of amitriptyline,
whilst the Morello et al. study showed no difference in the
incidence of side effects.
Symptom based studies comparing gabapentin with other
drug classes in postherpetic neuralgia would also be interesting, as would studies evaluating the efficacy of gabapentin in the ‘deafferentation’ and ‘irritable nociceptor’
classifications of patients which have been proposed for
postherpetic neuralgia (Fields et al., 1998).
In conclusion, this study adds to the growing evidence
that gabapentin significantly reduces chronic neuropathic
pain resulting from postherpetic neuralgia, reduces sleep
interference and improves some domains of quality of life.
Gabapentin has potential advantages in this predominantly
elderly population, being generally well tolerated (side
effects are mild and tend to be transient), with fewer contraindications than tricyclic antidepressants, and a lack of
limiting drug interactions (McLean, 1999).
