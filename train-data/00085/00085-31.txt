Objective: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of a once-daily gastroretentive formulation of gabapentin (G-GR; 1800 mg).
Methods: This was an 11-week, double-blind, randomized, placebocontrolled Phase 3 clinical trial in patients with postherpetic neuralgia. Patients underwent a 2-week dose titration, 8 weeks of stable
dosing, and 1 week of dose tapering. The primary endpoint was the
change in average daily pain intensity score from Baseline to Week 10
using Baseline Observation Carried Forward (BOCF) imputation.
Results: Four-hundred and fifty-two patients (mean age 65.6 y,
BMI 29 Kg/m2
) were randomized. Baseline average daily pain intensity score during the week prior to randomization was 6.6 and
6.5 for the G-GR and placebo treatment groups, respectively.
Three hundred and seventy-seven patients completed the study
(84% G-GR, 83% placebo). G-GR significantly reduced BOCF
change in average daily pain intensity compared with placebo (2.1
vs. 1.6; G-GR vs. placebo, P= 0.013). Compared with placebo,
more G-GR-treated patients reported “much” or “very much” improvement (patient global impression of change, 43% vs. 34%;
P< 0.0434), and G-GR reduced sleep interference (2.3 vs. 1.59;
P< 0.0001), although neither endpoint was considered statistically
significant based on a stringent hierarchical statistical paradigm.
Other secondary endpoints showed similar trends. The most common
adverse events were dizziness (G-GR, 11.3% vs. placebo, 1.7 %) and
somnolence (G-GR, 5.4% vs. placebo, 3.0%).
Conclusion: Once-daily G-GR 1800 mg was effective and well tolerated for the relief of pain in patients with postherpetic neuralgia.

Alarge body of evidence supports the use of gabapentin
in a variety of neuropathic pain syndromes, including
postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) for which it is specifically
indicated.1 In vitro, gabapentin reduces the calciumdependent release of several neurotransmitters by modulation, in part, of calcium-channel function.2,3 Gabapentin
specifically binds to CaVa2-d, resulting in a slow redistribution of calcium channels away from the functional
membrane sites and toward the cytosol; this action is
thought to result in a rapid action at synapses.4
PHN is defined as the persistence of pain for 3 months
or more after resolution of acute herpes zoster,5 with age
consistently associated with both increased prevalence and
worsening severity.6 PHN is often refractory to clinically
available analgesics; moreover, gabapentin is associated
with dose-limiting side effects that may limit its utility.4–7
The pharmacokinetic properties of gabapentin are well
established; its short half life (5 to 7 h)7 may potentially
reduce both convenience and plasma trough levels when
administered at least 3 times daily. In addition, gabapentin
is absorbed in the upper gastrointestinal tract, mainly
through a saturable L-amino acid transport system that
results in nonlinear absorption.7,8 These properties may be
overcome by formulation adjustments: G-GR is an extended-release formulation of gabapentin that uses a gastric
retentive technology9 designed to provide continuous delivery to the optimal site of absorption in the upper intestines over approximately 8 to 10 hours.10 Drug exposure
after administration of a G-GR dose of 1800 mg once
daily (qd) results in comparable systemic exposure to a
600 mg three times daily (tid) dose of the immediate-release
formulation.10
When administered as an asymmetrically administered
divided dose (600 mg qAM, 1200 mg qPM) over 4 weeks,
G-GR resulted in a statistically significant improvement in
average daily pain score compared with placebo.11 In a
large phase 3 clinical trial, a similar trend was observed
over a 10-week treatment period for once-daily dosing,
although it did not reach significance for the primary
outcome.12
We evaluated the efficacy and safety of once-daily
G-GR in a large, randomized placebo-controlled multicenter phase 3 clinical trial in PHN.
METHODS
Study Design
Patients from 89 investigative sites (57 in the United
States, 24 in Russia, and 8 in Argentina) participated in this
randomized, double-blind, parallel design, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical trial, conducted from March
2008 to August 2009. The study period included a 1-week
baseline period, followed by randomization and a 2-week

titration to a once-daily dose of 1800 mg G-GR or matched
placebo, followed by an 8-week maintenance-dose period,
followed by a 1-week dose-tapering period.
The study protocol was approved by appropriate institutional review boards/ethics committees for each center
and was conducted in accordance with International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practices guidelines. Written informed consent was obtained from each
patient before screening.
Patient Selection
The study included men and women, aged 18 years or
above, with persistent pain for at least 6 months but not
more than 5 years after the healing of a herpes zoster rash,
with a pain intensity score of at least 4 on the 11-point
Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) at screening. Patients were
excluded if they had previously not responded to treatment
with gabapentin at doses of Z1200 mg/d or pregabalin at
doses of Z300 mg/d as determined by the investigator, or if
they had experienced dose-limiting adverse effects with
gabapentin. Although this exclusion criterion may have
enriched the study population, its intent was for the
protection of patients. Other exclusion criteria included
neurolytic/neurosurgical treatment for PHN, severe pain
intensity from causes other than PHN, use of injected anesthetics or steroids within 30 days of baseline, immunocompromised state, gastric reduction surgery, history
of substance abuse within the past year, or any skin condition that could alter sensation in the area affected by
PHN. Moreover, patients with a creatinine clearance
<50 mL/min were excluded from the study to avoid dosing
adjustments.13
Before baseline assessments, patients were washed out
of current analgesic medications including opioids, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and gabapentin
or pregabalin. Patients were allowed to continue tricyclic
antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors,
acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (including COX-2 inhibitors), and aspirin, to ensure that enrolled patients who were randomized to placebo were not
left without analgesic treatment.
Throughout the baseline and treatment periods, an
electronic diary (DiaryPRO; Invivo Data Inc., Pittsburgh,
PA) was completed by the patient each morning to record
the average daily pain score and the degree to which pain
interfered with sleep. At the end of the baseline period
patients who continued to meet the eligibility requirements
of an average daily pain score of Z4 on the 11-point NRS
of 0 to 10 were randomized to treatment with once-daily
G-GR of 1800 mg or matched placebo.
Treatments
Starting doses during the 2-week titration period were
300 mg/d, increased to a ceiling daily dose of 1800 mg/d
over 2 weeks, on the basis of a predetermined dosing
schedule. Patients continued stable doses of 1800 mg/d for
an additional 8 weeks, followed by 1 week of dose tapering.
Treatment allocation was achieved using a parallel 1:1
electronic randomization scheme that was stratified by site.
Endpoints
Primary endpoint was change from baseline in the
average daily pain score measured on the 11-point NRS.
The DiaryPRO electronic diary was used throughout the
study by each patient to record average daily pain intensity
and the degree to which pain caused sleep interference each
morning throughout the study. At study week 10, investigator-rated clinician global impression of change (CGIC)
and patient-rated patient global impression of change
(PGIC) were completed. Other post hoc subanalyses included efficacy post hoc analyses by age, duration of PHN,
distribution of PHN, baseline average daily pain score,
history of gabapentin/pregabalin use, and pain descriptor.
Statistical Methods
The primary endpoint was change in the baseline observation carried forward (BOCF) average daily pain score
from the baseline week to week 10 of the efficacy treatment
period. We used the BOCF imputation method to calculate
efficacy endpoints on the basis of the assumptions that
missing data result from early termination primarily
because of adverse effects of the study drug, and the possibility that symptoms may improve over the duration of
the study. Secondary endpoints included last observation
carried forward (LOCF) change in average daily pain score,
change in the average daily pain score by study week difference in CGIC and PGIC evaluations at endpoint and
post hoc analyses by country, and change in the sleep interference score. A sample size of 450 patients (225 per
treatment arm) was projected to have 90% power to detect
a difference of 0.4 in the average daily pain score from
baseline to the end of the study at an a level of 0.05.
Efficacy and safety analyses were performed on the
intent-to-treat (ITT) population, which includes all randomized patients with valid baseline measurements and who
received study medication. Analysis of the primary efficacy
outcome was performed using an analysis of covariance
(ANCOVA) parallel lines model that included treatment
and center effects, with the baseline average daily pain score
as a continuous covariate. Calculations included the least
squares (LS) estimate of the mean change of the average
daily pain score within each treatment and its 95% confidence interval. Subgroup analyses were performed to
evaluate the effects of age, duration of PHN, distribution of
PHN, baseline average daily pain score, history of gabapentin/pregabalin use, and pain descriptor.
An analysis of variance model including treatment and
center or a parallel lines ANCOVA model including treatment, center, and baseline measurement as the covariate
was used for the analysis of continuous secondary efficacy
measurements. Patients from all study sites were pooled for
the analysis of the categorical outcome data (PGIC and
CGIC). A 2-sample Z test on 2 proportions (much or very
much improved versus other categories) between G-GR
treatment and placebo treatment was performed to assess
significance.
Because gabapentin was a known drug, a closed sequential hierarchical statistical paradigm was developed to
assess the significance of secondary efficacy parameters, on
the basis of 3 additional null hypotheses; no treatment
group difference in: (1) the proportion of patients who were
categorized as “very much improved” or “much improved”
in the PGIC score in the ITT population; (2) the proportion
of patients who were categorized as “very much improved”
or “much improved” in the CGIC score in the ITT population; and (3) the mean change from baseline in the
average daily sleep interference scores at the final week of
the efficacy treatment period, utilizing BOCF in the ITT
population. The hierarchical statistical paradigm was dependent on a statistically significant primary outcome,

performed at a= 0.05; the analyses on PGIC and CGIC
were then performed simultaneously at the a = 0.05/
2 = 0.025 two-sided significance level; if either test was
statistically significant, the analysis on average daily sleep
interference scores was performed at the a = 0.05 two-sided
significance level.
Safety endpoints included patient-reported adverse
events (AEs), baseline and end of study vital signs, and
routine hematology and blood chemistry panels. All
randomized patients who took at least 1 dose of study
medication were included in the safety analysis and summaries. Fisher exact test was used to compare the incidence
of the most frequent AEs (> 1%) between G-GR treatment
and placebo treatment.
RESULTS
A total of 512 patients were screened and 452 were
randomized (United States, 259; Russia, 161; Argentina,
32). The Consort flow diagram is shown in Figure 1. Of the
452 randomized patients, 377 (84% G-GR, 83% placebo)
completed the clinical trial. Seventy-two (15.9%) patients
discontinued the study treatment prematurely. Of those
treated with G-GR, 16.3% discontinued prematurely due to
(1) an AE (52.8%), (2) lack of efficacy (19.4%), and (3)
withdrawal of consent (11.1%). Conversely, of those
treated with placebo, 16.9% discontinued prematurely,
most commonly due to (1) lack of efficacy (30.8%), (2)
withdrawal of consent (23.1%), and (3) an AE (20.5%).
Demographic and baseline characteristics at randomization are presented in Table 1. There were no statistically
significant differences in age, sex, or race between the G-GR
and placebo cohorts. Four hundred two (88.9%) were
Caucasian and 283 (62.6%) were women. The mean age±
SD was 65.6± 12.2 (range, 21 to 89) years. The baseline
average daily pain score was 6.6± 1.4 for the G-GR group
and 6.5± 1.4 for the placebo group, the most prominent site
of pain being the torso in both groups (data not shown). The
mean duration of pain was 19.3± 12.5 and 21.1± 15.4
months, respectively, for the G-GR and placebo groups, with
approximately one third of patients in each group having
experienced persistent pain for between 6 and 12 months.
There were no statistically significant differences between the
G-GR and placebo groups for prior use and/or response to
gabapentin/pregabalin before study entry.
Efficacy Endpoints
The primary analysis (LS mean change in the BOCF
average daily pain score from baseline to the final week of the
efficacy treatment period) showed a significant reduction for
G-GR (2.12) compared with placebo (1.63) (P= 0.013;
95% confidence interval: 0.88, 0.11) (Fig. 2). This difference from placebo was statistically significant after 1 week
and continued to be superior at each time point for the
10-week duration of the study in both the BOCF and LOCF
analyses.
Secondary Endpoints
The LS mean (± SEM) difference (7.14± 3.11) in
percentage change from baseline to endpoint in the BOCF
average daily pain score for the ITT population between
G-GR (32.44 ± 2.63) and placebo (25.30± 2.60) was
statistically significant (P = 0.022). The LS mean ( ± SEM)

baseline to endpoint in LOCF average daily pain score between G-GR (37.52± 2.77) and placebo (28.49± 2.74)
was also statistically significant (P= 0.006).
The proportion of those patients with at least a 50%
reduction in the average daily pain score from baseline to
BOCF endpoint was 29.5% for the G-GR group and
22.6% for the placebo group; the proportion of responders
on the basis of LOCF endpoint was 36.8% for the G-GR
group and 25.7% for the placebo group. Neither responder
analysis resulted in a statistically significant difference.
Trends were consistent with that of the primary endpoint. The proportion of patients categorized as much or
very much improved on the PGIC was higher for G-GR
(42.7%) than for placebo (33.5%) with a difference of 9%
(P = 0.043; Fig. 3). The proportion of patients categorized
as much or very much improved on the CGIC was also
higher for G-GR (44.1%) than for placebo (33.9%) with a
difference of 10% (P = 0.027). The analyses on PGIC and
CGIC were conducted simultaneously at the 2-sided significance level (a= 0.025) and were not considered statistically significant.
Using a BOCF imputation method, trends toward
differential analgesic effects compared with the overall
population (mean change, 0.49) were noted for patients
aged between 65 and 75 years (D = 0.67; n= 168;
P = 0.059), duration of PHN between 6 and 12 months
(D = 0.91; n= 162; P = 0.018), baseline pain intensity of
<8/10 (D= 0.53; n = 373; P = 0.011), PHN with allodynia (D= 0.66; n = 243; P = 0.016), and shooting and
burning pain (D = 0.92; n = 228; P = 0.003).
Although mean differences in average daily pain intensity within the US and Russian centers favored G-GR,
consistent with the overall result (United States,
0.78 ± 0.28; Russia, 0.43± 0.27), those in the Argentine centers were + 0.64± 0.88.
Of the 259 patients recruited in the United States,
BOCF change in average daily pain compared with placebo
was 0.74 for those patients in the gabapentin-naive subgroup (n= 117; P = 0.12), and 0.87 for those with prior
exposure to gabapentin or pregabalin (n = 140; P = 0.03).
Data on the previous exposure status for 2/259 patients
were not known.
Sleep interference was reduced with G-GR compared
with placebo. From a baseline of 5.3 and 5.2, respectively,

LOCF imputation methods was higher in the G-GR group
than in the placebo group (BOCF, 2.3 vs. 1.6,
P = 0.0001; LOCF, 2.7 vs. 1.8, P = 0.0001), and the
improvement persisted throughout the 10-week duration of
the study. Again, because of the sequential hierarchical
paradigm, these comparisons were not considered statistically significant.
Safety
We assessed the nature, frequency, and severity of AEs
in the safety population of 452 patients (G-GR, n= 221;
placebo, n = 231) (Table 2). AEs were reported by 118
patients (53.4%) and 92 patients (39.8%) in the G-GR and
placebo groups, respectively. Nineteen patients (8.6%) in
the G-GR arm and 10 patients (4.3%) in the placebo arm
withdrew from the study because of AEs. The only AE
leading to the discontinuation of Z2% of patients was
dizziness in the G-GR group (2.3%). Ten serious AEs were
reported (4 in the G-GR group and 6 in the placebo group),
none attributable to the study drug.
The frequency of AEs commonly associated with gabapentin was as follows: dizziness (G-GR, 11.3%; placebo,
1.7%), somnolence (G-GR, 5.4%; placebo, 3.0%), and
peripheral edema (G-GR, 3.2%; placebo, 0.4%) with the
differences in dizziness and peripheral edema being statistically significant. A similar pattern of AEs was seen in
patients less than 65 years and greater than 65 years of age
with 61.7% of younger patients (dizziness, 12.3%) and
47.1% of older patients (dizziness, 10.7%) experiencing
AEs. The incidence of any AE was 54% among patients
with prior exposure to, and 66% among those naive to
gabapentin or pregabalin; the incidence of AEs was 40%
and 46% in the corresponding placebo groups. The incidence of dizziness and somnolence was 14.1% and 8.5%
(placebo, 0% and 2.9%) in the prior treatment group, and
7.1% and 5.4% (placebo, 0% and 3.2%) in the naive group.
The rates of AEs in G-GR patients with creatinine
clearance Z80 mL/min (53%) did not differ significantly
from those with creatinine clearance <80 mL/min (56%).
DISCUSSION
Our data show that G-GR reduces pain intensity
compared with placebo in PHN, whether missing data were
imputed by carrying the baseline or last observations forward. The observed reduction in average daily pain from
baseline in the G-GR treatment arm (BOCF, 2.1; LOCF,
2.3) is similar to those obtained by Rowbotham et al14
(LOCF, 2.1) and Rice and Maton15 (LOCF, 2.3) in
studies of immediate-release gabapentin. Similar reductions
in pain intensity are seen in studies of pregabalin.16,17
In a large 10-week study in PHN that failed to show
analgesic efficacy of 2 dose regimens of G-GR 1800 mg
daily in PHN,12 a high placebo response was noted, particularly in the subgroup with PHN of between 3 and 6
months; this may have been partly the result of spontaneous remission, as the response to placebo compared
with G-GR was differentially greater in the subgroup

with <6 months’ duration of PHN. In the current study,
patients with spontaneous resolution within 6 months were
excluded to ensure that only patients with stable disease
were recruited.
Patients were recruited from 3 different continents and
3 different health care systems (United States, Russia, and
Argentina). The baseline average daily pain rating across
both treatment groups was similar in the 3 countries (6.5,
6.7, and 7.0, respectively), but the reduction in average
daily pain during the study on active therapy was much
more pronounced in the US patients (2.5) compared with
the those in Russia and Argentina (1.6 and 1.7,
respectively). There were even greater differences in the
placebo response (1.7, 1.2, and 2.3, respectively) in
the 3 countries, with patients in Argentina exhibiting the
largest placebo response, possibly reflecting cultural differences in patient expectations and health care. The small size
of the subgroup recruited from Argentina contributes to the
difficulty in interpreting these data.
More than half of patients with PHN have sleep disturbance18 although the diurnal component of the pain can
still be significant.19 G-GR taken as a single 1800-mg dose
with the evening meal results in peak plasma levels at approximately 5 hours after dosing,10 which may, in part,
account for the trend of improvement in sleep interference.
At 10 hours after dosing, plasma levels remain within 25%
of the peak plasma levels due to the continued delivery of
gabapentin from the gastric retentive formulation20 that
likely contributes to the continued efficacy throughout the
day.
The primary outcome was based on an ANCOVA
analysis using the BOCF imputation strategy to analyze the
data from those patients who terminated early, independent
of the reason for dropping out. In fact, this strategy was based
on the AE profile of gabapentin immediate release observed in
the Rice and Maton15 and Rowbotham et al14 clinical trials,
in which the rates of dizziness were 31% and 24%, respectively, and the rates of daytime somnolence were 17%
and 27%, respectively. In contrast, we observed a relatively
low rate of withdrawal in the G-GR arm due to AEs (8.6%,
approximately 4% greater than that in placebo), with rates of
dizziness and somnolence of 11% and 5%, respectively. In
retrospect, a multiple imputation strategy may have been
preferable. Interestingly, patients belonging to the subgroup
of age 65 years and above reported fewer (47%) AEs compared with those in the less than 65-year subgroup (62%),
including dizziness (65 years and above, 10.7%; less than 65
years, 12.3%), possibly explained, in part, by the exclusion of
patients for whom the first line analgesic, gabapentin, was
already known to result in intolerable side effects.
In summary, compared with placebo, G-GR 1800 mg
once daily provided clinically and statistically significant
reduction in pain intensity and reduction in sleep interference in patients with PHN. G-GR was well tolerated with a
lower incidence of common AEs than previously reported
in gabapentin studies, even in the gabapentin-naive subgroup. Trends toward differential analgesic effects were
noted in the subgroups with PHN of <12 months’ duration, gabapentin prior usage, baseline pain score <8/10,
allodynia, and shooting/burning pain.
