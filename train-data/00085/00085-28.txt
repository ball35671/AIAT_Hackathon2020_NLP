ABSTRACT. Rintala DH, Holmes SA, Courtade D, Fiess
RN, Tastard LV, Loubser PG. Comparison of the effectiveness
of amitriptyline and gabapentin on chronic neuropathic pain in
persons with spinal cord injury. Arch Phys Med Rehabil 2007;
88:1547-60.
Objective: To test the hypotheses that both amitriptyline and
gabapentin are more effective in relieving neuropathic pain
than an active placebo, diphenhydramine.
Design: Randomized, controlled, double blind, triple crossover 8-week trial.
Setting: Veterans Affairs medical center.
Participants: Community dwelling adults with spinal cord
injury (N38) were recruited by telephone, letters, and flyers.
Intervention: Eight-week trial each of amitriptyline, gabapentin, and diphenhydramine.
Main Outcome Measures: Pain intensity measured with a
10-cm visual analog scale (VAS) and an 11-point (0 –10)
numeric rating scale (NRS) and depressive symptomatology
measured with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression ScaleShort Form (CESD-SF).
Results: Baseline VAS scores for participants with low
(10) CESD-SF scores was 4.61 and for those with high
scores (10) it was 7.41. At week 8, in participants with high
baseline CESD-SF scores, amitriptyline (mean, 4.21) was more
effective than diphenhydramine (mean, 6.67; P.035), and
there was a nonsignificant trend suggesting that amitriptyline
may be more effective than gabapentin (mean, 6.68; P.061).
Gabapentin was no more effective than diphenhydramine
(P.97). There was no significant difference among the medications for those with lower CESD-SF scores. Results could
not be attributed to dropout rates, order or dose of medications,
amount of medication taken for breakthrough pain, or side
effects.
Conclusions: Amitriptyline is more efficacious in relieving
neuropathic pain than diphenhydramine at or below the level of
spinal cord injury in people who have considerable depressive
symptomatology.

PERSONS WITH SPINAL CORD injury (SCI) frequently
have chronic pain; estimates put the numbers from 65% to
81%.1-10 Neuropathic pain at or below the level of the injury is
a particularly intractable type of pain experienced by an estimated 29% to 75% of persons with SCI.2,11-15 The prevalence
of chronic neuropathic pain varies, based on time since injury2,13,14,16 and by whether the pain is at or below the level of
injury.2,13,14,17 For example, Siddall et al2,13,14 reported an
approximate 38% prevalence of at-level pain at 2 weeks and 6
months postinjury and a prevalence of 41% at 5 years. The
prevalence of below-level pain was 14% at 2 weeks, 19% at 6
months, and 34% at 5 years.
Chronic pain is associated with depressive symptomatology
in participants with SCI. Higher levels of depressive symptoms
are related to (1) having chronic pain compared with not having
chronic pain,7,18 (2) greater pain intensity,19,20 (3) more painful
days a month,18 (4) more hours of daily pain,18 and pain
interference with daily activities.21
Various treatments for chronic neuropathic pain have included
increased activity levels, provision of psychosocial support, management of concomitant health problems, electric stimulation,
nerve blocks, surgery, use— or stopping use— of chemicals
including nicotine, cannabis, alcohol, caffeine, herbs, and prescription medications (antidepressants [eg, amitriptyline], anticonvulsants [eg, carbamazepine, gabapentin], narcotic drugs
[eg, morphine, codeine]).22 These treatments are often ineffective and have undesirable side effects.23
Amitriptyline (Elavil) is a tricyclic antidepressant that has
been associated with significant analgesia in different animal
models,24 including neuropathy and deafferentation-induced
autotomy.25 It has been a drug of choice for treating pain in
people with SCI, but to our knowledge, only a few studies have
described the effect of amitriptyline on chronic pain syndromes
in the SCI population. These include several surveys26-29 and a
randomized controlled trial (RCT).30
Gabapentin (Neurontin) is an anticonvulsant. RCTs of gabapentin for postherpetic neuralgia31 and painful neuropathy in
patients with diabetes mellitus32 found the medication to be
effective and to have tolerable side effects. Preclinical studies
in rat models with SCI indicated that gabapentin reduced
allodynia,33 reduced paw withdrawal to mechanic and thermal
stimuli,34 and ameliorated changes in spontaneous exploratory
activity.35 There have been several studies of the effectiveness
of gabapentin on pain in participants with SCI, including
surveys,26-29 retrospective studies,36,37 uncontrolled open-label
trials,38,39 and RCTs.40,41

In light of our previous work,7,18 and the works of others19-21
that have highlighted the prevalence of depressive symptomatology in conjunction with chronic pain in the SCI population,
we conducted a clinical trial to directly compare the effectiveness of an antidepressant (amitriptyline) and an anticonvulsant
(gabapentin) with an active control substance, diphenhydramine (Benadryl). We used an active control to maintain the
double blind, placebo-controlled design. Our hypotheses were
that in participants with SCI: (1) amitriptyline will be more
effective than diphenhydramine in relieving chronic neuropathic pain at or below the level of injury; (2) gabapentin will
be more effective than diphenhydramine in relieving chronic
neuropathic pain at or below the level of injury; and (3)
amitriptyline will differentially affect pain, depending on the
baseline level of depressive symptomatology.
Although we did not state it as an a priori hypothesis,
because there was no previous evidence comparing the 2, we
expected gabapentin to be more effective than amitriptyline,
based on the limited evidence available when we designed the
study.
METHODS
Study Design
We used a randomized, controlled, double blind, triplecrossover design to compare the effectiveness and safety of
gabapentin and amitriptyline with an active control medication,
diphenhydramine, for the relief of chronic neuropathic pain at
and/or below the level of injury in people with SCI. We used
a crossover design to control for the effect of individual differences in the perception and reporting of pain. We began a
baseline week after all medications being used for pain control
at time of entry to the study were discontinued. During the
baseline week, participants were instructed not to take any pain
medications except the medication for breakthrough pain that
we provided. Mercadante et al42 define breakthrough pain as
“transitory exacerbation of pain that occurs in addition to
otherwise stable persistent pain.”
At the end of the baseline week, eligible participants were
randomized into 1 of 6 groups. The groups differed only in
regard to the order in which the participants would receive the
3 study medications. The groups were: (1) gabapentin-amitriptyline-diphenhydramine (GAD), (2) GDA, (3) AGD, (4) ADG,
(5) DGA, and (6) DAG. For each consecutive set of 6 participants, 1 was assigned to each of the 6 groups. The order of this
assignment within the sets of 6 was based on a table of random
numbers, and varied from set to set. Each study drug was
administered for 9 weeks. During each of the 3 medication
phases, the daily dose of medication was gradually increased in
the first 4 weeks. Daily dosage was kept constant to the extent
possible for weeks 5 through 8; however, if side effects became
too severe, dosages or the number of doses a day were decreased. The medication was gradually decreased and then
discontinued during the ninth week. The tenth week of each
medication phase was a washout week similar to the baseline
week. Participants were instructed not to take any pain medications other than those we provided at any time during the
study.
Participant Recruitment
From November 2001 to April 2004, participants were recruited primarily from lists of persons with SCI who had
participated in previous research studies and had given permission to be contacted for future studies, and through word of
mouth. Inclusion criteria were: (1) 18 to 70 years of age, (2)
with an SCI at any level and any degree of completeness, (3)
the SCI occurred at least 12 months before entering the study,
(4) at least 1 chronic (6mo) pain component characteristic of
neuropathic pain, (5) at least 1 neuropathic pain component
rated as at least 5 on a 0 to 10 scale when initially contacted
about participating, and (6) lived within 160km (100 miles) of
the Michael E. DeBakey Veterans Affairs Medical Center
(MEDVAMC).
Exclusion criteria were: (1) evidence of significant cardiac
conduction disturbance, (2) history of seizures, (3) evidence of
liver dysfunction indicative of an infectious process or hepaticellular injury, (4) evidence of renal insufficiency, (5) taking
any contraindicated medications such as maximum acid output
(MAO) inhibitors, (6) current or recent substance abuse problem, (7) evidence of a previous allergic reaction to any of the
study medications, (8) evidence of a serious psychologic disorder that would prevent giving informed consent or hinder
one’s ability to follow through with the study based on the
attending physician’s clinical judgment, (9) evidence of psychologic or psychosomatic chronic pain based on clinical judgment (no one was excluded based on this criterion), and (10)
pregnancy.
In planning this study, we based our required sample size
calculation on an RCT by Rowbotham et al31 of the use of
gabapentin to treat neuropathic pain after herpes zoster. At the
time we designed this study, there were no published RCTs of
gabapentin to treat neuropathic pain in persons with SCI. A
parallel arm design, rather than a crossover design, was used in
the Rowbotham study. The sample size requirement for a
parallel study would be 31 participants in each group in order
to detect a difference as large as 1.8 on the visual analog scale
(VAS). Our planned sample size for each of the 6 assignment
groups was based on the formula n*
[n(1 – ICC)]/2, where n
is the sample size needed for each group in an equivalent 3-arm
parallel study and ICC is the intraclass correlation coefficient.43
Thus, using data from Rowbotham, n*
[31(1–.55)]/27. Because there were 6 randomly assigned sequence groups we
estimated that we would need 42 (67) participants to complete all 3 arms of the study.
Procedure
The Institutional Review Board for Human Subject Research
for Baylor College of Medicine and Affiliated Hospitals approved all procedures. After prescreening by telephone, potential candidates were invited to the MEDVAMC SCI outpatient
clinic to provide their written informed consent and establish
their eligibility. A research assistant (RNF) administered several questionnaires concerning pain, daily activities, and the
participants’ well being (see the Measures section). The candidates’ vital signs were obtained and their medical records
reviewed to identify any contraindications for participating in
the study. The following were verified for each participant
within a 6-month window prior to study entry: complete blood
count, electrolyte panel, liver function studies, and electrocardiogram (ECG). Women of childbearing potential were given a
serum pregnancy test.
A physician reviewed the results of all tests and interviewed
candidates to assess whether they had chronic neuropathic pain
at and/or below the level of injury. Identification of pain as
being neuropathic depended on (1) the location of pain with
respect to the level of injury (at or below the level of injury),
(2) its qualitative nature (burning, stinging, or stabbing), (3) its
pattern (diffuse, nonradicular), and (4) what worsens the pain
(eg, movement, certain activities, spasticity). If a participant
had more than 1 pain site, 1 site of neuropathic pain at and/or
below the level of injury was specified as the pain site of

interest for the study. Eligible candidates were randomized as
described in the study design section.
Participants were evaluated on 8 occasions in the clinic and
on 9 occasions in their homes during the 31 weeks they were
in the study. After their eligibility was established, the participants were evaluated at the end of the baseline week and at
weeks 2, 4, 8, and 10 during each of the 3 medication phases.
Beginning in January 2003, we began evaluating participants at
the end of week 6 to better ensure their safety and compliance.
During each visit, the research assistant again administered
questionnaires regarding pain at the specified study site, daily
activities, and subjective well-being, took vital signs, and obtained information about medication intake, side effects, and
adverse events, if any. The study coordinator (DC) provided
the medications and instructions for the next study period, and
also set each participant’s next clinic appointment. Participants
were paid $50 for each clinic visit and $25 for each home visit.
The payments covered the costs of transportation, arranging for
an attendant, childcare, or other incurred expenses. The first
visit lasted approximately 1 hour and all subsequent visits
lasted approximately 30 minutes. In addition to the clinic and
home visits every 1 to 4 weeks, the research assistant contacted
the participants by telephone once or twice a week. During
these contacts, the research assistant obtained the participants’
numeric pain ratings, as well as information about medication
usage, side effects, and adverse events since the last contact.
These interviews lasted approximately 5 to 10 minutes.
Medications
Participants were provided tablets containing a combination
of 5mg of oxycodone and 325mg of acetaminophen for breakthrough pain in packets of 8 tablets, 1 packet for each day of the
study, from the beginning of the baseline week through the
washout week after the third medication (maximum, 217d;
1736 tablets). Participants were instructed to take the tablets
only if necessary and to start a new packet each day. They were
told to leave any remaining tablets for that day in the packet so
that we could monitor the amount of breakthrough medication
used each day.
The maximum doses in this study were 50mg, 3 times daily
for amitriptyline and 1200mg, 3 times daily for gabapentin. We
chose these dosages because they are widely accepted by
practitioners as the standards for treating neuropathic pain in
persons with SCI.44 Smaller dosages of amitriptyline may have
been effective, however. For example, Max et al45 found that
105mg of amitriptyline was equally effective in depressed and
nondepressed patients with diabetic neuropathic pain. In our
study, amitriptyline was provided in 3 daily doses rather than 1
dose at bedtime because gabapentin was taken 3 times daily
and we wanted to keep the treatments as similar as possible.
Table 1 shows the daily maximum dose schedules for amitriptyline and gabapentin. Lower doses were taken if necessary due
to unacceptable side effects or if pain relief was achieved.
During week 9 of each medication phase, the daily dose of the
study medication was gradually decreased (table 1). We considered a 1-week washout period after each medication was
discontinued to be sufficient to avoid carry-over effects, because gabapentin has a half-life of 6 to 8 hours and amitriptyline has a half-life of 24 to 70 hours.
Our control medication, diphenhydramine, is an antihistamine. Its maximum individual dose was 25mg, 3 times daily,
and that dose was kept constant for the entire 9-week phase.
Participants received 1 dose a day for the first 3 days, 2 doses
a day for the next 2 days, and 3 a day thereafter through week
8. During week 9 they received 2 doses a day for 2 days and 1
dose a day for 2 days, to gradually discontinue the medication.
We used diphenhydramine as the control medication because it
is not a pain reliever but does have some side effects, such as
drowsiness and dry mouth, which are similar to side effects of
the other 2 medications. This fact helped maintain the double
blind design. The half-life of diphenhydramine is 3 to 12 hours.
All 3 medications were prepared by a commercial compounding pharmacy and placed in identical capsules according
to the dosing schedule. Inactive filler, sodium bicarbonate, was
used for 1 or 2 doses a day while gradually increasing or
decreasing the total daily dose (see table 1). They were packaged in blister packs, which were labeled with the day and the

time for each dose to be taken. We used labeled blister packaging to facilitate adherence to the dosing schedule.
Measures
Demographic and injury-related information was obtained
from questionnaires and medical records and included age, sex,
race and ethnicity, marital status, whether the participant was a
military veteran, age at onset of SCI, time since onset, and level
and completeness of the injury.
The VAS is a 10cm line anchored on the left with the words
“no pain” and on the right with “worst possible pain.”46 A
participant draws a mark across the line at a point representing
the severity of his/her pain. The distance from the left end to
the participant’s mark is the VAS pain intensity score. Huskisson46 and other researchers have found the VAS to be reliable
and valid. The VAS was obtained at each visit to the clinic or
to the home. For participants who were unable to accurately
draw a line across the appropriate point on the VAS (ie,
persons with tetraplegia), the research assistant slowly moved
the pen along the VAS line until the participant indicated that
the pen was at the correct point. The research assistant then
drew the line across the VAS at that point.
The numeric rating scale (NRS) is a simple 0 to 10 rating
scale. Only the 2 ends are designated by words (0, no pain; 10,
worst possible pain). It is similar to the VAS, but can be used
during a telephone contact. Downie et al47 found that a similar
11-point scale was more sensitive than a 4-point descriptive
scale and was more easily understood than the VAS. We used
the NRS at intake, during each telephone call, and at each clinic
and home visit. We used it in addition to the VAS because we
wanted to assess pain intensity during telephone contacts. NRS
ratings could thus be obtained more frequently than VAS
ratings. Weekly averages of the NRS obtained by phone and/or
in person are likely to be more stable than single ratings. An
additional advantage in using both the NRS and VAS is that by
using 2 methods of obtaining the data, the study conclusions
are strengthened if similar effects are indicated.
The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression ScaleShort
Form (CESD-SF) is a 10-item, self-report scale designed to measure symptoms of depression in the general population.48 Each
item is rated on a 0 to 3 scale according to how often the person
experienced certain feelings (eg, depression and hopefulness) in
the past week (1d, 1–2d, 3– 4d, 5–7d). Scores for positive
feelings are reversed. It has good predictive accuracy (.97)
compared with the original 20-item CES-D.49 The CESD-SF was
found by the developers to have a test-retest correlation of r equal
to .71.48 The CESD-SF was administered at baseline and at weeks
4, 8, and 10 of each medication phase. The Cronbach  was .80 in
this study.
Side-effects checklist. During each telephone contact, clinic
visit, and home visit, participants were asked if they had
experienced any of 17 possible side effects. The list included
common and serious side effects for each medication. Participants were also encouraged to report any other side effects they
experienced that were not on the list.
Medication costs. The cost of amitriptyline and gabapentin
at the maximum dosing for 1 month at the schedule used in this
study was obtained from the MEDVAMC pharmacy department in January 2007.
Data Analysis
Descriptive analyses were performed on all study variables. Means, medians, standard deviations, and ranges were
obtained for continuous variables and number and percentage were obtained for categoric variables. All NRS ratings
were averaged for each participant for each week. CESD-SF
scores were recoded into 2 groups: less depressive symptomatology (CESD-SF score 10) and more depressive symptomatology (CESD-SF score 10). This cutpoint was recommended by the developers of the short-form of the CES-D.48
Side effects were tallied for each medication arm. Differences
between participants who completed all 3 phases (completers)
and those who did not (noncompleters) were assessed with t
tests for continuous variables and chi-square tests for categoric
variables.
The primary outcome variable was the final pain rating
(pain on average for week 8 for each medication) as measured by the VAS. We did a repeated-measures analysis of
variance (ANOVA) to compare the effectiveness of the 3
medications. Because amitriptyline is an antidepressant, the
analysis was repeated with the dichotomous depressive symptomatology variable (CESD-SF scores 10 or 10) as a between-subjects factor. We did a similar analysis using the week
8 NRS average score. We calculated the change in average pain
intensity as measured by the VAS and the percentage change
from baseline to week 8 of each medication. The proportion of
participants whose pain intensity decreased at least 30% was
calculated for each medication within the 2 depressive symptomatology groups. A change of 30% or better is considered to
be a minimal clinically important difference.50
We determined the dropout rates across time for each medication. A dropout was defined as a participant who was unable
to complete at least the first 8 weeks of a given medication
phase. A participant could drop out of the entire study or could
drop out of a particular medication phase because of intolerable
side effects, then after a washout week, begin the next scheduled medication phase. The effect of dropping out was assessed
by comparing VAS data for those who completed all 3 phases
of the study with all available data at baseline and weeks 2, 4,
and 8 for each medication. The effect of the order in which the
medications were taken was assessed with separate 1-way
ANOVAs for each medication for the VAS score at week 8.
Similarly, we compared the percentage of the maximum dose
of the 3 medications taken during weeks 2, 4, and 8. The
amount of breakthrough medication taken during the 3 medication phases was compared within the 2 depressive symptomatology groups by using nonparametric Friedman tests because
the distribution was highly skewed.
Finally, we calculated the 1-month costs for 50mg of amitriptyline taken 3 times a day and 1200mg of gabapentin taken
3 times a day. We calculated an efficacy factor by dividing the
percentage change in average pain intensity by the cost for 1
month. Separate calculations were conducted for the 2 depressive symptomatology groups.
RESULTS
Participants and Profile of the Study
Figure 1 shows the study’s flowchart. People excluded from
the study included: 3 who had elevated liver enzymes, 1 who
had an abnormal ECG, 1 who was already taking higher doses
of the study medications than the maximum allowed in this
study, 1 who was allergic to 1 of the study medications, 1 with
a recent history of drug abuse, and 1 who did not have chronic
neuropathic pain. One person died from unrelated causes before being randomized. One person was excluded because his
laboratory findings were outdated and he was unable to have
them updated before the end of recruitment. Of the 38 participants randomized, 22 (58%) completed all 3 phases of the
medication regimen. A total of 26 participants completed the
gabapentin phase, 28 completed the amitriptyline phase, and 25
1550 COMPARING AMITRIPTYLINE AND GABAPENTIN, Rintala

completed the diphenhydramine phase. Five persons attempted
all 3 phases, but had to crossover to the next medication early
in at least 1 phase because of unacceptable side effects.
Tables 2 and 3 show the continuous and categorical variables
of the study sample. More than one third of the participants had
high CESD-SF scores (10). The mean for pain intensity on
average during the baseline week fell in the moderate range
while the mean for worst pain at both intake and during the
baseline week was in the severe intensity range.51 There was no
significant difference between the completers and the noncompleters on any of the variables listed in tables 2 and 3.
Effectiveness of the Medications
Mean VAS ratings for pain on average during week 8 for all
22 completers were: amitriptyline, 3.462.09; gabapentin,
4.852.86; and diphenhydramine, 5.112.54. A repeatedmeasures ANOVA indicated a main effect of medication
(F4.61, P.016). Follow-up paired t tests with Bonferroni
adjustment for multiple comparisons indicated that average
pain intensity in week 8 with amitriptyline therapy was significantly lower than with gabapentin therapy (t2.32, P.03;
effect size, Cohen d.55), or diphenhydramine therapy (t2.76,
P.012; Cohen d.71). There was no significant difference between gabapentin and diphenhydramine therapy.
A similar repeated-measures ANOVA was performed in
which the dichotomous depressive symptomatology variable
was entered as a between-subjects factor. The main effect of
medication was significant (F5.48, P.008), as was the
main effect of the depressive symptomatology variable
(F8.48, P.008). The interaction term was not significant,
indicating that the pattern of relative effects among the 3
medications is similar in the high and low CESD-SF groups.
Figure 2 shows the means and error bars (2 standard
errors) for the VAS scores for each of the 3 medications
within the high and low CESD-SF groups. When follow-up
paired t tests were performed separately for the high (n8)
and low (n14) CESD-SF participants, pain intensity during amitriptyline therapy (mean, 4.211.95) was significantly lower than during diphenhydramine therapy (mean,
6.681.88) within the high CESD-SF group only (t2.61,
P.035). Additionally, when the effect of amitriptyline and
gabapentin therapy on pain intensity was compared within
the high CESD-SF group, there was a nonsignificant trend
toward lower pain intensity during amitriptyline therapy

(t2.23, P.061). There was no significant difference in
pain intensity among the 3 medications in the low CESD-SF
group.
Results for pain intensity at its worst during week 8 were similar to
those for pain intensity on average during week 8. Means for worst
pain intensity (n22) were: amitriptyline, 5.682.39; gabapentin,
7.222.38; and diphenhydramine, 7.052.09. In a repeatedmeasures ANOVA in which the CESD-SF variable was entered
as a between-subjects factor, the main effect for medication
(F5.7, P.007) and the depressive symptomatology variable
(F14.41, P.001) were both significant, but the interaction
was not.
Figures 3 and 4 show the longitudinal results for the VAS
and the NRS. Week 0 refers to the pain intensity rating just
before each medication was started. For the first medication,
this was the baseline rating. For the second and third medications, it was the rating at the end of week 10 (end of washout)
of the previous medication. There was no significant difference
in the week 0 VAS pain ratings among the 3 medications,
whether they were analyzed with the CESD-SF variable as a
covariate (main effect of medication, F.77, P.472; main
effect of CESD-SF group, F11.85, P.003; interaction,
F.40, P.671) or not (effect of medication, F.85, P.437).
In both figures (VAS and NRS), with 1 exception in the high
CESD-SF group at week 2 for VAS, pain intensity during
amitriptyline therapy was consistently lower (but not always
significantly) than during therapy with either of the other 2
medications at weeks 2 through 8 for both the high and low
CESD-SF groups.
Figure 5 shows the decrease in average pain from baseline to
week 8 of each medication for the high and low CESD-SF
groups. In both groups, the decrease was greater during the
amitriptyline phase; however, the differences in pain intensity
among the medications was significant only in the high
CESD-SF group (F4.02, P.042). Figure 6 shows the mean
percentage change from baseline for each medication within
each depressive symptomatology group. Amitriptyline had the
greatest percentage of change from baseline in both CESD-SF
groups; however, the differences among the medications was
not significant in either group, but there was a nonsignificant
trend in the high CESD-SF group (F3.2, P.072). Among
the participants in the low CESD-SF group, the percentages
with at least a 30% decrease from baseline in pain intensity
were 50% with amitriptyline, 42.9% with gabapentin, and
35.7% diphenhydramine. Among participants in the high
CESD-SF group, the percentages were 62.5, 12.5, and 25,
respectively.

Figure 7 shows the CESD-SF scores across time. There was
no significant difference among the 3 medications at any given
time point and no significant change in CESD-SF scores across
time for any medication.
Dropout Rate and Its Effect on Pain Intensity Ratings
Figure 8 displays the percentage of the 38 participants who
dropped out across time during each medication phase. There
was no significant difference in dropout rate among the medications. Four persons withdrew or crossed over early due to
medical problems not thought to be study related: urinary tract
infection, autonomic dysreflexia, onset of diabetes, and pneumonia (see fig 1). Two people quit for unknown reasons before
completing their first medication. One person was withdrawn
because he twice claimed that he had lost his breakthrough
medication and a study physician considered this to be excessive. That person then obtained a nonstudy pain medication
from his primary care physician, which was a protocol violation.
Because some participants attempted 1 or 2 medication
phases but not all 3, and/or withdrew early from 1 or more of
the phases, mean VAS scores for all participants with data for
any medication at any measurement point (ie, 2, 4, and 8wk)
were calculated using all available data; the scores are shown
in figures 9, 10, and 11. There was almost no difference
between the pain intensity ratings for those who completed at
least 8 weeks of all 3 phases of the study (completers, n22)
and the total number (from 25 to 29 participants) who had data
for a particular medication at a particular time point. This
suggests a minimal effect of dropouts on the findings regarding
pain intensity.
Order and Dose of Medication
Figure 12 shows the VAS mean scores of the 22 completers
for average pain during week 8 by the 6 random assignment
groups. Amitriptyline had the lowest mean ratings in 5 of the 6
groups. A repeated-measures ANOVA with group assignment
entered as a covariate revealed a significant main effect of
medication (F3.41, P.045), no effect of group assignment
(F.21, P.956), and no interaction effect (F.42, P.929).
At any given measurement point (2, 4, or 8wk), the majority
of participants (85%–97% [from 25 to 30]) who were receiving
a given medication at a given time point were able to tolerate
the maximum dose of whichever medication they were receiving. It should be noted, however, that participants who withdrew from a particular phase of the study before a given time

point because of intolerable side effects were not included in
the analyses for that particular medication for that or for later
time points. For the 22 completers, there was no significant
difference in the percentage of the maximum dose received
among the 3 medications. For example, at week 8, on average,
they received 94% of the maximum dose of amitriptyline, 91%
of the maximum dose of gabapentin, and 95% of the maximum
dose of diphenhydramine.
Breakthrough Medication
Figure 13 shows the number of tablets of breakthrough
medication taken during week 8 for each medication within the
2 CESD-SF groups. For all 3 medications, regardless of the
CESD-SF group, at least 50% of the participants who completed the study received no breakthrough medication during
week 8. The majority of the other participants received no more
than an average of 2 tablets a day (ie, 14/wk). Nonparametric
Friedman tests revealed no significant difference in ranks for the
low CESD-SF group (amitriptyline, 1.73; gabapentin, 2.23; diphenhydramine, 2.04; 2 test2.69; P.261), the high CESD-SF
group (amitriptyline, 2.13; gabapentin, 1.88; diphenhydramine, 2;
2 test.38, P.827), or the 2 groups combined (amitriptyline,
1.88; gabapentin, 2.1; diphenhydramine, 2.02; 2 test.79,
P.673).
Side Effects
The side effects reported by the participants throughout each
medication phase are listed in table 4 for the completers and
table 5 for the noncompleters. The side effects checklist was
completed 210 times by the completers during amitriptyline
therapy, 201 times during gabapentin therapy, and 205 times
during diphenhydramine therapy. We divided the number of
times a given side effect was reported during therapy with a
certain medication by the number of reports for that medication. For example, dry mouth was reported 134 times out of the
210 reports, or 62.5% of the time during amitriptyline therapy.
Dry mouth was by far the most frequent complaint, with 21 of
22 completers reporting having had it at least once. Among the
completers during amitriptyline therapy, 5 side effects— dry
mouth, constipation, difficulty emptying the bowel, nausea, and
difficulty emptying the bladder—were significantly more frequently reported than during therapy with the other 2 medications. Not surprisingly, increased spasticity was reported significantly less often during gabapentin therapy than with the
other 2 medications. Gabapentin reduces spasticity in persons

with SCI.52,53 Spasticity was not listed on the side effects
checklist but was mentioned frequently when the participants
were asked about other side effects. For the noncompleters, dry
mouth, drowsiness, and fatigue were more frequently reported
during amitriptyline therapy.
It is important to identify possible adverse side effects that
were so intolerable that in spite of dose reductions, participants
withdrew or crossed over early to the next medication. This
happened 4 times during the amitriptyline phase. Complaints
included (1) light-headedness, drowsiness, pain in the lower
abdomen, flushing, rapid heart beat, and chills (week 1); (2)
allodynia and pins and needles feeling in extremities (week 4);
(3) suicide ideation (week 1); and (4) drowsiness, dizziness,
and falling out of a wheelchair (week 1). Withdrawal because
of possible side effects occurred 5 times during the gabapentin
phase: (1) shortness of breath (week 1); (2) dizziness, fatigue,
and nausea (week 4); (3) increased spasticity and pain (week
6); (4) fatigue, drowsiness, constipation, and dry mouth (week
3); and (5) severe itching (week 1). Possible side effects caused
an early crossover twice during the diphenhydramine phase: (1)
palpitations (first dose) and (2) fatigue, dizziness, and drowsiness (week 7).
Cost of Medication
At the MEDVAMC as of January 25, 2007, the monthly
(30d) cost of taking 50mg of amitriptyline, 3 times a day was
$1.76 ($.020/tablet) and for taking 1200mg of gabapentin
(400mg tablets, $.117/tablet, or $.351/dose) 3 times a day it
was $31.59. Costs in the private sector vary, but are likely to be
much higher. For the group with less depressive symptomatology, which had a 31.5% change in average pain intensity while
receiving amitriptyline, the efficacy factor (percentage change/
cost for a month) was 17.90. This means that for every dollar
spent, there was a decrease in pain of nearly 18%. For gabapentin in the low CESD-SF group, the efficacy factor was .44.
The efficacy factors for the high CESD-SF group were 23.07
for amitriptyline and .36 for gabapentin.

DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this is the first head-to-head, randomized,
controlled, double blind, triple crossover comparison of the
effectiveness of amitriptyline and gabapentin in the treatment
of neuropathic pain at or below the level of injury in persons
with SCI. Contrary to previous findings reported in the literature, we found amitriptyline to be effective in relieving pain. In
this study, amitriptyline was even more effective than gabapentin, which other studies40,41 have shown to be effective. Our
results could not be attributed to the effects of dropout rates,
the order in which the medications were taken, the dosage of
the medications, amount of medication taken for breakthrough
pain, or the number of side effects. The effectiveness of amitriptyline was greatest in participants who had many depressive
symptoms at baseline; they had more than a 3-point decrease
on a scale of 0 to 10. Amitriptyline was the most effective
medication even among those with fewer depressive symptoms
at baseline; they had an average decrease in pain intensity of
more than 1.5 points, but the difference between the medications was not statistically significant. Most participants experienced a clinically meaningful decrease (ie, 30% of baseline) in pain when taking amitriptyline. Not only was it more
effective than gabapentin, the monthly cost for amitriptyline is
far less than it is for gabapentin.
There has been considerable research into the effects of
pharmacologic agents on chronic pain after SCI. Studies that
focused on amitriptyline and gabapentin are briefly reviewed
here.

1556 COMPARING AMITRIPTYLINE AND GABAPENTIN, Rintala
Arch Phys Med Rehabil Vol 88, December 2007
Amitriptyline
Survey studies. Survey studies in which the respondents
evaluated the effectiveness of amitriptyline to reduce pain in
general found amitriptyline to be relatively ineffective. Warms
et al26 reported survey responses from 2 separate samples. On
average, the helpfulness of amitriptyline was rated as 2.08 and
2.06 on a scale of 1 (not at all helpful) to 5 (extremely helpful).
Widerström-Noga and Turk27 reported the results of a postal
survey in which three fourths of those who used unspecified
antidepressants indicated that there was no effect on pain, or
that their pain worsened. Cardenas and Jensen28 reported that
the average rating for amitriptyline was 2.9 on a scale of 0 (no
relief) to 10 (complete relief). We29 have reported that the
success of amitriptyline in relieving pain in veterans with SCI
was rated as 3.22 on a scale of 0 (no relief) to 5 (total relief).
Although the results varied to some extent among the survey
studies, in all of them amitriptyline was not perceived as being
very effective, on average, for pain relief in the SCI population.
Randomized controlled trial. Cardenas et al30 conducted
the first randomized controlled trial of the effectiveness of
amitriptyline in relieving pain in persons with SCI. They used
a parallel group design with 44 participants randomly assigned
to receive amitriptyline (maximum of 125mg once a day), and
40 assigned to receive an active control, benztropine mesylate
(Cogentin) (0.5mg once a day). Benztropine mesylate was
selected because it causes side effects similar to those caused
by amitriptyline. Randomization was stratified according to
depressive symptomatology (20-item CES-D49 score of 15 vs
16) to control for baseline depressive symptomatology. The
participants had a variety of pain types, including SCI pain
(pain below the level of injury), transition zone pain (pain at
the level of injury), radicular pain, visceral pain, mechanical
spine pain, and overuse pain. There was no significant difference between the groups in the primary outcome measure of a
rating of pain intensity on a numeric scale of 0 (no pain) to 10
(pain as bad as could be) during week 6 of the trial after
controlling for baseline pain intensity ratings. Cardenas concluded that amitriptyline was not efficacious in relieving pain
or improving the quality of life of participants with SCI.
The question arises as to why our results differ from those of
the study of amitriptyline by Cardenas and colleagues. Differences between that study and our study include the fact that
they used a parallel group design rather than a crossover
design. The advantage of a crossover design is that each person
is his/her own control, which accounts for possible individual
differences. Cardenas included participants with different pain
types rather than limiting participation to people with neuropathic pain at and/or below the level of injury, as we did in this
study. They did a post hoc analysis with a subset of participants
who had at- or below-level pain, but they included only a small
number of people (15 in the amitriptyline group, 17 in the
placebo); consequently, its statistical power was reduced. The
maximum dose of amitriptyline in their study was 125mg once
a day, with the median dose taken at week 6 (their end point)
being 50mg per day. This suggests that some of their participants were unable to tolerate the maximum dose when taken
once a day. Others may not have reached the maximum dose,
however, because of pain relief at a lower dose. In our study,
the maximum and median doses at week 8 (our end point) were
150mg a day taken as 50mg, 3 times a day. Perhaps receiving
several smaller doses of amitriptyline throughout the day results in increased effectiveness and/or a reduction in unwanted
side effects, thus permitting a larger total dose a day. Another
difference was that the 2 studies used different active control
medications. Cardenas used benztropine mesylate, a drug often
used to treat symptoms of Parkinson’s disease, and we used
diphenhydramine, which is an antihistamine. To what extent
this could have had an impact on the results is unknown.
Gabapentin
Survey studies. In the surveys by Warms26 and Cardenas
and Jensen,28 gabapentin was rated somewhat better than amitriptyline but it was not reported to be very effective. In the
Warms’ samples, the helpfulness of gabapentin was rated as
3.21 and 2.9, respectively, on a scale of 1 (not at all helpful) to
5 (extremely helpful), compared with 2.08 and 2.06 for amitriptyline. In the survey by Cardenas,28 the efficacy of gabapentin was rated as 3.32, on average on a scale of 0 (no relief)
to 10 (complete relief), compared with 2.9 for amitriptyline. In
the survey by Widerström-Noga and Turk,27 one third of those
who used anticonvulsants reported there was no effect, compared with three fourths for those who used antidepressants. In
our survey,29 the effectiveness of gabapentin (2.89/5) was rated
lower than amitriptyline (3.22).
Retrospective studies. In a retrospective chart review, To
et al36 found that 58% of people with SCI who received
gabapentin for neuropathic pain (maximum dose, 4800mg/d)
had some improvement. The mean pain intensity score decreased by nearly 5 points from baseline to the 6-month follow-up on a 10cm VAS. Putzke et al37 retrospectively contacted persons with traumatic SCI who had been in a trial of
gabapentin as an analgesic. At 6 months, 22% had discontinued
use because of unacceptable side effects. Fifty-two percent had
experienced at least a 2-point decrease in pain intensity, on a
scale of 0 to 10. Three years later, 91% of those contacted still
experienced a benefit from the gabapentin; however, their pain
intensity scores had risen. Doses of gabapentin ranged from
300mg to 3600mg a day at the follow-up contacts.
Open-label, uncontrolled studies. Attal et al38 conducted a
pilot study to assess the effects of gabapentin on peripheral and
central neuropathic pain syndromes. The maximum dose of
gabapentin was 2400mg a day. Gabapentin significantly reduced spontaneous pain, especially paroxysmal pain, by the
end of week 6. There was no difference in the effects of
gabapentin between participants who had central pain and
those who had peripheral pain. Ahn et al39 evaluated the effect
of gabapentin on intractable neuropathic pain in persons with
SCI, with the maximum dose at 1800mg a day. They had
significant reductions in pain and sleep interference from baseline to the end of 8 weeks. The majority had at least a 2-point
decrease in pain intensity, on a scale of 0 to 10. The effects of
gabapentin were evident by week 2, and by week 4, pain and
sleep interference reached a plateau.
Randomized controlled trials. Tai et al40 conducted a prospective, randomized, double blind, crossover trial of the effects of
gabapentin on neuropathic pain in participants with SCI. Seven
(50%) of the 14 persons enrolled completed the study. Participants
were assigned to receive either gabapentin (maximum dose,
1800mg/d) or a placebo for 4 weeks, and then to receive the
alternate medication for 4 weeks after a 2-week washout period.
Effects were assessed with the Neuropathic Pain Scale (NPS),
which evaluates 10 aspects of pain.54 The rating for “unpleasant
feeling” was significantly lower at the end of week 4 during the
gabapentin phase than during the placebo phase and there was
a tendency for lower “pain intensity” and “burning sensation”
during the gabapentin phase. Levendoglu et al41 also conducted
a prospective, randomized, double-blind, crossover study to
determine the efficacy of gabapentin to treat chronic neuropathic pain in 20 people with paraplegia. Participants were
randomly assigned to which medication they would receive for
the first 8 weeks; after a 2-week washout period they received
COMPARING AMITRIPTYLINE AND GABAPENTIN, Rintala 1557
Arch Phys Med Rehabil Vol 88, December 2007
the alternate medication for 8 weeks. The maximum dose of
gabapentin was 3600mg a day. The NPS was used to assess
effectiveness. Gabapentin provided significantly more relief
than placebo for “pain intensity,” “sharp,” “hot,” “unpleasantness,” “deep pain,” and “surface pain.” Percentage of pain
relief ranged from 53% to 62% during the gabapentin phase
and 8% to 13% during the placebo phase.
Gabapentin is being increasingly prescribed for pain in SCI
because the results of the aforementioned open-label and RCTs
have ostensibly demonstrated an analgesic effect. Why, then, did
we find gabapentin to be no more effective than diphenhydramine
and less effective than amitriptyline? Although the open-label,
nonrandomized studies38,39 of gabapentin for chronic pain after
SCI have demonstrated analgesic efficacy, the impact of these
results is weakened by their flawed (open-label) study design.
With regard to the 2 RCTs of gabapentin, it is more difficult to
pinpoint relevant possible reasons for the differences in our findings. One possibility is that neither Tai40 nor Levendoglu41 and
colleagues used an active control, but used an inert placebo.
Because of the common side effects of gabapentin, it may have
made it relatively easy for their participants to determine whether
they were on gabapentin or placebo at a given point in time.
Furthermore, the numbers of participants in both of those studies,
as well as this study, are not large, ranging from 7 completers in
the Tai study,40 to 20 in the Levendoglu study,41 to 22 in this
study. None of these small groups may be representative of the
overall SCI population with neuropathic pain.
Notably, none of the other studies except Cardenas et al30
examined the specific effects of depressive symptomatology in
modulating the response to the study medication. Cardenas did not
find that pretreatment CES-D scores were related to their outcome
variables. The added effectiveness of amitriptyline we found for
persons with depressive symptomatology is not surprising given
that it is an antidepressant. It is well known that depression and
pain often go hand in hand.19,20 In previous research,7 we found
that persons with SCI and chronic pain had significantly higher
average scores (12 vs 7) on the 20-item CES-D than those without
chronic pain. In a study of veterans with SCI,18 we found that 44%
of the participants had scores that fell above the cutoff for depressive symptomatology on the CESD-SF. Furthermore, depressive
symptomatology correlated significantly with average pain intensity (r.33), worst pain intensity (r.24), hours per day with pain
(r.18), and days with pain in the past month (r.18). It is
puzzling why, in this study, there was a difference in effect of the
amitriptyline based on baseline CESD-SF scores, yet there was no
significant change in CESD-SF scores across time in either the
high or low CESD-SF groups. Perhaps the dose of amitriptyline
(150mg/d), which is below the usual dose given specifically for
depression, was not sufficient to substantially reduce depressive
symptomatology. The small sample size also may have had an
impact on this finding.
Study Limitations
This study has several limitations. The number of participants (N38) was much smaller than the 54 people we planned
for, and only 22 completed all 3 phases of the study, compared
with the 42 we estimated we would need. Despite this limitation, however, we did find a significant difference between the
use of amitriptyline and diphenhydramine in the high
CESD-SF group. In a larger study, the difference in effect on
pain between gabapentin and diphenhydramine may be statistically significant. The small number of completers precluded
us from conducting the planned ANOVA while controlling for
numerous factors such as sequence of medications, dose of
medication, and amount of medication taken for breakthrough
pain. These factors had to be examined individually and, fortunately, did not appear to influence the main outcome measures of pain intensity. The baseline period of 1 week may have
been too short to adequately establish reliable baseline pain
levels. People may enter a study at a time when their pain is at
its worst. Thus, regression toward the mean could occur during
the intervention stage.
Another limitation of the study is that all measures were
based on self-reports. Some more objective measure of pain
relief would have been preferable, as would have been the use
of additional standardized pain measures such as the NPS54 and
Brief Pain Inventory.55 It would have been better to administer
the VAS at week 6 when the study began. A 4-week gap
between measurement points was too long and may have
contributed to the dropout rate. Finally, it was not possible to
schedule data collection contacts at the same time of day
throughout a person’s participation, thus, we did not account
for diurnal fluctuations of pain. These limitations may have
affected the validity of the findings. A larger study in the future
may yield different results.
CONCLUSIONS
Based on our results from this study, amitriptyline is efficacious
and relatively economic in relieving neuropathic pain at and/or
below the level of injury in participants with SCI who have
considerable depressive symptomatology. Their pain, however,
was not completely eliminated, even in those participants for
whom amitriptyline was effective. In combination with the results
of the survey data regarding amitriptyline reviewed above, it is
clear that more effective treatments are needed. It is also important
to remember that amitriptyline has considerable side effects, some
of which can be serious, particularly in the SCI population—as
reflected by this study’s exclusion criteria. Amitriptyline exhibits
strong anticholinergic activity, cardiovascular effects including
orthostatic hypotension, changes in heart rhythm and conduction,
and a lowering of the seizure threshold. It should not be given to
persons receiving MAO inhibitors. Furthermore, close monitoring
is essential, particularly when treatment is started and when the
dosage is increased. It is possible that combinations of treatments,
both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic, may be more effective than any 1 treatment alone. Furthermore, as our understanding
of the mechanisms of neuropathic pain in the SCI population
increases, new treatments may be developed; they will need to be
carefully evaluated. Finally, when treating persons with SCI for
pain, it is critical that the standard of care include assessment and
treatment of depressive symptomatology as well as of the pain.
