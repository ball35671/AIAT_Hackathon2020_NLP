ABSTRACT
Purpose
To determine the analgesic effect of the addition of gabapentin to opioids in the management of
neuropathic cancer pain.
Patients and Methods
One hundred twenty-one consecutive patients with neuropathic pain due to cancer, partially controlled
with systemic opioids, participated in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
parallel-design, 10-day trial from August 1999 to May 2002. Gabapentin was titrated from 600 mg/d to
1,800 mg/d in addition to stable opioid dose. Extra opioid doses were available as needed. Zero to 10
numerical scale was used to rate average daily pain. The average pain score over the whole follow-up
period was used as main outcome measure. Secondary outcome measures were: intensity of burning
pain, shooting/lancinating pain, dysesthesias (also scored on 0 to 10 numerical scale), number of daily
episodes of lancinating pain, presence of allodynia, and daily extra doses of opiod analgesics.
Results
Overall, 79 patients received gabapentin and 58 (73%) completed the study; 41 patients received
placebo and 31 (76%) completed the study. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) on the intent-to-treat
population showed a significant difference of average pain intensity between gabapentin (pain score,
4.6) and placebo group (pain score, 5.4; P  .0250). Among secondary outcome measures, dysesthesia
score showed a statistically significant difference (P  .0077; ANCOVA on modified intent-to-treat
population  115 patients with at least 3 days of pain assessments). Reasons for withdrawing
patients from the trial were adverse events in six patients (7.6%) receiving gabapentin and in three
patients receiving placebo (7.3%).
Conclusion
Gabapentin is effective in improving analgesia in patients with neuropathic cancer pain already treated
with opioids.

INTRODUCTION
Neuropathic pain is frequently diagnosed as
a complication of cancer pain.1 While opioids are the mainstay of cancer pain management, their efficacy in neuropathic pain
seems to be less then optimal,2,3 and adjuvant drugs, mainly anticonvulsants and antidepressants, are often combined with
opioids in the analgesic regimen of patients
with neuropathic cancer pain.4 This approach is suggested by well-established
guidelines,5 but the analgesic benefit of this
practice is poorly documented.6,7 Among
new-generation anticonvulsants, gabapentin has been used in anecdotal experiences as
adjuvant treatment for cancer pain with a
neuropathic component, in combination
with opioid analgesics.8,9
Gabapentin is an anticonvulsant structurally related to gamma aminobutyric acid,
which has analgesic effects in several experimental10,11 and clinical models of nonmalignant chronic neuropathic pain.12-17

These effects seem to be as a result of a specific antihyperalgesic
activity. Experimental and clinical data also suggest that gabapentin can be used to enhance morphine analgesia.18-20
The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and
safety of the addition of gabapentin to opioids in the
treatment of patients with neuropathic pain due to neoplasm that was not completely controlled by systemic
opioid administration.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Patients from 11 palliative care and oncology units (eight Italian
and three Spanish) participated in this trial from August 1999 to
May 2002. The protocol was approved by the ethics committees of
each participating center. The study consisted of a 10-day screening and treatment phase with a double-blind, placebo-controlled,
randomized parallel-group design.
Patients’ Characteristics
Patients with cancer pain were enrolled if they had an active
cancer lesion causing pain by infiltration or compression of nervous structures, and at least one of the following symptoms or
signs referred to the pain area: burning pain, shooting/lancinating
pain episodes, dysesthesias, or allodynia. Imaging studies (computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound, or
others as judged appropriate by the investigator) documenting a
neoplastic lesion compatible with the neurological pain syndrome
were required for all patients.
Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
Inclusion criteria were: age  18 years; pain intensity  5 on
a numerical rating scale from 0 to 10, in the 24-hour period
preceding the screening visit, referred to the neuropathic pain
syndrome as defined above; regularly scheduled systemic opioid
therapy without sufficient analgesia with significant opioidrelated side effects; stable dose of opiod medication for at least 24
hours; life expectancy  30 days; and Karnofsky performance
status (KPS)  40. Exclusion criteria were: plasma creatinine
 1.5 mg/mL in association with creatinine clearance  60 mL/
min; previous or current gabapentin use; chemotherapy from 3
days before screening throughout the study; and radiotherapy to
the pain-producing lesion from 15 days before screening throughout the study. Hormone therapy could be started before the study,
but the dose could not be changed afterwards.
Study Design
Patients were randomly assigned to placebo or gabapentin
with a 1:2 ratio. A nonstratified, block-of-three randomization list
was used. Study medications were provided as identical capsules
containing 300 mg of gabapentin or placebo in numbered containers and allocated in random sequence by the pharmacy department of the sponsor’s laboratories. All study participants were
blinded to allocation sequence.
During the study, the patients were seen on two scheduled
appointments: a screening and randomization visit (visit 1) and
after 10 days, or at any time during the double-blind treatment
phase if the patient had to discontinue study treatment (visit 2).
Eligible patients gave their written informed consent and
were given a physical examination. The treatment phase started on
the day of the screening visit; therefore, the 10-day treatment
phase overlapped with the screening on day 1.
At visit 2, the patients underwent another physical examination and daily pain diaries were collected.
Pain Assessment at Baseline
Average pain intensity during the 24 hours preceding the
screening visit was assessed on a 0 to 10 numerical scale (0 to 10
NRS) with 0 corresponding to “no pain” and 10 to “the worst
possible pain”.
21,22 In case of multiple pain sites, it was required
that the neuropathic pain was the worse problem, and initial and
subsequent assessments specifically addressed this pain. Shooting/
lancinating pain and/or burning pain and/or dysesthesia intensities were also assessed on a 0 to 10 NRS.
Dysesthesias were described in the study chart with four
different types of sensations (pins/needles, cold, numbness, tension/constriction)23 and the patient had to choose which one of
these symptoms better described his or her sensation.
Allodynia (pain following nonpainful stimulation) was assessed at visit 1 and 2 by gently stroking the cutaneous area to
which pain was referred with a cotton swab, and then recording
the pain as present or absent.
A cancer pain syndrome checklist1was used by the investigators to complete the description of the patient’s pain.
Pain Intensity Follow-Up and Pain Diary
At visit 1, patients were instructed on how to complete a daily
pain diary which included (on each page) four different 0 to 10
NRSs assessing previous 24-hour average intensity of global pain,
shooting/lancinating pain, burning pain, and dysesthesias. The
patient was also required to record in the diary the number of
lancinating pain episodes experienced during the previous 24
hours, and the use of rescue analgesic doses. The pain diary had to
be filled in daily by the patient. The investigator called the patient
every morning to check compliance with pain diary completion,
pain intensity, and adverse events.
Pain and Antineoplastic Therapies and Causes of
Treatment Interruption
Previous analgesic (opioids and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs) and adjuvant therapies (ie, steroids, antidepressants, anticonvulsants, anxiolitics, or muscle relaxants) were
unchanged throughout the study. One extra dose of opioid medication was available as needed (p.r.n.) and it was prescribed at
visit 1 based on the previous opioid regimen. Patients needing
more than one daily p.r.n. opioid dose during the treatment phase
were withdrawn from study. Antineoplastic therapies were prohibited; in the case that chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or surgery
was needed during the treatment phase for disease control, the
patient was withdrawn.
Study medication was administered orally starting with two
capsules per day (300 mg gabapentin every 12 hours or placebo). If
the 24-hour global pain score was  3, and if the patient had no
significant side effects, the dose could be increased to four capsules
per day (300 mg  300 mg  600 mg gabapentin or placebo), and
subsequently to six capsules per day (600 mg gabapentin every 8
hours or placebo). The dose could be increased on any study day.
Efficacy and Safety Outcomes
The aim of the study was to compare the two groups for
average response to treatment over the whole follow-up period;
therefore, the primary efficacy variable was defined as the average
follow-up pain score. Secondary efficacy parameters were the average of the subjective rating scale scores for lancinating/shooting
pain, burning pain, dysesthesias, the number of daily lancinating

pain episodes, presence/absence of allodynia, and the use of p.r.n
doses of analgesics.
Drug safety was assessed by evaluation of the type, frequency,
and intensity of any reported adverse event,24 and by reporting
changes on physical examination.
Statistical Methods
A sample size of 80 and 40 patients, respectively, for gabapentin and placebo was determined on the basis of the primary
efficacy variable analysis.25 This sample size gives the trial a power
of 90%, setting a two-tailed  at 0.05, to detect a minimum
difference between the two groups of 1 on a 0 to 10 NRS,
assuming a common within-group standard deviation (SD) of
3.0. The computation also assumes that the correlation between
repeated measurements is 0.65, which is an appropriate choice
in many situations.25
Analysis of the primary and secondary efficacy longitudinal
measures was performed by an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA)
summary statistic approach as suggested by Frison and Pocock.25
The method consists in averaging the post-treatment values on
each patient and then using this as a dependent variable in an
ANCOVA model with baseline pain data as covariate, as well as
fixed terms of treatment and country (Spain-Italy).
The main analysis was performed on the intent-to-treat
(ITT) population (all patients who received at least one study
medication),26 imputing missing longitudinal data with the average of observed data. In order to evaluate the robustness of the
results obtained, a sensitivity analysis was conducted using different criteria for missing data imputation—last observation carried
forward and worst value observed. All the remaining analyses were
conducted on a modified ITT set of data, defined as all patients
who received at least one study medication and compiled at least 3
days of the diary. The choice was made to have the minimum
treatment duration be 3 days, allowing for an eventual maximum
gabapentin dose of 1,800 mg per day.
In order to complete the description of the response to treatment, (1) pain control was defined as a pain reduction of at least
33% with respect to baseline pain (33% pain intensity difference 
33% PID);27,28 (2) then two different summary measures were
calculated for each patient: the percentage of the follow-up period
during which PID was at least 33% controlled (according to this
analysis, a patient reporting 33% PID for 7 days over 10 days of
follow-up would be classified to have 70% pain response); and the
time needed to reach PID  33% for the first time, which was
analyzed by Kaplan-Meier survival curves.
To show how pain scores changed over time, the percentage of patients achieving 33% PID was plotted by day and
treatment, along with 95% CIs. Safety data analysis was performed on the ITT population, and frequency distributions
were used to present the results.
RESULTS
Study Profile
Figure 1 reports the trial implementation profile according to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials
statement.26 Of 691 cancer patients with neuropathic pain
screened, 121 were randomly assigned (80 patients to gabapentin and 41 patients to placebo), with a ratio of about 1:6
for randomized versus screened patients. One patient in the
gabapentin group withdrew his consent before taking the
first dose of medication and was not considered further in
the analysis.
Fifty-eight gabapentin-treated patients (73%) and 31
patients (76%) in the placebo-treated group completed the
10-day protocol. Reasons for interrupting treatment are
reported in Figure 1. Finally, 120 patients (79 in gabapentin
group and 41 in the placebo group) were included in the
ITT analysis. The modified ITT analysis of efficacy was
performed on 115 patients because five patients (two in the
placebo group and three in the gabapentin group) had less
than 3 days of follow-up.
Eleven patients in the gabapentin group did not conclude the study because of intervening prohibited therapies.
Four because of recourse to chemotherapy (two patients) or
surgery (two patients) for disease control and all of them
had good pain control at the moment of dropping out.
Seven patients (8.8%) were withdrawn because of increased
daily opioid dose for insufficient pain relief. In two of these
last patients, disease progression with increasing new pain
could be definitely demonstrated (vertebral collapse in one
patient and deep venous thrombosis in the second). In the
placebo group, six patients (14.6%) dropped out because
they needed to increase their opiod consumption as a result
of worsening pain.
Patient Demographics and Baseline
Clinical Characteristics
Demographic characteristics of patients and baseline
pain characteristics are shown in Table 1. The placebo and
gabapentin groups were comparable as to age, sex, KPS,
stabilized opioid daily dose (expressed in oral morphine
daily equivalent milligrams), while baseline global pain intensity was higher in the placebo group.
The majority of patients had analgesic drug regimens
including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories and steroids.
The presence of shooting pain, burning pain, and dysesthesias was similar for the two treatment groups, while
allodynia and the number of daily shooting pain episodes
were more frequent among patients in the placebo group
(Table 1). Ninety-two patients (79.9%) reported more than
one symptom.
The most frequent neuropathic pain syndrome (Table
2) was malignant brachial and lumbosacral plexopathy
(49.1% of patients). Five patients had more than one neuropathic pain syndrome.
Two patients in the gabapentin group and one in the
placebo group underwent radiotherapy within 2 months before entering the study, while chemotherapy was administered
to three patients in the gabapentin group and to one patient in
the placebo group in the month preceding the study.
Primary Efficacy Outcome
The mean (model adjusted) follow-up global pain score
(ITT population  120 patients) was lower for patients taking

gabapentin (pain score  4.6) than for patients receiving placebo (pain score  5.4; ANCOVA, P  .0250; Table 3). Sensitivity analysis showed that the result obtained was robust when
different criteria were used for missing data imputation
(P  .0527 using last observation carried forward imputation,
and P  .0304 with worst value imputed). Also the analysis on
the modified ITT set confirmed this result (P  .0257).
Globally, there were 94 missing data (11.8% of potential data)
in the gabapentin group (mean data missing per patient 
standard deviation (SD)  1.18  2.3) and 59 missing data
(14% of potential data) in the placebo group (mean  SD 
1.43  2.75). Data were missing for patients interrupting the
study, and for only two patients who failed to complete one
entry in their pain diary.
Secondary Efficacy Outcomes
These analyses were performed on the modified ITT
population. Among the associated neuropathic symptoms,
dysesthesias were less severe in the gabapentin group
(mean  4.3) than in the placebo group (mean  5.2;
ANCOVA, P  .0077), while the other symptoms did not
show significant differences. Also, the assessment of allodynia comparing patients at visit 1 and visit 2 did not show
differences between the two groups.
The use of additional analgesic doses was higher in the
placebo group (64.7% of patients) than in the gabapentin
treated group (47.1% of patients), though the difference did
not reach statistical significance (P  .0999, Wilcoxon test),
and patients receiving placebo also used p.r.n opioid doses
more frequently (35.8% v 21.6% of follow-up days;
P  .0559, Wilcoxon test).
Other Pain Response Analyses
The average percentage of follow-up days per patient
with PID  33% was 51.6% (SD  36.5%) in the gabapentin group and 37.8% (SD  38.8%) in the placebo group
(Kruskall Wallis test, P  .039). Only 15% of patients in

gabapentin group versus 40% of placebo-treated patients
never reached 33% PID.
Kaplan-Meyer curves in Figure 2 show the time needed
to reach PID  33% for the first time. A higher number of
patients reached 33% PID in the first days of treatment in
the gabapentin group than in the placebo group (P  .0048,
log-rank test).
Figure 3 shows the percentage of patients achieving at
least 33% PID, by each study day and by treatment, along
with 95% CI, and data points available for analysis at each
time interval.
Gabapentin Doses
Maximum gabapentin daily doses were 600 mg for six
patients (7.5%), 1,200 mg for 18 patients (22.7%), and
1,800 mg for 55 patients (69.6%). Mean time needed to
reach maximum dose was 4.5 days (SD  2.0) for the 1,200
mg daily dose, and 3.3 days (SD  1.7) for the 1,800 mg
daily dose. Twenty-two of the patients reaching 1,800 mg
dose still had pain intensity  5 on their last follow-up day.
Safety
Six patients in the gabapentin group and three in the
placebo group discontinued treatment due to adverse
events (Table 4). In four of the patients who discontinued gabapentin, the adverse events were probably related
to the drug.
In two patients, the events were particularly significant.
One patient (gabapentin 300 mg every 12 hours) developed
sedation and coma after three doses of study medication
and died. This patient had a KPS of 50, liver failure, and was
treated with oral morphine 600 mg/day, oral morphine

p.r.n 120 mg, alprazolam 0.25 mg every 8 hours, lormetazepam 2 mg once a day at bedtime (qhs), and midazolam 15
mg qhs. The dose of morphine had been increased exactly
24 hours before the first gabapentin dose.
Another patient with a complex pharmacologic regimen (methadone 90 mg/d, morphine p.r.n 10 mg subcutaneously, ketorolac 60 mg/d, lorazepam 2 mg qhs, fluoxetine
20 mg/d, amytriptiline 175 mg/d) and KPS of 50 had respiratory depression and sedation after taking 1,200 mg of
gabapentin on the second study day. Naloxone was administered, while methadone and study treatment were discontinued, with prompt recovery of consciousness and
respiratory rate. The same patient had already had an episode of respiratory depression before entering the study
while on methadone 120 mg/d.
Most frequent side effects, not leading to drug discontinuation, were mild to moderate somnolence and dizziness
which were more common in the gabapentin group than in
the placebo group (Table 4).
DISCUSSION
There is clinical consensus that some cancer pain syndromes, as a result of neurological lesions, are less responsive to opioid analgesia,2,3,29 and that adjuvant drugs have
an indication in these pain syndromes,4,5,30 although this
practice is based only on anecdotal reports9,31-34 and are not
confirmed by controlled clinical trials.6,7,35 The aim of this
study was therefore to demonstrate the clinical usefulness of
an adjuvant drug in improving analgesia for patients with
neuropathic cancer pain already treated with opioids.
The low rate of accrual in the protocol (Fig 1) was mainly
due to concurrent need for chemotherapy or radiotherapy
(179 patients), previous exposure to gabapentin (n  104),
and pain already controlled with opiods (n  131).36
After randomization, the main reasons for dropping
out of the study were changes in analgesic or antineoplastic
therapy (Fig 1). In some of these cases, changes of pain type
and intensity were seen. Similar changes might have also
occurred in patients who remained on the study, with clear
implications for the possibility of using longitudinal outcome measure analysis.37
Our results showed a difference in mean pain intensity
and dysesthesia scores, but this information can be considered of limited clinical value. For this reason, we used recent
data27,28 suggesting that a reduction of pain intensity of
33% or greater can be considered clinically significant, both
in cancer and in nonmalignant neuropathic pain studies. By
using this cutoff value, the average follow-up period with
PID  33% favored gabapentin (51.6%) versus placebo
(37.8%). Figures 2 and 3 also help to understand how often
33% PID was achieved by a different proportion of patients,
and how fast this pain relief target was achieved for the first
time. In Figure 3, the difference between the two groups was
evident in the first study days throughout day 5, while
results tended to overlap from the fifth day onward. This
observation can have different explanations, including pain
changes from baseline, as exemplified in some cases, missing data (slightly higher for the placebo group), or reduced
drug efficacy in time. It is also possible that in some patients,

further escalation of gabapentin dose beyond 1,800 mg/d
could be of benefit.
There are very few controlled trials on adjuvant therapies for neuropathic cancer pain. Two trials on brief lidocaine infusions could not show an effect,35,38 while one trial
on ketamine infusion showed analgesic effects.39 The only
other experience on an adjuvant oral medication, comparable with the use of gabapentin in this study, is a 2-week
cross-over trial of amitriptyline versus placebo on 16 patients, which could demonstrate an effect only on worst
pain and not on global pain.7
In general, side effects were mild in most cases, with the
exception of four patients who discontinued the drug. In
two of them, both receiving benzodiazepines at significant
doses (and a number of other drugs), and with poor general
conditions, CNS depressing effects were observed. Our conclusion is that the association of 300 mg gabapentin to the
opioid drug regimen is usually safe, but in frail patients with
high opiod doses and complex drug regimens, especially
including benzodiazepines, a more cautious titration
schedule is recommendable.
The role of gabapentin in expanding the efficacy of
opioid analgesia in combined drug regimens has a rational
basis,10,18,19,40,41 but should be supported by clinical studies
in order to document the feasibility and potential therapeutic advantages of such use. Our study could demonstrate a
limited role of gabapentin as adjuvant to opioids for neuropathic cancer pain, although significant benefit could be
seen in some patients. Certainly better study design, and
more efficacious drugs for neuropathic pain, are needed to
improve the control of advanced cancer pain.
