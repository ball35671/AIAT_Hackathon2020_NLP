Objective: Severe and persistent mental illnesses are often lifelong and characterized by
intermittent exacerbations requiring hospitalization. Providing needed care within budgetary
constraints to this largely publicly subsidized population requires technologies that reduce
costly inpatient episodes. The authors report a prospective randomized trial to test the clinical
effectiveness of a model of acute residential alternative treatment for patients with persistent
mental illness requiring hospital-level care. Method: Patients enrolled in the Montgomery
County, Md., public mental health system who experienced an illness exacerbation and were
willing to accept voluntary treatment were randomly assigned to the acute psychiatric ward
of a general hospital or a community residential alternative. There were no psychopathologybased exclusion criteria. Treatment episode symptom improvement, satisfaction, discharge
status, and 6-month pre- and postepisode acute care utilization, psychosocial functioning, and
patient satisfaction were assessed. Results: Of 185 patients, 119 (64%) were successfully
placed at their assigned treatment site. Case mix data indicated that patients treated in the
hospital (N=50) and the alternative (N=69) were comparably ill. Treatment episode symptom
reduction and patient satisfaction were comparable for the two settings. Nine (13%) of 69
patients randomly assigned to the alternative required transfer to a hospital unit; two (4%) of
50 patients randomly assigned to the hospital could not be stabilized and required transfer to
another facility. Psychosocial functioning, satisfaction, and acute care use in the 6 months
following admission were comparable for patients treated in the two settings and did not differ
significantly from functioning before the acute episode. Conclusions: Hospitalization is a frequent and high-cost consequence of severe mental illness. For patients who do not require
intensive general medical intervention and are willing to accept voluntary treatment, the alternative program model studied provides outcomes comparable to those of hospital care.

A cute residential alternatives are not halfway houses
that support patients after a hospital stay but,
rather, homes in neighborhoods that are staffed and organized to accept and treat acutely decompensated patients in lieu of voluntary admission to a psychiatric
ward of a general hospital or state psychiatric facility.
Residential alternatives have been described for more
than 25 years but have not been widely used (1, 2). Current efforts to control medical costs, however, have
moved into center stage the search for effective nonhospital-based options for psychiatric (and other) patients requiring acute care (3).
In a randomized study narrowly focused on young
adults newly diagnosed with schizophrenia and treated
with no or minimal antipsychotic medications, Mosher
et al. demonstrated that care in a homelike acute residential facility (Soteria) generated patient outcomes
comparable or superior to those of treatment in the inpatient unit of a mental health center (4–6). Although
clinical reports describe the adaptation of the Soteria
model to more typical patients with longstanding and

recurrent mental illness (6–14), a rigorous assessment
of this model has yet to be reported. Accordingly, we
conducted a randomized clinical trial to assess the clinical effectiveness of treatment in an acute residential alternative compared to general hospital psychiatric
ward care for voluntary patients with severe and persistent mental illness.
METHOD
Subjects
Adult patients under the care of the Montgomery County, Md.,
Department of Health and Human Services were eligible for participation in this study. As the sole local public mental health authority,
the Montgomery County Department of Health and Human Services
manages a comprehensive network of services that supports approximately 1,600 adults with serious and persistent mental disorders at
any given time. Annually, about 12% of these patients experience an
illness exacerbation requiring one or more hospitalizations.
Patients who met the following criteria were referred for randomization: 1) were judged by their treating clinician to be in need of
hospital-level care, 2) were judged not to require acute general medical care or detoxification, 3) had Medicaid or Medicare funding, and
4) were willing to accept voluntary placement. Voluntary patients experiencing acute psychosis, depression, suicidality, homicidality, or
concomitant substance abuse were not excluded from randomization.
Treatment Sites
McAuliffe House is a eight-bed crisis alternative located in a ranchstyle house in a residential neighborhood in Rockville, Md. The program is staffed by two bachelor’s-level counselors 24 hours per day
under the direction of a master of social work-level program director.
During the residential treatment episode, medical responsibility for
each patient’s care is maintained by the patient’s outpatient psychiatrist, who prescribes or changes psychotropic medications and orders
outpatient laboratory assessments and other medical evaluations as
indicated. Each newly admitted patient is also evaluated by a consulting psychiatrist, who, in addition to providing a written second opinion, meets with program staff weekly to assist in treatment planning,
monitor progress, and provide staff supervision. The McAuliffe program model was based on Soteria and Crossing Place and has been
described in detail (4–13). Beyond a supportive environment, supervised medication self-administration, and the availability of one-toone staff monitoring, formal treatment is not provided in the alternative. Rather, continued participation in ongoing community-based
treatment, rehabilitation, school, work, or other activities is supported to an extent allowed by patients’ symptoms. If needed, program staff provide transportation to these appointments or activities.
Emergency backup for the residential alternative is provided by a mobile treatment team if evaluation for involuntary hospitalization becomes necessary. The efficacy of the model is thought to derive from
a normalizing homelike environment that minimizes stigma, loss of
esteem, and assumption of the sick role while allowing patients to
maintain continuity with outpatient treatment providers and community supports (14–18).
The control treatment site was Montgomery General Hospital, Olney, Md., a 229-bed general hospital, accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations, that since
1971 has operated a 31-bed inpatient psychiatric treatment unit supported by a day hospital and outpatient clinic. Hospital care includes
medical assessment, individual psychotherapy, group therapy, and
pharmacologic management.
Assignment Procedures
Admission procedures, approved by the institutional review
board, were as follows: First, at the time of crisis assessment, a
Montgomery County Department of Health and Human Services
clinician and the patient agreed on the need for inpatient treatment.
Second, after determining patient eligibility, the clinician contacted
the department’s 24-hour crisis center, which randomly assigned
the patient to one or the other treatment condition according to a
computer-generated pattern. Referring clinicians were not members of the research team and thus were blind to the randomization
sequence. Third, following admission, the patient was approached
to provide written informed consent to participate in subsequent
study assessments.
Although the research team monitored adherence to the random
assignment procedure, because all admissions were voluntary, both
referring clinicians and randomized patients were free to decline admission after learning the assignment. In the intention-to-treat group,
27 (14%) of 185 randomized subjects declined admission after receiving assignment. While these patients were denied admission to the
treatment option to which they were not assigned, they were free,
with their clinicians’ assistance, to seek admission to one of the other
inpatient programs in the area. An additional 11 patients withdrew
consent for assessment interviews, and 11 either did not arrive at their
assigned placement or left within 24 hours. Seventeen patients were
not entered for administrative or other reasons (e.g., benefits were
found to be inactive after randomization, site was full). Overall, unsuccessful entry was more common among those assigned to the hospital (N=42) than those assigned to the alternative (N=24) (χ2=7.63,
df=1, p<0.01). Because this trend was noted early in the study, the
ratio of random assignments was set at 10:7 to favor hospital placement. Nonetheless, the final group included 69 alternative and 50
hospital participants.
Outcome Assessment
Clinical program effectiveness was assessed by evaluating changes
in patient symptom severity, patient satisfaction with treatment episode, and percentage of patients successfully discharged to the community. Psychosocial functioning, service utilization, and life satisfaction in the 6 months before and after the treatment episode were
evaluated as secondary measures of clinical effectiveness. Randomized patients were assessed by a member of the research team at three
points: 1) within 48 hours of admission (mean=28, SD=13), 2) within
48 hours of discharge (mean=20, SD=26), and 3) 6 months after admission (mean=222 days, SD=85).
Symptom severity was rated at each time by using the Positive and
Negative Syndrome Scale (19). Patient satisfaction with episode treatment was measured at discharge with a 10-item satisfaction survey
based in part on the Quality of Life Scale (20). Discharge was considered successful if the patient was returned to the community and unsuccessful if the treatment episode ended in transfer to another inpatient facility.
At admission, data concerning premorbid functioning and illness
onset, severity, and history, as well as psychosocial functioning and
service utilization over the prior 6 months, were collected by using
an interview schedule based on our earlier work on the prediction
of outcome in serious mental illness (21, 22). Psychosocial functioning and 6-month service utilization were again assessed at 6-
month follow-up. Psychosocial functioning during each 6-month
period was assessed in the domains of family, social, and romantic
relationships; work performance; living situation; and service
utilization. Patient satisfaction ratings in each of these areas were
obtained on a scale from 1 (extremely dissatisfied) to 7 (extremely
satisfied). Data concerning episodes of homelessness and arrests
were collected through patient interview for each 6-month period.
Axis I, axis II, and substance abuse diagnoses were established
through administration of the Structured Clinical Interview
for DSM-III-R (SCID and SCID-II [23, 24]) during the treatment
episode.
All assessments were administered by six interviewers who were
graduate students in psychology or social work and/or had at least 5
years’ experience working with patients with serious mental illness.
Interviewers underwent approximately 50 hours of training (including the rating of 22 videotaped interviews) to establish SCID and PosiFENTON, MOSHER, HERRELL, ET AL.

tive and Negative Syndrome Scale reliability. Mean reliability achieved
by interviewers across major diagnostic categories (psychotic disorders, mood disorders, substance abuse) was 0.74 (kappa). Mean reliability for Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale total psychopathology severity was 0.80 (intraclass correlation). To minimize missing
data, interviewers obtained information as needed from family members, treatment staff, and medical records. All available medical records, including state Title XIX data tapes, were reviewed to validate
patient-reported acute care days.
Statistical Analysis
To permit bias testing of missing subgroups, Montgomery County
Department of Health and Human Services medical records of all randomized subjects were independently reviewed, and 27 case mix variables were coded. Randomization was further evaluated by comparing
patients assigned to each site across an additional 15 core interview-derived demographic, diagnostic, and clinical case mix variables (table 1).
Variables were selected and grouped a priori into conceptual domains

(e.g., demographic, diagnostic, and historical variables), and Bonferroni-corrected criterion alpha levels were used to limit the chance of a
type I error from multiple comparisons (25). Patients treated in each
setting were then compared across clinical outcome measures. Betweengroup analyses were conducted by using two-tailed t tests for dimensional and chi-square analyses for categorical dependent variables.
Square-root transformations were applied to variables with nonnormal
distributions for all statistical analyses. Effect sizes are presented as phi
or Cramer’s V for chi-square analyses and Cohen’s d for t test comparisons (26). Mixed design repeated measures analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were used to test the significance of changes in symptoms and
continuous psychosocial and service utilization variables across assessments and to evaluate time-by-treatment site interactions.
RESULTS
Study Population
Between July 1992 and December 1994 a total of 185
individuals who met entry criteria were randomized; 119
(64%) successfully entered the study. To determine
whether the 66 unsuccessful admissions differed from the
119 successful admissions, the subgroups were compared
across seven demographic, six treatment history, three
diagnostic, four personal history, and seven prognostic/illness severity variables on the basis of information
coded from their outpatient charts. The subgroups did
not differ significantly on any of these 27 variables, suggesting that the study group adequately represented the
total group of patients referred for inpatient treatment.
The average age of the final treated group (N=119) was
37 years (SD=10); 62 (52%) were male, and 38 (32%)
were non-Caucasian. Most patients (N=81 [68%]) had
never married; 18% (N=21) were divorced. Ninety-five
percent of patients met DSM-III-R criteria for schizophrenia (N=33 [28%]), schizoaffective disorder (N=31
[26%]), bipolar disorder (N=25 [21%]), or other major
mood disorder (N=24 [20%]). The mean age at illness
onset for patients was 16 years (SD=9); mean age at first
hospitalization was 23 (SD=9). Study patients had an average of 13 (SD=14) lifetime hospitalizations and a cumulative lifetime average of 43 months (SD=70) of prior
psychiatric hospitalization. Core interview-derived case
mix variables rated at admission for the hospital and alternative study patients are shown in table 1. Patient groups
did not differ at the p<0.05 level on any variables studied.
Clinical Outcome
Length of stay for alternative-treated patients (mean=
18.7 days, SD=13.8) was significantly longer than that
for hospital-treated patients (mean=11.7 days, SD=8.2)
(t=3.19, df=117, p<0.002, d=0.60). Repeated measures
ANOVA that used total Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale score as the dependent variable indicated a
statistically significant time effect (F=52.94, df=2, 220,
p<0.0001) but no significant treatment site effect (F=
0.23, df=1, 110, p=0.64) or treatment site-by-time interaction (F=1.18, df=2, 220, p=0.31). Post hoc t tests
showed that psychopathology for both hospitalized patients and patients treated in the residential alternative
decreased significantly from admission (hospital mean=
89, SD=25; alternative mean=87, SD=24) to discharge
(hospital mean=69, SD=16 [t=8.53, df=48, p<0.001];
alternative mean=72, SD=27 [t=6.29, df=67, p<0.001]),
and the decrease was maintained at 6-month follow-up
(hospital mean=69, SD=18; alternative mean=73, SD=
22). No differences between hospital and the alternative were significant at p<0.05.
Mean total patient satisfaction with acute episode
care did not differ between settings (hospital mean=5.1,
SD=0.9; alternative mean=5.1, SD=0.8) (t=0.20, df=
105, p=0.84). Of 10 areas rated, patient satisfaction differed significantly between settings on only one: alternative-treated patients were significantly more satisfied
with facility-provided food (d=0.71). Effect sizes for the
differences between groups on the other nine rated areas varied from 0.01 to 0.31.
Overall, 108 (91%) of 119 patients were stabilized
during the treatment episode and returned to the community. Treatment failure rate (transfer
to another inpatient facility) was
nine (13%) of 69 in the alternative
and two (4%) of 50 in the hospital
(χ2=1.85, df=1, p=0.17). One-third
(three of nine) alternative-treated
patients requiring transfer accepted
voluntary hospitalization; the remainder required involuntary commitment. No serious adverse events
occurred among alternative-treated
patients requiring transfer to an inpatient unit, beyond police intervention needed for commitment.
Ninety-five percent of patients
(N=113 of 119) were located for follow-up interview. One patient (alternative-treated) died from suicide
between discharge and follow-up.

satisfaction over the 6 months before and after index admission. No main effects or interaction between time of
assessment and treatment site were significant at Bonferroni-corrected alpha levels. Pairwise comparisons between the two treatment sites yielded effect sizes that varied between 0 and 0.35. Acute care use, psychosocial
functioning, and satisfaction with one’s life, mental
health, and physical health services over the 6 months
after admission, therefore, were comparable for patients
treated in the hospital and the alternative.
DISCUSSION
Mental illnesses such as schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and bipolar disorder are often recurrent,
with exacerbations and remissions superimposed on
varying degrees of prolonged disability. Care for patients with these severe disorders accounts for the use
of nearly half (43%) of mental health resources, with
the largest proportion of expenditures allocated to hospital inpatient care (27). It is widely recognized that
providing needed services to this population within
budgetary constraints requires the management of
costly inpatient utilization (28, 29).
In this study, voluntary adult patients with severe and
persistent mental illness and a history of multiple prior
inpatient care episodes were prospectively assigned at
the time of illness exacerbation to an acute psychiatric
ward of a general hospital or an acute residential alternative program. Overall, 87% of patients receiving care
in the alternative were successfully treated and returned
to the community. This relatively low failure rate is
consistent with those reported in other studies of alternatives to psychiatric hospitalization (7, 12, 30–32).
Patient acceptance of the alternative acute care setting
was good, as reflected in satisfaction ratings and a
higher percentage of successful placements in the intention-to-treat group. Both episode and 6-month clinical
outcome measured in the domains of symptom improvement, psychosocial functioning, acute care service
utilization, and patient satisfaction were comparable
for the hospital- and alternative-treated cohorts.
Using comprehensive cost estimation, Sledge et al.
(33, 34) recently described a model of acute care combining day hospital and residential respite care for voluntary patients that generated outcomes comparable to
those of hospital care at a significantly lower operating
cost. The crisis care model described here differs from
that described by Sledge et al. in our use of an eightrather than four-bed facility, the use of nonmedically
trained crisis staff, and our reliance on ongoing community treatment resources rather than a day hospital
to provide medical care and structure during the crisis
episode. Charges alone are generally a poor reflection
of costs and must be interpreted cautiously (35, 36).
Rates in Maryland are set by a Health Services Cost
Review Commission through use of Health Care Financing Administration-like cost report methodology.
The Health Services Cost Review Commission fiscal
year 1993 per diem rate for the hospital was $384.00;
the alternative treatment modality per diem rate was
$123.29. Evaluation of total cost, however, is required
to assess the costs of additional community services
used by patients during a crisis episode (37–39).
It is not surprising that neither we nor Sledge et al.
found that any acute care intervention had a significant
impact on postepisode psychosocial functioning. In the
6 months following acute treatment, most patients resumed functioning at their precrisis episode level. Although extended hospitalizations were once employed
to achieve improvements in social and vocational functioning, brief acute care is specifically aimed at crisis
resolution. Thus, symptom reduction, return to the
community, and patient satisfaction are likely the most
important outcomes of acute care to evaluate. Contrariwise, outpatient and community support programs that target improved social and vocational functioning and relapse prevention as goals may be best
assessed with measures of psychosocial functioning
and rehospitalization.
The results reported here must be considered in light
of this study’s strengths and limitations. This investigation took place in a functioning mental health system in
which both acute hospital and alternative services were
in place before the study. The patient group was restricted to Medicaid and Medicare beneficiaries disabled
by clearly documented severe and persistent mental illness characterized by repeated inpatient hospitalizations. For these reasons, findings should be broadly applicable to comparable patient populations in public
mental health systems in other jurisdictions.
While the naturalistic setting of this study provides a
favorable environment to test program model effectiveness, it also results in limitations. The necessity of obtaining patient consent may introduce a selection bias
that cannot be measured. In addition to reflecting patient acceptance of this modality, the higher rate of postrandomization admissions to the alternative could reflect the alternative’s more central location and faster
admission process. Alternatively, the different admission rates may have reflected patients’ experience-based
preferences for the nonhospital acute care setting or
other area inpatient facilities outside the scope of the
study. Any biases due to self-selection, however, did not
result in significant differences between successfully
and unsuccessfully admitted patients on any of 27
demographic and clinical characteristics, and the randomization procedure produced comparable subject
groups for the two treatment sites.
The generalizability of these findings to the uninsured
or those with private third-party insurance has yet to be
demonstrated. Furthermore, results reported here are
clearly restricted to voluntarily admitted psychiatric patients not requiring detoxification or acute general
medical intervention. In fiscal year 1993, 52 (10%) of
509 admissions among patients enrolled in the Montgomery County Department of Health and Human Services catchment area were involuntary.
Medicare and Medicaid are particularly important
GENERAL HOSPITAL AND ALTERNATIVE CARE

funding sources for adults with serious mental illnesses
and have supported growth in the number of general
hospital psychiatric units over the past two decades
(40, 41). During this same period community-based interventions of demonstrated efficacy have been developed (42–47), but reliable funding streams to support
these technologies have been limited (2, 47–49). Current initiatives to limit public health expenditures involve the provision of fewer total dollars, but more local choice in allocating funds to competing services
(50). In this environment the use of new or underused
technologies that are as effective as, but potentially less
costly than, available treatments should receive priority (51, 52).
Cost cutting replaces the risk of excessive hospitalization with the risk of undertreatment or of shifting the
burden of acute care to families or the criminal justice
system. While clearly not a substitute for all psychiatric
hospital care (11, 53), wider use of acute nonhospital
residential alternatives may be crucial in maintaining a
humane treatment infrastructure for psychiatry’s most
vulnerable patients in a future that will be characterized
by shrinking resources. Our data suggest that a crisis
residential alternative can be as effective as general hospital care for a wide range of patients with serious mental illness who do not require either acute detoxification
or emergent medical evaluation and are willing to accept voluntary treatment.
