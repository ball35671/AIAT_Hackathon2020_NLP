In the past 25 years several women’s crisis houses have opened
around the UK, offering an innovative alternative to psychiatric
hospital admission which is potentially less stigmatising, coercive
and institutionalised.1 The development of women’s crisis houses
was recommended in the UK Department of Health Women’s
Implementation Guidance.2 A few descriptions and evaluations
of women’s crisis houses have been published,3–5 but these small
uncontrolled studies have substantial methodological limitations.
At present there is no clear evidence on whether women’s crisis
houses are effective or cost-effective, although a qualitative study
indicated that a women’s crisis house was highly valued and often
preferred to conventional in-patient treatment.3 We aimed to
evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of women’s
crisis houses and decided to use a patient-preference randomised
controlled trial (PP–RCT) study design for two reasons: first, this
was acceptable to staff and service users, and second, strong
patient preferences can lead to patients refusing consent to enter
a trial and undergo randomisation, which can lead to bias
and may weaken the external validity of the study results.6,7 The
PP–RCT involves a conventional randomised controlled design
but data are also collected for those who do not wish to be
randomised but consent to data collection, and their preferred
treatment is offered. This design has been little used in psychiatry
but the current available evidence suggests it may prove to be a
useful paradigm when evaluating mental health services.8 This
paper describes the results of a pilot trial which was funded to
investigate the feasibility of a future larger PP–RCT; our
conclusions on the feasibility of a future trial are discussed
elsewhere.9
Method
Our study design (PP–RCT) involved four arms. Women consenting
to participate in the study but not to randomisation entered the
patient-preference arms of the study and entered either the
women’s crisis house or the hospital, depending on their
preference for treatment location. Women who consented both
to participate in the study and to randomisation were randomised
to the women’s crisis house or the hospital by means of an
independent 24 h telephone randomisation service at the time of
recruitment. Recruitment was carried out between March and
August 2007: a companion paper gives a more detailed account
of the procedure.9 The overarching aim of this pilot study was
to test the feasibility of a future PP–RCT; we report its results
because these are the only available data on the effectiveness and
cost-effectiveness of women’s crisis houses.
The intervention – admission to a women’s crisis house – was
available at two London centres where there were also psychiatric
wards that admitted women living in the same catchment areas.
The women’s crisis houses were located in ordinary residential
streets, had a domestic atmosphere and were funded by the UK
National Health Service (NHS). Staff were available 24 h per day
and were either nurses or healthcare workers with a background
in mental health. Women’s crisis houses cannot admit women
who are detained under the Mental Health Act at admission
although they can accept them as transfers from hospital on leave.
In addition, women who are considered to be at current risk of
violent behaviour, who are misusing drugs or alcohol such that
they require detoxification under medical supervision or who

Background
Women’s crisis houses have been developed in the UK as a
less stigmatising and less institutional alternative to
traditional psychiatric wards.
Aims
To examine the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of
women’s crisis houses by first examining the feasibility of a
pilot patient-preference randomised controlled trial (PP–RCT)
design (ISRCTN20804014).
Method
We used a PP–RCT study design to investigate women
presenting in crisis needing informal admission. The four
study arms were the patient preference arms of women’s
crisis house or hospital admission, and randomised arms of
women’s crisis house or hospital admission.
Results
Forty-one women entered the randomised arms of the trial
(crisis house n = 19, wards n = 22) and 61 entered the patientpreference arms (crisis house n = 37, ward n = 24). There was
no significant difference in outcomes (symptoms, functioning,
perceived coercion, stigma, unmet needs or quality of life) or
costs for any of the groups (randomised or preference arms),
but women who obtained their preferred intervention were
more satisfied with treatment.
Conclusions
Although the sample sizes were too small to allow definite
conclusions, the results suggest that when services are able
to provide interventions preferred by patients, those patients
are more likely to be satisfied with treatment. This pilot study
provides some evidence that women’s crisis houses are as
effective as traditional psychiatric wards, and may be more
cost-effective.

are unable to engage in a safety plan and therefore need constant
supervision are not admitted to women’s crisis houses. The two
houses included in this study had the following operational
characteristics.
Croydon crisis house
The Croydon women’s crisis house opened in 1999 and is a
nursing-led service with support from a female psychiatrist. It
has 8 beds and a mean length of stay of 21 days. Referral is made
by telephone, by the woman herself or a concerned other
(including carers or health professionals). After telephone
assessment, if appropriate the woman is invited to see a staff
member at the women’s crisis house for further assessment. The
Croydon catchment area also has a women-only and a mixed
acute admission ward.
North London crisis house
The north London Drayton Park women’s crisis house opened in
December 1995. This serves the inner-London boroughs of
Camden and Islington. It has 12 beds (plus 4 beds for children)
and a mean length stay of 19 days. Both self-referrals and referrals
from professionals are accepted. After referral, women are invited
to attend the house for assessment. Other psychiatric services in
the catchment area include women-only in-patient wards and
mixed wards.
Study population
The study population consisted of all women requiring voluntary
admission who could be admitted to a psychiatric in-patient ward
or women’s crisis house. Exclusion criteria included women
detained under the Mental Health Act, or those who would not
be considered clinically appropriate for admission to a women’s
crisis house, for example because of violence or needing intensive
observation.
Procedure
There were a number of potential entry points to the study. First,
mental healthcare professionals from home treatment teams,
psychiatric liaison teams in accident and emergency departments,
and duty workers in community mental health teams were asked
to discuss the study with any women who needed to be admitted
informally to hospital or a women’s crisis house. Second, women
admitted to psychiatric wards or the women’s crisis house who
had not been approached when the admission was being arranged
were traced through local bed management teams and approached
by a research worker as soon as possible after being admitted.
Similarly, self-referrals (to the Croydon women’s crisis house)
were told about the project and asked if they would agree to
participation.
Potential participants were informed that although a place
might not be available at the allocated or preferred service they
would be transferred there as soon as a place was available and
transfer was clinically appropriate (this was similar to normal
clinical practice, in which a place might not be available
immediately but would be provided as soon as practically
possible). As we knew that these women would be acutely
distressed and would find it difficult to read a long participant
information sheet during the process of admission, we provided
them with a brief written explanation of the interventions and
randomisation, to allow the women to make a decision regarding
randomisation to treatment condition. The women were
contacted by the research worker as soon as possible after
admission and were then provided with a full participant
information sheet detailing the research procedures, including
interview measures at baseline and follow-up.
Ethical approval was obtained from the National Hospital for
Neurology and Neurosurgery and the Institute of Neurology Joint
Research Ethics Committee (06/Q0512/104) and included ethical
approval to include women without the capacity to consent to
the trial using the provisions of the UK Mental Capacity Act
2005. The trial was registered with the International Standard
Randomised Controlled Trials Registry (ISRCTN20804014).
Outcome measures
Measures at baseline included sociodemographic details, past
psychiatric history, and preferences for admission to psychiatric
hospital or women’s crisis house on a five-point Likert scale from
‘definitely crisis house’ to ‘definitely hospital ward’ – this was
dichotomised into a preference for either ward or crisis house.
The actual treatment that women received was defined as the
location of the majority of their treatment (ward or crisis house).
Data on the participants’ treatment preference and the actual
treatment they received were combined to group them into ‘Did
not receive preference’ and ‘Received preference’. We used
standardised measures of functioning (Global Assessment of
Functioning; GAF), symptoms (Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale;
BPRS), quality of life (Manchester Short Assessment of Quality
of Life; MANSA), health-related quality of life (EQ–5D), unmet
needs (Camberwell Assessment of Need; CAN), satisfaction with
services (Verona Service Satisfaction Scale; VSSS), coercion
(MacArthur Perceived Coercion Scale) and stigma (Ritsher
scale).10–17 Patients were followed up 12 weeks later and
re-interviewed with these measures.
Our primary outcomes were level of functioning and
symptoms, because these were the primary outcomes most
important to women patients and staff interviewed in a previous
qualitative study. Our secondary outcomes were quality of life,
unmet needs, satisfaction with services, coercion and stigma.
Economic measures
The economic evaluation took a broad perspective, including all
hospital and community health and social services, productivity
losses resulting from time off work due to illness, and criminal
justice resources. Economic data were collected in interview at
baseline (covering the 12-week period prior to study entry) and
at the 12-week follow-up point (covering the period from baseline
to follow-up) using the Adult Service Use Schedule (AD–SUS), an
instrument designed on the basis of previous studies of adult
mental health populations.18–20 The AD–SUS asks recipients for
the number and length of contacts with various services and
professionals relevant to the population of interest over the period
of interest. To ensure that this measure covered all services
relevant to the current population, it was adapted following
discussions with clinical team members and through pilot testing
at the baseline interviews.
All unit costs were for the financial year 2006–7, the most
recent financial year over which the trial data were collected.
The women’s crisis houses were costed directly from annual
budgets provided by the crisis house managers. All hospital
contacts were costed using the Department of Health’s national
reference costs for NHS Trusts.21 National UK unit costs, inflated
where necessary, were applied to community health and social
services, supported accommodation and criminal justice
resources.22–26 Productivity losses were calculated using the
s33

human capital approach, which involves multiplying the
individual’s salary by reported days off work due to illness.27
Statistical analysis
Data were entered into Access and then transferred to Stata
version 9 for Windows. Descriptive statistics (means and standard
deviations or percentages) were recorded for baseline characteristics
of the following groups:
(a) participants randomised to the ward and those randomised to
the crisis house;
(b) participants who refused randomisation and were allocated
treatment by their own preference to ward compared with
those choosing the crisis house;
(c) participants allocated (by randomisation or preference) to the
ward compared with those allocated to the crisis house;
(d) all participants whether randomised or not who spent more
than half of their in-patient stay on the ward compared with
those who spent most of their stay at the crisis house.
Differences were tested using t-tests and chi-squared tests for
all except the comparison of the randomised groups (for which
such tests would not be meaningful). Differences between patients
who were followed up and those who were lost to follow-up were
examined in terms of baseline characteristics. We also examined
such differences for the randomised participants (comparing those
who were followed up with those who were not) and patientpreference participants.
A simple bivariate analysis of outcome measures was
completed to compare outcomes at follow-up in all four groups
listed above. Differences were assessed using t-tests. Finally, the
independent differences in functioning (GAF), symptoms (BPRS),
quality of life (MANSA), health-related quality of life (EQ–5D),
coercion (MacArthur), stigma (Ritsher), unmet needs (CAN)
and satisfaction with services (VSSS) after treatment at the crisis
house compared with the ward were assessed using linear
regression, controlling for possible confounders. The impact of
treatment preference on outcomes was also investigated. Variables
associated with loss to follow-up were included in the regression
to account for selection bias in the sample results due to missing
values. No adjustment for multiple testing was made. Linear
regression was used to investigate whether participants who
received their preferred treatment tended to experience better
outcomes than those who did not. The analysis was repeated for
only those who were randomised to a treatment, and then for
all participants whether randomised or from the patientpreference group together.
Differences in mean costs between the four groups described
above were analysed using standard parametric t-tests with the
validity of results confirmed using bias-corrected, non-parametric
bootstrapping (repeat resampling).28 Despite the skewed nature of
cost data, this approach is recommended to enable inferences to
be made about the arithmetic mean.29 Cost-effectiveness was
explored in terms of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs),
calculated using the EQ–5D measure of health-related quality of
life.13 Uncertainty around the cost and effect estimates is
presented using cost-effectiveness acceptability curves which show
the probability that an intervention is cost-effective compared
with the alternative for a range of maximum monetary values that
a decision-maker might be willing to pay for a particular unit
change in outcome, in this case QALYs.30 All economic analyses
were adjusted for baseline costs, baseline EQ–5D score and
variables associated with loss to follow-up.
Results
Participants
A total of 103 women were recruited to the study, 42 to the
randomised arms and 61 to the patient-preference arms (Fig. 1).
One patient was not admitted after recruitment, so no baseline
questionnaire was completed for her and she was excluded from
the study because she did not receive either intervention; 102
women were therefore included in the baseline analyses. Most
women (82%, n= 84) received their allocated or chosen service,
although 9 women were not transferred immediately and had to
wait 3–27 days; the remaining 18% did not receive their allocated
or chosen service. We therefore carried out analyses by service
received for more than 50% of the admission, in addition to
examining differences for women in the randomised arms and
patient-preference arms.

Effectiveness of crisis houses
women are presented in Table 1; no significant difference was
found between women agreeing to randomisation and those
declining randomisation and entering the patient-preference arms,
other than that the latter had higher average numbers of unmet
needs (P = 0.005).
No substantial difference in baseline characteristics was found
between those randomised to the ward and those randomised
to the crisis house. There were some differences in baseline
characteristics when comparing women in the patient-preference
arms, with women who preferred the crisis house being
significantly younger and having lower baseline functioning
(GAF) than those who preferred the ward (Table 2). Women
who spent most of their treatment at the crisis house (either by
randomisation or preference) had significantly lower quality of life
(MANSA), more perceived stigma (Ritsher total score) and more
unmet needs (CAN) but less coercion (MacArthur total score) at
baseline, and were more likely to be from the borough of Croydon
than women allocated to the ward (Table 2).

Howard et al
Seventy per cent (n = 72) of women interviewed at baseline
completed follow-up interviews (68% of those who had agreed
to randomisation and 72% of those in the patient-preference
arm) (see Fig. 1). Women who were allocated to the crisis
house were statistically significantly more likely to participate
in the follow-up (P = 0.05). Among the randomised patients,
those not seen at follow-up had a higher baseline mean
MANSA score than those who completed the study (P = 0.05).
In the patient-preference arm no characteristic was
significantly different between those followed up and those not
followed up.
Outcomes
Bivariate analysis of follow-up data indicated that average quality
of life (MANSA score) was significantly higher in those
randomised to the crisis house compared with those randomised
to the ward (at an unadjusted level of 5%). No other bivariate
analysis was significant at that level (Table 3).
Regression adjustments to the differences between arms were
made to account for differences in demographic factors and
severity of illness found at baseline between the ward and crisis
house groups (see Table 2) as well as indicators of missing
follow-up (see above). The results are shown in Table 4. Although
coercion (MacArthur scale) and stigma (Ritsher scale) were
significantly different at baseline between the treatment arms they
are measures of the process of admission and were not included in
the analysis of outcome. We therefore adjusted only for baseline
GAF, MANSA, CAN, age, borough and the baseline score of each
outcome measure. There was no significant difference in outcomes
between those randomised to the crisis house compared with
those randomised to the ward; between those declining
randomisation and selecting the crisis house compared with those
selecting the ward; or between those allocated (whether by
randomisation or not) to the crisis house compared with the
ward. However, there was a trend toward significance for BPRS
score in favour of crisis houses (adjusted difference 76.47, 95%
CI –13.18 to –0.23, P= 0.06). Satisfaction with treatment was also
significantly higher in those who spent the majority of their
admission in the crisis house (randomised or patient-preference
arms) compared with those who spent the majority of time on
the ward (adjusted difference 0.30, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.59,
P = 0.04) (Table 4).
Analysis of satisfaction subscales indicated that satisfaction
with information, access and efficacy was significantly higher in
those who spent most of their time in the crisis house compared
with the ward (Table 5).
Impact of preferences
Only three participants had no preference for treatment in the
ward or the crisis house before treatment. Since so few indicated
no preference, comparisons could not be made with this group
and they were removed from the preference analysis. Fourteen
participants did not respond to the preference question and two
had no information on the length of time that they spent in
treatment on the ward or crisis house, and their data were also
excluded from the analysis.
A total of 83 participants in either the randomised or
preference group indicated a preference for either the ward or
the crisis house before treatment was given, of whom 67 (81%)
preferred the crisis house. Fifty-eight per cent (21 of 36) of those

Effectiveness of crisis houses
receiving most of their treatment on the ward had stated a
preference for the crisis house, and 1 person out of 47 (2%)
who spent most of her stay in a crisis house had stated a
preference for treatment on the ward. Almost three-quarters
(73%, n= 61) of participants received their preferred treatment.
Bivariate analysis of outcomes at follow-up indicated that
participants who obtained their preferred treatment had
significantly higher levels of overall satisfaction, whether we
examined data only for randomised patients (P = 0.03) or for all
patients (P = 0.05). There was weak evidence of lower levels of
perceived coercion for all patients who received their preferred
service (P = 0.09), but there was no other difference in outcomes
between those who did and those who did not receive their
preferred treatment. After adjustment for baseline functioning,
unmet needs, quality of life and demographic factors there was
no significant difference in outcome when examining the
randomised groups only; however, when examining data for the
whole group, receiving the preferred treatment was associated
with significantly higher levels of total satisfaction (adjusted
preference coefficient 0.37, 95% CI 0.05–0.69, P= 0.03).
Economic evaluation
Use of services is reported in online Table DS1. The sample as
a whole made the greatest use of hospital services, particularly
in-patient stays, with an average length of stay of 33 days for
the index admission and 8 days for all subsequent admissions.
There was little difference between the randomised groups in
terms of the total number of days spent in hospital (mean 36 days
for those allocated to the ward and 34 for those allocated to crisis
house). Slightly larger differences were observed between the
patient-preference arms (mean 44 days and 55 days respectively)
and total in-patient days were longer on average for the patientpreference group compared with the randomised group. A wide
range of community services were accessed by participants, but
the average number of contacts per participant was low. Use of
supported accommodation, criminal justice contacts and
productivity losses were low in all groups.
Cost results are reported in Table 6. Baseline costs tended to be
higher in the crisis house groups, and were significantly so in the
combined preference and randomised groups. All subsequent
economic analyses were adjusted for baseline costs to compensate

for this imbalance. Total follow-up costs were dominated by the
cost of in-patient stays, which constituted 85% of total costs on
average. Total follow-up costs per participant did not differ
significantly in any of the groups compared.
Although there was no statistically significant difference in
either costs or outcomes, exploration of cost-effectiveness and
the uncertainty surrounding the cost and effect estimates suggests
there may be a greater probability of women’s crisis houses being
more cost-effective than traditional psychiatric wards. In the
randomised group there is little to choose between the two arms,
with the probability of crisis houses being more cost-effective
ranging from 47% to 58% depending on willingness to pay for
gains in QALYs (online Fig. DS1). In the patient-preference group
there is almost a 90% probability of crisis houses being the more
cost-effective option, irrespective of willingness to pay (online
Fig. DS2), with similar findings for the combined preference
and randomised group and the treatment received group.
Discussion
We found no significant difference in outcomes for women
admitted to women’s crisis houses or traditional psychiatric wards
other than higher levels of satisfaction with services for those
admitted to the crisis houses, and no significant difference in
costs. This pilot study does not have the statistical power to
establish whether admissions to crisis houses are as effective or less
effective than traditional wards, but the results from this pilot can
be used to inform future hypotheses on the effectiveness and costeffectiveness of women’s crisis houses, and provide some evidence
on whether a larger sample is likely to yield differences. The
confidence intervals for BPRS score in the randomised
comparison indicate that the symptoms are not likely to be much
worse on follow-up in crisis houses compared with wards and may
be much better. This suggests that women’s crisis houses may be as
effective as traditional psychiatric in-patient ward admissions in
treating women presenting with acute psychiatric problems and
do not have an adverse impact on resource use. Exploration of
cost-effectiveness suggests there is an equal or greater probability
of women’s crisis houses being cost-effective compared with
traditional psychiatric wards. These findings counter those found
in other research into alternative services, where outcomes were
better for standard services,31 but these differences may reflect
differences in measurement – our results were derived from
patient-rated measures, including patient satisfaction, and not

Effectiveness of crisis houses
staff-rated measures of functioning. The difference in time of
follow-up might also be important in accounting for this
admission: in our study follow-up assessment took place after 3
months rather than at the time of discharge as in the Alternatives
Study.31 A previous larger study of 245 consecutive informal
admissions to women’s crisis houses and psychiatric wards found
that women’s crisis houses have a similar case-mix when
compared with admissions to catchment area wards,32 although
an investigation of six residential alternatives to hospital suggested
that people admitted to community alternatives are less likely to
be assessed as a risk to others, less likely to be behaviourally
disturbed, more likely to have referred themselves for help and
more likely to be already known to services.33 These studies
therefore suggest that crisis houses are a viable alternative to
traditional psychiatric wards for voluntary female admissions
where intensive observation is not required.
We also found that receiving preferred treatment was
associated with significantly higher levels of total satisfaction in
multivariate analyses, although no difference in adjusted outcome
was found when examining the randomised groups only. Recent
systematic reviews that have examined the relationship between
patient preferences and the outcome of interventions have
concluded that there is evidence to suggest that patient preferences
have a significant, though small, effect on outcome,7,34 and our
failure to detect other differences in outcome may reflect our small
sample size. Previous qualitative research has found that women
often prefer women’s crisis houses to conventional in-patient
treatment, as women find the former less stigmatising, less
frightening and a better environment in which to discuss their
problems,3 a finding confirmed regarding alternatives in general.35
The offer of admission to a women’s crisis house where this is
available is therefore likely to lead to greater satisfaction with
services; this may be particularly important for women who
may have adverse service experiences, such as women from Black
and minority ethnic (BME) groups.
Limitations
This was an exploratory study with small numbers of patients in
each treatment arm. Our failure to find any significant difference
in symptoms, perceived coercion and stigma, unmet needs, level
of functioning or costs for women admitted to the different
services may reflect the relatively small sample size in this pilot
study, and a larger study of outcomes of women in these two
groups is needed to investigate such outcomes further. A further
difficulty was in facilitating the receipt of the allocated or
preferred arm; not all patients received the allocated or preferred
service immediately owing to limits by the clinical demands of the
services and 18% were never transferred to their allocated or
preferred service. However, this reflects clinical practice in which
services are not always immediately available even if desirable,
and women may have to wait before they are transferred to the
more appropriate service or may find that they are ready for
discharge before transfer is possible. Where significant findings
have been reported, the problems of multiple testing should be
noted. No adjustment has been made for this and the results
should therefore be regarded as hypothesis-generating only.
Methodological considerations
Recruiting potential participants into a trial investigating services
for acutely ill patients is challenging. We tried to overcome this
using a number of strategies, including provisions under the
Mental Capacity Act, recruitment at different sites on the pathway
to admission and use of a brief participant information sheet at
the point of recruitment when patients were in crisis, which was
supplemented by a longer information sheet a few days later.
The success or otherwise of these strategies has been discussed
in more detail elsewhere,9 but we found recruitment in the
community just before admission and of women without capacity
particularly challenging. It is clear that the research community
needs to find innovative ways of carrying out evaluations of acute
services so that evidence is available on their effectiveness.
Implications
Women’s crisis houses have been criticised for being expensive and
for admitting less severely ill women than psychiatric wards, but
this study suggests that they can admit women who would
otherwise be admitted to psychiatric wards, are as effective in
improving symptoms and functioning as traditional settings,
while providing a service that women prefer and feel more
satisfied with, and moreover at no greater expense. This study,
together with other qualitative and quantitative research reported
in this supplement,36 suggests that health service providers should
consider giving women the choice of admission to women’s crisis
houses.
