mm, 1-5-3-49 mm, and -3-5 mm were 88%, 66%, and
47% respectively. In each thickness group survival was
better for women than for men. Overall, the five year
survival specific for melanoma was 64% for the older
age group, which is similar to the survival rate reported
by other groups for older patients.5 For the younger
age group overall five year survival specific for
melanoma was 78%. With Cox's proportional hazards
model the Breslow thickness, ulceration, and sex were
found to be the most important prognostic factors. Age
above 65 years compared with under 65 was also found
to be associated with a significantly poorer prognosis
(p<001), independent of Breslow thickness, ulceration, sex, and histogenetic type.
Discussion
This study confirmed our impression that the pattern
of presentation of malignant melanoma is different in
elderly patients (65 and over). Several centres, including our own, have embarked on public education
exercises aimed at all adults and encouraging early
referral of thinner melanomas, which have a better
prognosis.' To date no specific message has been aimed
at older patients, and our results would suggest that
these public education campaigns have not yet reached
the over 65 section of the Scottish population, who still
have a disturbingly high proportion of thick tumours.
A higher proportion of thick tumours in the older age
group has been reported by North American groups 8
and recently from Australia (P Hersey et al, second
international symposium on epidemiology ofmalignant
melanoma, Vancouver, 1991). Our figures strongly
suggest that public education aimed specifically at
older people is required. Education needs to be
directed not only at elderly people but also at those who
care for them. Campaigns should emphasise that in
older people the incidence of melanoma is increasing,
particularly in older men; the site most commonly
affected in both sexes is the face; and if melanoma is
identified early the outlook is still good.
Changing patterns of delivery of health care in the
United Kingdom, with greater emphasis on health
education and prevention in general practice, mean
that this could be an appropriate time to enlist the help
of family doctors in a specific programme aimed at
informing elderly people about the features of early
cutaneous melanoma. This will entail dermatologists
offering a preparatory educational programme to
general practitioners to help them differentiate true
early melanoma from benign non-melanoma pigmented
lesions. This programme should also be aimed at
district nurses and others involved in the care of elderly
patients.

Home based care and standard hospital care for patients with severe
mental illness: a randomised controlled trial
M Muijen, I Marks, J Connolly, B Audini
Abstract
Objective-To compare the efficacy of home
based care with standard hospital care in treating
serious mental illness.
Design-Randomised controlled trial.
Setting- South Southwark, London.
Patients- 189 patients aged 18-64 living in catchment area. 92 were randomised to home based care
(daily living programme) and 97 to standard hospital
care. At three months' follow up 68 home care and 60
hospital patients were evaluated.
Main outcome measures-Use of hospital beds,
psychiatric diagnosis, social functioning, patients'
and relatives' satisfaction, and activity of daily living
programme staff.
Results-Home care reduced hospital stay by 80%
(median stay six days in home care group, 53 days in
hospital group) and did not increase the number of
admissions compared with hospital care. On clinical
and social outcome there was a non-significant trend
in favour of home care, but both groups showed big
improvements. On the global adjustment scale home
care patients improved by 26-8 points and the
hospital group by 21-6 points (difference 5-2; 95%
confidence interval -1-5 to 12). Other rating scales
showed similar trends. Home care patients required
a wide range of support in areas such as housing,
finance, and work. Only three patients dropped out
from the programme.
Conclusions-Home based care may offer some
slight advantages over hospital based care for
patients with serious mental illness and their
relatives. The care is intensive, but the low drop out
rate suggests appreciation. Changes to traditional
training for mental health workers are required.
Introduction
For about 40 years in most Western countries there
has been a steady move away from treating patients
with a serious mental illness in mental hospitals to
caring for them in the community.' 2 In Britain this
trend has been bolstered by official policy.34 Initially,
little research evidence was produced to support the
advantages of community care, but in the past two
decades several controlled studies outside Britain have
compared home and inpatient care.56 The outcome
measures used in the studies varied, but any significant
differences consistently favoured the patients cared for
at home with greater improvement in clinical symptoms
and social functioning and in patients' and relatives'
satisfaction. No study found inpatient care to be better
on any variable.5 At the end of the studies the patients
cared for at home still had many symptoms and much
disability despite their relatively greater improvement.
The importance of continuity of care was illustrated by
the gradual loss of gains after withdrawal of home care,
even after 14 months of home care.78

We conducted
a randomised controlled study of
home based and standard hospital care for seriously
mentally ill patients to determine whether the results
could be replicated in Britain, which has differently
organised health services. The objective was to evaluate
the effect of intensive home care compared with
hospital care on psychopathology, social functioning,
and satisfaction. We report here the outcome at three
months, which includes the period during which
patients received the most intensive care in both
treatment groups.
Subjects and methods
From October 1987 to December 1989 we recruited
patients aged 18-64 who had
a serious mental illness
and were deemed by an independent psychiatrist to
require immediate hospital admission. Patients who
were violent, suicidal, or subject to
a section of the
Mental Health Act were all included. If patients
subject to
a section were not admitted they were taken
off the section. All patients had to be living in or
connected with south Southwark (including patients
with no fixed abode but with close family ties or
attending local statutory services). We excluded
patients with
a primary addiction (dual diagnosis was
accepted) or with
a primary diagnosis of organic brain
damage.
We included in the study all qualifying patients
being admitted for the first time to
a psychiatric
hospital and 20% of those with previous admissions to
determine the efficacy of comunity based care for long
term mentally ill patients. The other 80% were excluded
because the team would not have been able to care for
this additional number of patients. Since most patients
seen have been admitted previously the proportion of
first admissions and readmissions in each group was
expected to be about equal.
The total study sample included about 20% of all
people from south Southwark admitted to the Maudsley
Hospital. One hundred patients were intended to be
included in the home based arm because this seemed
the maximum the home care team could care for.
Owing to time constraints slightly fewer eventually
entered. The study was approved by the ethics
committee.
ENTRY AND RANDOMISATION PROCEDURES
Patients were initially seen by psychiatrists at the
emergency clinic, who judged that admission was
required for
a severe mental illness. This decision was
made independent of the study by any of the psychiatrists working in the clinic. Patients meeting the entry
criteria were randomised to either home based care or
standard inpatient care by the clinician opening the
next of
a set of numbered opaque envelopes, which had
been ordered by using random numbers.
A blocked
design was used. Separate sets had been prepared for
new and readmitted patients. Envelopes for new
patients all contained either "daily living programme"
or "hospital" care but the set for readmitted patients
instructed the exclusion of
a patient from the study in
80% of the envelopes. For the 20% of patients for
whom an "include in study" was drawn an envelope
was taken from the new admissions' set. All but three
of the study patients were entered at the Maudsley
Hospital emergency clinic; the exceptions were
randomised by consultants on domiciliary visits. Other
patients who required admission after domiciliary
visits were also entered into the study but were sent by
the consultant psychiatrist to the clinic for admission,
where randomisation took place.
All patients and their relatives were asked by the
clinic staff before randomisation whether they objected
to either hospital or community care, whichever was
available. If community care was rejected patients were
to be excluded from the study, but this never occurred.
After randomisation the research proceedings were
explained. If patients objected to being rated, this
did not affect their care and they remained in the
study.
DAILY LIVING PROGRAMME (HOME BASED CARE)
The daily living programme team initially consisted
of seven psychiatric nurses (a senior nurse, three
charge nurses, and three staff nurses),
a social worker,
a senior registrar in psychiatry, and
a whole time
equivalent secretary. When
a nurse left after
a year, he
was replaced by
a senior occupational therapist.
The consultant psychiatrist responsible for the
programme was also responsible for the emergency
clinic. Staff liaised with other services inside and
outside hospital, including the Maudsley emergency
clinic for crisis cover at night; the occupational therapy
department for assessments of basic skills; and day
centres for daytime activities.
Patients were initially assessed with available
relatives in the emergency clinic. The first assessment
was usually by
a psychiatrist and another health
worker. Problems were identified,
a physical examination was done, and treatment was prescribed for
most patients. When home care was agreed on patients
and relatives were offered
a lift home, where living
conditions were assessed.
For those patients who required immediate
admission the daily living programme staff remained
responsible for their care. While on the ward patients
were seen frequently by the programme's psychiatrist,
the key worker, and other staff. Hospital admission
was aimed at brief crisis intervention, and patients
were taken home as soon as possible for further care.
Patients in
a serious state, such as those with suicidal or
psychotic behaviour, continued to be seen regularly by
the psychiatrist and other staff and interventions could
be adjusted on
a daily basis.
A team member was allocated as key worker from
a
rotation within 48 hours of entry. Using
a problem
solving approach, key workers presented and discussed
their patients with the multidisciplinary team for
advice and modifications to care plans.
STANDARD HOSPITAL BASED CARE
Patients randomised to this group received inpatient
care in the Bethlem or Maudsley Hospitals. They were
admitted to beds of any of the consultants and received
no special attention. Follow up care consisted mainly
of outpatient appointments.
RATING SCALES
Psychopathology was measured with the present
state examination"' and the 24 item brief psychiatric
rating scale." Neither of these scales have thresholds
denoting serious mental illness but in both the scores
increase with severity (from
0 (absence of any symptoms) to over 100 for present state examination and
from 24 (absence of psychopathology) to 168 for the
rating scale). The social adjustment scale was used to
measure social functioning (range of mean for all items
is 1-5, lower score=better functioning),'2 and the
global adjustment scale to measure general functioning
(range 1-100, higher score=better functioning)."
Satisfaction was assessed by the client satisfaction
questionnaire (range 8-32, higher score indicating
greater satisfaction)'4 and relatives satisfaction questionnaire (based on the client satisfaction questionnaire;
range 13-65, higher score=greater satisfaction).
All questionnaires were administered by independent psychologists. Baseline ratings were obtained
within 72 hours of entry and follow up ratings between
three and six months after entry. Obtaining

set of ratings from the patients and relatives on each
occasion took a mean of three hours over two interviews. In addition, many patients and relatives
defaulted from appointments without informing raters,
and many had no telephone. Therefore several repeated
visits often had to be made to complete a set of ratings.
Ratings at nine and 18 months and the cost-benefit
analysis will be reported later.
ANALYSIS
The daily living programme and hospital groups
were compared at baseline and on changes from
baseline. Confidence intervals ofthe absolute difference
between changes in the two treatment means from
baseline to three to six months indicate the likely size of
the differential treatment effects. We also calculated a
relative measure of the effect of home treatment (the
confidence interval divided by the change in the
hospital group).
A t test on the changes in score from baseline was
performed, adjusting for individual differences at
baseline. For the satisfaction scales absolute scores
were compared as no baseline data had been obtained.
Results
During the 25 month admnission period 189 patients
were randomised, 92 to the daily living programme and
97 to standard hospital care. Because they turned out
not to meet selection criteria, seven patients (4%) were
excluded after randomisation; six (7%) in the home
care group and one (1%) in the hospital group. Of the
patients excluded in the home group, two were living
outside the area, one had an organic disease at the first
assessment, one was pregnant, and one refused to
participate (the only patient to do so). One patient
in each group was excluded because of absence of
psychiatric illness. The higher number of patients
excluded in the home care group may be due to closer
scrutiny of selection criteria by the daily living
programme team and may have led to some selection

BASELINE CHARACTERISTICS
Table I shows the baseline features of all patients,
those with three to six months follow up ratings, and
those without ratings at three to six months. Most
variables were similar across the two treatment groups.
Ethnicity was similar to that of the south Southwark
population, with a slight excess of patients from an
Afro-Caribbean background.
The baseline results of the present state examination
were used for diagnosis. If the index of definition
was below 5, an ICD (ninth revision) diagnosis was
allocated from the medical notes for the seven patients
for whom sufficient information was available. Three
patients (3%) in the home care group and two (2%) in
the hospital group had no psychopathology. The distribution of diagnoses in the two groups was comparable
(table I). However, some heterogeneity between the
treatment groups was present. More patients with
previous admissions were allocated to standard hospital
than to home care, but the reasons for this are unclear.
Table II shows the scores on the psychiatric rating
scales. The scores indicate serious mental illness, as
would be expected from patients deemed to require
admission, and the two groups had similar profiles.
The difficulty of obtaining ratings from patients and
relatives led to a high proportion not completing all
questionnaires. Patients were defined as missing if no
score for the global adjustment scale, brief psychiatric
rating scale, or present state examination was available
at the three month follow up interview. These data
were missing from 24 (26%) of home care patients and
36 (36%) of hospital patients, the higher proportion in
the hospital care group being mainly due to a greater
loss to follow up among patients with previous admissions and men in this group. Reasons for missing
ratings differed between the groups; home care patients
mainly refused (21, 88%), whereas hospital patients
either refused (15, 42%) or were untraceable (18, 50%),
probably as a consequence of lack of clinical follow up
in hospital care. In both treatment groups baseline
demographic features and rating scores of missing
patients were similar to those of patients for whom
three month ratings were available.
A large proportion of relatives were also lost to
follow up. The severity of condition at baseline as
measured by the global adjustment scale was similar
for patients whose relatives did or did not rate
satisfaction.
HOSPITAL ADMISSIONS
This information was available from hospital records
for all patients. As intended in the study design home
care patients spent much less time in hospital than did
hospital patients (table III). The median stay of home
care patients was six days and of hospital group
patients 53 days. For 21 (23%) patients admission was
prevented altogether by home care. This is a conserTABLE iI-Mean (SE) baseline scores for all patients and for patients with ratings at both baseline and at three to six months' follow up

vative estimate as patients admitted overnight before
randomisation to home care were counted as home care
admissions. The differences between the treatment
groups in duration of hospital stay was independent of
diagnosis or history of a previous psychiatric admission
(table III).
Sixty six home care patients (72%) but only 17
control group patients (18%) spent less than 15 days in
hospital, and only two home care patients (3%)
compared with 33 hospital patients (34%) stayed the
whole three month period in hospital. Within treatment
groups, length of admission was very homogeneous. In
neither of the groups did admission duration differ
significantly for patients with or without any previous
psychiatric admissions. Neurotic patients had relatively
brief admissions in the home care group but not in the
hospital group. Diagnosis and history of previous
admission did not confound each other; in both groups
the first admission schizophrenic patients stayed in
hospital about as long as those with previous admissions. Duration of hospital stay did not vary with
ethnicity in either group, again independent of
diagnosis or history of previous admission.
The short admissions in the home care group did not
lead to large numbers of readmissions. Although 20
(21%) home care patients versus 10 (10%) hospital
patients were readmitted within three months, this
difference is misleading because 33 (34%) hospital
patients had remained continuously in hospital since
entering the trial.
CLINICAL AND SOCIAL OUTCOME
Home care patients improved more than hospital
patients on all measures, although confidence intervals
were wide. No questionnaire suggested an advantage
for hospital care (table IV). Similar trends emerged
when diagnostic and admission subgroups were considered. All subgroups of patients improved greatly in
both treatment groups, with slight advantages for
home care patients, but the differences were significant
only for measures of relatives' satisfaction for relatives
of new patients (p<004), though numbers were low:
19 (40%) relatives of new home care patients (mean
(SE) 55-3, (1-6)) and 10 (30%) of relatives of new
standard care patients (mean 48-0 (3 4)) completed the
questionnaire.

During this follow up period no suicides occurred,
but one home care patient was charged with homicide.
A hospital inquiry cleared the daily living programme
from any blame.
SUPPORT FOR HOME CARE PATIENTS
The mean number of contacts per patient fell from
26 in the first month to 17 during the second and 12
during the third month. Mean time of each contact
remained constant at about 40 minutes, independent of
diagnosis or history of previous admissions. The main
component of care, work in the community, demanded
67% of patient time in the first month, with 27% spent
on ward visits and 6% on phone calls. From the second
month onwards 90% of patient time was used for
community work, the other components requiring
only 5% each.
Patients with and without previous admissions
required similar amounts of time. Schizophrenic,
manic, and depressed patients required more care in
the first month than neurotic patients (table V). At two
months after entry psychotic patients required significantly more contacts and time than neurotic patients,
but this difference narrowed subsequently.

Many patients received help with aspects of daily
living. Although the proportion of neurotic patients
being so supported was slightly lower than that of other
diagnostic groups and readmitted patients received
slightly more help than new patients (table VI) none of
the differences was significant. The programme
attempted to help several patients to find work by
looking through newspapers with them and setting up
training interviews, but the success rate was low. Only
very few of the 20 patients who were working and the
two who were studying found work through the efforts
of the programme. Patients who were competent
enough to work seemed to be able to find employment
independently.
About 30% of patients required help with problems
such as personal hygiene, shopping, or cooking. Several
of these patients needed to be visited daily for several
weeks, during which time the necessary skills could be
taught and reinforced. Little progress was made in
many instances, probably partly because of lack of
expertise of staff and partly because some patients were
less interested in achieving change. Relatives and
friends often received support -for example, information, education, counselling, marital therapy, or
practical assistance. Relatives did not necessarily live
with or actively support patients.

Discussion
Home care reduced the duration of hospital admissions by 80%. This reduction was not achieved at the
expense of worse health in home care patients than in
hospital patients. Nevertheless, after three months
confidence intervals were wide, which makes it difficult
to estimate the size of the effect.
Patients' and relatives' satisfaction tended to favour
home care over standard care, though this difference
was not significant with the exception of the satisfaction
of relatives living with new patients. The relatives'
satisfaction questionnaire was completed for only a
small proportion of the sample, and this group may not
have been representative. This low response rate, due
to patients refusing permission to interview relatives
and to relatives' refusal, is similar to that in other
studies. 15
Duration of admission was surprisingly consistent
within each treatment group, and much longer in
standard care patients. The required length of hospital
stay was largely unrelated to diagnosis or history of
admission, but may depend more on tradition and
untested opinion than on any proved efficacy and
safety of longer inpatient care.
Early in the programme, hospital admission of home
care patients was seen as failure but gradually positive
indications for admission were identified. Very
psychotic and disturbed patients needed more structure
than could be offered at home, and were often a risk to
themselves or others. Single people were at higher risk
of admission, partly because they had no one to look
after them but also because they often presented with
more severe problems and lived in poor circumstances.
In addition, the lack of night staff on the daily living
programme meant that single people had to spend the
night alone if hospital admission was considered
unnecessary, and their inability to do so was often the
decisive factor for admission.
Some aspects of home care were so novel that they
were not covered by existing guidelines. This included
night telephone duty by the nursing staff. Other
problems emerged in the course of the project, such as
the role of nurses in traditionally medical decisions
such as about admission and discharge and adjustment
of drugs. In the daily living programme these decisions
were often initiated by the non-medical staff, but they
required agreement from medical staff, either the
team's senior registrar or psychiatrists working in the
emergency clinic.
ACCEPTABILITY OF DAILY LIVING PROGRAMME
Staff were surprised by the appreciation from
patients and relatives of attempts to prevent admission
to hospital. We had expected that admission would be
demanded as the presenting problems were often
severe. After being told that the programme provided
constant support, patients and relatives became positive
about care at home. Patients or relatives rarely objected
to discharge after a brief admission. Family sessions
were mainly held in the home and aimed at solving
problems created for the family or increasing tolerance
of the patient's behaviour.
Only three patients refused further contact with the
daily living programme after the first few weeks, and
these patients functioned well by then, having entered
with acute neurotic conditions which required no
further care. Several patients refused to see the team
for a while, but returned on their own initiative when
they needed help. Drug compliance was poor initially,
but improved over time, possibly as a result of
education and the development of trust. The programme was well accepted by Afro-Caribbean patients,
many of whom were young men with schizophrenia
yiving alone.
OTHER STUDYS
Our study and the Sydney study"6 both replicated
the Madison project.8 Average duration of admission
for home care patients requiring admission to hospital
was about 16 days in all three studies, but the Madison
and Sydney studies did not give admission details for
subgroups of patients. Improvement in psychopathology and functioning were impressively similar across
these studies. The trends always slightly favoured
community care, including greater satisfaction of
patients and relatives. None of the studies indicate how
home care yields slightly greater benefits than hospital
care. Home care might be beneficial because it allows
interventions in the natural setting, without any need
for acquired skills to generalise from an institutional to
a home setting, and without the related problem of
institutionalisation. Other important components of
home care are case management, coordinating the
various care components, and continuity of care.
The relatively large variance of outcome measures in
our study and others is related to low power, which
may have contributed to the absence of any differential
outcome in the various subgroups. Nevertheless, our
study included the largest number of patients of
studies evaluating home care so far.
A potential criticism of such studies is the role of
bias. Some bias is unlikely to be avoided, because
clinicians, assessors, and patients cannot be blinded to
treatment and may have been influenced by the
publicity supporting or condemning community care.
The strength and direction of such biases are impossible
to measure and may have led to underestimation or
overestimation of treatment differences.
REQUIREMENTS FOR HOME CARE
The clinical experiences suggest that home care
requires a different approach towards patient care and
flexibility on the part of both clinicians and management. It is not known whether the help given to
patients reflected their need, as perceived by either
patients or staff, or staff interest or ability to deal with
particular problems. The relatively low proportion of
success with work and activities of daily living may
have been due to lack of staff training and experience
since a considerable need existed.
A large amount of time was spent dealing with
patients' financial and housing problems, with staff
liaising with social services, housing departments, and
telephone, gas, and electricity companies. These
negotiations were beneficial to patients, who had often
been unable to deal with the problems on their own.
Such work is traditionally thought to be the responsibility of social workers, suggesting that service caring
for severely mentally ill people should be multidisciplinary. Psychiatric patients are particularly prone to
problems in these areas, and their poor circumstances
can be the result of or aggravate their illness.

Case management entails acceptance of responsibility
for the coordination and implementation of the many
required components of care. This may have to
continue for many years, and staff will have to accept
that care and maintenance may have to be the objective,
rather than cure. The low drop out rate of home care
patients, reflected in the higher number of untraceable
patients in the hospital group, suggests that patients
appreciated the attention given to difficulties which
affect their quaility of life at least as much as their
psychiatric illness. It also suggests that an assertive
community team, sensitive to the need of patients can
prevent those patients who need the support most
from dropping out, as found by other studies.'78
This role for mental health workers differs from
the traditional ward role, and training will need to be
adjusted.
Comprehensive community care requires resources.
The lack of sufficient facilities in an impoverished
inner city area imposed
a great burden of care on home
care staff, and it is doubtful whether such devotion to
care could continue indefinitely in community teams.
The experience of the Mendota Mental Health Centre
suggests that some reduction in enthusiasm can be
expected after conversion from
a model programme to
a regular service, although the centre's continuing
effectiveness also indicates that
a community service is
feasible.
9 Some community services in Britain confirm
this.20
The relevance and general applicability of model
programmes of home care such as ours depend on
many factors, including patient target groups, sociodemographic characteristics of the area, staffing levels,
and resources. The external validity of the daily living
programme will have to be judged by local clinicians,
managers, and planners.

ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO
MARAT'S BROTHER.
It is now well known that Marat was
a physician with
a considerable practice, and no mere "horse leech,"
as Carlyle described him, many years before the revolutionary craze made him the shabby, dirty, bloodthirsty
personage so familiar to the student of history. Mr. Morse
Stevens, in his great work on the French Revolution, now
in course of publication, speaks of the "ami du peuple" as
an educated gentleman. It also appears,' according to M.
Germain Bapst, that Marat had
a brother Olivier, who
played
a remarkable part in the history of science in Paris
during the Reign of Terror. On the day before the fatal
10th of August, 1792, Louis XVI made Bernardine de St.
Pierre, the immortal author of Paul et Virginie, Director of
the Jardin des Plantes. He was probably the last man ever
appointed to any charge by that monarch. He proved
a
failure, and was replaced by the veteran Daubenton. The
Government had brought the royal menagerie from
Versailles to the Jardins des Plantes, and Daubenton
himself succeeded in bringing to Paris
a fine collection of
minerals confiscated at Chantilly, the palace of the emigre
Prince de Conde. But soon funds fell low, and the director
sent repeated claims for subsidies to the Convention,
which turned
a deaf ear to his entreaties. The collection
would have perhaps been ruined, when suddenly the
director found out
a way of pressing the Government
without risking his own head. Marat had just been killed.
His brother Olivier was making an uncertain livelihood at
Geneva by collecting and mounting insects. Olivier Marat
pressed Soulavie, the French Minister at Geneva, to get
him
a post at Paris. He was accordingly recommended to
Daubenton. The Minister of the Interior sent
a similar
recommendation to that scientist, with
a further request
that rooms for Olivier Marat and his wife should be
prepared in the Museum. Accordingly Daubenton,
De Jussieu, Lamarck, and Saint-Hilaire agreed to the
request, but respectfully noted that the Museum was so
short of funds that it would not be possible to set up
Olivier Marat and his wife in the Museum till debts were
paid and
a further subsidy granted. The Minister had to
present the plea before
a Committee of the Convention,
and it was granted. The funds were used for arranging the
collections in the Museum. The lodgings for the Marats
were slowly prepared, when Robespierre fell and Olivier
Marat was forgotten. He disappeared from the Jardin des
Plantes and from history for ever. (BMJ 1892;i:673)
