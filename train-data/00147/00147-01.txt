\s=b\The effectiveness of community-based treatment stressing
home care was compared with hospital-based psychiatric care.
One hundred and fifty-five patients destined for inpatient
psychiatric care were randomly assigned to Home Care (76
patients) and to Hospital Care (79 patients). Symptoms, role
functioning, and psychosocial burden on the family were similar
at admission, one month, three months, six months, and one
year. The mean in-hospital stay of Hospital Care patients was
41.7 days compared with a mean stay of 14.5 days for Home Care
patients. The difference in the amount of ambulatory care
received by patients in the two groups was not significant. The
evidence is consistent: community-based psychiatric care is an
effective alternative to hospital-based care for many but not all
severely disabled patients. The active ingredients of successful
community treatment are known, yet the lag in implementing
these programs persists.
(Arch Gen Psychiatry 36:1073-1079, 1979)
Community-oriented care, stressing home care, can
produce comparable rates of symptom remission and
improvement of some role functioning, and at the same
time, can effectively substitute for hospitalizaron.1" This
study, begun in January 1973, replicates previous studies,
this time in a densely populated urban area, and also
compares family burden and financial costs of care.
In this article, we compare clinical symptoms, role
functioning, family burden, and inpatient and outpatient
treatment patterns in two groups of patients, one receiv¬
ing home-based care, the other hospital-based care. They
studied at five observation points: on admission to the
study, at one month, three months, six months, and one
year later.
Financial costs of the two treatments will be compared
in a subsequent article.
METHOD
Subjects
Patients for this study were drawn from the Department of
Psychiatry of the Montreal General Hospital, Montreal, a 900-bed
McGill University teaching hospital. The psychiatric inpatient
service, a 30-bed unit, serves a socially and economically diverse
catchment area of approximately 250,000 adults in metropolitan
Montreal.
Inclusion Criteria.—To be included in this study, an individual
had to be considered by psychiatric staff not associated with this
study to be in need of admission or readmission to the psychiatric
inpatient service of the Montreal General Hospital. Then, each
patient was interviewed by a member of the Home Care Treat¬
ment Team. There were two additional inclusion criteria. The
patient had to be at least 18 years old and in contact with his
family, the latter being defined as an individual or individuals who
agreed to assist in treatment.
Exclusion criteria included the following: (1) a diagnosis of
organic brain syndrome, alcoholism, or other drug dependence; (2)
serious suicidal intent or violent behavior; (3) chronic physical
illness that precluded starting treatment at home immediately; (4)
residence in Montreal for less than six months prior to entering
the study; (5) domicile outside home visiting range; and (6)
language other than English.
Patient Groups.-Each of the 175 eligible patients (and their
relatives) was asked to accept either Home Care or Hospital Care:
13 patients refused Home Care and were excluded. The remaining
162 patients were randomly assigned to the Home Care group, 78
patients, or to the Hospital Care group, 84 patients. Excluding
seven patients who died during the year, two in the Home Care
group (cause of death was complications of arteriosclerosis) and
five in the Hospital Care group (cause of death was suicide, two
patients; complications of arteriosclerosis, two patients; and viral
encephalitis, one patient), our analysis was concerned with 155
patients, 76 in the Home Care group and 79 in the Hospital Care
group.
Treatment
The two groups were treated by separate clinical staffs.
Patients in the Home Care group were treated by a multidisciplinary team consisting of one half-time psychiatrist, one psychiatric
social worker, and one psychiatric nurse. This team, on-call 24
hours daily to patients in the Home Care group, emphasized
treatment within the family and various community agencies.
Initially, home visits elicited a thorough understanding of the
patient's mental state in the context of his family. Intervention
included the use of psychopharmacological and other physical
treatments. Psychotherapeutic intervention was also used to
ameliorate symptoms and also to help the patient and members of
his family to cope better with daily life. The assessment, consulta¬
tion, and treatment facilities within the Department of Psychia¬
try of the Montreal General Hospital were available as back-up
resources to the Home Care team.
Patients in the Hospital Care group received short-term, inten¬
sive treatment from the Department's regular psychiatric and
paramedical staff, which included two attending psychiatrists, one
full-time, one half-time, two and often three psychiatric residents,
and nursing and occupational therapy staff. Social work consulta¬
tion was available. The average length of stay per patient on this
unit during the 20-month study intake period was 28.3 days. After
being discharged from hospital, patients were followed up by a
team including a staff psychiatrist and a nurse at least one of
whom was previously a member of the patient's in-hospital
treatment team.
Measures
The outcome measures included clinical symptoms and role
functioning, family burden, and psychiatric inpatient and outpa¬
tient treatment. The information was obtained by research
psychiatric social workers, independent of both treatment teams,
at admission to the study, and on four occasions thereafter: one
month, three months, six months, and one year.

eight Summary Scales recording judgments of an individual's
psychosocial functioning during the week prior to interview. The
interjudge reliability, based on 60 interviews by a pair of inter¬
viewers, was estimated by the intraclass correlation coefficient.
The median value for the individual scales was 0.86, and for the
Summary Scales also 0.86 (range, 0.80 to 0.96).
Burden.—A 61-item instrument adapted from the Family Evalu¬
ation Form" (FEF) reflected different aspects of the psychosocial
and economic burden on the informant caused by the patient's
illness. The informant is the one person in closest contact with the
patient during the one week prior to interview. Content analysis
yielded five clusters of items. Items with a frequency with less
than 10% were excluded from this analysis. The remaining 23
items include the following: seven symptoms of subjective burden,
which an informant experiences and attributes directly to stress
associated with the patient's condition; financial worries, four
items; inconvenience to informant, four items; additional respon¬
sibilities on informant, three items; and patient's bothersome
behavior, one item. Four items-child neglect, informant receiving
psychiatric treatment, informant taking psychotropic medication,
and rater's assessment of overall burden on informants due to the
patient's illness-were reported individually.
Psychiatric Treatment.—Inpatient treatment is reflected by the
number of readmissions and the number of days in hospital. (A
readmission for patients in the Home Care group is defined as an
admission to hospital after assignment to Home Care. A readmission for patients in the Hospital Care group is an admission to the
hospital following discharge from the index admission after
assignment to Hospital Care). Outpatient visits Home Care
group refer to the number of visits by the Home Care Treatment
Team with patients and families, and in the Hospital Care group
to the number of outpatient visits. Psychiatric facilities in
Montreal and elsewhere were contacted to ensure complete cover¬
age.
Data Analysis
Cross-sectional comparison of Home Care and Hospital
Care groups on admission and at one month, three months,
six months, and one year was analyzed. Two-tailed ¿-tests
for independent samples were used to test differences
between groups; - was computed for categorical vari¬
ables.
RESULTS
Comparability of Home Care and Hospital Care Groups
Table 1 illustrates that two groups were similar in terms
of key social, demographic, and clinical characteristics. The
one difference noted was the preponderance of Protestants
in the Home Care group.
Of the patients, 60% were women. Slightly more than
half of the group were younger than 35 years old. Sixty-two
percent were either single, widowed, or divorced. Approxi¬
mately two thirds had completed some high school educa¬
tion; an additional one quarter had attended college or
university. Regarding social class, the Hollingshead TwoFactor Index of Social Position7 was computed. Of those
classified, 72% were in social classes IV and V, 28% in
classes I through III. Regarding the previous psychiatric
care: one third had been hospitalized at least twice before.
Close to three quarters were diagnosed as functional
psychosis, the majority were schizophrenic within the
International Classification of Diseases, eighth revision.
Virtually all patients in the psychoneurotic group were
severely depressed.
Nonresponse Effects
Response Rates for Patients.—The rate of completion of
PEF interviews ranged from 76% at one month to 64% at
one year. Differences between response rates for the
Home Care and Hospital Care groups were never statisti¬
cally significant. The two major reasons for nonresponse
were a patient's refusal to be interviewed or a patient had
moved from Montreal and could not be reached.
Respondents and nonrespondents in each group were
compared in two ways: first, in terms of the PEF Summary
Scale scores and the Overall Severity of disability score on
admission; no consistent differences were noted between
the respondents and nonrespondents at any of the four
observation points. Second, the respondents and nonreDownloaded From: http://archpsyc.jamanetwork.com/ by a University of California - San Diego User on 01/29/2016

spondents were compared at each observation point in
terms of the length of their initial hospitalization. No
differences were noted. Therefore, we concluded that the
nonrespondents probably did not influence subsequent
comparisons of patients in the Home Care and Hospital
Care groups.
Response Rates for Informants.—The rate of completion of
FEF interviews with informants varied from 54% at one
month to 48% at one year. The two major reasons for
nonresponse were the unavailability of patients or infor¬
mants for an interview (no informants were interviewed
without a patient's consent). The difference in the infor¬
mant response rates between the two groups was substan¬
tial at the one-month point, favoring the Home Care
group.
At the three subsequent time points, the percentage of
FEF interviews completed in the Home Care and Hospital
Care groups were not substantially different, although the
Home Care informants were generally more cooperative.
This is not unexpected. Since Home Care patients and their
informants were seen jointly in treatment by the Home
Care Treatment Team, the informants were easier to
reach. To assess the influence of nonresponse by infor¬
mants, a two-way analysis of variance was computed. Two
independent variables were used: the interview status
(interviewed or not interviewed) of informants at each
observation point, and the group affiliation (Home Care or
Hospital Care) of informants on admission. Admission
PEF Summary Scale scores and the Overall Severity scores
were the dependent variables used. Since only one of the 84
F-ratios was significant at less than the .10 level, it seems
that informants who have completed the FEF interview
were not associated with patients whose degree of psychopathology differed substantially from those patients whose
informants were not interviewed.
Overall, it seems unlikely that nonresponse by either
patients or informants biased the results.
Clinical Symptoms and Role Functioning
A cross-sectional analysis was done at each of the five
observation points. The lack of differences noted between
the two groups on admission, illustrated in Table 2,
supported the contention that the Home Care and Hospital
Care groups are clinically similar at the beginning of the
study. In addition, the role impairment in both groups was
quite high. The overall severity of the patient's illness,
rated clinically, was severe.
The differences between the Home and Hospital groups
at the other four observation points were not clinically or
statistically significant.
The major changes in clinical state, equal in both groups,
occurred during the first three months of treatment.
Symptoms of depression and anxiety included in the
Subjective Distress Scale improved during the first month;
psychotic symptoms, hallucinations, and inappropriate
affect for example, included in the Disorganization Scale,
became less intense during the first month and continued
to subside during the second and third months. Role
functioning remained impaired in both groups after one
month of treatment. Although the differences in role
functioning between the two groups at this point is not
statistically significant, there is a clear trend for patients
in the Hospital Care group to be more impaired. Role
impairment decreases in both groups during the second
and third months of treatment. Most of the decrease in the
Overall Severity of psychopathology occurred, in both
groups, during the first month of treatment.
Family Burden
Cross-sectional analysis of burden items at the five
observation points showed no differences between the two
groups. Accordingly, for purposes of analysis, the two
groups were combined, as illustrated in Table 3.
There is one exception: There are statistically significant
differences at the 2% level between two items relating to

Almost 2V2 times (44.4% vs 18.4%) as many informants in
the Hospital Care group assume responsibility that
patients would undertake if they were well than do their
counterparts in the Home Care group. Similarly, after one
month of treatment, four times (38.9% vs 10.2%) as many
informants in the Hospital Care group find these chores
difficult to handle. The differences between groups on
these two items at three months are not significant. The
Hospital Care group has made up the difference.
The frequency of most items decreased during the first
three months. Financial worries affected a low proportion
of informants at each observation point. Similarly, few
informants consulted a psychiatrist or took psychotropic
drugs to decrease stress caused by the patient's condi¬
tion.
Treatment Patterns
Inpatient Stay.—Hospitalization was prevented entirely
for 61.8% of the patients in the Home Care group. An
additional 30.3% of the patients in the Home Care group
were hospitalized for an average of 1.8 days. Thus, hospi¬
talization was prevented outright or minimized in 92.1% of
the Home Care patients. Table 4 gives the number of days
spent in hospital by the patients in each group during the
year.
Patients in the Hospital Care group received more
inpatient treatment throughout the year, most notably
during the first month of treatment. During the entire
year, the mean inpatient stay of Hospital Care patients
was 41.7 days compared with a mean stay of 14.5 days for
Home Care patients.
The proportion of patients readmitted to hospital during
the first year of treatment was similar in the two groups,
24.4% in the Home Care group (19 readmissions among the 76
Home Care patients) and 23.4% in the Hospital Care group ( 19
readmissions among the 79 Hospital Care patients).
Outpatient Visits.—Table 5 illustrates that during the
first three months Home Care patients received consider¬
ably more outpatient treatment. The difference was
greatest during the first month when home care treatment
was most intensive. Meanwhile, most of the patients in the
Hospital Care group spent their first month in hospital.
The trend reversed particularly during the second six
months of the year: Hospital Care patients received
three times as much outpatient treatment; the difference
is highly statistically significant (P =
.005, two-tailed t val¬
ue -
2.9).
COMMENT
We compare this study with similar studies, identify the
active ingredients of successful home care treatment,
discuss the generalizability of the results, and describe
future research needs.

often schizophrenia, is the most common diagnosis; random
allocation of eligible patients to community-based and
hospital-based treatment was successful, and reliable
outcome measures applied by independent evaluators has
been the rule rather than the exception.
Treatments.—The experimental community-based pro¬
grams all emphasize treatment outside the hospital, often
in the patient's home; inpatient hospitalization is used
sparingly. Psychotropic drugs are prescribed. Family
members or other individuals close to the patient are
supported, and may even be included in treatment.
Attempts are made to link the patient and his family with
community agencies. In contrast, the hospital-based
control programs emphasize inpatient treatment. Mea¬
sured by current standards, the quality of these programs
is high. Psychotropic drugs and a range of psychosocial
therapies are used. The patient's family and others impor¬
tant to him are not routinely included in either inpatient or
outpatient treatment.
Results.—The outcome measures will be reviewed in
turn.
Patient's Clinical Symptoms.—The evidence is clear:
Community-based care is as effective as hospital-based
care in achieving symptom remission.
Patient's Role Functioning.—Comparing our results with
others is difficult mainly because various workers define
role functioning differently. Our results are similar to
those of Langsley et al2: community-based care is not more
effective than hospital-based care. In contrast, Test and
Stein' report that considerably more patients in their
community-based program were used in sheltered settings
after four.m/mths, eight months, and 12 months. The major 6m W...M
advantage of their program seemed to be the emphasis on
the teaching of specific coping skills needed by the socially
impaired individuals, mostly schizophrenics, to perform
better in their communities and with their families.
Burden.—Other investigators3910 have compared family
burden associated with hospital-based care and communi¬
ty-based care over time. However, since different instru¬
ments were used and follow-up periods varied, we are
cautious when comparing our results with others. Consid¬
ering short-term effects of burden, ie, after approximately
one month of treatment, community care is as effective as
hospital-based care in relieving burden. The implication of
this finding is that either admitting the patient to hospital
or supporting the patient and his family in the community
achieves the same end—symptoms of burden are relieved.
In this study, psychosocial burden, highest at the start of
the study, was not translated into either taking psycho¬
tropic drugs or seeing a psychiatrist independently.
Considering long-term effects of psychosocial burden (ie,
at least one year after community-based care and hospitalbased care have started), we noted no differences between
the Home Care and Hospital Care groups. However, one
third of the informants were still very worried about the
patient's condition one year after treatment had begun
and after the patient's clinical symptoms and other
evidence of burden had diminished. Grad and Sainsbury89
measured the burden in the family of two groups of
patients, one treated in a community-based program, the
other in a hospital-based program during a two-year
period, and noted a trend toward greater relief of moder¬
ate burden among families in the hospital-based program
due possibly to the greater amount of social work
performed in this program. It is not clear to what extent
the activities performed by the workers in this study and in
the Grad and Sainsbury study are similar.
Overall, most studies seem to show that psychosocial
burden is equally relieved by community-based treatment
and hospital-based treatment over the short-term, but that
the deleterious effects of long-term community care or
hospital care are not clear.
Psychiatric Treatment Patterns.—Community-based care
decreases inpatient utilization. Hospitalization is avoided,
not simply delayed, in a high proportion of cases." In the
study by Langsley et al,' for example, not one of the 150
patients in the experimental group was admitted to an
inpatient service during the acute phase of communitybased treatment. Also, when inpatient admission is neces¬
sary, the average length of hospital stay is less for patients
in the community-care group. The report by Goodacre et
al12 is an exception: inpatient experience between groups
receiving home-based treatment and hospital-based treat¬
ment did not differ substantially. However, 42.3% of the 87
patients assigned initially to Home Care treatment were
admitted to hospital within the first week, mostly because
of "suicidal or homicidal behaviour" or because of "such
lack of support that the home treatment team were
incapable of managing them out of hospital."
The saving in inpatient care is not offset by increased
outpatient care. In our study, the expected excess of
outpatient treatment received by patients in the Home
Care group during the first three months of treatment is
almost balanced by the greater amount of outpatient

treatment received by patients in the Hospital Care group
during the last nine months of the year.
More evidence for a cause-effect relationship between
community-based care, improved clinical adjustment, and
decreased use of services is provided by follow-up of
community care and hospital care groups after the commu¬
nity care is stopped and patients in both groups have access
to the same after-care facilities in the community. The
present study does not provide this information. Three
other studies do: the 5-year follow-up study of patients in
the study by Davis et al,'1 the 18-month follow-up of
Langsley et al,14 and the 14-month follow-up of Stein et al.15
The three groups of investigators reached the same conclu¬
sion: after community-based care stops, there is very little
carry-over: beneficial effects of community-based care
diminish over time. Gains in clinical adjustment are lost,
and the gap between inpatient and outpatient treatments
in the two groups decreases because the group formerly
receiving community-based care receives more inpatient
and outpatient treatment.
Effective Ingredients of Community-Based
and Hospital-Based Treatments
Since there is no evidence that the internal validity of
the experimental design has been jeopardized by dissimilar
groups or excessive measurement error, we conclude that
the effects achieved are due to differences in the treat¬
ments in the two groups. What combination of active
ingredients, therefore, is necessary for the success of the
home-based treatment program offered to patients and
families in this study? Features shared by both treatment
programs—highly skilled personnel, the use of psychotropic
drugs (the amount of major tranquilizers, the most
frequently prescribed drugs, was the same in both groups
during the year) and a similar degree of drug compliance
(the patient's verbal report was used as the screening
instrument; the written prescription for psychotropic
drugs included in the patient's hospital record was the
reference source used) can be considered necessary but not
sufficient ingredients of the successful Home Care
program. An outpatient program described in detail else¬
where,'0 emphasizing continual ambulatory treatment of
the patient and his family or significant others, in which
inpatient care is not the focus but only one component of
the program, stands out as the major difference between
the two treatment programs in this study.
Generalizability of Results
Of the 864 admissions to the psychiatric inpatient service
of the Montreal General Hospital between January 1, 1973
and August 31, 1974, 55% were eligible for this study. Of
the 864 admissions, 18.8% (162 patients) entered the study;
36.2% of patients were eligible although not included for
logistical reasons (168 patients [19.4% of the admissions]
were admitted to the Montreal General Hospital on
weekends or holidays when patients were not being admit¬
ted to the study, and 145 patients [16.8% of the admissions],
who were otherwise eligible were excluded for the follow¬
ing project-related reasons: living outside home visiting
range [8.0%], living in Montreal less than six months [4.4%],
non-English speaking [2.9%], or under age 18 years
[1.5%] ).
The findings in this study cannot be generalized to
suicidal or homicidal patients (15.7% of the admissions), to
alcoholics and patients whose conditions were diagnosed as
organic brain syndrome (18.9% of the admissions), to
patients with no family or significant other available to
assist with treatment (8.9% of the admissions), or to
patients or informants who refused home-care treatment
(1.5% of the admissions) (approximately one third of study
patients were living with a significant other and not with
either their parental or conjugal families at the start of the
study).
Home-based care is feasible with severely disabled
patients. Overall severity of impairment, our most valid
indicator of patient's condition, was high at the start of the
study. The low mean scores on the Disorganization and
Grandiosity-Externalization Scales indicating that individ¬
ual psychotic symptoms affect a small proportion of
patients are not valid indicators of a patient's overall
condition.
The Home Care treatment offered in this study was
acceptable to patients. Only 13 of the 175 eligible patients
and informants who were asked to participate in this study
refused because of the possibility of home treatment. Also,
between two thirds and three quarters of the patients in
the Home Care group were satisfied with their treatment
during the year.
Future Research Needs
Future research needs are considered under three head¬
ings: research questions, research designs, and implemen¬
tation of research findings.
Research Questions.—Evidence that community-based
care is a feasible and effective alternative to hospitalbased care does not mean that community-based care is
inherently more desirable for all patients. It is important
to answer more refined questions. Who fails on home care?
Evidence1718 suggests that certain family environments
may be the single most important influence contributing to
clinical relapse, and that different family environments
may be detrimental to schizophrenic and depressive
patients. Might patients in these environments fare better
in a hospital-based program? Similarly, one can expect
treatment failures in the Hospital Care group. Certainly, it
seems that inpatient hospitalization is being over-used for
some patients who might be termed hospital-care failures.
Might these individuals do better with community-based
treatment?
The next logical step is to find out which patients are
best suited to which combinations of effective treatments?
Short-term hospitalization, usually one month or less,19 and
day-care20 are two effective treatments that might be
combined with home-based treatment in future experi¬
ments.
Research Designs.—We make three recommendations.
First, homogeneous groups of patients, for example, first
episode schizophrenics, chronic schizophrenics, patients
older than 65 years of age, with and without organic brain
syndrome, and patients who have neither a family nor
significant others should be studied to broaden generaliza¬
tion of findings. Second, multicenter trials should be
considered. Although not easily carried out, such trials
might enable investigators to work with larger samples.

Third, accurate and reliable diagnosis must be the rule.
Structured diagnostic interviews now available can help.
Treatments.—Role functioning, the employment record in
particular, improves when the community-based programs
emphasize the learning of basic coping skills designed
specifically to improve functioning on the job and in the
community. Training in Community Living program
described by Test and Stein21'-'2 and the "Lodge Society"
program of Fairweather et al23 are two examples. Features
of these programs should be incorporated into communitybased programs for chronically disabled patients.
Outcome Measures.—A wider range of outcome measures
should be developed. One step would be to develop reliable
and valid measures of psychosocial burden on individuals in
a patient's social network, children included, which could
then be included in longer follow-up studies. The Family
Evaluation Form7-24 is a start. That the state of the art of
conceptualizing, defining, and measuring burden is not far
advanced is perhaps surprising, given the emphasis on
psychiatric care in the community in recent years. Exami¬
nation of the instruments available shows agreement that
psychosocial burden includes several concepts, including
the mental and physical health of members of a patient's
family and others in his social network, effects of a
patient's violent or disruptive behavior, disruption in the
family's social and domestic routine, and financial hard¬
ships associated with the patient's condition. On the other
hand, there is no consensus about several basic issues: (1)
how symptoms and behaviors comprising burden should be
defined and classified; (2) the "burden upon whom?"
question, ie, whether burden should be measured for one or
more individuals in the patient's family or social network;
(3) whether symptoms and behaviors comprising burden
should be measured as categorical or continuous variables;
(4) how to standardize recording of information; and (5)
how to summarize judgements quantitatively.
Implementation of Research Findings.—Several observ¬
ers21"27 contend that there is a gap in the application of
knowledge concerning effective alternatives to hospitalbased care. We agree. The delay in translating these
research findings into wider practice has been attributed
to economic and political considerations on one level,25 and
certain organizational patterns of psychiatric services on
the other.28 Some of these obstacles seem to be reversible.2"
At the same time, there is little experimental evidence to
guide us how best to change our patterns of services.
Although there is no doubt that there are gaps in knowl¬
edge concerning the primary prevention of the functional
psychoses1"1' and although Eisenberg's12 comment that,
"what appears to be true in the light of yesterday's
evidence proves false by tomorrow's" is valid, the plea that
"more research need be done" should not be the rationale
for delay in providing effective community services.
