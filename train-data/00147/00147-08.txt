Alternative to the Hospital: A Controlled Study
Am J Psychiatry 132:5, May 1975 517

The authors describe the evaluation ofa treatment model
that makes use ofthe community to help mentally ill
patients acquire necessary coping skills. This approach is
based on the assumption that deficiency in coping skills
and aggressive dependency are primarily responsible for
high readmission rates to mental hospitals and that
coping skills and autonomy are best learned in the
community. where the patient will be needing and using
them. The treatment model is evaluated by comparing it
with progressive in-hospital treatment and follow-up
care. The results suggest that the model described can
successfully treat patients with a high level of
symptomatology in the community rather than in the
mental hospital.
IT IS EVIDENT that psychiatry is not successfully meeting
the treatment needs of a substantial number of patients
who come to public mental hospitals. In spite of recent
innovative and intensive approaches, such as novel inhospital programs (1 -3), dramatic shortening of patients’
hospital stay (4-6), and attempts to make use of commu- nity agencies for treatment (7), a sizable percentage of
patients continue to spend considerable time in mental
institutions, function poorly between admissions, and cx- penience high readmission rates.
It is our contention that this persisting high rate of
“treatment failures” is caused by the fact that existing
models of treatment do not effectively ameliorate certain
disabilities shared by many of these patients. These disabilities, which have been mentioned frequently in the literature (8-1 1), can be described in two ways: as a limited
repertoire of instrumental and problem-solving behaviors to meet the goals and demands of life, leading to persisting difficulties with work habits, socialization, leisuretime activities, etc., and as powerful dependency needs,
frequently expressed as an aggressive dependency on
family or institutions.

These problems lead to a tenuous community adjustment, keeping patients on the brink of rehospitalization.
Patients thus disabled carry various diagnoses, ranging
from schizophrenia to dependent personality. However,
these disabling characteristics cut across diagnostic categonies and can, in fact, represent the rock upon which
treatment often founders. For example, the manifestations ofan acute schizophrenic episode arc managed relatively easily by means of phenothiazine drugs; however, if
either a deficiency in coping skills or an aggressive dependency is also present, the problems ofdischarging and
maintaining the patient in the community can be
enormous. In this paper we describe the evaluation ofa clinical re- search program that is a radical departure from the
present system of short-term hospitalization plus after- care. The program, titled “Training in Community Living,” was designed to help patients acquire the coping
skills and autonomy necessary for a reasonable comjw
nity adjustment. The model uses the community,4 a
treatment arena; hospitalization is virtually elinThated.
The rationale for this approach is based on tl#{233}oretical
and empirical work suggesting that the hospitaitsclf frequently has a debilitating influence on patic(its (12-14)
and, more importantly, that the community has much to
offer as an arena for treatment of this population (15-
17). The community, in contrast to the hospital, has
stronger demand characteristics for appropriate bchavior, has more healthy role models for the patients to emulate, and requires much less generalization to implement
what is learned in treatment.
This new model for treating severely disturbed patients
is being rigorously evaluated by comparing patients
treated in the community with a control group receiving
the presently available model of progressive in-hospital
treatment of short duration plus aftercare services in the
community. The relative success of the two models is
being considered in terms of a number of patient out- come variables and in terms of social and economic costs.
This paper outlines the clinical and research procedures
and reports the results of the study to date. METHOD Subjects
The subjects for this ongoing study include all patients
seeking admission for inpatient care at Mcndota Mental
Health Institute who meet the following criteria: I) residence in Dane County, Wis., which consists of the city of

Madison and the surrounding area; 2) age of 18 to 62;
and 3) any diagnosis other than severe organic brain syndrome or primary alcoholism.
Experimental Design
Patients meeting the above criteria are randomly as- signed to either the community treatment group or the
control group by the admission office staff. Control
patients arc treated in the hospital for as long as deemed
necessary and then linked with appropriate community
agencies. Experimental patients do not enter the hospital.
They are treated according to the training in community
living approach for 14 months, after which the staff are no longer available to them. Assessment data on all
patients arc gathered at baseline (time of admission) and
every 4 months for a period of 36 months by means of
personal interviews by a research staff. This staff operates
independently of both clinical teams.
Control Treatment
Patients assigned to the control group are screened
upon admission by a member of the hospital’s acute
treatment unit serving Dane County. The patients are usually, although not necessarily, admitted to the hospital, where they receive progressive treatment aimed at
preparation for return to the community. The Dane
County unit serves as a stringent control for the experimental program because it has a high staff-to-patient ratio and offers a wide variety of services, including inpatient treatment, partial hospitalization, and outpatient
follow-up. It is by no means a custodial unit; its median
length of stay is only I 7 days. This unit also makes liberal use of the aftercare services available in Madison for discharged patients.
Experimental Treatment
Work with patients. Patients assigned to the commu- nity program arc interviewed upon admission by a mem- ben of the experimental staff. They are then taken from
the admission office to the community to begin their
treatment program. Every effort is made to avoid hospitalization, which is used only for patients who are imminently suicidal or homicidal or who are so severely psychotic that they require high doses of medication that can
be given only in the hospital’s structured environment.
In the rare instances when hospitalization is used, it is of
short duration so that community treatment can begin
with minimal delay.
The community treatment approach focuses directly
on an in vivo teaching of coping skills as well as on treating the acute problem that precipitated the patient’s coming to the hospital. The patient’s treatment consists of
participation in a full schedule of daily living activities in
the community. Pharmacotherapy is used when appropriate.
The therapeutic input from the staff consists of motivating, supporting, and often being with the patients day
and evening. More specifically, staff members, who are
“on the spot” in patients’ homes and neighborhoods,
teach and assist them in such daily living activities as
laundry upkeep, shopping, cooking, going to restaurants,
grooming, budgeting, and use of transportation. Patients are also given sustained and intensive assistance in finding ajob or placement in a sheltered workshop. Staff then
continue daily contact with patients and their supervisors or employers to help with on-the-job problem solving.
Patients are aided in the constructive use of leisure
time and the development ofeffective social skills by staff
prodding and supporting their involvement in relevant
community recreation and social activities. This frequently involves staff members’ accompanying patients
to such functions on a regular basis. In all of these activities, a “can do” philosophy is transmitted from staff to
patient, the assets of the patients are stressed, and their
symptomatology is played down. Daily, even hourly contact of staff with patients is emphasized initially and then
gradually diminished according to each patient’s
progress in the treatment program.
The staff To carry out the program, we retrained a mental hospital ward staff, which consisted of a psychiatrist, a psychologist, a social worker, an occupational
therapist, nurses, and aides. These staff members spend
their time dispersed throughout the community working
with patients in such settings as their homes, their places
of work, supermarkets, and recreational facilities. They
help the patients learn the requisite skills to sustain a satisfactory community adjustment. Twice a day the staff
members gather at the project’s headquarters, a rented
house in downtown Madison, to share information, revise
treatment programs as necessary, and plan the next
shift’s work schedule. There are two shifts, so that the
program is well staffed from 7 am. until I I p.m., seven
days a week. A member of the professional staff remains on call at night to give 24-hour-a-day coverage for
patients as well as for community agencies.
Making use of mental hospital personnel in this kind of
extro-hospital program has advantages as well as disadvantages. The advantages include the experience of
mental hospital personnel in and commitment to working
with severely ill patients and their orientation toward
working with patient behaviors as well as feelings and
cognitions. These workers are also experienced with a
team approach; they are willing to rotate shifts so that
the program can be operational at all times. The major
disadvantage lies in the transition from work in a highly
structured hospital setting, where little is required in the
way of individual decision making, to work in the inevitably unstructured setting of the community, where a great
deal of initiative and willingness to make decisions on the
spot is vital. Fortunately, with training and support this
transition was possible and the staff members increasingly welcome greater responsibility.
Community agencies. A program of this nature cannot
survive unless the community is carefully prepared for its
implementation. Before we conducted the pilot study (18)
upon which this program is largely based, we held confer- ences with every relevant community agency to establish
the closest of working relationships. Our major goal was
to influence them to respond to the patients in a manner
that would promote responsible behavior rather than re-

inforce maladaptive modes of coping with stress. For cx- ample, if a patient’s behavior was disruptive to other tenants in his apartment building, we would encourage the
landlord to talk to the patient directly about his behavior
and tell him he would be evicted if it continued. This is in
contrast to the community’s usual response, which is to
see to it that the patient’s disruptive behavior leads to re- hospitalization. That action implicitly gives the patient
the message that he is not responsible for his behavior,
teaches the patient a maladaptive mode of coping with
stress, and reinforces the chronic patient role.
The manner in which we gained and maintained the co- operation of the supporting agencies in the community in
relating to patients as described above is most clearly
communicated by the following illustration:
The local sheltered workshop is an agency that we use
frequently; we regard its cooperation as essential. Early
in our work in community treatment, therefore, we met
with the administrative staff of the workshop to discuss our philosophy of treating patients as responsible individuals and to obtain their sanction for our sending highly
symptomatic patients to the workshop. After this was ac- complished we enrolled several patients in the workshop
and gradually developed effective techniques for maintaming the cooperation of this agency. We soon learned
that even though we had gained support from the workshop administration, daily contact with floor supervisors was a necessary and useful endeavor because these mdividuals were relating directly to our patients. Throughout
these contacts we urged workshop personnel to operate
only in the area of their own expertise, rather than to relate to the patients as if they were therapists.
Our contacts with personnel at the workshop took the
following forms: I) structured meetings were held to re- view patient progress and to solve problems collaboratively, 2) a member of our staff frequently worked alongside our patients in the workshop as a model for the
workshop staff and to discuss with them techniques useful in relating effectively with our patients, and 3) our staff was available on a round-the-clock basis to aid in
the handling of crises and to provide assistance in any
matter relevant to our patients. While such crisis contacts were usually initiated by a telephone call from workshop
personnel, we often found it helpful to go immediately to
the site of the problem to demonstrate our willingness to
help.
Our assistance most often took the form of consulting
with workshop personnel on how they might handle a patient rather than our directly intervening with the
patient. Repeated supportive contacts such as these gradually assured the workshop staff that we were not dumping our work on them and provided valuable opportunities for training and problem solving. The result was that
many workshop personnel became highly skilled in our
training in community living techniques, and the number
of crisis calls from this agency greatly diminished.
Modifications of these techniques of constant availability, modeling, support, and collaborative problem
solving were successfully used to gain the active cooperation of a wide variety of individuals and agencies in the
community. These included landlords, employers, social
and recreational leaders, restaurant owners, vocational
counselors, mental health workers, the staffs of local
emergency rooms, the police, and the district attorney’s
office.
Summary ofguidelines. The community treatment approach focuses directly on the patient disabilities discussed and thus adheres to the following guidelines:
In-hospital treatment, even with extremely symptomatic patients, is virtually eliminated so as not to reinforce
dependency and to prevent institutionalization.
Treatment concentrates primarily on teaching coping
skills necessary to live in the community and enjoy a rca- sonable quality of life. The learning of these skills takes
place solely in the community.
Work with families and significant others is primarily
directed toward the breaking of pathologically dependent
relationships.
Staff members relate to patients as responsible individuals and make maximal efforts to expose them to the natural contingencies of living in society.
A close relationship is maintained with an exceptional
variety of community facilities, from agencies to individuals, to ensure the consistency and continuity of our approach.
Staff members are assertive in their approach, not only
to minimize the possibility of patients dropping out of
treatment, but to maximize their engagement in rcsponsible, independent community living.
Measuring Instruments
At the time of their admission to the study, we administer the following measuring instruments to the patients
in each group:
Demographic dataform. We devised this form to collect standard demographic data on the patients’ life situation and economic status.
Short Clinical Rating Scale (19). This scale measures
symptomatology. We used a summary scale of this mea- sure, the global symptomatology rating, which is a 9-
point scale in which 0=none and 8= severe. Community adjustmentform. We devised this form to
assess the patient’s living situation, how much time he
had spent in institutions, his employment record, his
social relationships, the quality of his environment, his
subjective satisfaction with life, and what leisure-time
activities he participated in.
Family Burden Scale. At one month, the Family Burden Scale is administered to the most significant other in
the patient’s family if that person lives in Dane County.
We devised this 3-point scale to assess whether or not
the experimental approach of treating the patient in the
community places more of an emotional and economic
burden on family members than does the control approach. A score of I on this scale indicates that the
family feels no extra burden; a score of 3 indicates severe burden.
Every four months, the global symptomatology rating,
the community adjustment form, and the Family Burden
Scale are readministered.

the first 60 patients in each group during their first four

Characteristics ofthe Sample
Relevant characteristics of patients in the two treatment groups at the time of admission to the study are presented in table 1. From this table it can be seen that
the sample was relatively young, that most patients
(approximately 75 percent) were either single, separated, or divorced, and that the patients had accumulated a
substantial amount of time in psychiatric institutions
before admission to this study.
The only variable on which patients in the experimental group differed significantly from the patients in the

control group was global symptomatology: the experimental patients were somewhat more symptomatic than
the control patients. This difference is viewed as con- servative bias.
Decision To Hospitalize
Only 6 of the 60 experimental patients were hospitalized in comparison with 54 of the 60 control patients
(p<.OOI by chi-square test). The 6 experimental patients
spent a mean of 13.83 days in the hospital (SD= 15.60),
and the 54 control patients spent a mean of 22.87 days in
the hospital (SD=20.35). Ofthe 54 control patients who were hospitalized, 14 were readmitted after being discharged within the first four months of the study, representing a readmission rate of 33 percent in four months.
Living Situation
Table 2 summarizes where patients lived during their
first four months in the study. The amount of time spent
in psychiatric hospitals was, of course, strikingly different in the two groups. There was no significant difference
between the groups in the amount of time spent in mcdical or penal institutions. There was also no significant difference between the two groups in the amount of time
spent in sheltered living situations. There was, however, a
significant difference in the amount of time spent in mdcpendent settings: the experimental patients spent more
time in independent settings than the control patients.
Employment Situation
The employment situation of patients in both groups
during the first four months of study is shown in table 3.
It can be seen that experimental patients spent significantly less time unemployed and significantly more time
in sheltered employment than did control patients. There was no significant difference between groups in the
amount of time spent in competitive employment. Follow-up data will show whether or not time spent in sheltered employment leads to competitive employment.
Other Measures
As was shown in table I, both groups scored high (between “moderately” and “markedly” ill) upon entry into
the study on the global symptomatology rating. By the
end of four months patients in both groups revealed a sig-
STEIN, TEST, AND MARX
Am J Psychiatry 132:5. May 1975 521
nificant decrease in symptomatology, with no significant
difference between groups on amount of improvement.
Preliminary measures of social relationships, leisure-time
activities, quality of environment, and subjective satisfaction with life also revealed no significant differences
between groups at the end of four months.
Family Burden Scale
One month after entry into the study the burden felt by
the families of both groups was almost identical. The 18
relatives of patients in the experimental group had a mean rating of 1.89 (SD=.76), and the 16 relatives of
patients in the control group had a mean rating of 1.81
(SD= .75). At four months there was a significant de- crease in the burden felt by families of experimental
patients; their mean rating was 1.44 (SD=.70) (p<.Ol by
two-tailed t test). However, there was no such decrease in
the burden felt by control families; their mean rating re- mained 1.81 (SD=.75). These results indicate that our community treatment approach did not place excessive
stress on the families of experimental patients in com- parison with the traditional approach (p<.O5 by twotailed t test).
The relatively small numbers of 18 and 16 for the families ofexperimental and control groups, respectively, reflect the fact that a high percentage ofour patients do not
have family living near them.
DISCUSSION The above results clearly indicate that our extro-hospital model is a feasible alternative to mental hospital
treatment. While other studies have demonstrated suc- cessful alternatives to the mental hospital for selected
populations such as patients with families close-by (20-
22), we used a randomly selected group of patients
presenting for admission to a public hospital. Patients were included in the study regardless of symptomatology
and regardless of the presence or absence of social re- sources. While the longer range data currently being collected
are certainly needed to assess the overall effectiveness of
the model, the four-month data demonstrate that, in the new model, hospital stays were virtually eliminated,
thereby reducing the disruption to life, the social stigma,
and the reinforcement of dependency that result from
hospitalization. The psychiatric hospital was used less,
but there was no increase in the amount of time spent in
penal institutions by our experimental patients, and no
“mini-hospital” was created in the community. Rather,
experimental patients spent most of their time in independent living situations, and the amount of time spent in
overall productive functioning was increased. This was accomplished without reducing the individual patient’s
quality of life or his personal satisfaction with life. It is
also important to note that this was accomplished without increasing the burden felt by the patient’s family.
These results may be viewed as tautological: i.e., reduction of time in the hospital “creates” increased time in
productive community living. To some extent this is true;
however, the existence of third-rate boarding houses and
hotels crowded with discharged mental patients makes it
clear that simply being out of the hospital does not neces- sarily ensure satisfactory community functioning (23).
A cost-benefit analysis comparing the new model with
traditional treatment is in progress to determine the eco- nomic feasibility of the program. Data from the eco- nomic study as well as data regarding the future clinical
outcome of patients will be reported at a later time. Although the primary significance of the current data is in
demonstrating that the training in community living
model is a feasible alternative for patients who would
otherwise be treated in public mental hospitals, it is our hope that the follow-up data will show that this model
also enhances the long-range community adjustment of
these patients.

The Journal would like to remind authors who are particularly interested in early publication
(whether to establish priority of an idea, reveal innovative resUlts of new research, or for other
pressing reasons) of its prompt publication policy. Under this policy, short (maximum of six
double-spaced pages) manuscripts will be considered for publication in the Brief Communications section of the first available issue. These manuscripts must still undergo expert scrutiny
before being accepted, and two months must be allowed for the printing process. However, the
time required for publication of these short articles can be lessened considerably.
Authors who would like to have their manuscripts considered under this policy should indicate
this desire, as well as the reasons for it, when they submit their manuscripts.
