Abstract
Objective To evaluate the effectiveness of a crisis resolution team.
Design Randomised controlled trial.
Participants 260 residents of the inner London Borough of
Islington who were experiencing crises severe enough for
hospital admission to be considered.
Interventions Acute care including a 24 hour crisis resolution
team (experimental group), compared with standard care from
inpatient services and community mental health teams (control
group).
Main outcome measures Hospital admission and patients’
satisfaction.
Results Patients in the experimental group were less likely to be
admitted to hospital in the eight weeks after the crisis (odds ratio
0.19, 95% confidence interval 0.11 to 0.32), though compulsory
admission was not significantly reduced. A difference of 1.6
points in the mean score on the client satisfaction questionnaire
(CSQ-8) was not quite significant (P = 0.07), although it became
so after adjustment for baseline characteristics (P = 0.002).
Conclusion Crisis resolution teams can reduce hospital
admissions in mental health crises. They may also increase
satisfaction in patients, but this was an equivocal finding.
Introduction
Crisis resolution teams are intended to reduce psychiatric bed
use and provide rapid access to services.1–3 Their roles are to
assess everyone for whom acute admission is considered and,
whenever feasible, to provide intensive home treatment instead
of admission. Unlike multidisciplinary community mental health
teams, which provide continuing care for severely mentally ill
patients in most areas of the United Kingdom,4 crisis resolution
teams are available outside usual office hours. Crisis resolution
teams can offer more frequent visits than community mental
health teams: patients can usually be visited twice a day if
required. Their input is short term: once the initial crisis has
resolved, usually within a few weeks, they withdraw and community mental health teams provide longer term continuing care if
needed. They are intended to be more acceptable to service users
than hospital admission and to have a greater capacity to attend
to the social factors that contribute to many crises.1 2
Government policy mandates introduction of crisis resolution teams throughout England,3 5 but supporting evidence has
remained weak.6 Earlier studies of intensive home treatment initiated in emergencies provide only limited support7–9 as the
experimental teams in these studies continued to provide care
once the crisis had resolved. Moreover, control services did not
include teams that routinely visited patients at home. No
previous randomised trial has evaluated crisis resolution teams
in the context of a modern community mental health system,
although our recent naturalistic study suggested reduced admission rates and better patient satisfaction after their introduction.10
Methods
We tested whether involvement of a crisis resolution team in
patients’ care would result in lower admission rates within eight
weeks of a crisis and in greater satisfaction with care.
Setting
The setting was two geographical sectors in the London
Borough of Islington, where community mental health teams are
well established.4 A multidisciplinary liaison team was available
from 8 am to 10 pm in the local casualty department, and two
crisis houses, one for women only, provided alternatives to
admission. Before the introduction of crisis resolution teams,
Islington used fewer acute beds than other similarly deprived
inner London boroughs.11
Sample
All residents aged 18 to 65 who were experiencing a crisis severe
enough for mental health professionals to consider admission
were eligible.
Assignment
Recruitment to a trial during a psychiatric crisis is a challenge:
crises tend to occur unexpectedly, waiting for a researcher to
arrive and conduct an interview before formulating a treatment
plan is often unsafe and unfeasible, and patients often lack the
capacity to make informed decisions. These problems probably
account for the lack of recent randomised evaluations of crisis
services and they required us to adapt usual trial recruitment procedures in several ways. As we wanted to minimise demands made
on clinicians and patients at the time of the crisis, when patients
initially presented we sought agreement only to the experimental
intervention and not to the subsequent research interview. To
achieve a reasonably representative sample, we also needed to
design a procedure that allowed us to recruit people who lacked
decisional capacity at the time of the crisis, often transiently.
Identification of study participants was thus the task not of
researchers but of the community mental health teams, mental
health liaison team, and on-call psychiatrists and approved social
workers.. We obtained ethical approval to randomise:
x People who were willing and able to give informed consent to
randomisation and care by the crisis resolution team
x People who lacked capacity to make a decision about their
care at the time of the crisis but had received information about
the trial before it began and had not decided to opt out. Before

the trial began, 1160 people who had recently had contact with
services were given the chance to opt out in advance if they did
not want to be randomised; 100 did so
x People who lacked capacity at the time of the crisis and had
not already been informed about the trial but whose carers
assented to their entry.
Initial consent was to randomisation and receipt of the experimental intervention. We sought separate consent for the research
interview at eight weeks. People randomised to the experimental
intervention were subsequently given further written information
by the crisis resolution team staff and offered another opportunity
to refuse care from the team: for those initially lacking capacity, this
was delayed until they had recovered it.
People identified by staff in the community mental health
teams and other referring teams as meeting one of the above criteria for inclusion in the study were discussed with staff from the
crisis resolution team. If crisis resolution team staff agreed that
inclusion criteria were met, they telephoned the 24 hour randomisation service at the health services research unit, University of
Aberdeen, which allocated participants at random to the experimental or control group. The research team was notified immediately about randomisations during office hours and on the next
working day about randomisations that occurred out of hours.
People in crisis who did not meet the conditions for trial
entry received standard care without the crisis resolution teams.
In view of the complexity of these procedures, a member of the
research team was on call 24 hours throughout the first three
months of the trial to give advice.
Interventions
In the experimental group, a crisis resolution team augmented
existing acute services and aimed to assess all patients and manage them at home if feasible. Staff were available 24 hours but on
call from home after 10 pm. The control group received care
from the inpatient unit, crisis houses, and community mental
health teams.
Data collection
Baseline—As interviewing patients before randomisation was
not feasible researchers collected baseline data from staff and
clinical records as quickly as possible after randomisation. They
recorded demographic details, clinical history, and presenting
problems using structured questionnaires. They used the threshold assessment grid (TAG)12 and Health of the Nation outcome
scales (HoNOS)13 to elicit staff ratings of risks and severity of
clinical and social problems at the time of the crisis.
Primary outcome measures—We used best available information from patients, staff, and clinical records to establish whether
participants had been admitted to hospital in the eight weeks
after the crisis. Patients’ satisfaction was assessed at a research
interview with the client satisfaction questionnaire, 8 item
version (CSQ-8).14 Blinding researchers, clinicians, or patients
was not feasible.
Secondary measures—At eight weeks, we collected data on days
in hospital and crisis houses, and on compulsory detentions). At
interview, symptoms were rated with the brief psychiatric rating
scale15 and quality of life with the Manchester short assessment of
quality of life.16 Staff again made ratings on the Health of the
Nation outcome scales and also rated social functioning with the
life skills profile.17 At six months, patients were not interviewed,
but we assessed service use, ratings on the Health of the Nation
outcome scales and life skills profile, and adverse events, such as
suicide attempts and violence, using information from staff and
clinical records.
Analysis
We used data from our previous study10 for the power
calculation. We estimated that 134 participants per group would
yield 90% power to detect a 20% difference in admission rates,
while 85 per group would provide 90% power to detect a difference in satisfaction scores of half a standard deviation (3.8 points
on the CSQ-8). Analysis was on an intention to treat basis. We
calculated odds ratios and confidence intervals for categorical
variables and mean differences and confidence intervals for
quantitative data, except for bed use, for which we used
Mann-Whitney tests because data were highly skewed, even after
log transformation.
Results
Randomisation
We randomised 260 people, 135 to the experimental group and
125 to the control group. Of these, we interviewed 118 in the
experimental group (87%) and 108 in the control group (86%) at
eight weeks. The figure shows the randomisation process.

Patients excluded before randomisation
Of the people who were admitted during the recruitment period,
104 did not enter the trial (figure). We compared these people
with people in the control group who were admitted: the main
differences were that those who did not enter the trial were more
likely to be black Caribbean (21% v 5%), having their first contact
with mental health services (24% v 12%), admitted via the police
(23% v 10%), and admitted compulsorily (50% v 32%).
The other group of patients in crisis who may not have
entered the trial were those managed in the community without
referral to the trial. Unlike admissions, we had no reliable
mechanism for identifying them all. It is unlikely, however, that
large numbers of community crises associated with a significant
risk of admission were missed. In the present study, around 40
people a month per 100 000 local population either entered the
study or were admitted to hospital, bypassing the study. Our
naturalistic study identified all crises over a nine month period in
south Islington, adjacent to the present study area: there were
around 34 emergency presentations per 100 000 per month.10
Moreover, one north Islington sector was served by the same crisis resolution team as the current trial sectors but was not
involved in the trial. The crisis resolution team received around
38 referrals per 100 000 population per month from this sector
(including patients admitted immediately after assessment). All
the Islington sectors had similar service structures and
demographic characteristics, so that these recruitment rates suggest that few crises managed in the community were missed during the trial period.
We also compared characteristics of people included in our
previous naturalistic study10 and in the current study to assess the
representativeness of the current study sample. Demographic
characteristics were similar, but participants in the current study
were significantly less likely to have been compulsorily admitted
in the past two years (18% v 27%), to be rated by staff as uncooperative at initial assessment (16% v 28%), to have a diagnosis of
schizophrenia (25% v 34%) or to present with psychotic
symptoms (55% v 65%) or elevated mood (14% v 22%), and
more likely to present with depressive symptoms (59% v 42%).
This supported our impression that people who did not enter
the trial tended to be severely ill patients who went to hospital,
rather than people successfully managed at home by the
community mental health teams.
Sample characteristics
Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of the experimental
and control groups. Random allocation resulted in largely similar groups, though total scores on the Health of the Nation outcome scales were significantly higher in the control group,
reflecting higher symptom subscores.
Admissions
Patients in the experimental group were less likely than those in
the control group to be admitted during the eight weeks after the
crisis (table 2). This effect persisted six months after baseline and
when we included admissions to crisis houses. It was reflected in
fewer bed days. Over the initial eight weeks, the number needed
to treat to prevent one admission was 2.65. However, there was
no significant difference in compulsory detentions.
Satisfaction
Patients in the experimental group were slightly more satisfied
with their care (P = 0.07, table 3). After we adjusted for baseline
characteristics the difference became significant (P = 0.002).
However, baseline characteristics should be treated with caution
as they were reported by staff after randomisation had occurred:
thus adjusted results are not necessarily more valid than
unadjusted.
Secondary outcomes
Patients in the experimental group had less severe symptoms at
eight weeks, though after we adjusted for baseline characteristics
the difference was no longer significant (table 3). The adjusted
difference in the scores on the Health of the Nation outcome
scales was significant at eight weeks (better in the experimental
group) but not at six months. Other outcomes showed no clearly
significant differences.
Adverse events
By six months, two people in the experimental group had died:
one was shot by the police while he was holding hostages at
knifepoint, another died after an overdose. Two people in the
control group died of natural causes, and the coroner returned
an open verdict on one who was found dead in his flat. There
were no significant differences over six months in rates of
attempted suicide and violence or of participants losing their
jobs, becoming homeless, or being victims of violence.

Discussion
Availability of a crisis resolution team was associated with a
reduction in the admission rate at eight weeks from 59% to 22%,
indicating that the team achieved its goal of providing an
alternative to acute admission, at least in the group recruited to
the trial, among whom severely ill patients at risk of compulsory
admission were probably under-represented. The impact,
however, was mainly on voluntary admissions.
We found some evidence of an effect on satisfaction,
especially after we adjusted for baseline characteristics, though
measurement problems regarding these are discussed above.
This effect was less than we found in our previous study10 and less
than might have been expected from older controlled studies7 of
home treatment and from uncontrolled surveys indicating positive views about crisis teams.18 19 Views of both forms of treatment
were on average mildly positive. One possibility is that use of a
brief global measure failed to capture variations in views. Some
patients may also have had reservations about crisis resolution
teams, which have been criticised for lack of continuity of care.6
Clinical and social outcomes were otherwise similar, except
for some evidence of differences in scores on the Health of the
Nation outcome scales at eight weeks, which had disappeared by
six months. This lack of substantial persisting differences is not
surprising as the intervention period was brief, against a
background of longstanding mental illness and social exclusion
among many patients.
Strengths and weaknesses
The main strength of our study is that we succeeded in carrying
out a randomised trial with an adequate sample size in an emerTable 2 Use of mental health services in eight weeks and six months after psychiatric crisis according to treatment. Figures are numbers (percentages) of

gency situation, despite the considerable practical difficulties this
poses. Response rates for those included were good.
Lack of assessment before baseline is a limitation. We relied
on randomisation to produce comparable groups. The similarity
of the groups on most characteristics suggests this succeeded.
However, we do not know whether the baseline differences we
did find—for example, in scores on the Health of the Nation outcome scales)—occurred by chance or were early treatment
effects.
More important, however, was the exclusion of a substantial
group of admitted patients who were probably more disturbed
on average than the group entering the trial and of some
patients managed in the community without referral to the trial.
Such exclusions are inevitable in randomised controlled trials,
though often unreported.20 This is the reason why we conducted
a complementary before and after quasi-experimental study in
the adjacent part of Islington,10 in which we controlled for baseline variables and did not exclude any eligible patients. The fact
that both studies showed that crisis resolution teams were associated with reduced admissions after crises supports our
conclusions. While the exclusion of a more severely unwell
group may exaggerate the effect size in the current study, the
routinely collected admissions data for the study area before and
after the trial are interesting. In the 12 months before the introduction of the crisis resolution team, there were 340 admissions.
In the 12 months after the trial, when randomisation had ended
and the crisis resolution team was involved in all decisions to
admit, there were 237.
Finally, generalisability is limited by the distinctive characteristics of psychiatric patients in inner London, among whom psychosis, social isolation, substance misuse and compulsory
treatment are common.21 These characteristics, however, may
make Islington a particularly stringent test of the effectiveness of
crisis resolution teams, as achieving a reduction in bed use in this
setting is especially challenging.

What is already known on this topic
Crisis resolution teams are currently being introduced
throughout England as part of national mental health
policy
No randomised evaluation of this service model has been
carried out in a modern community mental health system
What this study adds
Crisis resolution teams can prevent some psychiatric
hospital admissions, especially voluntary ones
In this group of patients with acute mental health
emergencies, people who received care from a crisis
resolution team tended to be more satisfied with their care
