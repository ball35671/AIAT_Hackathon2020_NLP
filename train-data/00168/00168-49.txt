PRESENT RECOMMENDATIONS ca]] for influenza immunization of hospital employees who contact high-risk
patients on a yearly basis. ~-s This recommendation
is largely based on the assumption that medical personnel may transmit influenza to patients while incubating infection or working despite the presence
of infection. However, there is little information
known about the epidemiology of nosocomial influenza or whether influenza immunization of hospital
employees will decrease the occurrence of this potentially catastrophic event.
Other important benefits of influenza immunization may include reducing illness and absenteeism
among hospital personnel. However, influenza immunization of health care providers could cost millions of dollars for the vaccine, its administration,
treatment of vaccination side effects, and work absences caused by the side effects. The balance of
costs, risks, and benefits should be determined beReceived from the Department of Medicine, Divisions of General

fore beginning a mass vaccination program. Therefore, we performed a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial to determine whether
influenza immunization would decrease illness and
absenteeism among hospital employees. Our specific questions were: 1) What are the adverse reactions associated with influenza immunization of hospital employees? 2) Is there an increase in
absenteeism immediately after injection attributable to the vaccine? 3) Does influenza immunization
of hospital employees decrease the incidence, duration, or severity of illness during the influenza season? 4) Does influenza immunization reduce absenteeism caused by illness during the influenza
season? The study was designed to assess the costs,
risks, and benefits (impact on absenteeism and illness) of influenza immunization and not to determine
the efficacy of the vaccine through virologic
confirmation.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Patient Population
Any full-time Cedars - Sinai Medical Center employee between the ages of 21 and 65 years was
eligible for entry into the study. Reasons for exclusion included pregnancy, an egg allergy, a prior
adverse reaction to the vaccine, or a chronic debilitating disease. Chronic debilitating diseases included illnesses associated with increased medical
risks of influenza-related complications as specified
by the Immunization Practices Advisory Committee
of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). ~ The study
was approved by the Human Subjects Protection
committee at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. Informed consent was obtained after the study procedure was explained to each subject.
Study Design
Participants were assigned using a randomnumber generator to receive either the influenza
vaccine (0.5 nfl of inactivated influenza split-viTus
supplied by Squibb-Connaught) or placebo (0.5 ml
of normal saline). The vaccine contained 15 fig each
of A/Chfle/1/83(H1N1), A/Phillipines/2/82(H3N2),
and B/USSR/100/83 hemagglutinin antigens in 
JOURNAL OF GENERAL INTERNAL MEDICINE, Volume 3 (Jan/Feb). 1988 33
each 0.5 ml. All injections were given intramuscularly between November 18 and December 13, 1985.
A demographic questionnaire that described personal characteristics, medical history, immunization
history, and smoking history was completed by each
participant. Subjects were asked to forego additional influenza immunization for one year and to
proceed with concurrent therapies for any illnesses
they might incur independent of entry into the study.
Participants were instructed to take their temperatures every eight hours after the onset of influenzalike illnesses and to keep diaries of symptoms and
illness durations. The injection was given and the
data were collected in a double-blind manner. One
week after entry into the study, participants completed a questionnaire that described adverse reactions to the injection. The study code was disclosed
to the investigators and interviewers only after the
data collection was completed.
Epidemic influenza began in the United States
in January 1986, peaked in early February 1986, and
ended in early April 1986. 4 Active influenza surveillance was conducted in our community by the Los
Angeles County Department of Health Services. In
our region, significant influenza activity began in
December 1985 and concluded in February 1986
(personal communication, Frank Sorvillo, Los Angeles County Department of Health Services, 1985-
1986). Thirty-four people in our community, 17 of
whom were adults, had laboratory-confirmed influenza. During the two-month period corresponding to
the study, surveillance detected 14 influenza virus
and two respiratory syncytial virus infections among
adults in our community. Most of the influenza infections among adults and children were caused by
type B, 75.7% nationally and 56% locally. 4
Participants were contacted at monthly intervals and asked about the occurrence of influenzalike illness by trained interviewers using an explicit
closed-end questionnaire. Two telephone interviews were performed and information was collected for illnesses occurring between December 15,
1985, and February 20, 1986, a period corresponding to the presence of documented influenza activity
in our community. Subjects were asked specifically
about the occurrence of any influenza-like illness,
duration of illness, severity of illness, use of antipyretics, and symptoms. An influenza-like illness was
defined by the CDC case definition of clinical influenza, which was a documented temperature greater
than 100°F and at least the symptoms of cough or
sore throat. 4 Severity of illness was scored using a
10-point scale (10 most severe). If the subject had
more than one illness, the highest severity of illness
was included in the analysis. Sick absences occurring during the injection period (November 18 to December 13, 1985) were collected using computerized

time card data. Absences caused by illness occurring during the period of influenza activity (December 15, 1985, to February 20, 1986) were also
recorded.
Statistical Methods
Discrete data were analyzed using a chi-square
test with Yates' correction and normally distributed
continuous data using Student's t test. Skewed continuous data (duration of illness, severity of illness,
and absenteeism) were analyzed using the MannWhitney Utest. Any p value:less than 0.05 was considered significant. The probability of a beta error
was calculated using the method described by
Fleiss. s
RESULTS
One hundred and eighty-one employees entered the study between November 18, 1985, and
December 13, 1985. Two employees were excluded
from analysis because they left employment at the
medical center prior to the completion of the study. In
total, 91 subjects received the influenza vaccine and
88 received the placebo. There were no meaningful
differences in the distribution of data when comparing the vaccine and placebo groups for age, gender,
race, previous influenza immunization history,
smoking history, patient contact, and the presence of
a minor medical problem (Table 1). A minor medical
problem was defined as any medical condition that
did not meet the exclusion criteria.
Adverse Reactions
A questionnaire describing adverse reactions to
the injection was completed by 60% of subjects one
week after the injection. Erythema at the site of injection was experienced by 11% of those who received the vaccine, as compared with 0% of those
who received the placebo (p (0.05). Significant pain
at the injection site was experienced by 51% of those
