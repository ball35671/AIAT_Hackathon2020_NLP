ABSTRACT. A double-blind field trial was performed comparing a subunit influenza vaccine
(A/Victoria/7S and D/Hongkong/73) with placebo. A good protection against influenza was
induced by the vaccine. On the basis of serological determinations (enzyme immunoassay, EIA)
the incidences of influenza A and D infections were reduced within a period from 3 weeks up to S
months after the vaccination by 88 and 68%, respectively. Three weeks after the vaccination
79% of the vaccinees had acquired protective serum antibody levels (;;'32 x 10" by EIA) against
influenza A and 62 % against influenza D, while in the control subjects protective antibody levels
were measured in frequencies from 4 to 13% in subsequent serum samples. With a few exceptions antibody levels were still present in S-month samples. Side effects were recorded within
the first 3 days following the vaccination. Some minor symptoms like redness and tenderness
at the vaccination site and muscle ache were reported more frequently by the vaccinees than
by the controls, but no more harmful systemic reactions.
INTRODUCTION
Inactivated influenza virus vaccines contain either
whole viruses or a mixture of antigens obtained by
disrupting the virus particles (split vaccines). Recently, purified subunit vaccines have been described in which the envelope proteins are separated from the nucleoproteins(l, 2). All vaccines elicit
a rise in serum antibodies against the haemagglutinin and neuraminidase antigens (8, 9, 14). Previous
studies have shown that subunit vaccines cause
fewer side effects than whole virus vaccines (10, 12,
13, 14). However, there is still little direct evidence
on the efficacy of subunit vaccines in preventing
naturally acquired influenza (6, 7). Therefore, a
double-blind field trial was conducted in adult volunteers to compare the efficacy of a subunit vaccine
with placebo in prevention ofserologically diagnosable influenza A and B infections. From the results
the protection against influenza A and B afforded by
the vaccination as well as the side effects of the
vaccination were assessed.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Design ofthe trial
307 adult volunteers were randomly divided into two
groups without regard to sex or age. One of the groups
consisting of 155 individuals, received placebo (the
medium in which the vaccine was dispersed). The other
group consisting of 152 individuals, was given Sandovac"
(Sandoz Ltd.), a bivalent subunit influenza vaccine containing 1200 IU of strain A/Victoria/3/75 (H3N2) antigen
and 800 IU of B/Hongkong/8/73 antigen in 0.5 ml of phosphate buffered saline. The subunit components, the
proteins of the viral envelope, haemagglutinin and
neuraminidase had been solubilized by treatment with
cetyl trimethylammonium bromide (1,2). The vaccine and
the placebo were injected subcutaneously into the arm.
Side effects within the first 3 days following the vaccination were reported in a questionnaire completed by each
individual.
Blood samples were collected prior to the vaccination,
and 3 weeks and 5 months after the vaccination in order to
evaluate the antibody response to the vaccination and the
incidence of influenza A and B infections during the
course of the study. A complete series of 3 consecutive
blood samples was received from 144 individuals in the
vaccine group and 148 in the placebo group (95% in both
groups) and they were included in the statistical analysis.
Antibody determination
Influenza A and B serology was done by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) with some minor modifications described by Leinikki et al. (15). Influenza A/Victoria/3/75
(H3N2) and influenza B/Hongkong/8/73 ELISA antigens
were from Orion Diagnostica (Mankkaa, Finland). The
alkaline phosphatase conjugated antihuman IgG was also
from Orion Diagnostica. The serum samples were diluted
1: 50, 1: 500 and I : 5 000 in disposable 9-channel cuvettes
(Finnpipette-Labsystems, Helsinki). The positive standard serum was diluted in halflogarithm steps beginning at
I : 10. The color reactions were read by a FP-9 photometer
(Labsystems, Helsinki).
Each test series included I positive standard serum and
2 negative control sera. All 3 serum samples from one

Statistical methods
The percentage of side effects and the incidence of infections in the two groups were tested for significant differences using 2X2-contingency tables. Differences between
logarithms of titres were analyzed by the Mann-Whitneyindividual were tested in the same test series and in the
same 9-channel cuvette block.
The results are given as endpoint titres. The endpoint is
the point where the linear portion of the dilution curve has
an absorbance twice that of the negative standard sera.
The linear portion of the curve for the positive standard
serum is used as a standard linear for the serum samples to
be tested (Fig. I).

solid line represents the positive standard serum. The
dotted line represents a line parallel to the linear portion

the negative serum its abscissa value is taken as the endpoint titre.
test, and titre increases by the paired t-test when the
distribution could be accepted as approximately normal.
Otherwise, Wilcoxon's test for paired samples was used.
Serum antibody response to vaccination
and protection against influenza A
and B infections
Three weeks postvaccination 4-fold or greater increases in antibody titres were noticed against influenza A in 82% and against influenza B in 78%.
The antibody titres against both influenza A and
influenza B rose significantly higher (p<O.OOI) in
those receiving vaccine than in the control subjects
(geometric mean titres 59.4xl02 versus 8.3xI02 ,
and 35.8x 102 versus 6.3>< 102 , respectively) (Tables
III and IV). The distribution of the postvaccination
titres are presented in Tables I and II.
The incidences of influenza A and B infections
from 3 weeks to 5 months postvaccination were
assessed by serum antibody determinations. A 4-
fold or greater increase in antibody levels between
the 3-week and 5-month samples was considered as
a criterion of probable infection. Vaccination gave
good protection against both influenza A and influenza B (Tables I and 11). Only 2/144 vaccinated
subjects had diagnostic influenza A infection, while
17/148 control subjects were shown to have had
such infection (p<O.OOI). Five of the vaccinated
subjects as against 16 of the control subjects had
developed serologically confirmed influenza B infection ,(p =0.02). Thus, an 88% reduction in the
incidence of influenza A and a 68% reduction in
that of influenza B was observed.

The incidence of influenza A and B infections
seemed to be clearly dependent on the postvaccination antibody levels measured by the EIA
technique. None of the subjects with antibody titres
;;.:32 x I()2 had serologically confirmed influenza A
or B. At an antibody level of 16x 102 the incidences
of infection were 5 %, while below that titre the
incidences of both influenza A and influenza B were
about 15% in both control and vaccinated subjects
(Tables I and II).
From the sequential serum samples the proportion of the subjects with protective antibody levels
prior to vaccination and 3 weeks as well as 5 months
postvaccination could be analysed. Of the control
subjects 4-13 % had protective influenza A antibody levels (;;':32) in various samples, after excluding the subjects with probable infection during the
study. 79 and 75% of the vaccinated subjects had
protective antibody levels 3 weeks and 5 months
postvaccination (Table III). A protective antibody
level (;;.:32) against influenza B virus was detected in
4-8% of the control subjects using all 3 samples,
while 62 and 58% of the vaccinated subjects had
protective antibody levels in their 3-week and 5-
month samples (Table IV). Protective antibody
levels were thus detected 6-7 times more frequently
in those receiving vaccine than in the controls.
These figures are in good agreement with the observed reduction of serologically determined infection rates.

(p<O.OOI); and muscle ache 17 versus 8%
(p<O.OOI) (Table V). The frequency of other possible side effects registered, fever and tenderness of
axillary glands and absence from work, did not differ significantly between the two groups.
Large scale influenza prophylaxis has been mainly
attempted by using inactivated whole virus vaccines. Disadvantages of these vaccines are frequent
adverse reactions either locally or systemically
which limit the use of the vaccines. The reactivity
of these vaccines may partly be due to non viral
impurities or nonimmunogenic viral components.
Thus, results with whole virus vaccines might be
improved only by using purified immunogenic viral
subunits, haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase
(N) as vaccines.
In the present double-blind field trial a bivalent
subunit vaccine was used. The vaccine contained
selectively solubilized (I, 2) HA and N components. A single injection was shown to cause a good
antibody response to both viral components. The
rise in average geometric mean titre against A/Victoria was 7.2-fold and 4-fold rises in antibody levels
were measured in 82% of the subjects. The rise of
geometric mean titre against B/Hongkong was 5.6-
fold still providing 4-fold rises in antibody levels in
78 % of the subjects. These figures are consistent
with the antibody response to this type of subunit
vaccine measured in previous studies (10, II, 12,
13, 14, 16), where the vaccine has been demonstrated to have good immunogenicity also in
children.
The epidemics occurring during the present study
were particularly favourable for evaluating the protection afforded by the vaccination against both
influenza A and B. The vaccinations were performed in the period December 15-23, 1976;
epidemics of both influenza A and influenza B began in Finland in mid-February 1977. Both the
epidemics peaked at the beginning of April and continued until June. More than 90% of the serological
diagnoses regarding both A and B type influenza
were made in the Helsinki area prior to the time of
collecting the third serum sample. The antibodies of
3-week and 5-month samples should thus very well
reflect the infection rate.
Protection afforded by influenza vaccinations
may be variable. Sometimes, protection up to 80-
100% has been reported (5, 6, 7,17,18), while some
authors have observed only minimal or no effect at

all attributable to the vaccination (6). Assuming that
the antibody rises between the second and the third
serum samples provide the diagnosis of influenza
during the observation period, the protection rates
for influenza A (88%) and for influenza B (68%) are
comparable with the best results obtained in several
trials with whole virus influenza vaccines (5, 17,
18).
The frequencies of adverse reactions recorded
were somewhat higher than those in previous
studies with the same vaccine (10, 11, 12, 13, 14).
However, the side effects were mostly only mild
local reactions, whilst more harmful general
symptoms were not reported more often by the
vaccinated subjects than by the control group. In
studies with whole virus vaccines various types of
systemic reaction including fever have usually been
observed with much greater frequency-up to 20-
40% (3, 4,18). The improved reactogenicity of this
subunit vaccine as compared to whole virus vaccines has also been observed in children (14).
The conclusion is that a purified subunit influenza vaccine of the type used in this study is an
efficient immunogen for adults, providing good
antibody stimulation. Protection against both influenza A and influenza B is evidently as good as
with whole virus vaccines. Because of the low incidence of side effects the antigen content of the
vaccine could perhaps be raised higher than in
whole virus vaccines. All these criteria favour the
view that the subunit vaccine used in this study is a
suitable alternative for large scale influenza vaccinations. While the protection afforded by a vaccine
probably greatly depends on the immunity prevailing in the population prior to vaccination, further
clinical trials with subunit vaccine are indicated during epidemics caused by new influenza strains.
