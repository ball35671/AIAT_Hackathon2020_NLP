Numerous organizations use performance measures to monitor the
quality of care provided for a variety of clinical conditions. An
appraisal of the evidence underlying such performance measures
has never been reported. Our objective was to estimate the effects of
interventions recommended by performance measures and to determine the quality of evidence from which those estimates derive,
using the Joint Commission and the Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Services’ performance measures for community-acquired
pneumonia (CAP) as examples. We performed systematic reviews of
the literature to identify evidence related to the performance
measures for CAP. Metaanalyses were then performed to estimate
the absolute and relative effects of the interventions recommended
by the performance measures. The Grading Recommendations,
Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system was used to
determine the quality of evidence. The estimated effects favored
the interventions recommended by five of the six performance
measures. These included pneumococcal vaccination (incidence of
pneumococcal pneumonia: relative risk [RR], 0.43; 95% confidence
interval [CI], 0.24–0.75), blood cultures, antibiotic administration
within 6 hours, use of a guideline-compliant antibiotic regimen, and
influenza vaccination (incidence of symptomatic influenza: RR, 0.30;
95% CI, 0.22–0.40). However, among these performance measures,
only influenza vaccination was supported by high-quality evidence.
One-step smoking cessation counseling was contradicted by moderate-quality evidence (smoking quit rate: RR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.90–
1.22). The evidence supporting performance measures is frequently
not of high quality and occasionally contradictory.

Performance measures have been developed by many organizations to monitor the quality of care rendered for a variety of
clinical conditions (1). The goal of performance measures is to
provide an incentive for clinicians and healthcare organizations
to improve the quality of care that they deliver (2).
A performance measure can be considered a recommendation to use an intervention in a specific patient population.
The decision to recommend an intervention is influenced by
several factors, including the balance of desirable and undesirable consequences, the quality of evidence, patient values and
preferences related to the intervention and outcomes, and
resource use (3, 4). When consideration of these factors indicates that implementation of the recommendation will lead to
greater benefit than downsides, a strong recommendation is
warranted. This requires a reasonable degree of certainty about
the desirable and undesirable effects of the intervention.
Performance measures should primarily be based on strong
recommendations rather than weak recommendations. Performance measures related to weak recommendations (i.e., alternative actions are reasonable if the decision-making process
accounts for the reasons of the alternative action) require substantially more debate during development and implementation
because either there is less certainty about the balance of desirable and undesirable effects of an intervention or patient
values and preferences exert greater influence on decisions.
Certainty about the balance of desirable and undesirable
consequences of an intervention is directly influenced by the
quality of evidence. The greatest certainty exists when the
estimated effects are derived from high-quality evidence, whereas
less certainty exists when the estimated effects are derived from
lower-quality evidence. Thus, performance measures should be
supported by the highest possible level of clinical evidence or by
transparent descriptions of the other factors that led to the
selection of the performance measures, such as patient values,
preferences, and resource considerations (2). Although these
latter three factors may not be routinely or adequately considered during the development of some performance measures, it
is reasonable to assume that those who develop performance
measures routinely evaluate the quality of evidence and the
balance of the benefits and harms.
Performance measures and the evidence supporting them
have not been well studied. The purpose of our study was to
estimate the effects of the interventions recommended by
performance measures and to determine the quality of evidence
from which those estimates were derived. We chose the Joint
Commission and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
Services’ performance measures (i.e., National Hospital Quality
Measures) for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) as an
illustrative set of performance measures.
METHODS
Performance Measures
We identified updated versions of the major performance measures for
patients admitted with CAP from version 3.1 of the Specification
Manual for National Hospital Quality Measures (1). They included
recommendations for pneumococcal vaccination, blood cultures, onestep smoking cessation counseling, antibiotics within 6 hours, use of
guideline-compliant antibiotics, and influenza vaccination. Each is
described in detail in the RESULTS section.
Data Sources and Searches
Systematic reviews were performed for each performance measure
using a two-step approach. The first step consisted of one of the
investigators searching Medline (via PubMed), the Cochrane Central
Register of Controlled Trials, the Cochrane Database of Systematic
(Received in original form September 10, 2010; accepted in final form January 14, 2011)

Reviews, and Google Scholar for randomized trials (see Table E1 in the
online supplement). If no eligible randomized trials were identified,
a second step was used that was virtually identical to the first, except
observational studies (i.e., cohort studies and case-control studies)
were sought (Table E2). In addition to the electronic database
searches, the bibliographies of published metaanalyses, selected
studies, and the Specification Manual for National Hospital Quality
Measures were reviewed for potentially eligible studies (1). The
electronic database searches included all dates from the beginning of
the database through April 15, 2010.
Study Selection
For the performance measures recommending pneumococcal vaccination, smoking cessation counseling, and influenza vaccination, studies
were selected if they compared the intervention to either placebo or no
intervention and measured patient-important outcomes. For the performance measures recommending blood cultures, antibiotics within
6 hours, and guideline-compliant antibiotics, the same selection criteria
were used but the patients had to be hospitalized with CAP.
Data Extraction and Quality Assessment
For each selected study, one of the investigators extracted data from
the published article regarding the study design, participant characteristics, outcome measures, and frequency of events. Occasionally, the
event data could not be extracted because either the study could not be
located or the study did not report event data. When this occurred, an
attempt was made to extract event data from published metaanalyses
that had included the study. When this secondary approach also failed
to identify event data, we could not calculate our own estimated effects
and we instead relied on the effects reported by the original studies to
inform our judgments.
Data Synthesis and Analysis
For each performance measure whose systematic review identified
multiple relevant studies, one investigator performed metaanalyses
to estimate the absolute and relative effects of the recommended
intervention. Metaanalyses were conducted with Review Manager
(RevMan) 5.0, using a random effects model with relative risk as the
measure of effect (5).
Once the estimated effects of the recommended intervention were
calculated, the two investigators appraised the quality of evidence
using the Grading, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation
(GRADE) approach. Randomized trials began with the assumption
of high-quality evidence, whereas well-done observational studies
began with an assumption of low-quality evidence. The quality of
evidence was downgraded or upgraded according to criteria shown
in Table E3 (3, 6). Discussion and consensus were used to arrive at
a final quality assessment. Evidence tables were constructed using
GRADEpro (7).
RESULTS
Pneumococcal Vaccination
The pneumococcal vaccination performance measure determines the proportion of patients, aged 65 years or older,
hospitalized with CAP who were screened for pneumococcal
vaccine status and then vaccinated before discharge, if indicated
(1). Our systematic review identified 15 randomized trials that
met our inclusion criteria (i.e., compared pneumococcal vaccination to either placebo or no vaccination and measured
patient-important outcomes) (Figure E1).
Metaanalyses of the randomized trials found that pneumococcal vaccination decreased the incidence of pneumococcal
pneumonia (relative risk [RR], 0.43; 95% confidence interval
[CI], 0.24–0.75), the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease
(RR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.21–0.98), and mortality due to pneumonia
(RR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.46–1.09), although the third outcome was
not statistically significant (Table 1). The absolute effects were
small (0.1–0.6%) for all of the outcomes due to low baseline
risks. Prior metaanalyses have similarly found either small or no
absolute benefits from pneumococcal vaccination (8–14).
The quality of evidence supporting the performance measure
(a recommendation for pneumococcal vaccination) was very
low for all of the outcomes. There were multiple randomized
trials, but their results were inconsistent (most of trials detected
a relative benefit, but several found no effect or harm) and their
populations were indirectly related to the performance measure’s target population. Sources of indirectness included the
clinical context (most of the trials did not include patients who
were recovering from an infection, but the performance measure targets adults who are recovering from CAP), age (most of
the trials included adults of all ages, but the performance
measure targets only adults who are > 65 years old), and
comorbidity (most of the evidence is from patients without
significant comorbidities, but the performance measure is also
intended for patients with comorbidities) (Table 1). This indirectness may be important because there are data that suggest
that pneumococcal vaccination may be less effective among the
elderly, patients who were recently infected, and patients with
comorbidities (8–10, 12, 15, 16).
Blood Cultures
This performance measure determines the proportion of adult
ICU patients transferred or admitted to the ICU within 24
hours of hospital arrival with CAP who had blood cultures performed within the 24 hours before or after hospital arrival (1).
Our systematic review identified two retrospective cohort studies
that met our inclusion criteria (i.e., enrolled patients hospitalized with CAP, compared those who had blood cultures performed to those who had not, and measured patient-important
outcomes) (Figure E1) (17, 18). Metaanalyses were not performed because the studies did not report event data.
Blood cultures were associated with an increased likelihood
of being clinically stable at 48 hours in the only study that
looked at this outcome (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.62; 95% CI,
1.33–2.33) (17). The studies also found a reduction in the
relative risk of mortality among patients who had blood cultures
performed (adjusted OR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.36–2.07 [17]; and
adjusted OR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.81–1.00 [18]), although both failed
to achieve statistical significance.
The quality of the evidence supporting the performance
measure (a recommendation for blood cultures) was very low
for both outcomes. For clinical stability at 48 hours, there was
an observational study, but its population was indirectly related
to the performance measure’s target population (the study
included many non-ICU patients, but the target population is
ICU patients). For mortality, there were two observational
studies, but their estimates were imprecise, there was a risk of
bias (confounding by indication), and the populations were
indirectly related to the performance measure’s target population (one study included only elderly patients and both studies
included non-ICU patients).
Smoking Cessation
The smoking cessation performance measure determines the
proportion of adult patients with CAP and a history of smoking
cigarettes any time during the prior year who were given
smoking cessation advice or counseling during their hospitalization (1). Our systematic review identified 10 randomized trials
that met our inclusion criteria (i.e., they compared inpatient
smoking cessation advice to no smoking cessation intervention
and measured patient-important outcomes) (Figure E1).
A metaanalysis of these trials found that inpatient smoking
cessation advice without outpatient follow-up did not improve
Pulmonary Perspective 1455
the smoking quit rate (RR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.90–1.22), contradicting the performance measure (a recommendation for inpatient smoking cessation advice). The quality of evidence was
moderate because there were multiple randomized trials, but
their estimates of effect were imprecise (Table 2). Our results
are similar to a prior metaanalysis that included many of the
same studies (19).
Antibiotics within 6 Hours
The antibiotic timing performance measure determines the
proportion of adult patients with CAP who received their first
dose of antibiotics within 6 hours of hospital arrival (1). A
threshold of 4 hours was used in previous versions of the
performance measure, but the threshold was changed to 6 hours
amid reports of increased misdiagnosis and inappropriate antibiotic use after implementation of the 4-hour threshold (20–27).
We reviewed the evidence underlying the prior performance
measure (antibiotics within 4 hours) in response to our reviewers and found that the estimated effects were inconsistent.
Two observational studies found that the initiation of antibiotics
within 4 hours was associated with reduced mortality (28, 29),
one observational study reported a possible benefit (i.e., mortality decreased, but the 4-hour threshold was only one of
a bundle of interventions and the study did not analyze each

* Inconsistency: We downgraded for inconsistency because our metaanalysis of the 10 randomized trials found a severe amount of heterogeneity (I2 5 70%, P 5
0.0004). In addition, visual inspection of the relative risks on the Forrest plot from our metaanalysis revealed five studies with a relative benefit, four studies with little or
no relative benefit, and one study with relative harm. † Indirectness: The performance measure is intended for patients who are aged 65 years or older and recovering from community-acquired pneumonia, but the
evidence presented here is from adults of all ages who were not recovering from an infection. We downgraded for indirectness of the population because some data
suggest that the pneumococcal vaccine may be less effective among the elderly, patients with comorbidity, and patients who are currently or were recently infected. ‡ Imprecision: We did not downgrade for imprecision because we already downgraded for inconsistency, which is partially related to the wide CI of the relative effect.
We also note that the absolute effects are small and compatible with a small benefit (absolute risk reduction of 0.7% for the upper limit of the confidence interval). x Inconsistency: Visual inspection of the Forrest plot from our metaanalysis revealed seven studies with a relative benefit, five studies with little or no relative benefit,
and two studies with relative harm. In addition, we found a large amount of heterogeneity (I2 5 74%, P , 0.00001).

intervention separately) (30), and three observational studies
found no improvement in clinical outcomes (20, 21, 31).
Our systematic review targeted evidence related to the
current performance measure (antibiotics within 6 hours). The
review did not identify any studies that met our inclusion criteria
(i.e., enrolled patients with CAP, compared an initial antibiotic
dose within 6 hours to a later antibiotic dose, and measured
patient-important outcomes); therefore, we extracted data from
studies that described the relationship of an outcome to the duration until the initial antibiotic dose, over a range of durations.
We identified three such retrospective cohort studies (Figure E1).
Metaanalyses were not performed because some studies did
not report event data. However, the studies found that the
administration of an initial antibiotic dose within 6 hours was
associated with a lower likelihood of having a prolonged
hospital stay (RR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.19–0.48 [32]) (Table 3). It
was also associated with decreased mortality (adjusted OR,
0.84; 95% CI, 0.73–0.95 [33] and adjusted OR, 0.93; 95% CI,
0.85–1.02 [18]), although the latter study was not statistically
significant.
The quality of the evidence supporting the performance
measure (a recommendation to begin antibiotics within 6 hours)
depended upon the outcome (Table 3). For mortality, there was
very low-quality evidence: two observational studies with
a dose–response gradient, but a serious risk of bias and
imprecise estimates. For the incidence of a prolonged hospital
stay, there was low-quality evidence: an observational study
with a large effect but serious risk of bias.
Guideline-Compliant Antibiotics
The antibiotic selection performance measure determines the
proportion of adult patients with CAP who received an initial
antibiotic regimen consistent with current guidelines during the
first 24 hours of their hospitalization (1). Acceptable regimens
are listed in the Specification Manual for National Hospital
Quality Measures (1) and are consistent with the 2007 Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA)/American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines for CAP (34).
Our systematic review identified two retrospective cohort
studies that met our inclusion criteria (i.e., enrolled patients
with CAP, compared antibiotic regimens that were consistent
with the 2007 IDSA/ATS guidelines to regimens that were not,
and measured patient-important outcomes). Given both the
paucity of data and the fact that the 2007 IDSA/ATS guidelines
and the 2001 ATS guidelines (35) recommend similar antibiotic
regimens, we broadened our selection criteria and repeated the
systematic review. We selected studies that compared antibiotic
regimens that were consistent with either the 2007 IDSA/ATS
guidelines or the 2001 ATS guidelines to regimens that were
not. Our repeat systematic review identified six observational
studies (Figure E1) (36–41).
Metaanalyses were not performed because several studies
did not report event data. However, the studies consistently
found that a guideline-compliant antibiotic regimen was associated with decreased mortality: RR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.35–0.60
(36); adjusted OR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.47–0.61 (37); adjusted OR,
0.69; 95% CI, 0.25–1.94 (38); adjusted OR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.15–
0.95 (39); adjusted RR, 0.43, P 5 0.04 (40); and adjusted OR,
0.18; 95% CI, 0.06–0.5 (41) (Table 4).
The quality of evidence supporting the performance measure
(a recommendation to use a guideline-consistent antibiotic
regimen) was moderate (Table 4). There were multiple observational studies that were strengthened by a large effect.
Influenza Vaccination
The influenza vaccination performance measure determines the
proportion of patients, aged 50 years and older, hospitalized
with CAP during the months of October through March, who

* Early antibiotic therapy may be a marker of a more aggressive approach to initial care. Thus, cointerventions, rather than antibiotics within 6 hours, may be
responsible for the effects measured. † Indirectness: The performance measure is for all adults, but the studies were primarily conducted in patients more than 65 years old. Nevertheless, we did not
downgrade the quality of evidence for indirectness because we could think of no reason that advanced age would mislead us about the true impact of early antibiotic
therapy. ‡ Imprecision: Assuming that a 1% absolute risk reduction in mortality would prompt most clinicians to administer the first antibiotic dose within 6 hours (threshold
number needed to treat 5 100), the upper and lower limits of the CIs in both studies indicate opposite clinical decisions. x Dose–response gradient: Both studies found that earlier antibiotic administration was associated with lower mortality over a range of approximately 2 to 8 hours.

were screened for influenza vaccine status and then vaccinated
before discharge, if indicated (1). Our systematic review identified 26 randomized trials that met our inclusion criteria (i.e.,
compared influenza vaccination to no influenza and measured
patient-important outcomes) (Figure E1). Metaanalyses of
these trials found that influenza vaccination decreased the
incidence of both laboratory-confirmed cases of symptomatic
influenza (RR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.22–0.40) and influenza-like
illnesses (RR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.67–0.82) (Table 4). Our findings
are consistent with previous metaanalyses (42–44).
The quality of evidence supporting the performance measure
(a recommendation for influenza vaccination) varied according
to the outcome (Table 5). For laboratory-confirmed cases of
symptomatic influenza, the quality of evidence was high because
there were numerous randomized trials with a large effect. For
influenza-like illnesses, the quality of evidence was moderate
because the randomized trials had inconsistent results (most
trials found a benefit, but several found no effect).
DISCUSSION
The purpose of our study was to systematically evaluate the
evidence underlying performance measures. Our results suggest
that the estimated effect usually favors the intervention that is

1458 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF RESPIRATORY AND CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE VOL 183 2011
recommended by the performance measure, but the evidence is
frequently not high quality. This implies that there is uncertainty about the balance of desirable and undesirable effects of
the intervention. We believe that when such uncertainty exists,
there should be other compelling factors that favor the intervention if it is going to be recommended by a performance measure (3,
45). These factors may include patient values and preferences as
they pertain to the intervention and outcomes as well as resource
use (3, 4). It is possible that these factors implicitly influence the
development of performance measures, but we suggest that they
be stated explicitly and transparently for those who are being
evaluated on the basis of the performance measures.
We chose the Joint Commission and the Centers for
Medicaid and Medicare Services’ performance measures for
CAP as an illustrative set of performance measures (1). We
believe that recommendations for influenza vaccination and
guideline-compliant antibiotics are reasonable performance
measures. Influenza vaccination has a large effect and is
supported by high-quality evidence (Table 5), whereas the use
of a guideline-compliant antibiotic regimen also has a large
effect and is supported by moderate-quality evidence (Table 4).
Although it would be ideal if the guideline-compliant antibiotic
performance measure was supported by high-quality evidence,
any uncertainty that exists about the ratio of desirable and
undesirable effects seems to be superseded by the potential for
major patient-important benefits, the implicit distribution of
values and preferences, and the limited resource requirements.
Specifically, the potential desirable effects of administering
guideline-compliant antibiotics (decrease in mortality) far exceeds both the potential undesirable effects (antibiotic side
effects) and the resource requirements (cost of the antibiotic) if
administered to appropriate patients. Thus, it is likely that most
patients would choose to receive guideline-compliant antibiotics.
In contrast to the recommendations for influenza vaccination
and guideline-compliant antibiotics, we believe that the rationale for the recommendations for pneumococcal vaccination,
antibiotics within 6 hours, blood cultures, and one-step inpatient
smoking cessation counseling is elusive and either reconsideration or further description by the sponsoring organizations is
warranted.
With respect to the recommendation for pneumococcal
vaccination, the finding that pneumococcal vaccination decreases pneumococcal pneumonia and invasive pneumococcal
disease is supported by very low-quality evidence, suggesting
uncertainty about the presence and magnitude of the estimated
effect. Even if pneumococcal vaccination is beneficial, the
magnitude by which pneumococcal vaccination decreases pneumococcal pneumonia and invasive pneumococcal disease is
probably extremely small due to the low baseline risk. Based
on randomized trials, this absolute risk reduction may be as low
as 0.1 to 0.6% (Table 1). Patients, clinicians, and healthcare
organizations may reasonably decide that the small benefits of
pneumococcal vaccination do not outweigh its burdens and
costs. It can be argued that the benefits may be larger among the
elderly patients for whom the performance measure is intended,
because they are at the highest risk for complications from
pneumococcal infection. However, this assumes that pneumococcal vaccination is effective in elderly patients who are
recovering from CAP, which cannot be confirmed due to
conflicting data (8–10, 12, 15, 16).
With respect to the recommendation for antibiotics within 6
hours of hospital arrival, the relevant evidence is low or very
low quality depending on the outcome, meaning that we have
little confidence in the direction and magnitude of the estimated
effects. Thus, the balance of potential desirable effects (decreased mortality, decreased likelihood of a prolonged hospital
stay) and undesirable effects (increased misdiagnosis, inappropriate antibiotic use) is uncertain. It seems likely that early
antibiotics are beneficial to some patients (e.g., patients with
sepsis due to CAP), but not others (e.g., patients whose
diagnosis is uncertain). This argues against the use of antibiotics
within 6 hours as a performance measure, because interventions
recommended by performance measures should routinely benefit the vast majority of the patients for whom the performance
measure is intended.
With respect to the recommendation to draw blood cultures
from patients admitted to an ICU, the evidence for performing
blood cultures in patients with CAP is very low quality. This
means that there is uncertainty about the presence and magnitude of the estimated benefits of blood cultures. It may be argued
that blood cultures should be performed because positive blood
cultures frequently affect empiric therapy (1). However, citing
the impact of positive blood cultures overestimates the importance of performing a blood culture, because relatively few blood
cultures are positive even among ICU patients (46). It also
assumes that most changes in empiric therapy represent optimization of therapy, which may be incorrect (47). The possibility
that clinical benefits are associated with performing blood
cultures and that these benefits are not due to the optimization
of antimicrobial therapy suggests that performing blood cultures
is merely a surrogate for other interventions that improve outcomes (e.g., more aggressive or protocol-guided care).
With respect to the recommendation for inpatient smoking
cessation counseling, we found moderate-quality evidence
suggesting that inpatient smoking cessation counseling alone
does not improve the smoking quit rate (Table 2). However,
high-quality evidence has been reported that indicates that
inpatient smoking cessation counseling improves the smoking
quit rate if it is followed by at least 1 month of outpatient
smoking cessation therapy (19). We recognize the importance
of smoking cessation, but believe that this performance measure
may be improved by making it a recommendation for inpatient
smoking cessation counseling followed by outpatient therapy or,
at least, documentation of the intention to continue the
counseling as an outpatient. It can be argued that inpatient
counseling is a prerequisite for the outpatient intervention and
it therefore qualifies as performance measure (sine qua non),
but this argument is weakened by the lack of evidence that
enough patients will complete the outpatient counseling to
make the inpatient efforts worthwhile.
Our study has the following strengths. We selected an
updated list of performance measures, conducted systematic
reviews of the evidence, and used the GRADE strategy to
appraise the evidence. GRADE is an approach that focuses on
transparency in the evaluation of the quality of evidence,
considers the same factors that influence the appropriateness
of a performance measure, and is based on widely validated
factors that can lead to systematic errors and factors that are
used to evaluate a cause and effect relationship (48, 49).
There are also some limitations to our study. We did not use
a multidisciplinary approach or a rigorous guideline development process to evaluate the performance measures. However,
we believe that our methods were transparent and that our
findings are reproducible. In addition, we selected performance
measures related to CAP only and not other performance
measures. Given the paucity of attention paid to the importance
of developing performance measures supported by high-quality
evidence or, in the presence of lower-quality evidence, supported by other compelling factors that favor the intervention,
our study is probably representative and would remain important even if the issues identified in this study are less prevalent
among performance measures for other diseases.
Pulmonary Perspective 1459
In summary, our study suggests that the evidence supporting
performance measures is frequently not of high quality. This
implies that there is uncertainty about the balance of the
desirable and undesirable consequences of the interventions
being recommended by performance measures. With respect to
our illustrative performance measures for CAP from the Joint
Commission and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services,
we believe that two of the performance measures (recommendations for influenza vaccination and guideline-compliant
antibiotics) are reasonable performance measures, but four
(recommendations for pneumococcal vaccination, antibiotics
within 6 hours, blood cultures, and one-step smoking cessation
counseling) require further explanation or reconsideration.
