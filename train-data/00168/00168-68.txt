SUMMARY
Immunization procedures with live attenuated and inactivated vaccines were
carried out on a group of young recruits at the beginning of an outbreak of infection due to an A/Victoria/3/75-related virus strain, which occurred in February
1977 in a military camp. A retrospective investigation on protection from clinical
influenza was then performed in order to investigate whether immunization with
live virus vaccines, administered at the beginning of an epidemic, could provide
early protection from the disease. In the course of the two weeks following vaccination, laboratory-confirmed clinical influenza cases occurred in 4 subjects among
the 110 volunteers of the control group which received placebo, and in 8, 7 and
4 subjects respectively of the 3 groups of about 125 individuals, each of which
received one of the following vaccine preparations: (a), live attenuated A/Victoria/
3/75 influenza virus oral vaccine, grown on chick embryo kidney culture; (b),
live attenuated nasal vaccine, a recombinant of A/Puerto Rico/8/34 with A/
Victoria/3/75 virus; and (c), inactivated A/Victoria/3/75 virus intramuscular
vaccine. These data do not support the hypothesis that, during an epidemic of
infection, early protection from clinical influenza can be achieved through immunization with live attenuated or inactivated influenza virus vaccines, in spite of
the high immunizing capability of the vaccine preparations.
INTRODUCTION
Several investigations indicated the safety of live attenuated influenza vaccines
which were recently developed (McDonald et al. 1962; Alexandrova et al. 1970).
A high degree of stability of attenuation and a virtually absent transmissibility to
susceptible contacts has been reported for these vaccines (Murphy et al. 1972;
Beare et al. 1973; Ikic et al. 1977). Immunization produces a high incidence of

specific antibody rise in blood serum and nasal secretion (Prevost et al. 1973;
Minor et al. 1975; Rubin et al. 1976; Crifo et al. 1978), which is associated with a
high degree of protection against artificial challenge and natural infection (Rytel
et al. 1975; Donikian, McKee & Greene, 1977; MacKenzie et al. 1975; Noble et al.
1975).
The present study was originally undertaken in the winter of 1977 to investigate
the immunogenicity of two live-attenuated strains of the current serotype
A/Victoria/3/75 (H3N2) virus in a partially immune population. The population
was not selected for immunity status to influenza A/Victoria virus, yet it was
expected that the majority of candidates would have antibody for influenza
A/Victoria virus, since antigenically related strains had been repeatedly isolated
in Italy from respiratory illness during the winter of 1976. The trial was carried
out on recruits who volunteered to receive either placebo or attenuated or
inactivated vaccines. The vaccination procedure was performed when the volunteers entered military camp, at the beginning of February 1977. This was a rather
late period for vaccination to be started, since, during interpandemic years,
influenza virus is usually prevalent in Italy in January through March. In fact,
at nearly the same time when immunization procedures were started, an 'outbreak
of influenza began amongst new recruits, producing a limited number of illnesses.
This gave the opportunity to investigate retrospectively whether vaccination
against influenza could induce protection from natural infection when the immunization procedure is carried on during an oubreak of disease.
In fact, it has been reported that live attenuated vaccines could protect those
susceptible in a community even though the immunization programme is started
when the natural infectious agent has already reached the community (Shvetshova
et al. 1971; Alexieva, Petrova & Jancheva 1971; Shvetshova et al. 1973; Alexeieva
et al. 1978).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Volunteers
Subjects were healthy new recruits between the ages of 18 and 20 years, of the
'Scuola Allievi Sottoufficiali', Viterbo, Italy. This is a basic training post which
received 600 new recruits during the last few days of January 1977, and which has
a total population of approximately 2000 men. New recruits were grouped in four
companies each housed in different lodgings. Each company carried on training
activity, which was independent of the others. All recruits, however, had several
opportunities to meet with other residents in the camp. Candidates for the trial
were selected among new recruits on the basis of willingness to participate in the
study. A complete explanation of the nature and benefits of the study was given
to the participants in order to obtain consent.
Vaccines and placebo
Live attenuated type A influenza virus vaccine, Influoral, an A/Victoria/3/75
virus grown on chick kidney embryo, prepared according to the technique of the
Moscow Institute for Viral Preparations, was supplied by Istituto Sieroterapico

Milanese 'S. Belfanti', Milan, Italy. This vaccine was prepared for experimental
trials. It was given in a 2 ml amount oral dose, i.e. 2 x 104

5
 50% egg infectious
doses (EID50).
Live attenuated type A influenza virus vaccine,. BIT 4050, a recombinant of
A/Puerto Rico/8/34 with A/Victoria/3/75, was supplied by Recherche et
Industrie Therapeutiques, Belgium. Attenuated vaccine was given to vaccinees by
dropping 0-25 ml in each nostril, i.e. an individual dose of 107
 EID50.
Inactivated influenza vaccine contained A/Victoria/3/75 virus (600 i.u.) and
B/Hong Kong/5/72 (300 i.u.) and aluminium phosphate (5 mg/ml). This vaccine
was given by intramuscular injection. It was supplied by the same producer of
oral vaccine.
Placebo consisted of the diluent in which nasal vaccine was reconstituted and
was indistinguishable in appearance from the nasal vaccine. Placebo was given
intranasally. Volunteers received placebo or nasal vaccine in a blind fashion.
Experimental design
A total of 496 volunteers belonging to four different companies participated in
the trial. In early February 1977 126 individuals of the first company received
inactivated vaccine, 133 and 127 of the second and third company, respectively,
were given either live attenuated nasal or oral vaccine, and 110 of the fourth
company received placebo. A second dose of vaccines and placebo was given two
weeks after the first one.
Clinical evaluation
Before vaccination, and 5 weeks and 5 months later, a complete clinical history
was obtained and physical examination was performed for all volunteers. Temperatures were obtained during ten days after administration of vaccine or placebo.
Volunteers reporting any complaint were examined by a physician. Volunteers
presenting evidence of clinical illness were carefully observed for the presence and
severity of signs and symptoms to be recorded.
Antibody studies
Specimens of serum were collected from all participants before vaccination, and
5 and 21 weeks thereafter. The five-week sample of serum was used to determine
immunogenicity of vaccines and/or the effect of natural infection. The 21-week
sample was used to evaluate the persistence of immunity and to determine the
occurrence of further prevalence of influenza virus infections after the February
outbreak. Studies of hemagglutination-inhibiting (HI) antibody were done by a
standard micromethod using four units of A/Victoria/3/75 virus antigen (Sever,
1962).
RESULTS
During the week before vaccination scattered cases of febrile illness resembling
influenza were observed throughout the population of the military camp. On the
day when vaccination was performed, 6 volunteers in the four companies were

not given vaccine since they were apparently ill. Retrospective serological study
showed that 5 out of these 6 individuals were affected by influenza A/Victoria
virus infection. During the period between the first and the second administration
of vaccines or placebo, 35 individuals among the 496 participants in the trial
complained of one or more of the symptoms indicated in Table 1. Clinical signs
taken as indicative for influenza (i.e. fever lasting 2 days or more, plus three or
more of the following symptoms: malaise, myalgia, headache, sore throat, cough)
were reported by 8, 7 and 4 volunteers who received live oral or nasal or inactivated
intramuscular vaccine, respectively, and by 4 participants in the placebo group.
The symptoms started 1 to 3 days after vaccination in 1 volunteer of either group
of recipients of live oral or nasal vaccines, and four to ten days after vaccination
in 7 and 6 recipients of live oral or nasal and in the 4 recipients of inactivated
vaccine. The disease lasted three days or more in these cases. Among the volunteers
in the placebo group, the four cases of illness became clinically apparent 2-5 days
after treatment. Serological study showed that all the volunteers complaining of
influenza-like disease, in vaccines and placebo groups, developed a significant
immunity response (fourfold or greater increase of HI serum antibody titre) to
A/Victoria virus.
Diseases resembling influenza were not reported coincident with, or following
the second administration of vaccine or placebo, nor afterwards. Antibody titration performed on sera taken before and five weeks after vaccination showed that
nearly 39 % of the volunteers who received placebo experienced influenza A infection (fig. 1 d). Among the vaccinees, significant antibody response to A/Victoria/
3/75 virus occurred in about 59 %, 77 % and 94 % of recipients of live attenuated
oral or nasal, and of inactivated intramuscular vaccine, respectively (fig. 1, o-c).
HI serum antibody GMTs, ranging from 1/19-6 to 1/27-0 in the 4 groups of volunteers before vaccination, rose, five weeks after, up to 1/132-9, 1/149-5, 1/612-4
and 1/71-9 for live oral and nasal vaccine, for inactivated intramuscular vaccine
and for placebo groups, respectively.

A/Victoria/3/75 virus was tested in four groups of volunteers before and five weeks
after administration of: (a) live attenuated virus oral vaccine; (b) live attenuated
virus nasal vaccine; (c) inactivated virus intramuscular vaccine; (d) placebo.
In the third serum sample, four months later, no further significant antibody
titre rise was detected; GMTs were then 1/92-2, 1/110-5, 1/421-3 and 1/44-2 in
the four groups, respectively.
DISCUSSION
The scattered cases of influenza that were observed in the military camp one
week before the beginning of the vaccination trial and during the two subsequent
weeks indicate that a small influenza epidemic, due to A/Victoria/3/75-like virus,
prevailed among the volunteers at the time when the vaccination trial was started.
An epidemic from the same virus was also documented through serology and virus
isolation study in the same region in Italy at that time (Rocchi et al. 1979). The
incidence of apparent disease among the infected individuals in the camp was
rather low, since only four cases of clinical influenza were recognized among 43
volunteers experiencing A/Victoria virus infection in the placebo group. It is
conceivable that the cases of influenza which were observed in the placebo group
were due to natural infection rather than to spread of vaccine-virus from vaccinees
since, (a) there was little occasion of contact among recruits belonging to the four

companies, (6) the disease cases appeared, as a rule, earlier among the recipients
of placebo than among vaccinees and, (c) at least for one of the live attenuated
vaccine preparations which were used in this trial, i.e. for the nasal vaccine, the
occurrence of transmission to susceptible contacts has been ruled out (Lobmann,
Delem & Jovanovic, 1977). As for the volunteers of the inactivated vaccine group,
who experienced clinical influenza, the considerations which were made at the
point (a) and (c) for the patients in the placebo group could apply, indicating
natural infection as the possible cause of the disease. As for the live-virus vaccinees,
the possibility that the scattered cases of influenza which were observed during
the ten days following administration of the vaccines could be due to the vaccine
itself cannot definitely be excluded. However, at least two facts stand out in
support of the possibility that natural influenza infection was the cause of the
disease in the patients belonging to these 2 groups, i.e. the lack of reactogenicity
of the live attenuated virus vaccine preparation which was used in the trial
(Lobmann et al. 1977; De Barbieri et al. 1977) and the late occurrence of the
majority of the cases, after the fourth day after vaccination.
It can be concluded that in this study no protection from natural infection
became appreciable with any of the virus-vaccine preparations which were used
during the epidemic. This observation seems to be rather in contrast with data
reported by Russian workers (Shvetshova et al. 1971; Alexieva et al. 1971;
Shvetshova et al. 1973) indicating that protection from natural infection can be
achieved soon after administration of the first oral vaccine dose, possibly through
viral interference mechanisms. Indeed, it is generally accepted that a second dose of
a live-virus vaccine, given one to two weeks after the first one, is able to increase
immunization, possibly because of virus growth in the respiratory tract. This
consideration does not support the hypothesis that a first vaccine dose is able to
confer appreciable interferon and/or immunity against natural influenza virus
infection before fifteen days, when the immunogenic effect of it becomes evident
in terms of local and serum antibody activity rises (Crif6 et al. 1978), even though
it seems that a reduction of the incidence of influenza with symptoms could be
achieved when live virus vaccine is given as late as five days after recipients become
exposed to infection (Elveback et al. 1976).
Although in this trial the vaccination procedure performed during a small
epidemic outbreak did not apparently produce any appreciable protective effect
against clinical influenza, the immunizing effect of the procedure appeared rather
clear at least for two of the vaccines used. In fact, for the intramuscular inactivated
vaccine and for the nasal live-attenuated vaccine preparations the GMTs of
specific HI antibody activity and the percentage incidence of individuals showing
'protective' serum antibody titres (^ 1/40) appeared to be significantly increased
after these two immunization procedures.
