abstract
Background: Before pandemic H1N1 vaccines were available, the potential benefit of existing seasonal
trivalent inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV3s) against influenza due to the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza strain was investigated, with conflicting results. This study assessed the efficacy of seasonal IIV3s
against influenza due to 2008 and 2009 seasonal influenza strains and against the 2009 pandemic
H1N1 strain.
Methods: This observer-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study enrolled adults aged 18–64 years
during 2008 and 2009 in Australia and New Zealand. Participants were randomized 2:1 to receive IIV3
or placebo. The primary objective was to demonstrate the efficacy of IIV3 against laboratory-confirmed
influenza. Participants reporting an influenza-like illness during the period from 14 days after vaccination
until 30 November of each study year were tested for influenza by real-time reverse transcription

Results: Over a study period of 2 years, 15,044 participants were enrolled (mean age ± standard deviation: 35.5 ± 14.7 years; 54.4% female). Vaccine efficacy of the 2008 and 2009 IIV3s against influenza
due to any strain was 42% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 30%, 52%), whereas vaccine efficacy against influenza due to the vaccine-matched strains was 60% (95% CI: 44%, 72%). Vaccine efficacy of the 2009 IIV3
against influenza due to the 2009 pandemic H1N1 strain was 38% (95% CI: 19%, 53%). No vaccinerelated deaths or serious adverse events were reported. Solicited local and systemic adverse events were
more frequent in IIV3 recipients than placebo recipients (local: IIV3 74.6% vs placebo 20.4%, p < 0.001;
systemic: IIV3 46.6% vs placebo 39.1%, p < 0.001).
Conclusions: The 2008 and 2009 IIV3s were efficacious against influenza due to seasonal influenza strains
and the 2009 IIV3 demonstrated moderate efficacy against influenza due to the 2009 pandemic H1N1
strain.

1. Introduction
Trivalent influenza vaccines (IIV3s) containing antigens of two
influenza A strains (A/H1N1, A/H3N2) and one influenza B strain
are effective in protecting against influenza [1,2]. As new influenza
variants arise via frequent antigenic change, the influenza strains
included in IIV3s frequently change between influenza seasons,
based on recommendations by the World Health Organization
(WHO) [3].
The 2009 H1N1 pandemic raised the question of whether existing seasonal IIV3s might provide protection against this novel influenza strain. Early analyses of stored sera from vaccine trials
demonstrated limited antibody reactivity to this new virus; therefore, IIV3s were predicted to be of no benefit [4,5]. Over the course
of the pandemic, numerous observational studies of IIV3 effectiveness were conducted and yielded conflicting results [6], suggesting
seasonal vaccines to be protective [7–12], ineffective [13–17], or
even detrimental [18] against influenza due to the pandemic
H1N1 strain. A meta-analysis of 8 case-control studies with low risk
of bias found that IIV3 s provided moderate cross-protection
against laboratory-confirmed pandemic H1N1 influenza [19]. However, few randomized controlled trials have addressed this
question.
The onset of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic in Australia and New
Zealand coincided with the second year of a large, phase 4, randomized, placebo-controlled, efficacy study of a seasonal IIV3 (Fluvax, CSL Limited, Parkville, Victoria, Australia). The aim of this
study was to evaluate the clinical efficacy, safety, and tolerability
of IIV3 in healthy adults during the 2008 and 2009 Southern Hemisphere influenza seasons. This timing afforded us the opportunity
to evaluate the efficacy of the 2009 IIV3 in the prevention of
laboratory-confirmed 2009 H1N1 influenza in a study cohort of
7500 adults. This report describes the efficacy of the 2008 and
2009 IIV3s against influenza due to seasonal influenza strains, as
well as a post hoc analysis of the clinical efficacy of the 2009
IIV3 against the 2009 pandemic H1N1 strain.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Study design
This phase 4, randomized, observer-blinded, placebocontrolled, efficacy study enrolled healthy adults aged 18 to less
than 65 years over two consecutive influenza seasons (2008 and
2009) across 25 sites in Australia and New Zealand. The purpose
of this study was to evaluate the clinical efficacy, safety, and tolerability of a IIV3 (Fluvax, CSL Limited, Parkville, Victoria, Australia).
All participants provided written informed consent under ethics
approval from each participating institution and the study was
conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
Healthy, non-pregnant adults were eligible for enrollment if
they were 18 years to less than 65 years old at the time of vaccination. Main exclusion criteria were: allergy to any of the vaccine
components; medically unstable clinical condition; planned or current pregnancy; lactation; history of Guillain-Barré Syndrome;
confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive condition; current or
recent immunosuppressive therapy; concurrent participation in a
clinical trial or use of an investigational compound; or recommended for seasonal influenza vaccination according to guidelines
in Australia [20] or New Zealand [21]. Participants enrolled in 2008
were ineligible to be enrolled in 2009.
2.2. Randomization and masking
Participants were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive a single
injection of 0.5 mL IIV3 or placebo, administered intramuscularly
into the deltoid muscle (23 gauge needle, 0.6 mm wide, 25 mm
long). As there was a visual difference between IIV3 and placebo,
study personnel who were involved in the preparation and administration of the study vaccine had no further involvement in the
study conduct. Participants and investigational site staff involved
in performing study assessments remained blinded to treatment
allocation.
The randomization code was prepared by a statistician,
employed by CSL Limited, with the use of SAS software (version
9.1.3; SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA), using simple block randomization to maintain approximate allocation balance.
2.3. Vaccines and placebo
The two commercially available study vaccines fulfilled all of
the applicable regulatory requirements and were composed of
World Health Organization recommended strains for the Southern Hemisphere in 2008 and 2009, respectively (2008: A/Solomon Islands/3/2006 [H1N1], A/Brisbane/10/2007 [H3N2], B/
Brisbane/3/2007; 2009: A/Brisbane/59/2007 [H1N1], A/Brisbane/10/2007 [H3N2], B/Florida/4/2006). Each vaccine contained
15 lg of each hemagglutinin antigen from the respective influenza strains per 0.5 mL dose. The thimerosal-free vaccine was
prepared in the allantoic fluid of embryonated chicken eggs as
previously described [22]. Placebo consisted of vaccine diluent
and was composed of saline, dibasic sodium phosphate, and
monobasic sodium phosphate. Batch numbers for the 2008
vaccine and placebo were 00749112A and FLUPLACEBO, respectively; batch numbers for the 2009 vaccine and placebo were
04749111A and IV313248B1, respectively.
4992 W.J.H. Mcbride et al. / Vaccine 34 (2016) 4991–4997
2.4. Safety assessments
Solicited adverse events (AEs) and oral temperature were
recorded in diary cards on the evening of vaccination and every
evening for the next 4 days. Unsolicited AEs that occurred on the
day of vaccination and for the 20 days after were recorded in diary
cards. Information regarding the occurrence of serious adverse
events (SAEs) was collected from the day of vaccination to
180 days after study vaccination. A data monitoring committee
was established according to United States Food and Drug Administration guidelines [23].
2.5. Clinical and laboratory outcomes
Stimulated by weekly reminder contacts from investigators,
participants reported signs and symptoms of an influenza-like illness (ILI) from day 14 after vaccination until 30 November of the
respective study year, the time typically marking the end of influenza circulation in the Southern Hemisphere. An ILI was defined as
at least one respiratory symptom (e.g., cough, sore throat, nasal
congestion) and at least one systemic symptom (e.g., fever
P37.8 C [oral], feverishness, chills, body aches). This broad case
definition was chosen to maximize the chance of detecting influenza infections. Participants who reported signs and symptoms
of an ILI had nose and throat swab specimens collected within
72 h of symptom onset for laboratory confirmation of influenza
infection. Laboratory-confirmed influenza was defined as a nose
or throat specimen testing positive by viral culture and/or realtime reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR,
Focus Diagnostics, Cypress, CA, USA). Laboratory-confirmed cases
were typed to determine whether they matched the strains
included in the vaccine. Except for those specimens identified to
be 2009 H1N1 by rRT-PCR, influenza strain typing was determined
by gene sequencing (for A subtypes H1N1 and H3N2) or pyrosequencing (for B strains) performed by the WHO Collaborating Centre (Melbourne, Australia) [24].
2.6. Statistical analysis
Vaccine efficacy was assessed for each influenza virus type and
subtype only for laboratory-confirmed cases that occurred 14 or
more days after vaccination and before 30 November of each trial
year. Vaccine efficacy was defined as the relative reduction in influenza rate in the IIV3 group relative to the placebo group, i.e., vaccine efficacy = 1 – (IIV3 recipient infection rate/placebo recipient
infection rate). The primary analysis tested whether vaccine efficacy versus placebo was significantly greater than or equal to
40%. The primary endpoint was achieved if the lower bound of
the (1  2a)  100% confidence interval (CI) for vaccine efficacy
was 40% or higher.
The study was designed as a 2-year study with an interim analysis after the first season. A Pocock alpha-spending function was
used to maintain an overall one-sided a = 0.025 for the primary
endpoint, whereby in the first season a = 0.01550 and in the second season a = 0.01387. Assuming an influenza attack rate of at
least 3% and a vaccine efficacy of at least 70%, then a first season
sample size of N = 7500 randomized participants in a 2:1 ratio to
active vaccine and placebo (N = 5000 and 2500, respectively), with
a 10% drop-out rate, yields at least 90% power for a one-sided test
of vaccine efficacy being greater than 40% using a = 0.01550 (PASS
2005, NCSS, LLC, Kaysville, UT, USA).
The primary analysis assessed vaccine efficacy against any
influenza infection and infections caused by vaccine-matched
strains. A post hoc analysis of efficacy against non-vaccine strains
was also carried out to assess cross-protection. In addition, for
the 2009 season, where most cases were of the pandemic H1N1
strain, vaccine efficacy was also analyzed by age strata
(17–39 years, 40–54 years, and 55–65 years).
3. Results
3.1. Demographic and baseline clinical characteristics
The first year of the study was conducted between 25 February
2008 and 28 January 2009, and the second year between 9 March
2009 and 29 January 2010. A total of 15,479 individuals were
assessed for eligibility, and 15,044 were randomly assigned to a
study arm (7544 in 2008, 7500 in 2009, Fig. 1). The mean age of
participants was 35.5 years and 9.6% reported having received a
seasonal influenza vaccine during the 12 months before entering
the study (Table 1). Approximately 90% of participants were White
and approximately 55% were female. Most (63%) had never previously received an influenza vaccination, and most were nonsmokers.
Protocol violations occurred in 41 (0.3%) participants and were
distributed equally between study arms (IIV3 group: 28 [0.3%] participants; placebo group: 13 [0.3%] participants). Note that 2 participants aged 17 years and 2 participants aged 65 years were
enrolled in the study and included in the evaluable population.
3.2. Concomitant medications
A total of 7194 (47.9%) participants were receiving concomitant
medications at baseline. The most frequently recorded baseline
medications were birth control medications (ethinylestradiol/levo
norgestrel: 1122 [7.5%] participants; ethinylestradiol/cyproterone
acetate; 419 [2.8%] participants) and salbutamol (375 [2.5%] participants), taken by similar proportions of participants in the IIV3 and
placebo groups.
Influenza vaccines other than the study vaccine were received
by 140 (0.9%) participants during on-study periods (IIV3 group:
108 [1.1%] participants; placebo group: 32 [0.6%] participants). Of
these, 135 participants reported receiving the 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza vaccine (Table 1). All 140 participants were
excluded from the efficacy analysis before unblinding. An additional 40 participants who took other prohibited medications
(e.g., immunosuppressive therapy) were excluded from the efficacy
analysis before unblinding.
3.3. Vaccine efficacy
In the 2008 and 2009 influenza seasons combined, laboratoryconfirmed influenza was identified in 222 of 9889 (2.2%) IIV3
recipients and 192 of 4960 (3.9%) placebo recipients (Table 2).
The incidence of laboratory-confirmed influenza due to vaccinematched strains was low during both study years (Table 2). Of
the 179 participants with laboratory-confirmed influenza identified in the IIV3 and placebo groups in 2008, 107 (59.8%) were
caused by influenza B strain; 64 of the 107 (59.8%) influenza B
strains were antigenically dissimilar to the vaccine strains
(Table 2). All influenza A strains identified in 2008 were antigenically similar to the vaccine strains. Of the 235 influenza infections
identified in the IIV3 and placebo groups in 2009, 219 (93.2%) were
caused by strains antigenically dissimilar to the vaccine strains. Of
these 219 mismatched strains, 209 (95.4%) were characterized as
2009 H1N1 (Table 2).
Overall vaccine efficacy in the 2008 and 2009 influenza seasons
combined was 42.0% (95% CI: 29.9%, 52.0%; a = 0.01387 lower
bound 28%; Table 2, Fig. 2). Vaccine efficacy against influenza
strains contained in the vaccine, however, was higher at 60.1%
(95% CI: 43.8%, 71.7%; a = 0.01387 lower bound 41%; Table 2,
W.J.H. Mcbride et al. / Vaccine 34 (2016) 4991–4997 4993
Fig. 2). Post hoc analysis of vaccine efficacy against influenza
strains not included in the vaccine yielded variable results. Vaccine
efficacy against mismatched B strains (9.7%; 95%CI: 85.8%,
35.2%) and against mismatched H3N2 (49.8%; 95% CI: 73.2%,
85.5%) was not statistically significant (Table 2, Fig. 2). By contrast,
vaccine efficacy against the 2009 pandemic H1N1 strain was 38.3%
(95% CI: 19.3%, 52.8%; Table 2, Fig. 2).
Post hoc analysis by age suggested that the efficacy of the 2009
IIV3 against the 2009 pandemic H1N1 strain was highest in older
participants compared with younger participants. In participants
55–65 years of age, vaccine efficacy against the 2009 pandemic
strain was 65.8% (95% CI: 4.6%, 87.7%), whereas in participants
17–39 years of age, vaccine efficacy was 38.1% (95% CI: 16.1%,
54.4%). Vaccine efficacy in participants 40–54 years of age was
21.6%; however, the CIs were wide and included 0 (95% CI:
56.3%, 60.7%). However, the differences in vaccine efficacy
between age groups were not statistically significant for the 2009
pandemic H1N1 strain (logistic regression analysis, p = 0.416).
In contrast, post hoc analysis by age suggested similar vaccine
efficacy against matched strains across 2008 and 2009 between
age groups. In participants 55–65 years of age, vaccine efficacy
against all matched strains was 68.4% (95% CI: 3.7%, 89.6%),
whereas in participants 17–39 years of age, vaccine efficacy was
55.1% (95% CI: 30.3%, 71.1%). Vaccine efficacy in participants
40–54 years of age was 66.7% (95% CI: 37.2%, 82.3%). The differences in vaccine efficacy between age groups were not statistically
significant for the matched strains (logistic regression analysis,
p = 0.683).
3.4. Adverse events
No vaccine-related deaths or SAEs were reported. One or more
solicited local AEs were reported by 74.6% of IIV3 recipients and
by 20.4% of placebo recipients (p < 0.001; Fig. 2A). Pain and
injection-site tenderness were the most frequently reported local
AEs. Solicited systemic AEs were less common than local events,
with one or more AEs reported by 46.6% of IIV3 recipients and
39.1% of placebo recipients (p < 0.001; Fig. 2B). Malaise, headache,
and myalgia were the most frequently reported systemic AEs in
both groups. The majority of solicited local and systemic AEs were
of mild to moderate intensity and of limited duration (less than
3 days). The frequency of unsolicited AEs was similar between
treatment groups (IIV3 group: 33.9%; placebo group: 35.1%).
4. Discussion
Despite being conducted during two influenza seasons with
substantial mismatch between vaccine and circulating influenza
strains (in 2008, influenza B was the predominant circulating type
whereas in 2009, pandemic A(H1N1)pdm09 was predominant
[25]), this large, randomized, placebo-controlled trial

demonstrated efficacy against influenza due to vaccine-matched
influenza strains. Efficacy was also demonstrated for a seasonal
influenza vaccine against influenza due to laboratory-confirmed
2009 H1N1 infection.
A possible explanation for the observed cross-protection of the
2009 IIV3 against the 2009 pandemic H1N1 strain is the stimulation
of cross-reactive antibodies. Cross-reactive antibodies may be vaccine strain-specific or boosting of antibodies directed at earlier
influenza strains to which the individual was exposed. We observed
a boosting of cross-reactive antibodies in our clinical trials of monovalent 2009 H1N1 vaccine in adults and children in Australia
[26,27], where individuals who had previously received 2009 IIV3
had higher pre-vaccination antibody titers to 2009 H1N1 than those
who had not received the vaccine. The findings of the current study
are supported by data from other studies of antibody crossreactivity in individuals before and after receipt of IIV3 [28],
although in those studies the effect was greater for those aged over
60 years [4,29]; the magnitude of efficacy was highest in those over
55 years in our study. This further suggests that protective efficacy
may be a result of cross-protective immunity from multiple vaccinations or exposure to a related virus earlier in life, i.e., some degree
of original antigenic sin. Induction of cross-reactive T cell responses
to conserved viral epitopes may also be a factor underlying the
cross-protection observed in this study [30].

seasonal IIV3 against laboratory-confirmed 2009 H1N1 influenza
in adults. Two other randomized controlled studies that have
investigated the efficacy of seasonal IIV3s against the 2009 pandemic H1N1 strain were conducted in children in Hong Kong
[31,32]. The first small pilot study (N = 119) conducted during
2009 found no evidence of protection (or harm), but was not powered to investigate this outcome [30]. The second larger study
(N = 796) conducted in 2009–2010 showed children who received
IIV3 had a reduced risk of pandemic influenza A, with a vaccine
efficacy estimate of 47% (95% CI, 15–67%) [32].
The 2008 and 2009 IIV3s were generally well tolerated, with no
safety concerns identified. It should be noted that the subsequent
2010 IIV3 was associated with an unexpected increase in postmarketing reports of febrile seizure compared with previous seasonal
IIV3 s, predominantly in children <5 years of age. This was likely
due to the combination of the new influenza strains included in
the 2010 IIV3 and the CSL standard method of manufacture. This
method preserved strain-specific viral components of the new
influenza strains, heightening immune activation of innate
immune cells, which, in a small proportion of children <5 years
of age, was associated with the occurrence of febrile seizures
[33,34]. No patient in the current study reported febrile seizures
during the study period.
The strengths of this study were the randomized, placebocontrolled design, relatively large size, and use of a clinical efficacy
endpoint rather than a serological surrogate endpoint. As such, the
study was less subject to the potential sources of bias and confounding associated with the previously reported observational
studies. Nevertheless, this study is subject to certain limitations.
There was no description of the clinical course of influenza infection among vaccinated and unvaccinated cases, so we cannot
report the impact of vaccination on the course of illness or associated co-morbidity. Our study population was limited to healthy
adults 17–65 years of age (mean, 35 years), so we cannot address
the impact of seasonal IIV3 on preventing 2009 H1N1 in children,
a group more immunologically naive to influenza. Most subjects
were also female, non-smokers, influenza-vaccine naïve, white,
and not Hispanic. In addition, our study did not measure serologic
endpoints for influenza infection and, therefore, we can report efficacy only against symptomatic influenza infection.
The formulations for the 2009 Southern Hemisphere and
2009/10 Northern Hemisphere contained identical influenza A
strains. As the monovalent H1N1 vaccine was not available during
the first wave of the 2009 influenza pandemic, this study suggests
that any use of seasonal vaccine in either the Southern or Northern
Hemisphere may have had a positive impact on mitigating the
peak incidence of pandemic H1N1 infections. Pre-pandemic mathematical modelling indicated that a vaccine, even one with low
efficacy, used early in a pandemic could have meaningful benefit
in reducing the amplitude of the pandemic wave [35].
5. Conclusions
The 2008 and 2009 seasonal IIV3s demonstrated clinical efficacy in healthy adults against influenza infection caused by the
strains included in the vaccines. In addition, the 2009 seasonal
IIV3 conferred significant clinical efficacy in healthy adults against
laboratory-confirmed 2009 pandemic H1N1 infection.
