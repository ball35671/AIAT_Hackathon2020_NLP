pandemic put pregnant
women at increased risk of
morbidity, mortality, and
poor pregnancy outcomes.1-4 Pregnant
women were among the main target
groups prioritized for vaccination
against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09,5
and an estimated 2.4 million women
were vaccinated during pregnancy in
the United States alone.6 However,
assessment of the fetal safety of H1N1
vaccination in pregnancy has been
limited to a few pharmacovigilance
reports and descriptive cohort
studies.6-14
In a registry-based cohort study, we
investigated whether exposure to an
AS03-adjuvanted influenza A(H1N1)
pdm09 vaccine in pregnancy was associated with increased risk of major
birth defects, preterm birth, and fetal
growth restriction. METHODS
We conducted a nationwide registrybased cohort study of liveborn infants

Context Assessment of the fetal safety of vaccination against influenza A(H1N1)
pdm09 in pregnancy has been limited.
Objective To investigate whether exposure to an adjuvanted influenzaA(H1N1)pdm09
vaccine during pregnancy was associated with increased risk of adverse fetal outcomes.
Design, Setting, and Participants Registry-based cohort study based on all liveborn singleton infants in Denmark, delivered between November 2, 2009, and September 30, 2010. In propensity score–matched analyses, we estimated prevalence odds
ratios (PORs) of adverse fetal outcomes, comparing infants exposed and unexposed
to an AS03-adjuvanted influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine during pregnancy.
Main Outcome Measures Major birth defects, preterm birth, and small size for
gestational age.
Results From a cohort of 53 432 infants (6989 [13.1%] exposed to the influenza
A[H1N1]pdm09 vaccine during pregnancy [345 in the first trimester and 6644 in the
second or third trimester]), 660 (330 exposed) were included in propensity score–
matched analyses of adverse fetal outcomes associated with first-trimester exposure.
For analysis of small size for gestational age after second- or third-trimester exposure,
13 284 (6642 exposed) were included; for analyses of preterm birth, 12 909 (6543 exposed) were included. A major birth defect was diagnosed in 18 of 330 infants (5.5%)
exposed to the vaccine in the first trimester, compared with 15 of 330 unexposed infants (4.5%) (POR, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.60-2.45). Preterm birth occurred in 31 of 330 infants (9.4%) exposed in the first trimester, compared with 24 of 330 unexposed infants
(7.3%) (POR, 1.32; 95% CI, 0.76-2.31), and in 302 of 6543 infants (4.6%) with second- or third-trimester exposure, compared with 295 of 6366 unexposed infants (4.6%)
(POR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.84-1.17). Small size for gestational age was observed in 25 of
330 infants (7.6%) with first-trimester exposure compared with 31 of 330 unexposed
infants (9.4%) (POR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.46-1.37), and in 641 of 6642 infants (9.7%) with
second- or third-trimester exposure, compared with 657 of 6642 unexposed infants (9.9%)
(POR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.87-1.09).
Conclusions In this Danish cohort, exposure to an adjuvanted influenza A(H1N1)
pdm09 vaccine during pregnancy was not associated with a significantly increased risk
of major birth defects, preterm birth, or fetal growth restriction.

ers were linked to the cohort using the
unique personal identification number
assigned to all inhabitants in Denmark.15 In propensity score–matched
analyses, we investigated associations between H1N1 vaccination in pregnancy
and risks of adverse fetal outcomes: major birth defects, preterm birth, and small
size for gestational age as the primary
outcomes; and secondary outcomes of
low birth weight, mean difference in
birth weight, and analyses according to
categories of preterm birth. We additionally analyzed outcomes in the entire cohort prior to matching, although
the propensity score–matched analyses were defined as primary analyses.
The study was approved by the Danish
Data Protection Agency. In Denmark,
ethics approval is not required for registry-based research.
Cohort
On the basis of the Danish Medical Birth
Register,16 we identified a cohort of all
liveborn infants in Denmark, delivered between November 2, 2009, and
September 30, 2010. The Medical Birth
Register contains individual-level information on all deliveries by women
living in Denmark, each newborn’s date
of birth, gestational age, birth weight,
and other characteristics, as well as maternal characteristics including parity,
body mass index, and smoking status.
Gestational age is recorded on the basis of the first day of the last menstrual
period; this date is estimated by ultrasonography in most pregnant women.
In a study of the use of obstetric ultrasound scanning among pregnant
women in Denmark, more than 93%
underwent a scan in the year 2000.17
The onset of pregnancy was defined as
the first day of the last menstrual period and was calculated by subtracting gestational age from the date of
birth. We excluded multiple births;
births with missing gestational age or
birth weight; infants with diagnoses of
chromosomal aberrations, genetic disorders, birth defect syndromes with
known causes, and congenital viral infections possibly associated with birth
defects (rubella, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex, hepatitis, other viral infections including varicella, and unspecified congenital viral disease)18;
pregnancy onset before February 1,
2009, or after December 31, 2009 (limiting inclusion of participants unlikely to receive the vaccine because
pandemic vaccination occurred almost exclusively in November and
December),19 and women vaccinated
prior to pregnancy onset. Among mothers who had several births in the study
period, only the first was included.
Vaccination
Information on vaccination status was
obtained from a national H1N1 vaccination database established by Statens
Serum Institut with the purpose of
monitoring vaccination coverage, effectiveness, and safety. The only vaccine used in Denmark was the monovalent inactivated AS03-adjuvanted
split virion influenza A(H1N1)pdm09
vaccine (Pandemrix, GlaxoSmithKline
Biologicals). All health care clinicians
administering the pandemic vaccine
were mandated by law to report personal identification numbers and dates
of vaccination of all vaccinees; reporting was also required for clinicians to
receive reimbursement from the Danish National Health Insurance. The database is therefore considered close to
complete. The pandemic influenza vaccination campaign in Denmark, starting on November 2, 2009, targeted individuals with chronic diseases, key
government personnel, health care personnel, and pregnant women.20 For
pregnant women with chronic diseases, vaccination was recommended in
any trimester (in the first trimester after individual assessment). Pregnant
women without comorbidities were recommended vaccination in the second
and third trimester.
Outcomes
Cases of major birth defects diagnosed until 1 year of age were identified through the Danish National Patient Register, 2 1 which contains
individual-level data on hospital visits
and admissions including diagnostic information. Major birth defects were defined according to EUROCAT (a European network for surveillance of
congenital anomalies),22 with minor
modifications as described previously.18 Applying this definition to detect cases from the National Patient Register, the rate of major birth defects in
a nationwide cohort of live births in
Denmark (2.4%)18 was similar to the
rate reported by EUROCAT for Europe overall (2.1%).23 Cases of preterm birth (delivery before 37 completed weeks) and small size for
gestational age (lowest 10th percentile of the gestational age-specific birth
weight within the cohort) were identified on the basis of Medical Birth Register data. Very- and moderately preterm birth were defined as delivery
before 32 completed weeks and delivery between the start of week 33 and
before 37 completed weeks, respectively. Low birth weight was defined as
less than 2500 g, and very low birth
weight as less than 1500 g.
Potential Confounders
From the Medical Birth Register, the
Danish Central Person Register, the National Patient Register, and the Danish National Prescription Register,24 we
identified potential confounders for inclusion in propensity scores: maternal
age, place of birth, degree of urbanization at place of living, parity, smoking
status, and prepregnancy body mass index; history of any birth defects, preterm birth, spontaneous abortion, and
small size for gestational age; maternal comorbidities and use of drugs
(eTable 1 available at http://www.jama
.com); and health care utilization: number of hospital admissions and hospital outpatient visits in the last 3 years,
and number of drugs used in the last 6
months. We had no data on comorbidities diagnosed exclusively in the primary care setting, inpatient drug treatment, alcohol use, over-the-counter
medications, or vitamin supplements.
Statistical Analyses
For the outcome of major birth defects, the exposure time window comADVERSE FETAL OUTCOMES AFTER INFLUENZA A(H1N1) VACCINE

prised the first trimester (pregnancy onset through 12 gestational weeks). For
all other outcomes, we aimed to analyze risks associated with exposure
throughout pregnancy. Because only
women with comorbidities had indication for vaccination in the first trimester, we expected that characteristics of mothers vaccinated in this time
period would differ from that of mothers vaccinated in the second or third trimester. Because we also expected that
the number of those exposed in the first
trimester would be small, we anticipated that the comorbidity status of
these mothers would not be captured
adequately by a propensity score common for the entirety of pregnancy. We
therefore separated the analyses into 2
exposure time windows: vaccination in
the first trimester and vaccination in the
second or third trimester. Those exposed in the first trimester were excluded from analyses of the second- or
third-trimester time window.
In the analyses, pregnancies contributed to follow-up from the first day of
the vaccination campaign (November
2, 2009), in order for all contributing
pregnancies to be at risk of vaccination. To be eligible for the analysis of a
distinct exposure time window, participants were required to have follow-up during this specific time window. For example, a participant with
pregnancy onset on July 1, 2009, did
not start contributing follow-up to the
cohort until November 2, 2009; hence,
the participant did not have follow-up
in the first trimester and was not eligible for the analysis of birth defects,
in which pregnancies had to have follow-up in the first trimester. Additionally, participants included in the analysis of preterm birth were required to
have had follow-up before 37 completed gestational weeks; else they were
excluded from this analysis.
A propensity score for each participant was estimated using logistic regression as the predicted probability of
vaccination conditional on all potential confounders listed previously. Additionally, all 2-way interactions between potential confounders, except for
maternal comorbidities and medications, were included in the propensity
scores. We used mode imputation for
variables with missing values. Distinct propensity scores were estimated for first-trimester exposure and
for second- or third-trimester exposure. After estimation of propensity
scores, exposed and unexposed participants in each exposure time window were matched 1:1 (greedy matching) on the second decimal of the
propensity score. Participants with no
match were excluded from the propensity score–matched analyses.
Logistic regression was used to estimate prevalence odds ratios (PORs)
with 95% CIs comparing prevalence
odds of adverse fetal outcomes in the
unmatched cohorts and in propensity
score–matched cohorts of infants from
vaccinated and unvaccinated pregnancies.25 For the analysis of mean difference in birth weight associated with
vaccination in pregnancy, normal linear regression was used. In preplanned sensitivity analyses, we estimated birth defect risk associated with
vaccination in the period of maximal
susceptibility to teratogenic agents, 4
to 10 gestational weeks (corresponding to 2-8 weeks after estimated
conception)26; estimated risks of adverse outcomes according to maternal
comorbidity status in which comorbidity was defined as any of the diagnoses
listed in TABLE 1 with the exception of
disorder of female pelvic organ/
genital tract and hospital contact for injury and poisoning; and estimated the
risk of small size for gestational age by
trimester of vaccination. Posthoc, estimates for primary outcomes were additionally adjusted for exposure to seasonal influenza vaccine (data on
seasonal influenza vaccination [recommended only for pregnant women with
chronic diseases] were obtained from
the National Board of Health; reporting of seasonal influenza vaccination
was not mandatory but necessary for
cost reimbursement). A difference between groups was considered statistically significant if the 95% CI did not
overlap 1.0 in either direction. SAS software (version 9.2) was used for all
analyses.
RESULTS
Study Cohort
FIGURE 1 illustrates the enrollment of
participants in the cohort. Following
exclusions, a cohort of 53 432 liveborn infants was identified with 6989
(13.1%) exposed to the influenza
A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine during
pregnancy. Most were exposed to the
vaccine in November 2009
(FIGURE 2); the median gestational
age at the time of vaccination was
174 days (range, 0-285 days; ie, 24
weeks, 6 days). In the unmatched
cohort, 345 vaccine-exposed and
22 917 unexposed participants were
included in analyses of first-trimester
exposure; correspondingly, there
were 6644 exposed and 46 443 unexposed in analyses of second- or thirdtrimester exposure (Figure 1). Participants exposed in the first
trimester were older, more often had
a history of adverse pregnancy outcomes, had higher body mass index,
were more often smokers, had higher
prevalence of several comorbidities
such as respiratory disease and diabetes, were more often users of prescription medications such as antidepressants and analgetics, and had
more health care utilization (Table 1;
TABLE 2). Although there were some
differences in the distribution of
baseline characteristics such as age
between participants exposed and
unexposed in the second or third trimester, these 2 groups were more
similar (Table 1; Table 2). The
C-statistic (an estimate of the ability
of the propensity score model to predict vaccination status) was 0.81 for
first-trimester exposure and 0.62 for
second- or third-trimester exposure.
After 1:1 propensity score matching,
660 (330 exposed) infants were
included in analyses of adverse fetal
outcomes associated with vaccination in the first trimester, and 13 284
(6642 exposed) in analyses of
adverse fetal outcomes associated
with vaccination in the second or

included in the propensity score,
although there were smaller differences between the groups; participants included in analyses of secondor third-trimester exposure were well
balanced (Table 1; Table 2).
Unmatched Cohort Analyses
In the unmatched analyses, participants with first-trimester exposure to
the vaccine, when compared with the
unexposed, had higher prevalences of
major birth defects and preterm birth
but not low birth weight and small
size for gestational age (TABLE 3).

preterm birth, respectively, were significantly increased (Table 3). Vaccination in the first trimester was not
associated with a difference in birth
weight (mean difference, −49 g; 95%
CI, −108 to 10). Participants exposed
to the vaccine in the second or third
trimester did not have higher prevalences of any of the outcomes when
compared with the unexposed; the
PORs were not significantly increased
for any outcome (Table 3). Similarly,
vaccination was not associated with a
difference in birth weight (mean difference, −2; 95% CI, −16 to 12).
Propensity Score–Matched
Analyses
There were 18 infants (5.5%) diagnosed with a major birth defect
among those exposed to the vaccine
in the first trimester of pregnancy
compared with 15 (4.5%) among the
unexposed (POR, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.60-
2.45; Table 3). No infant was diagnosed with more than major birth
defect and no unexpected cluster of
specific birth defects was observed;
birth defect diagnoses in the 2 groups
are listed in eTable 2.
Among infants exposed to the H1N1
vaccine in the first trimester, 31 (9.4%)
were born preterm compared with 24
(7.3%) among the unexposed (POR,
1.32; 95% CI, 0.76-2.31; Table 3). There
was no increased risk of preterm birth
associated with H1N1 vaccination in the
second or third trimester (302 [4.6%] exposed vs 295 [4.6%] unexposed; POR,
1.00; 95% CI, 0.84-1.17; Table 3). When
analyzed according to category of preterm birth, there was no increased risk
of moderately and very preterm birth associated with vaccination in the second
or third trimester (Table 3).
There was no increased risk of low
birth weight associated with vaccination in the first trimester (15 [4.5%] exposed vs 18 [5.5%] unexposed; POR,
0.83; 95% CI, 0.41-1.67; Table 3) and
no increased risk of low birth weight
(225 [3.4%] exposed vs 199 [3.0%] unexposed; POR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.94-
1.38) or very low birth weight associated with vaccination in the second or
third trimester (Table 3). Vaccination
was not associated with a difference in
birth weight (mean difference, 18 g;
95% CI, −70 to 106 for first-trimester
exposure; mean difference, −4 g; 95%
CI, −23 to 15 for second- or thirdtrimester exposure). Taking gestational age into account, there was no
increased risk of small size for gestational age associated with vaccination
in the first (25 [7.6%] exposed vs 31
[9.4%] unexposed; POR, 0.79; 95% CI,
0.46-1.37) or the second or third trimester (641 [9.7%] exposed vs 657
[9.9%] unexposed; POR, 0.97; 95% CI,
0.87-1.09; Table 3).
Sensitivity Analyses
The POR for major birth defects associated with vaccination in the period of
maximal susceptibility to teratogenic
agents (4 to 10 gestational weeks) was
similar to that in the main analysis
(TABLE 4). In analyses according to maternal comorbidity status, the PORs for
the associations between firsttrimester exposure and major birth defects, second- or third-trimester exposure and preterm birth, and second- or
third-trimester exposure and small size
for gestational age were all similar in
infants with mothers with or without
comorbidities (Table 4). Because fetal
growth restriction develops over some
period of time, our initial analysis of
small size for gestational age, which
combined exposures in the second and
third trimester, might not have adequately captured a risk associated with
vaccination; however, when this expoFigure 2. Gestational Age at the Time of Exposure to Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 Vaccine by

safety with high precision; results were
similar in both unmatched and propensity score–matched analyses. However, vaccination in the first trimester
was uncommon and the participants exposed in the first trimester were a highrisk population with more than double
the rate of major birth defects and preterm birth than the unexposed in the
unmatched population. Nevertheless,
relative to a matched comparison group,
no significant associations between vaccine exposure in the first trimester and
adverse outcomes were observed, although the data only allow the exclusion of large risks of birth defects and
preterm birth and a moderate risk of
small size for gestational age.
Among the limited number of previous reports on the fetal safety of H1N1
vaccination in pregnancy, which have
included both adjuvanted and nonadjuvanted vaccines, no study has directly compared fetal outcomes from
vaccinated and unvaccinated pregnancies. Pharmacovigilance reports have
not identified safety concerns linked to
vaccination in pregnancy6-10; however, such studies cannot exclude risks
with certainty. The few cohort studies
that have been conducted have not
identified increased risks of birth defects, preterm birth, or fetal growth restriction associated with vaccination
against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 in
pregnancy11-14; for example, a prospective cohort study of 267 women exposed to the AS03-adjuvanted H1N1
vaccine reported that the rates of birth
defects, preterm birth, and low birth
weight were not higher than expected.11 However, these studies failed
to include unexposed control participants, did not present adequate estimates of risk, were underpowered, and
collectively included 64 infants exposed in the first trimester and around
1000 infants exposed at any time during pregnancy with available follow-up data at birth. Therefore, they
cannot be considered as providing evidence of safety. Thus, our report expands on the limited previous data investigating adverse fetal outcomes
associated with H1N1 vaccination in
pregnancy; it provides results from a
large cohort study with a comparative
analytical design. Together with our
findings of no significantly increased
risk of spontaneous abortion and stillbirth associated with vaccination,27
these data provide reassurance of the
safety of the AS03-adjuvanted A(H1N1)
pdm09 vaccine in pregnancy. Our data
might be generalizable to nonadjuvanted A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccines because they contain identical viral antigens, although the antigen doses and
manufacturing processes may differ.
However, results from this study do not
provide evidence of safety for vaccines with other adjuvants. Additionally, our study adds to the body of safety
data for seasonal influenza vaccines,
which rests on a limited number of
comparative studies and few studies investigating, eg, birth defect risk.28,29
Apart from providing information on
influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine
safety in pregnancy in retrospect, studies such as ours may have implications for future influenza seasons and
pandemics; in some circumstances, the
use of adjuvanted vaccines will likely
be critical to achieve sufficient host immune responses.30
Our study had strengths and limitations. The registry-based study design
allowed nationwide coverage and independent ascertainment of exposure
and outcomes. We took into account
many potential confounders but identification of maternal comorbidity, for
example gestational diabetes, was incomplete because the National Patient Register is restricted to the hospital setting. Conversely, many drugs
were included as potential confounders, and because the National Prescription Register covers all dispensed prescriptions in the country, drug use may
have served as a useful proxy for comorbidity. Because women with comorbidities likely represented the majority of participants vaccinated in the
first trimester, it is possible that results for this exposure time window
were biased toward increased risk. Only
women with comorbidities had indication for vaccination in the first trimester (although some who were health
care or key government personnel and
pregnant were likely also vaccinated in
this time period). Therefore, the population exposed in the first trimester had
a higher prevalence of factors that influence the risk of adverse fetal events.
Indeed, the rates of major birth defects and preterm birth in this group
were twice the rate in the general Danish population.18,31 Nonetheless, although participants exposed in the first
trimester represented a high-risk population, when compared with an unexposed group matched on a wide range
of characteristics, the vaccinated group
was not at significantly increased risk
of adverse fetal events. However, given
these limitations and also the low power
for the first-trimester exposure time
window, the results for adverse outcomes associated with first-trimester exposure should be viewed as preliminary and in need of confirmation.
We cannot exclude the possibility
that the relatively small proportion of
women (13%) who were vaccinated
against pandemic influenza had some
unmeasured characteristics that were
different when compared with the unexposed. If such factors were associated with lower adverse fetal outcome
risks, for example folate use and birth
defect risk, they could have obscured
fetal risks associated with vaccination. Our study did not include abortions or stillbirths. If vaccine-induced
adverse fetal outcomes were simultaneously associated with abortion or
stillbirth, results of the study would
have been biased toward the null. However, in our previous study, H1N1 vaccination in pregnancy was not associated with increased risk of spontaneous
abortion or stillbirth.27 The low vaccination coverage in the present study
(13%), which contrasts to some countries but is similar to others,32-34 is probably explained by the fact that the 2009/
2010 season was the first time that all
pregnant women were recommended
to receive influenza vaccination in Denmark; for example, in the United States
(coverage 40%)32 all pregnant women
have been recommended vaccination

since 2004.35 Lastly, when interpreting results of the current study, it is important to note that it was designed to
investigate safety, not effectiveness.
Therefore, it did not address the question of whether maternal vaccination
is associated with fetal benefits.
In conclusion, this nationwide cohort study in Denmark found no significant associations between exposure to an AS03-adjuvanted influenza
A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine in pregnancy and risk of adverse fetal outcomes including major birth defects,
preterm birth, and growth restriction.
Although the data provide robust evidence of safety with respect to outcomes associated with second- or thirdtrimester exposure, results from
analyses of first-trimester exposure
should be viewed as preliminary and
need confirmation. Further research
also needs to address risk of specific
birth defects as well as effectiveness of
H1N1 vaccination in pregnancy.
