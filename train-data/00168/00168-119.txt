Abstract
Objective: To determine whether neonatal outcomes differ between
women vaccinated during pregnancy and those not vaccinated.
Methods: Self-reported history of receipt of influenza vaccination
during pregnancy was collected from women at the time of
admission for obstetrical delivery at the IWK Health Centre in
Halifax, Nova Scotia, beginning in April 2006. The cohort for this
study included women who delivered a singleton infant prior to
November 2009, reflecting the pre-pandemic H1N1 vaccination
period. Neonatal outcomes were compared using logistic
regression between vaccinated and non-vaccinated women.
Results: Overall, 1957 of 9781 women (20%) included in the cohort
received influenza vaccine during their pregnancy. The adjusted
odds ratio and 95% confidence interval for a small for gestational
age infant (lowest 10th percentile birth weight for gestational age
and sex) was 0.80 (95% CI 0.65 to 0.95) for vaccinated women
relative to non-vaccinated women. The adjusted odds ratio for
a low birth weight infant was 0.74 (95% CI 0.58 to 0.95). Rates
of preterm birth and a composite indicator of adverse neonatal
outcomes were lower among vaccinated women, but were not
statistically significant. The effects of maternal vaccination on
neonatal outcomes did not differ between high- and low-risk
women.
Conclusion: As evidence continues to mount in support of improved
neonatal outcomes associated with receiving influenza vaccination
during pregnancy, enhanced public health measures are
necessary to encourage pregnant women to receive the influenza
vaccine.
Résumé
Objectif : Déterminer si les femmes vaccinées pendant la grossesse
connaissent des issues néonatales différentes de celles que
connaissent les femmes n’ayant pas été vaccinées.
Méthodes : Les antécédents autosignalés de vaccination antigrippale
pendant la grossesse ont été recueillis auprès de femmes au
moment de leur hospitalisation en vue d’un accouchement
obstétrical au IWK Health Centre de Halifax, en Nouvelle-Écosse, et
ce, à partir d’avril 2006. La cohorte utilisée aux fins de cette étude
comprenait des femmes ayant accouché à la suite d’une grossesse
monofœtale avant novembre 2009, ce qui reflétait la période de
vaccination anti-H1N1 pré-pandémique. Les issues néonatales
ont été comparées au moyen d’une régression logistique entre les
femmes vaccinées et les femmes non vaccinées.
Résultats : En tout, 1 957 des 9 781 femmes (20 %) faisant partie de
la cohorte ont reçu un vaccin antigrippal pendant leur grossesse.
Le rapport de cotes corrigé et l’intervalle de confiance à 95 %
étaient, en ce qui concerne un enfant présentant une hypotrophie
fœtale (poids de naissance se situant dans le 10e
 percentile
le plus faible, en fonction de l’âge gestationnel et du sexe), de
0,80 (IC à 95 %, 0,65 - 0,95) chez les femmes vaccinées, par
comparaison avec les femmes non vaccinées. Le rapport de cotes
corrigé était, en ce qui concerne un enfant présentant un faible
poids de naissance, de 0,74 (IC à 95 %, 0,58 - 0,95). Les taux
d’accouchement préterme et un indicateur composite d’issues
néonatales indésirables étaient plus faibles chez les femmes
vaccinées, mais n’étaient pas significatifs sur le plan statistique.
En ce qui concerne les effets de la vaccination maternelle sur les
issues néonatales, aucune différence n’a été constatée entre les
femmes exposées à des risques élevés et les femmes n’étant
exposées qu’à de faibles risques.
Conclusion : Puisque les données indiquant une amélioration des
issues néonatales chez les femmes qui ont reçu une vaccination
antigrippale pendant la grossesse ne cessent de s’accumuler, la
mise en œuvre de mesures de santé publique améliorées s’avère
nécessaire pour inciter les femmes enceintes à recevoir le vaccin
antigrippal.

The Association Between Influenza Vaccine in Pregnancy and Adverse Neonatal Outcomes
INTRODUCTION
I
nfluenza viruses are the most common cause of
serious wintertime respiratory morbidity in Canada and
throughout the world. During seasonal influenza epidemics,
which occur almost every winter in North America, an
estimated 7% to 20% of the working adult population
become ill.1
 Although there are case reports of fatal and
near-fatal influenza infections occurring in pregnant
women during intra-pandemic influenza seasons,2
 the
true impact of influenza on pregnant women during nonpandemic influenza seasons is less clear. In 1998, Neuzil
and colleagues published a 19-year retrospective cohort
study in a Tennessee Medicaid population and found an
increased risk of hospitalization during influenza season
in all trimesters of pregnancy.3
 In their study, for every
10 000 women in their third trimester without medical
comorbidities, an average excess of 25 hospitalizations per
year for influenza-related morbidity was observed during
influenza seasons.3
 Two Canadian studies reported similar
findings.4,5 In one of these, investigators using Canadian
Institute for Health Information hospital discharge data
found that during the four-week peak of influenza activity
in each year from 1994 to 1999, 60% of admissions of
otherwise healthy pregnant women in Canada for acute
respiratory conditions could be attributed to influenza.5
 In
the second study, in a cohort of pregnant women in Nova
Scotia with and without comorbidities, exposure to the
influenza season during pregnancy was associated with a
markedly higher risk of respiratory-related hospitalization
in the third trimester than exposure to the influenza season
in the year prior to pregnancy.4
 Infants born to women in
this cohort who were hospitalized for a respiratory-related
admission during influenza season were more likely to be
small for gestational age and to have a lower birth weight.6
Additionally, in this cohort only 2.6% of pregnant women
overall and 6.7% of high-risk women received influenza
vaccine during the years in which influenza immunization
data were available (1999 to 2002).4
 Although the data
reported in this study likely underestimated the vaccination
rate because information was obtained only from billing
records of family physicians, it is very likely that the true
influenza vaccination rates in pregnant women are very
low.
The results of these studies provided sufficient evidence
for the National Advisory Committee on Immunization
to expand its recommendations in 2007 for influenza
immunization to include all pregnant women, with or
without comorbid medical conditions. The Nova Scotia
Department of Health Promotion and Protection adopted
these revised recommendations, and since 2007 it has
offered publicly funded influenza immunization for all
pregnant women.
Because it was recognized that obtaining influenza
immunization data from physician billing records likely
underestimates the true immunization coverage rate,
from April 1, 2006, influenza immunization data began
to be collected prospectively at the time of admission
for obstetrical delivery for women delivering at the IWK
Health Centre. This study was designed to determine
whether neonatal outcomes differed between women
vaccinated during pregnancy and women who were not
vaccinated.
METHODS
We conducted a retrospective cohort study of women
who delivered a live or stillborn singleton infant of
> 500 grams or > 20 weeks’ gestation at the IWK Health
Centre between April 1, 2006, and October 31, 2009. Data
for deliveries after October 31, 2009, were not included
in this study because pandemic H1N1 vaccine was being
introduced at that time, and we wished to focus specifically
on seasonal influenza vaccine. The IWK Health Centre
is the only hospital in the Halifax Regional Municipality
providing obstetrical services, and approximately half the
deliveries in Nova Scotia are at the IWK Health Centre.
After April 1, 2006, pregnant women who came to the
IWK Health Centre to deliver were asked whether or not
they had received the influenza vaccine for the current
influenza season. These data were collected by staff in
the admitting department before the patient was assessed
and entered in a database designed to capture this vaccine
information. Data were saved in the Meditech system at
the IWK Health Centre. The standard procedure is to
purge these data after one year, unless there is a request
for the data to be saved. Unfortunately, the data for the
time period from April 2007 to December 2007 were
accidentally purged and could not be retrieved.
The information collected on influenza vaccination
was linked to data from the Nova Scotia Atlee Perinatal
Database (NSAPD) to determine the characteristics of
the cohort and the neonatal outcomes. The NSAPD is a
population-based database that contains detailed clinical
and demographic information from 1988 onwards for
all deliveries in the province. The NSAPD includes live
births and stillbirths born at a gestational age of at least
20 weeks or having a birth weight of at least 500 grams.
The database contains extensive data on demographics,
behaviour and lifestyle, labour and birth, and maternal and
neonatal diseases and procedures.

Obstetrics
Information from the NSAPD was used to determine
maternal risk status. High-risk status was determined
by the presence of any of the following pre-existing
conditions (all available in the NSAPD): pre-existing
diabetes, pulmonary disease (including asthma), heart
disease, renal disease, or anemia during the pregnancy.
The NSAPD was also used to obtain data on potential
confounders: risk status, maternal age, smoking, parity,
marital status, neighbourhood income level, pre-pregnancy
weight, one or more children under the age of five, and
infant sex. In addition, fetal and neonatal outcomes were
obtained from the NSAPD. Outcomes included perinatal
mortality (stillbirth and neonatal death to 28 days). The
neonatal morbidity variables that were analyzed were low
birth weight (< 2500 grams), SGA (defined as the lowest
10th percentile for each sex of birth weight for each week
of gestational age), and preterm birth (defined as < 37
weeks’ gestation at delivery). In addition, a composite
neonatal morbidity variable was generated based on a
diagnosis of any of the following: low 5-minute Apgar
score (≤ 3), sepsis (positive blood culture, septicaemia, or
systemic infection), asphyxia, respiratory distress syndrome
(moderate or severe), intraventricular hemorrhage (grade 3
or 4), or acute necrotizing enterocolitis.
A chi-square test was used to compare characteristics
between women who received the influenza vaccine and
those who did not. For each outcome, logistic regression
models were used to estimate odds ratios and 95%
confidence intervals. Initially, unadjusted odds ratios were
calculated for all outcomes. Then, a backward stepwise
approach to identify potential confounders of the relation
between receipt of vaccine and each outcome was used.
The initial set of potential confounders included all factors
with P < 0.1 on univariate analysis. We began by removing
the potential confounder with the highest P value and
evaluated the degree of change in the point estimate for
the variable representing receipt of vaccine. If removing
the factor did not change the point estimate by ≥ 5%,
the factor was assumed not to be a confounder and was
omitted from the model and the process repeated. The
final, adjusted model included confounding variables that
affected the vaccine estimate by 5% or more.
Research Ethics Board approval was received from the
IWK Health Centre.
RESULTS
Of a total of 12 950 women admitted to the IWK Health
Centre for a live birth delivery during the study period,
information on influenza vaccination was obtained for
9647 (74.5%). Of these 9647 women, 20.0% reported
having received the seasonal influenza vaccine during their
pregnancy; 19.5% of women at low risk and 23.0% of women
at high risk received the influenza vaccine. The vaccination
rates by year and date of delivery are shown in Table 1, and
the characteristics of the cohort according to whether or not
the women had received the influenza vaccine in pregnancy
are shown in Table 2. Most of the variables were significantly
associated with receipt of vaccine in pregnancy, although
the magnitude of difference seen was fairly small for most
variables. Among the larger differences in vaccination rates
were among smokers (14.7%) versus non-smokers (21.1%)
and among single women (15.1%) versus women who were
married or living common-law (21.8%).
The results for the neonatal outcomes according to
maternal influenza vaccination status are shown in Table 3.
For SGA, the adjusted odds ratio for women who had
received the influenza vaccine during pregnancy was 0.75
(95% CI 0.62 to 0.92) compared with women who did
not receive the vaccine. Maternal smoking was the only
confounder in the final model. Similar results were found
with low birth weight, with a protective adjusted odds
ratio of 0.74 (95% CI 0.58 to 0.95) among infants born to
vaccinated women. The magnitude of the odds ratio for
the relation between receipt of the influenza vaccine and
low birth weight among term infants was similar to that
found for SGA, but was not statistically significant.
For the outcomes of preterm birth and the composite
outcome, there were no confounding factors that met
the criteria of altering the vaccine odds ratio by 5% or
more. Therefore the unadjusted and adjusted models
are identical for these two outcomes. For preterm birth,
the odds ratio associated with women who received the
influenza vaccine was 0.84 (95% CI 0.69 to 1.02). A
similar result was seen for the composite outcome variable
(OR 0.82; 95% CI 0.64 to 1.07).

The analyses stratified by risk status are not shown. For
each outcome, the odds ratios were similar to the total
group. However, the confidence intervals were wide and
the odds ratios were not statistically significant.
DISCUSSION
Influenza vaccination rates continue to be low in pregnant
women, despite a change in the Canadian National Advisory
Committee on Immunization recommendation in 2007
that advised that all pregnant women should receive the
influenza vaccine and the implementation in Nova Scotia
of public funding for vaccination. Although we observed
some variability over the years, the peak annual coverage
rate was 25.4%.
Previous research has explored the reasons for the low
uptake in influenza vaccination in pregnant women to
determine whether they are attributable to a woman’s
personal decision not to receive the vaccination or because
the vaccine is not being offered by health care providers.
In 2004, Halperin et al. surveyed 662 pregnant women at
the IWK Health Centre regarding influenza vaccination in
pregnancy.7
 Sixty-one percent of the women said that they
would take the influenza vaccine if it were recommended
by their doctor, but only 20% of the women reported
that their doctor had discussed influenza vaccination
with them during their pregnancy. In a 2006 survey in the
United States from the Pregnancy Risk Assessment and
Monitoring System in Georgia, 44.5% of women said
that their physician did not mention anything about the
influenza vaccine during pregnancy.8
 In a separate survey,
71% of women who were offered the vaccine chose to
be vaccinated.9
 About 28% of the women indicated that
they were worried about the side effects of the vaccine on
themselves or the harm it might cause their baby.
In response to the findings of low influenza vaccination rates
and few physicians offering pregnant women vaccination,
McNeil et al. conducted a study in Nova Scotia entitled
“Influenza Immunization During Pregnancy and Childhood:
Translating Research into Practice.” (S.M., unpublished data,
2007) This study, funded by the Drug Evaluation Alliance of
Nova Scotia, was designed to increase immunization rates
among pregnant women and children aged 6 to 23 months
through public and professional education. As part of this
objective, the research team developed an evidence-based
educational program for all providers of care to pregnant
women and young children in Nova Scotia between 2005
and 2007. As of November, 2009, it did not appear that
this program had resulted in increased numbers of pregnant
women receiving the influenza vaccine in the Halifax region,
possibly reflecting the limitations of traditional didactic
continuing medical education initiatives to health care
providers.
The results of our study showed consistent improvement
after maternal influenza vaccination (or a trend towards
improvement) in newborn outcomes for all five outcomes

The Association Between Influenza Vaccine in Pregnancy and Adverse Neonatal Outcomes
analyzed. Newborns whose mother had received the
influenza vaccine during pregnancy had significantly lower
rates of low birth weight and SGA. A trend towards
a protective effect was found for each of the other
outcomes; the lack of statistical significance was possibly
due to small numbers. We recognize that our data show
associations and that we are unable to determine whether
these represent causal relations. However, if we assume
the relation is causal, the number needed to vaccinate to
prevent one infant born SGA is 50 and to prevent one with
low birth weight is 63.
Relatively few studies have examined the relation between
maternal seasonal influenza vaccination and neonatal
outcomes. In a randomized controlled trial of 340 mothers
in Bangladesh by Zaman et al., influenza immunization
during pregnancy was associated with a 36% reduction in
the rate of febrile respiratory illness in mothers during the
pregnancy and up to 24 weeks postpartum.10 In this same
randomized controlled trial, maternal vaccination was also
associated with a 29% reduction in febrile respiratory illness
and a 63% reduction in laboratory-confirmed influenza
among infants to age six months. In a case–control study,
influenza vaccine given to pregnant women was estimated
to be 91.5% effective in preventing hospitalization of
infants up to six months of age for influenza.11 Maternal
vaccination is felt to protect the infant from febrile
influenza-like illness, likely by decreasing the susceptible
population of close contacts and by passive protective
antibody transfer.10,12
Several studies have reported on rates of adverse neonatal
outcomes according to vaccination status. Recently,
Steinhoff et al. conducted secondary analyses from the
randomized controlled trial in Bangladesh and compared
neonatal outcomes between those randomized to receive
influenza vaccination and those who were not.13 They
found that during periods of circulating influenza virus,
maternal vaccination was associated with newborns having
a decreased risk of being SGA (OR 0.4; 95% CI 0.19 to
0.99) and with significantly higher mean birth weight, but
they found no differences in rates of prematurity.13 There
were no differences in neonatal outcomes among the two
groups during periods with limited circulating virus. Omer
et al.14 studied a cohort from Georgia in the United States
between 2004 and 2006 and found rates of influenza
vaccination during pregnancy (19.2%) that were similar
to those we observed in the Nova Scotia cohort. Omer
et al. found that infants who were born during the influenza
season to mothers who had received influenza vaccination
during pregnancy were less likely to be premature and to be
SGA. France et al., on the other hand, found no impact of
maternal vaccination on gestational age (mean gestational
age of 39.1 weeks in the vaccinated group compared to
39.2 weeks in the non-vaccinated group), and a 17-gram
lower birth weight in the vaccinated group.15 Similarly,
Black et al. did not find a difference in the preterm birth
rates among women who had received the influenza
vaccine and those who did not.16
Several limitations of our study are noted. Since women
were not randomized to vaccination or no vaccination,
our results could have been biased by baseline differences
in the two groups affecting the risk of adverse neonatal
outcomes. Although we were able to adjust for available
variables, it is possible that other variables confounded
the relation between the influenza vaccine and the
outcome. Interestingly, of the variables we were able
to test as confounding factors, very few met the criteria
for confounding (i.e., changing the relation between
vaccination status and pregnancy outcome). We did
not collect information on the gestational age at which
vaccination occurred or the level of influenza activity in
the population, which may have an effect on outcomes.
There may have been some misclassification of receipt
of influenza vaccine, since the information was selfreported. Additionally, we did not capture influenza
vaccine data in approximately 25% of the women in
our cohort. Reasons for not collecting the vaccine
information from women at the time of delivery were
not recorded, but one possibility is that admitting staff
might not have had time to collect the information at
an emergency delivery. If rates of vaccination in women
with emergency delivery were similar to or lower than
those observed in our cohort, then our observed RRs
were conservative (i.e., closer to the null).
CONCLUSION
Influenza vaccination rates in pregnant women were low
prior to the 2009 pandemic. Whether the heightened
awareness during the 2009 pandemic will affect postpandemic rates of seasonal influenza vaccination is still
unknown. Our study, in a Canadian population, supports
previous research conducted elsewhere that found an
association between receipt of influenza vaccination and
reduced odds of SGA and low birth weight. In light of
the low immunization rates and the mounting evidence for
the benefit of immunization to pregnant women and their
infants, enhanced public health measures are necessary to
encourage pregnant women to receive the influenza vaccine
and to ensure that health care providers actively promote
influenza immunization for this high-priority group.
