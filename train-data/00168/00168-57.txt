SUMMARY
Haemagglutinating inhibiting antibody (HAI) responses were determined and
clinical reactions recorded in 162 adult volunteers who received either 1 or 2
intranasal doses of 107-0
 EID50 WRL 105 strain live influenza vaccine or placebo.
After administration of a single dose of vaccine significant antibody responses
were obtained in 69 (70%) of 98 volunteers with initial antibody titres of < 1/20.
Of the 70 volunteers who received a second dose of vaccine, 62 provided a further
post-vaccination sample of serum, and only 3 (4-8 %), who had not responded to
the first dose of vaccine, produced a significant antibody response.
Local, upper respiratory and constitutional symptoms were recorded more frequently after the administration of a first dose of vaccine than after placebo or a
second dose of vaccine. The symptoms were of a minor nature except in one volunteer who, after the first dose of vaccine, developed influenzal symptoms followed
by bronchitis.
INTRODUCTION
Parenteral administration of monovalent living attenuated viral vaccines
usually elicits the development of specific circulating antibody responses in almost
all susceptible individuals but a high response rate may be obtained only with
difficulty when live vaccines are given intranasally. For instance, higher titres of
virus were needed for immunization when rubella vaccine was administered by the
intranasal than the subcutaneous route, presumably to allow for loss of vaccine
into the stomach, breaching of mucosal barriers and interference by other subclinical nasal infections (Zealley, Morrison & Freestone, 1974; Hillary, 1971).
The technique used to administer live vaccines intranasally has been found to
bear an important direct relationship to the seroconversion rates obtained (Freestone et al. 1976). Nevertheless, a single intranasal dose of live influenza vaccine
does not usually achieve a seroconversion rate greater than 85 % in subjects with
low antibody titre even when the best techniques are employed. This study investigated whether the seroconversion rate could be significantly improved by the

METHOD
Ten (5-8%) of 172 adults who volunteered to take part in the study were not
included since it was thought tindesirable to vaccinate subjects with past histories
of bronchitis (4), subacute bacterial endocarditis (1) or recent influenza (1).
Vaccine was also not administered to 2 other volunteers who had common colds,
1 who was pregnant and one who fainted after venepuncture. The remaining 162
volunteers were randomly divided into two groups, A and B, which were subsequently found to be similar in relation to age, sex, recent past history of influenza
and vaccine (Table 1). Blood samples were collected and volunteers vaccinated
intranasally with WRL 105 strain live attenuated influenza vaccine (group A) or
treated with placebo (group B). Second blood samples were collected 3-4 weeks

later and all volunteers were vaccinated with WRL 105 strain live attenuated influenza vaccine. Third blood samples were again collected between 3 and 4 weeks
later. Reactions were recorded for 7 days after administration of each dose of
vaccine or placebo on calendar record cards. The design of the trial and the number of volunteers completing each section of the trial are summarized in Table 2.
Vaccine and method of administration
WRL 105 strain live attenuated influenza vaccine is a recombinant of attenuated 280th egg passage A/Okuda/57 (H2N2) and unattenuated A/Finland/4/74
(H3N2) strains. The preparation of this recombinant and the clinical assessment of
its immunogenicity, transmissibility and reactivity have been described previously
(Stealey, McCahon & Freestone, 1975; Morris, Freestone, Stealey & Oliver, 1975;
Moffat, Stealey, Freestone & MacDonald, 1976). The vaccine was administered
intranasally as drops to give 1070
 EID50 virus in an 0-5 ml. volume (0-25 ml.
vaccine being administered to each nostril). Virus-free freeze-dried excipients as
used in the vaccine were employed as placebo and were identical in appearance and
reconstitution characteristics with vaccine.
Serological testing
Haemagglutinating inhibiting (HI) antibody titrations were performed by the
micromethod of Takatzy (1955), as modified by Sever (1962), using 0-025 ml.
volumes, 8 haemagglutinating units of virus (WRL 105) and 0-6 % chicken erythrocytes. Serum, virus and erythrocytes were all diluted in saline. Before testing,
sera were treated with receptor-destroying enzyme (RDE; cholera filtrate) to
eliminate non-specific inhibitors. After incubation overnight at 37° C. RDE-serum
mixtures were heated for 30 min. at 56° C. to inactivate the RDE.
RESULTS
Serological responses
The antibody responses and seroconversion rates obtained by the administration of a single dose of vaccine were, as expected, similar in groups A and B and
are shown aggregated in Table 3. Seroconversion rates declined inversely with the
titre of antibody present before vaccination. In volunteers with initial antibody
titres of < 1/20 a seroconversion rate of 70 % was obtained. Treatment with placebo 1 month previously had, as expected, no effect on the seroconversion rate in the
volunteers in group B. However, 4 (5-3 %) of 76 (3 of 68 volunteers bled 3 weeks,
and 1 of 8 volunteers bled 6 weeks) were found to have a fourfold or greater
increase in antibody after administration of placebo.
A second dose of vaccine was administered to volunteers in group A and produced a fourfold or greater antibody response in only 3 (4-8 %) of 62. However, in
group A, 19 volunteers showed twofold increases and 11 volunteers two-fold
decreases in antibody titre resulting in a modest increase in geometric mean titre.

Reactions
Over 95 % of volunteers recorded details of reactions after both doses of vaccine
or placebo. In analysing these results, reactions at their most severe were used in
the evaluation of the data. Table 4 shows the frequency of local symptoms referable to the upper respiratory tract (nasal obstruction, nasal discharge or sore
throat), general symptoms (headache, fever or myalgia) and the use of analgesics
in the week after treatment with vaccine or placebo. A first dose of vaccine was
associated with a somewhat greater consumption of analgesics and a greater frequency of local and general symptoms which were of longer duration than occurred
following treatment with placebo or a second dose of vaccine. Statistically significant differences (P < 0-05) were obtained between a first dose of vaccine in
group A and placebo (group B) for:' all reactions' and for the occurrence of, and the
duration of local reactions. Other differences after first and second doses of
vaccine were not statistically significant.
One volunteer in group A developed influenza 36 hr. after administration of
the first dose of vaccine. This was followed by secondary bronchitis which was
treated with antibiotics. He was in bed for 14 days.
DISCUSSION
In volunteers with antibody titres before vaccination of < 1/20 a single dose of
WRL 105 strain live attenuated influenza vaccine administered as drops elicited
fourfold or greater antibody responses in 70%. Little increase in seroconversion
rate was obtained after the administration of a second dose of vaccine indicating
that these volunteers were protected against infection with homologous strains of
influenza either by the administration of the first dose of vaccine or by preexisting antibody induced by natural infection. These serological results correlate
with the lower incidence of reactions in volunteers in group A after the administration of the second dose of vaccine.
It is not possible to determine whether the increase in antibody in four

volunteers in group B after the administration of placebo is the result of natural
infection, present in some employees at the time that the trial was carried out,
or of transmitted infection with vaccine virus. However, no evidence of spread has
been found in three other studies specifically designed to assess transmissibility
(Morris et dl. 1975; Moffat et al. 1976; D. S. Freestone, personal communication).
It is of interest that fewer reactions followed the administration of the second dose
of vaccine than followed treatment with placebo. There is no certain explanation
for this unexpected finding. However, it seems possible that volunteers might have
been less concerned or less vigilant about reactions after the second dose of an
experimental vaccine than after the first. There is no evidence that volunteers
reacting to a first dose of vaccine failed to come forward for a second dose or that
the same volunteers reacted after both doses.
