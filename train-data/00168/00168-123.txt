Objective To describe a large study on pregnancy outcome after
vaccination against H1N1 during the 2009/10 pandemic.
Design A cohort study of women vaccinated with Pandemrix
during pregnancy.
Setting The Swedish Medical Birth Register was used for the
analysis. Information on vaccination and pregnancy week when
vaccination was made was obtained from antenatal care
documents.
Population All women who gave birth during 2009 and 2010 in
Sweden.
Methods Characteristics of the vaccinated women and their
delivery outcome were compared with two groups of women:
women without a known vaccination who gave birth in 2009/10
after 1 October 2009, and women who gave birth during 2009
before 1 October. Adjustment was made for year of delivery,
maternal age, parity, smoking habits and body mass index.
Outcome measures Stillbirth, congenital malformations, preterm
birth, low birthweight, small for gestational age.
Results A total of 18 612 vaccinated women having 18 844 infants
were studied. The risk for stillbirth, preterm birth and low
birthweight was lower than in the comparison groups whereas the
risk for small for gestational age and a congenital malformation
(after vaccination during the first trimester) did not differ from
the comparison groups. No clear-cut explanation to the
‘protective’ effect of vaccination was found.
Conclusions Vaccination during pregnancy with Pandemrix
appeared to have no ill effects on the pregnancy. On the contrary,
the rate of preterm birth and low birthweight was lower than
expected, which agrees with some previous results.
Keywords Congenital malformations, H1N1 influenza vaccination, pregnancy, preterm birth, small-for-date, stillbirth.

Introduction
The pandemic of H1N1 influenza, sometimes called swine
influenza, began during April 2009 and reached Sweden the
same year in early May. In October 2009, a mass vaccination against H1N1 influenza was started in Sweden. A vaccine produced by Glaxo Smith Kline (Brentford, Middlesex,
UK) was used, Pandemrix. This vaccine contained inactivated split influenza virus (A/California/07/2009), squalene
adjuvant and thiomersale preservative.
The official recommendations regarding vaccination during pregnancy for H1N1 influenza varied between 20 different European countries and also the type of vaccine used.1
In 12 countries, the recommendation was to only vaccinate
during the second or third trimester. In Sweden, pregnant
women were included in the vaccination programme.
Until recently, studies on H1N1 influenza vaccination
were restricted to small investigations based on only a few
hundred women.2–5 An article in press6 followed 332
women who were vaccinated for H1N1 influenza and compared them with 1329 nonvaccinated women and found no
significant difference in spontaneous abortion rate or the
rate of congenital malformations. This conclusion was
based on five spontaneous abortions and two infants with
malformations born after vaccination before or during the
first trimester.
A Danish study7 found that 12.9% (n = 7062) of pregnant women who were vaccinated against H1N1 influenza

Epidemiology
had no increase in spontaneous abortion rate and a lowerthan-expected stillbirth rate.
A study in Ontario, Canada,8 identified 23 340 women
who were vaccinated during pregnancy against H1N1 influenza and found that vaccinated women were less likely to
have an small-for-gestational-age (SGA) infant (relative risk
[RR] 0.90, 95% CI 0.85–0.96), preterm birth (RR 0.73,
95% CI 0.58–0.91) or fetal death (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.47–
0.91).
Many authors have stressed the need for clear-cut safety
data concerning influenza vaccination during pregnancy.9–11
To study rare outcomes, a large number of exposed
women are needed. We present a study based on national
health registers from Sweden on delivery outcome after
H1N1 vaccination and describe neonatal outcomes: the
presence of congenital malformations, preterm birth, low
birthweight, and intrauterine growth restriction.
Methods
Complete vaccination registers were only kept in some
counties in Sweden. During antenatal care, however, information on vaccination was often obtained and recorded in
standardised antenatal medical documents. In these documents, space is present for the recording of drugs and vaccinations taken since the woman became pregnant and
before the first antenatal visit (usually during pregnancy
weeks 10–12) and also during the subsequent antenatal
care. The recording is probably incomplete but when a
note exists that a vaccination has been made, it is likely to
be correct. The week of pregnancy when the vaccination
was made was generally recorded but this information was
missing in 18% of the women.
These medical records were entered into the Medical
Birth Register database.6 This register contains information
on antenatal care, delivery and the neonatal condition of
the newborn infant. Some information on the mother’s
social situation is also included in the register. From this
register, data on all women with a recorded H1N1 vaccination during pregnancy were extracted, a total of 18 623
women (vaccinated group). The pregnancy and delivery
outcomes were compared with two groups of women,
women delivered after 1 October 2009 up to the end of
2010 without information on vaccination (nonvaccinated
group), and women delivered during 2009 before 1 October, that is, a period when no mass vaccination of the population occurred (prevaccination group). It should be
stressed that within the nonvaccinated group an unknown
number of women had been vaccinated but the vaccination
had not been recorded. Some women in the prevaccination
group may have had vaccinations against seasonal influenza. Such vaccinations have been recommended to pregnant women but not until after week 15.
From the Medical Birth Register,12 information on
maternal age, parity, smoking habits in early pregnancy,
prepregnancy body mass index (BMI) and woman’s country of birth were obtained. Also some maternal pregnancy
diagnoses were included in the analysis and also gestational
duration, usually determined by second-trimester sonography. Postdelivery information on stillbirth, birthweight and
SGA infants, determined after normal graphs constructed
from the register,13 were extracted.
Information on congenital malformations among the
infants was present in the Medical Birth Register. More
extensive information on congenital malformations were
obtained by linkage with the Birth Defect Register (previously called the Congenital Malformation Register) and
the Patient Register for 2009 and 2010, containing data
on hospital discharge diagnoses and also information
from specialist outpatient diagnoses. The use of different
data sources will increase the malformation ascertainment
but this will depend on the length of follow-up why
comparisons were only made with children born in 2010.
In this analysis, some specific groups of malformations
were analysed: congenital cardiovascular defects (except
single umbilical artery and patent ductus at preterm
birth), ventricular and atrial septum defects, eye malformations, orofacial clefts and hypospadias. An analysis
was also made after exclusion of some common and
clinically less significant conditions, which also show a
marked variability in registration: preauricular tags and
sinuses and other branchial malformations, tongue tie,
single umbilical artery, patent ductus at preterm birth,
undescended testicle, congenital deformity of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, (sub)luxation of hip and nevus.
The remaining malformations were categorised as ‘relatively severe’.
Characteristics of women who were vaccinated were
compared with characteristics of nonvaccinated women
and with women who belonged to the prevaccintion group
(and the vast majority of which could therefore not have
been vaccinated). The following maternal characteristics
were studied: age (5-year classes, <20, 20–24 etc.,), parity
(1, 2, 3, ‡4, where 1 means first child born), smoking in
early pregnancy (unknown, none, <10 cigarettes/day,
‡10 cigarettes/day), BMI (unknown, <19.8, 19.8–24.9, 25–
29.9, 30–39.9, ‡40), and if the woman was born in Sweden
or outside Sweden. The presence of a delivery diagnosis of
pre-existing diabetes, gestational diabetes or pre-eclampsia
was also investigated.
Infant outcome referred to stillbirths, presence and types
of congenital malformations, occurrence of preterm births
(<37 weeks), low birthweight (<2500 g) and SGA in singletons when vaccination was performed before week 37. In
the study of malformations, only vaccinations made before
the end of the first trimester were included.

In further analyses, comparisons were made with nonvaccinated women who had reached the gestational week
when vaccination was made in the vaccinated women,
which of course could only be made when the vaccination week was known. Comparisons of the occurrence of
preterm births were made between vaccinated women that
week and nonvaccinated women who had not yet given
birth.
Adjustments as shown in the tables were made using the
Mantel–Haenszel method and approximate 95% confidence
intervals were estimated with Miettinen’s method.
Results
The total number of vaccinated women was 18 612 having
18 844 infants (vaccination group). These women were
compared with 136 914 women having 138 931 infants
who gave birth after September 2009 and before the end of
2010 (nonvaccinated group) and with 83 298 women having 84 484 infants who gave birth in the year 2009 before
October (prevaccination group).
Time of vaccination for H1N1 (first immunisation)
About 18% of the vaccinations recorded in the Medical
Birth Register had no information on the pregnancy week
when the vaccination was made. The distribution of the
remaining women is shown in Figure 1. There is a peak
around the end of the first trimester (when the first antenatal care visit is usually made) and a second peak around
24 weeks of gestation.
Variation in the registration of vaccination
between counties
Sweden is divided into 21 counties or regions. The percentage of women who had a recorded vaccination during
pregnancy varied, being <1% (three counties), 1–14% (ten
counties) and 15–22% (eight counties). Among women
who were vaccinated and had a stated week of vaccination
in the register, the percentage of first-trimester vaccinations
varied from <10% (two counties), throught 10–19% (ten
counties) to 20–29% (nine counties).
Maternal characteristics
Table 1 shows some maternal characteristics, comparing
vaccinated women and nonvaccinated women, and also
vaccinated women with women who belonged to the prevaccination group. There were only slight differences
between the two sets of odds ratios (OR) calculated for
maternal characteristics.
The highest recorded vaccination rate was seen among
women aged 25–29 years and among women of parity 2–3.
Maternal smoking in early pregnancy did not significantly
affect vaccination rate. There was an increased vaccination
rate with increased BMI.
Women who were born outside Sweden were vaccinated
much less often than Swedish-born women. The OR for
being vaccinated when born outside Sweden was 0.63 (95%
CI 0.60–0.65) when compared with nonvaccinated women
and 0.74 (95% CI 0.71–0.77) when compared with women
belonging to the prevaccination group.

lower vaccination rate than other women. This effect was
slightly stronger when the analysis was restricted to Swedish-born women. No effect was seen for gestational diabetes
or pre-eclampsia. Both estimates for pre-existing hypertension and chronic lower respiratory disease were increased
but the only estimate reaching statistical significance was
for chronic lower respiratory disease when compared with
the prevaccination deliveries.
Infant outcome
Five neonatal outcomes are summarised in Table 3. The
stillbirth rate was lower after maternal vaccination than
among the two control groups. This was also seen for
the rate of preterm birth and low birthweight but not
for SGA or for congenital malformations registered in
the Medical Birth Register. When the analysis of congenital malformations was repeated restricted to vaccinations
between weeks 1 and 9, still no increased risk was seen
(OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.81–1.22, based on 54 malformed
infants among 1729 exposed infants).
When the analysis was repeated comparing vaccinated
women with women who had given birth during 2009 but
before 1 May (when influenza reached Sweden), a similar
OR was obtained.
When an analysis was made restricted to women with
known vaccination week and with comparisons with
nonvaccinated women who were still pregnant in that
week, all ORs increased and were no longer significantly
<1.0. For stillbirths the OR = 0.95 (95% CI 0.69–1.22).
for preterm birth among singletons OR = 0.96 (95% CI
0.88–1.05), for low birthweight in singletons OR = 0.96
(95% CI 0.87–1.07), and for SGA OR = 1.05 (95% CI
0.94–1.18). When the data were divided into three
groups according to the timing of vaccination, an effect
on the risk of preterm birth was seen only when vaccination was made after week 26 (Table 4). The preterm

rates in the three groups differed significantly (chi-square
for 2 df 13.8, P = 0.001).
In counties with a high registered vaccination rate
(>10%), the OR for preterm birth was 0.84 (95% CI 0.76–
0.94) and in counties with a low registered vaccination rate
(<10%) the OR was 0.93 (95% CI 0.79–1.12).
Among all women who were vaccinated during pregnancy
between weeks 27 and 36, 89% gave birth during the period
November 2009 to February 2010. These 4 months show the
highest rates of preterm birth in the population (around
5.4%, yearly average 4.9%) and when the rate of preterm
birth among vaccinated women was studied with a restriction to these 4 months, the OR was even lower: 0.54 (95%
CI 0.45–0.65) when compared with nonvaccinated women.

unusual feature but there are five infants with orofacial
clefts, the mothers of three of these children were vaccinated during weeks 7–9, which is when the face is formed,
the other two during week 11. The mothers of the infants
with oesophageal or ilial atresia were vaccinated during
weeks 8–9, slightly late for a causal association.
Risk analyses for subgroups of malformations identified
no statistically significant excess risk (Table 5). The highest
estimate concerned ventricular and atrial septum defects
but this estimate was also far from statistically significant.
Most infants (84%, n = 2643) exposed in the first trimester to maternal Pandemrix vaccination were born during
May to July 2010. The risk for a ‘relatively severe malformation’ among these infants was 0.88 (95% CI 0.72–1.09).
After exclusion from the analysis of women who were
born outside Sweden, only small changes in OR estimates
occurred but the low OR for stillbirths when compared
with women belonging to the prevaccination group lost
statistical significance.
Discussion
This is one of the largest published studies of delivery outcome after vaccination against H1N1 during pregnancy.
Most previous publications are based on much smaller samples. Among 130 pregnancies in a Scottish study, there were
four miscarriages and six possible congenital malformations.2 A French study identified 569 pregnant women who
were vaccinated with a nonadjuvant H1N1 vaccine (Panenza,
Sanofi Pasteur, Lyon, France) and found no adverse effects.3
A US prospective study of 261 pregnancies where vaccination for an AS03-adjuvant split virion H1N1 had been performed found a normal delivery outcome.4 A Taiwan study
analysed 198 pregnancies (202 infants) where the women
had been vaccinated with an adjuvant-free vaccine (AdimFlu-S, Adimmune Corp., Tanzih Township, Taiwan) without finding any signs of adverse pregnancy effects.5
Only one vaccine had been used in our study, Pandemrix, and the results may not be relevant for other vaccines.
Pandemrix contains both an adjuvant (squalene) and a preservative (thiomersale).
The advantage with this study is, in addition to the large
number of women, the use of health registers which makes
it possible to study characteristics of the vaccinated women
and adjust for putative confounders, and to ascertain outcome in an unbiased way.
The study has not identified all vaccinated women.
When comparisons are made with deliveries that occurred
after the start of the mass vaccination (October 2009),
some women who are regarded as nonvaccinated will in
fact have been vaccinated. This will bias the estimated ORs
towards unity, which was also seen when the OR for preterm birth was compared between counties with a high
(OR = 0.84) and a low (OR = 0.93) registered vaccination

women who had given birth during 2009 before October
and therefore were most certainly not vaccinated for H1N1
influenza during pregnancy. Some may have had vaccination for seasonal influenza, however. The estimated two
ORs were in most instances similar even though a tendency
can be seen that the ORs based on comparisons with ‘nonvaccinated’ women deviate slightly more from 1.0 than the
ORs based on comparisons with women delivered before
October 2009.
We found no effect on congenital malformation rate
after vaccination and the low stillbirth rate after vaccination could be random but agrees with the results in a
recent Danish study.7 The risk of preterm birth (and therefore also of low birthweight) is significantly lower than 1.0
after vaccination during pregnancy. This analysis was
restricted to deliveries where the vaccination had been
made before 37 weeks of gestation because if made later, it
could not cause a preterm delivery. No effect was seen on
intrauterine growth restriction or SGA. Further analyses
showed that the effect of the vaccination on preterm birth
was only seen when it was given after 26 weeks of gestation
and that it was not the result of the temporal pattern of
vaccinations, which could have confounded the analysis. A
similar effect was seen in a study of maternal influenza
immunisation (not against H1N1) with an OR of the same
order of magnitude as that found by us.14
Different alternative explanations can be discussed for
the finding of a better than expected delivery outcome after
vaccination with regard to preterm birth and low birthweight. It could be an effect of uncontrolled confounding,
for instance, from socio-economic conditions. It could be
that a high socio-economic standard increased the probability of vaccination and decreased the probability of preterm birth. Two facts speak against this explanation. One is
that practically no association was seen between maternal
smoking and vaccination rate, and maternal smoking is in
Sweden today strongly associated with a less advantageous
socio-economic level. The second fact is that the effect on
preterm birth was only seen when vaccination was performed after 26 weeks of gestation. Had the effect been a
result of undetected confounding by socio-economic
factors, one would expect similar effects of vaccination
irrespective of the timing during pregnancy.
Another explanation of the ‘protective’ effect of vaccination could be that vaccination had been avoided in pregnancies showing pathological features, which could favour
preterm birth. One such mechanism could be pre-eclampsia, but pre-eclampsia was not associated with a low vaccination rate. The only maternal morbidity that was
associated with a reduced vaccination rate was pre-existing
(but not gestational) diabetes. On the other hand, chronic
lung disease was (as expected) associated with a somewhat
increased vaccination rate but maternal asthma, if anything,
increases the risk for preterm birth.15
Some women will have had influenza during pregnancy,
mainly those who had not been vaccinated. If maternal
influenza increased the risk for preterm birth, it could
explain the significantly low risk after vaccination when
comparison was made with nonvaccinated women who
gave birth after September 2009. Also, among women who
gave birth during 2009 before October 2009 influenza may
have occurred. When the analysis was repeated comparing
vaccinated women with women who had given birth before
May 2009 (when the H1N1 influenza reached Sweden), the
same low OR was found, however.
A direct effect of the vaccination must be considered.
One possibility is that the immune reaction induced by the
vaccination somehow reduced the risk for rejection of the
fetus. A substantial part of noniatrogenic preterm deliveries
are associated with signs of anti-fetal rejection.16 This
would agree with the fact that a protective effect is only
seen towards the end of the pregnancy (after 26 weeks of
gestation) but this mechanism of action is speculative.
Inflammatory responses to trivalent influenza vaccine
among pregnant women have been described that were
suggested to be beneficial for pregnancy outcome.17
The observed effect could, however, also be obtained if
vaccination before 22 weeks of gestation increased the risk
for spontaneous abortion in pregnancies that were at risk for
preterm birth (and stillbirth), e.g. as the result of placental
insufficiency. This is an unlikely explanation as vaccination
before week 27 did not seem to affect preterm rates.
The number of women who were vaccinated before the
end of the first trimester was only somewhat more than
3000 but among their infants no indication was noted of
an increased risk for a congenital malformation. This
observation is limited by the absence of data on prenatally
detected and aborted fetuses. Such cases are registered but
without identification number for legal reasons, and can
therefore not be studied in relation to vaccinations. If vaccination caused a serious and nearly always detectable malformation (like anencephaly) this would not be found in
this study, which is restricted to deliveries.
A possible teratogenic effect of vaccination may not act
immediately at vaccination but could be delayed for some
time if it was the result of immunological reactions. Vaccinations occurring during the latter part of the first trimester could then not cause malformations, because the
embryo may then have left the window of organogenesis.
An analysis of vaccinations made between 1 and 9 weeks of
gestation did not change the risk estimate, however.
In conclusion, we found no ill effects of vaccination with
Pandemrix during pregnancy but instead an apparent beneficial effect in a marked reduction of the rate of stillbirth,
preterm birth and low birthweight, but no effect on SGA
