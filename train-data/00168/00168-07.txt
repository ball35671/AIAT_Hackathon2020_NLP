A double-blind, randomized controlled trial over 5 years compared the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of cold-adapted and inactivated influenza A vaccines in 5210 normal subjects.
Both vaccines were well tolerated. Inactivated vaccine significantly increased hemagglutination
inhibition antibody titers. Significant titer rises were also noted after cold-adapted vaccine but of
lesser magnitude than with inactivated vaccine. The efficacyof inactivated vaccine in preventing
culture-positive influenza was 76% (95% confidence interval [CI], 58%-87%) for HINI disease
and 74% (95% CI, 52%-86%) for H3N2; for cold-adapted vaccine, 85% (95% CI, 70%-92%) and
58% (95% CI, 29%-75%), respectively. The efficacy of inactivated vaccine in preventing a fourfold rise in antibody titer over the influenza season was 69% (95% CI, 61%-76%) for HI Nl and
73% (95% CI, 65%-79%) for H3N2; for cold-adapted vaccine, 54% (95% CI, 44%-62%) and
32% (95% CI, 17%-44%), respectively. Cold-adapted and inactivated influenza vaccines are safe
and effective for preventing influenza A disease.
Influenza is a respiratory illness that causes substantial
morbidity and mortality during the winter months. Inactivated whole virus vaccines to prevent influenza were initially
developed in the 1930s and have undergone improvements
that have decreased reactogenicity and standardized the antigenic content. Studies of inactivated influenza vaccine have
demonstrated efficacy rates of 60%-90% in preventing influenza when the vaccine matched the epidemic strain; when a
major antigenic drift or shift occurred, the vaccine was less
effective. The need for annual immunization to maintain
immunity and respond to changing antigenic composition of
the circulating virus as well as perceptions of high reactogenicity and low efficacy have contributed to acceptance rates of
only 30% in high-risk patients and significantly less in the
normal population [I]. Primary influenza immunization in
children poses additional problems, as two doses of vaccine
are required and the antibody response is frequently poor.
Routine influenza immunization of children has not been
implemented despite attack rates ofclinical influenza as high
as 30% in preschool populations [2].

and the hope of inducing broader and more durable immunity have motivated the pursuit of new influenza vaccines. A
live attenuated influenza vaccine developed by passage in
tissue culture at progressively lower temperatures has been
produced and has been administered intranasally as a live
vaccine [3, 4]. This cold-adapted vaccine can be used to generate reassortants that contain the six internal genes from the
cold-adapted donor and the two genes coding for the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase surface proteins from contemporary wild strains. The reassortants have been shown to be
immunogenic, nontransmissible, genetically stable, and safe
in laboratory animals and humans [5-10]. They have also
induced protection against experimental challenge with wild
or attenuated influenza virus comparable to or better than
that induced by inactivated vaccine [II, 12].
Field studies demonstrating efficacy of the cold-adapted
vaccines have been conducted in several selected populations [13]. However, no one has compared the efficacy of
yearly administration of inactivated parenteral vaccine with
that of cold-adapted intranasal vaccine for prevention ofinfluenza A illness in an open population of seropositive and
seronegative adults and children. To address questions of
vaccine efficacy in this setting, we conducted a randomized,
double-blind placebo-controlled trial of bivalent preparations of the two vaccines over 5 years in 5210 healthy children and adults.
Methods
Recruitment and randomization. To be eligible for enrollment, subjects had to be between ages I and 65 years and have
no underlying cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal, or endocrine

disease. They were excluded if they were allergic to eggs, pregnant, or receiving steroids or other immunosuppressive agents.
Subjects were assigned to one of three vaccine groups using a
permuted block randomization scheme [14] that was stratified
by treatment center and age group (1-3 vs. 4-65 years). Subjects and clinical staff were kept unaware ofthe assigned vaccine
group through the use of sealed randomization envelopes that
contained vaccine codes.
Subjects were recruited from seven organizations in metropolitan Nashville. These included employees and students at Vanderbilt University, employees ofthe state of Tennessee, patients
enrolled in a local health maintenance organization (Miller Medical Group), employees of two private hospitals in Nashville
(Baptist and St. Thomas Hospitals), patients of one large private
pediatric practice (Rivergate Pediatrics), and children enrolled
in a public elementary school (Eakin School). Subjects were
paid $10 for each visit.
Vaccines. Inactivated influenza vaccines were commercially
prepared in embryonated chicken eggs, inactivated, disrupted,
and purified by standard methods [15]. They contained 15 J.Lg of
hemagglutinin from each strain included in the vaccine preparation. During year I of the study, bivalent inactivated vaccine
contained only HI N I and H3N2; during years 2-5, the trivalent
vaccine contained HINI, H3N2, and influenza B.
Attenuated cold-adapted influenza A viruses containing contemporary hemagglutinin and neuraminidase proteins were derived from the same cold-adapted master strain (A/Ann Arbor
6/60[H2N2]) and grown in the allantoic cavity ofspecific pathogen-free eggsas previously described [3]. The titers ofthe coldadapted vaccines ranged from 107.°-107
.
6 pfu/rnl, with the exception of A/Kawasaki in year 3, which had a titer of 106
.
0
pfu/ml., Cold-adapted influenza B vaccines were not sufficiently characterized to include in the study.
Study design. Subjects were assigned to one ofthree vaccine
groups: inactivated, cold-adapted, or control. To ensure doubleblind treatment, subjects in all three groups received both an
intranasal preparation, delivered as nasal drops with the head
tilted backward, and an intramuscular injection in the deltoid.
Subjects in the inactivated vaccine group received the inactivated vaccine intramuscularly and uninfected allantoic fluid as
a placebo in the nose. Subjects in the cold-adapted vaccine
grqup received saline intramuscularly in year I ofthe study and
inactivated monovalent influenza B vaccine in years 2-5, as
well as 0.5 mL of each of the two cold-adapted influenza A
strains (total volume, 1.0 mL) intranasally. Subjects in the control group received an intramuscular injection ofsaline placebo
(year I) or monovalent influenza B vaccine (years 2-5). They
also received uninfected allantoic fluid as a placebo intranasally
in all years of the study.
Subjects were immunized each fall for up to 5 consecutive
years, staying in the same assigned vaccine group. Children <3
years of age received 0.25 mL of the inactivated vaccine or 0.5
mL of a 1/ I0 dilution of each of the two cold-adapted vaccine
preparations as a single dose. No child received the two-dose
vaccine series that is usually recommended with initial immunization with inactivated vaccine.
The strains of inactivated and cold-adapted influenza A vaccines used in each study year are listed in table I. Strains used to
develop inactivated and cold-adapted vaccines in each year were
antigenically comparable.
All subjects were asked to complete a vaccine reaction form to
indicate any systemic or local symptoms during the 5 days after
immunization. Serum samples were drawn before the first immunization, -- 1 month after each vaccination, and in the spring of
each year after the end of the influenza season. Pre- and postimmunization antibody titers were measured to assess the immune
response to vaccine. Comparisons between postimmunization
and spring blood samples were used to evaluate possible infection with wild-type influenza A virus during the influenza season. Spring serum samples also served as prevaccination specimens for the subsequent immunization.
A Data Safety and Monitoring Board reviewed the results of
the study yearly.
Surveillance. An intensive virus surveillance program was
implemented in the community to identify the onset of influenza. When the first isolates of influenza virus were documented in the community, all study participants received a letter reviewing the symptoms of influenza. Participants with
influenza symptoms were asked to call a 24-h answering service,
to present for a throat culture, and to complete an illness record
form documenting symptoms at the time of the throat culture.
Each season after 1987, subjects were asked at the time spring
sera were obtained to recall influenza-like illness that had occurred over the winter. They were not asked the exact dates of
their illness.
Laboratory measurements. Viral cultures were obtained by
vigorously rotating two cotton swabs in the posterior pharynx
and immediately immersing them into 3 mL of Hanks' medium
containing 0.5% gelatin, amphotericin B, penicillin, and gentamicin. The specimens were held at 4°C, and 0.2 mL was inoculated onto duplicate tubes ofrhesus monkey kidney and MDCK
cells within 24 h of collection. Cells were examined for hemadsorption of 0.1%guinea pig red blood cells at 5 and 10 days. All
hemadsorbing viruses were characterized by inhibition ofhemagglutination with appropriate antisera supplied by the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta). All original.samples
and positive isolates were frozen at -70°C for further investigation. During the influenza season, a search for other cultivatable
respiratory viruses was made by inoculation ofthe sample onto
human embryonic kidney cells, HEp-2 cells, and human embryonic lung cells.
Sera were analyzed for influenza strain-specific antibody by
hemagglutination inhibition (HAl) assay according to a standard protocol using formalin-inactivated egg-grown whole virus
as antigen. All sera were treated with receptor-destroying enzyme and heat inactivated at 56°C for 30 min to remove nonspecific inhibitors. In light of recent reports of nonspecific inhibitors interfering with HAl responses to A/Los Angeles [16], 50
randomly selected sera were treated according to newly described techniques to eliminate these inhibitors [16]. No differences were noted in HAl responses using the two methods to
remove nonspecific inhibitors (data not shown). Therefore, the
results from standard assay techniques are reported. The initial
serum dilution for HAl was I:8. The prevaccination, I month
postvaccination, and spring serum samples from each subject
each year were analyzed simultaneously to minimize variability.

Case definitions. We adopted the following definitions for
determination of efficacy. The influenza season in any study
year started on the day that we obtained the first influenza A
virus isolate in Nashville and ended on the day that our last
isolate was obtained. Patients had influenza-like illness if they
had fever of abrupt onset with at least one of the following:
chills, headache, malaise, myalgia, cough, pharyngitis, or other
upper respiratory complaints. They had cultured illness if they
had influenza-like illness during the influenza season and presented for throat culture; if this culture revealed an influenza A
virus isolate they had culture-positive illness. They seroconverted if they had a fourfold rise in titer from postvaccination to
spring sera for the influenza A virus that circulated that season.
They had retrospectively reported illness if they stated at the
time of the spring blood sampling that they had had influenzalike illness during the previous winter.
Vaccines were evaluated for their efficacy in preventing two
distinct outcomes: culture-positive illness and seroconversion (it
would be expected that the culture-positive illness definition
would be the more specific definition, while the seroconversion
definition would be the more sensitive). Additional analyses
were done to evaluate correlations between seroconversion and
illness. Subjects who were ill over the influenza season, who
presented for culture, and who also seroconverted had seroconversion with cultured illness. Subjects who recalled influenzalike illness during the influenza season when they returned for
their spring serum sample and who seroconverted had seroconversion with retrospectively reported illness.
Data management and analysis. Data were maintained by
computer using the SAS statistical package [17]. The comparability of the vaccine and control groups with respect to baseline
variables was assessed with standard contingency table tests or
one-way analyses of variance. Vaccine reactions were assessed
in the same way as baseline variables. Confidence intervals for
proportions were derived using Fleiss's method [18]. The serologic response to vaccination was assessed by mixed effects analyses of variance using the general linear model procedure from
the SAS statistical package [19]. In these analyses. treatment
and year of vaccination were treated as fixed effects, while time
of assay (before vs. after vaccination) and serotype (H IN I vs.
H3N2) were treated as repeated measures. Terms for interactions between year and treatment were included in the model.
Serologic titers were transformed to log scale before analysis.
Vaccine efficacy was assessed with a general linear model that
treated influenza in each season as a dichotomous outcome variable [20]. In this study, the prevalence of influenza in the control group was high enough to make odds ratios slightly biased as
estimates of relative risks. To avoid this bias, we chose a model
with a binomial error structure and a logarithmic link function.
These analyses were done with the GUM statistical package
[21] using the model specification macros of Wacholder [22].
This approach is similar to logistic regression but has the advantage of providing direct estimates of relative risks as opposed to
odds ratios [22]. The relative risk and efficacy estimates are adjusted for age at vaccination and year ofvaccination. Other variables that were considered for adjustment were seroconversion
due to vaccination and first versus subsequent vaccination in
this trial. These terms did not prove to be significant and were
not included in the final model.
Vaccine efficacy was estimated as the percentage reduction in
the incidence ofinfluenza in each vaccine group relative to controls. This equals 100( I - RR), where RR is the risk of influenza illness relative to controls. This formula permits the derivation of adjusted efficacy estimates using the generalized linear
model described above.
Results
Populations immunized. A total of 5210 people aged
1-65 years (including 809 pediatric patients 15 years old)
participated in the trial (table 2). Equal proportions of subjects were included in the three vaccine arms. The participants were equally distributed among the three groups with
respect to age, sex, previous history ofinfluenza vaccination,
number of family members, educational level, prerandomization serology results, and other variables (data not shown).
The initial year of the study (1985-1986) was a pilot study
with only 323 subjects enrolled. Enrollment was increased to
2628 subjects in the second year and maintained at >3000
subjects in years 3-5. New subjects were recruited in each

rate was 25%/year and did not differ significantly among vaccine groups or age groups.
Table 2 also shows the number ofsubjects subdivided by
vaccine group and the duration ofparticipation ofsubjects in
the 5-year study by vaccine group. A total of 12,500 doses of
vaccine was given.
Vaccine reactions. Febrile, local, and systemic reactions
to vaccine were assessed in all subjects (table 3). No significant differences were noted among the vaccine groups with
respect to fever.
Redness, induration, and tenderness occurred significantly more frequently in the inactivated vaccine group. This
difference was seen in all years, even though subjects in the
cold-adapted and control groups received inactivated influenza B vaccine in years 2-5.
Significantly more sore throat, coryza, lethargy, headache,
and muscle ache were noted in the cold-adapted vaccine recipients than in members of the control or inactivated vaccine groups. Slight increases in the incidence of sore throat
and lethargy were also seen in the inactivated vaccine group
relative to controls. Reaction rates after initial and repeat
vaccination did not vary appreciably. Reaction rates were
similar in all age groups and did not vary from year to year.
No severe reactions occurred.
Serologic responses to vaccine. No significant differences
in prevaccination titers were observed among the vaccine
groups in subjects receiving their first vaccination. A difference in prevaccination titers between control and each vaccine group emerged and gradually increased as the study progressed; this difference was due to accumulated immunity in
subjects who had been repeatedly vaccinated.
Postimmunization HI N 1 and H3N2 titers rose significantly in the inactivated and cold-adapted vaccine groups
each year, although responses were lower in the cold-adapted
vaccine group in all years except 1985. Cold-adapted HI N 1
vaccines stimulated higher serologic responses than coldadapted H3N2 vaccines. In 1986-1987 and 1987-1988, the
naturally circulating influenza virus strains showed significant antigenic drift from that year's vaccine strain. Figure 1
shows the pre- and postvaccination titers of antibody to the
circulating influenza viruses in these years. Vaccination produced a smaller increase in antibody to these circulating viruses than to the vaccine strains. Nevertheless, immune responses were generated by both vaccines against the
circulating strains in both years.
The percentage ofsubjects with a fourfold rise in HAl titer
from before to after vaccination is shown separately for subjects receiving their first and subsequent vaccinations (table
4). With both the cold-adapted and inactivated vaccines, the
percentage of subjects with a fourfold rise was significantly
greater after the first vaccination than after subsequent vaccinations for both HI N 1 and H3N2 serotypes. In the coldadapted vaccine group, the serologic responses were significantly greater with HI N 1 than with H3N2 vaccines after
both first and subsequent vaccinations. With inactivated
vaccine, no differences in seroresponse rates were noted between HI N 1 and H3N2 serotypes. Both cold-adapted and
inactivated vaccines increased the percentage of subjects
with a postvaccination titer of >32 (table 4). However, the
proportion ofsubjects in the inactivated vaccine group who
achieved a titer of >32 was significantly higher than in the
cold-adapted vaccine group.
Vaccine efficacy. The effects of vaccines on influenza A
illness are summarized in table 5 for years 2-5. During
1986-1987 and 1988-1989, HI N 1 subtypes circulated; durTable 3. Percentage of subjects experiencing reactions in the 4

ing 1987-1988 and 1989-1990. H3N2 subtypes were detected. No influenza A illness was detected in the 1985-
1986 season; only influenza B was seen [23]. The epidemic
periods were defined by the first and last isolates ofinfluenza
A virus for each season. The epidemic curves for study subjects and for surveillance subjects were similar. For 1986-
1987 the epidemic period was 56 days, for 1987-1988 it was
10 I days, for 1988-1989 it was 78 days, and for 1989-1990
it was 80 days. During each influenza season , the proportion
ofill vaccinees presenting for culture was greater in the control group than in either the inactivated or the cold-adapted
vaccine groups. although these differences were not statistically significant. The proportion ofill vaccinees with positive
cultures in the control group was significantly greater than
the proportion with positive cultures in the inactivated or
cold-adapted vaccine groups. The proportion of subjects
with positive cultures did not differ significantly between inactivated and cold-adapted vaccine groups for any study
year. The mean interval between onset of symptoms and
culture was 1.7 days for the culture-positive subjects, 2.7
days for culture-negative patients, and 3.1 days for culture
negative patients who seroconverted.
The number of retrospectively reported influenza-like illnesses over the previous winter was between 14% and 25%
for each vaccine group each year and did not vary significantly among the vaccine groups. Only 48%-64% of those
reporting influenza-like illness at the time ofthe spring blood
sampling had presented for culture at the time oftheir acute
illness during the influenza season.
The proportion of vaccinees with seroconversion to the
circulating wild-type influenza A virus strain over the winter
was significantly higher in the control group than in the inac-

tivated and cold-adapted vaccine groups for all years of the
study (table 5). Seroconversion during the influenza season
occurred at a significantly higher rate in recipients of coldadapted vaccine than in recipients ofinactivated vaccine for
those years when H3N2 circulated but not for those years
when HI N I virus circulated.
Subjects in the control group were significantly more
likely than subjects in the inactivated and cold-adapted vaccine groups to have had seroconversion as well as either cultured illness or retrospectively reported illness for all years of
the study. Rates ofseroconversion combined with either cultured illness or retrospectively reported illness were significantly higher for the cold-adapted than the inactivated vaccine group for years when H3N2 circulated but not for years
when HI N I virus circulated. Within each treatment group,
the incidence of seroconversion decreased with increasing
postvaccination titer. For any given postvaccination titer, patients in the cold-adapted treatment group had a lower incidence of culture-positive disease than did other subjects.
Efficacy calculations are shown in tables 6 and 7. For
HI N I disease, there were no statistically significant differences in efficacy between cold-adapted and inactivated vaccines regardless ofillness definition. In general, efficacy rates
for 1988, the year with a better vaccine match, were higher
than for 1986, a year with a poorer match. For H3N2 disease,
no significant differences were noted between inactivated
and cold-adapted vaccines for preventing culture-positive illness, but the inactivated vaccine was more efficacious than
the cold-adapted vaccine in preventing H3N2 seroconverTable 5. Effects of vaccines on influenza A illness.

Discussion
More than 12,000 doses of vaccine were given to adults
and children in the course of this trial. Both vaccines were
well tolerated, without severe adverse reactions. No significant febrile responses were noted with either product. Recipients of inactivated vaccine had 2%-5% more local redness
and induration and 15% more extremity tenderness than did
recipients of cold-adapted or control products. Recipients of
the cold-adapted vaccine had ,....., 10% more episodes of sore
throat and 5% more coryza and lethargy than did recipients

of inactivated vaccine or controls. These data, as well as
those from earlier studies in seronegative children followed
with daily observation and cultures for influenza virus [8-10,
24, 25], demonstrate that the cold-adapted vaccine is nontransmissible, genetically stable, and safe when administered
to adults and children.
Statistically significant increases in serum antibody responses were measured after administration of both coldadapted and inactivated influenza A vaccines of the HI N 1
and H3N2 serotypes. Serum HAl titers were significantly
higher in response to inactivated vaccine than to coldadapted vaccine, as shown in earlier studies [26]. (In contrast, cold-adapted vaccine has been shown to produce
higher levels of nasal IgA antibodies [11, 27]). For coldadapted vaccines, serum HAl antibody responses to HI N 1
were consistently greater than to H3N2 serotypes. Earlier
studies in seronegative adults and children had suggested
equal immunogenicity of HI N I and H3N2 vaccines, but
more recent studies using the strains we used suggest enhanced immunogenicity of the HI N 1 strain [26]. Since all
vaccines are derived from the same master strain, differences
in immunogenicity may be explained by differences in the
surface proteins or in the levels of preexisting immunity in
this population. Additional studies with other serotypes are
needed to extend these findings.
It should be noted that prevaccination titers were assayed
from spring serum in patients returning for repeat vaccinations. For this reason, it is possible that we underestimated
the serologic response to vaccination in these patients because the titer may have dropped over the summer. However, there were no meaningful differences between spring
titers obtained from control subjects and prevaccination
titers obtained the next fall from newly recruited subjects.
This result provides some reassurance that decline in titer
over the summer months did not appreciably affect our estimates ofserologic response to vaccination.
The evaluation ofvaccine efficacy was complicated by several factors. First, seroconversion during the influenza season occurred in 5%-10%ofparticipants who denied any influenza-like illness during that winter. Second, although
positive throat cultures for influenza virus are highly specific
indicators of influenza, only about one-half of the participants who reported illness over the influenza season presented for culture during their illness. In addition, some patients with influenza may have come in for culture after the
virus was no longer culturable from the throat. The fact that
the time to culture was greater for culture-negative than for
culture-positive subjects supports this possibility. Finally, the
higher postvaccination HAl titers after inactivated vaccine
may have made it more difficult to detect a fourfold rise in
titer after natural infection in recipients of inactivated vaccine; our vaccine-specific seroconversion rates among culture-positive patients suggest that this was the case for H3N2
disease.
With these limitations in mind, two major outcomes were
evaluated. The first incorporated only those who presented
for culture and had influenza virus isolated from the throat.
The second was seroconversion (a fourfold rise in titer over
the influenza season). This definition allowed evaluation of
all study subjects, but without any assessment of illness.
Therefore, two additional categories ofillness defined by seroconversion were studied. Seroconversion rates for patients
who retrospectively reported influenza over the influenza
season were evaluated. A major concern with this category of
illness is that subjects were asked to retrospectively recall
illness occurring several months previously, which may have

included illnesses other than influenza. Finally, subjects who
presented with illness during the influenza season and who
also had seroconversion were studied. Most observers would
categorize these subjects as having had influenza.
This study showed that both cold-adapted and inactivated
influenza vaccines were effective in reducing infection and
morbidity due to influenza A virus. Inactivated vaccine was
equally effective in preventing culture positive illness or seroconversion, with efficacy estimates ranging from 69% to 76%
for both serotypes. This finding is similar to the 60%-90%
efficacy estimates reported in earlier studies [28-30]. The
cold-adapted vaccine efficacy estimates varied more, depending on the outcome evaluated. For prevention of culture-positive illness, the efficacy rates for cold-adapted vaccine were 58% and 85% for the two serotypes-rates that
were not significantly different from those seen with inactivated vaccine. For prevention of'seroconversion, the efficacy
rates of cold-adapted and inactivated vaccine did not differ
for HI N I but differed significantly for H3N2.
There are several possible explanations for the differences
in efficacy rates for outcomes of positive culture and seroconversion. First, the apparent difference might be an artifact: The higher postvaccination titers achieved with inactivated vaccine might make seroconversion more difficult to
detect in the inactivated vaccine recipients. Second, the
H3N2 cold-adapted vaccines may be intrinsically less infectious than the HI N I products. If so, additional work on
vaccine interactions and modifications of the master strain
might circumvent this problem. Third, and an intriguing possibility, is that wild-type influenza virus strains may have
caused asymptomatic infections in cold-adapted vaccine recipients more often than in inactivated vaccine recipients
and stimulated a memory response causing asymptomatic
seroconversion. This could be a desirable result of coldadapted vaccines: The wild-type challenge virus might replicate in the nasopharynx without causing disease but provide
antigenic stimulus and recruitment and expansion of memory cells. This possibility is supported by the finding that the
vaccines did not differ in their efficacy in preventing culturepositive disease.
This study shows that the current cold-adapted vaccine is
an effective prophylactic against influenza A illness. Since it
does not require an injection, cold-adapted vaccine may be
delivered to a much larger fraction of the population than
has been possible with inactivated vaccine. Children, major
vectors of influenza A viruses in the community, prefer the
cold-adapted over the conventional parenterally administered vaccine [31, 32]. A high acceptance rate of coldadapted vaccine in the pediatric population could substantially reduce the transmission of influenza A disease in the
family and alter the epidemiology ofthe disease. We believe
that cold-adapted vaccines will prove to be an important new
therapy that will reduce influenza morbidity and mortality in
the years to come.
