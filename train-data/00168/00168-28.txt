A live, attenuated influenza B virus vaccine was evaluated in a group of students. The
virus, cold-recombinant (CR) 7, was produced by recombining the attenuated coldadapted parent, BlAnn Arbor/1/66, with a wild strain, B/Hong Kong/8/73. In ferrets,
the wild strain produced histopathologic lesions in the lungs, whereas the CR strain and
the attenuated parent did not. A total of 306 individuals was inoculated intranasally
with either the CR virus or a placebo. After inoculation, only one symptom was significantly more common in the vaccinees than in the control subjects. That symptom,
sore throat, occurred briefly in 26070 of the vaccine recipients and in 10.5% of the
placebo recipients. An outbreak of influenza B occurred three months after vaccination. When serologic infection rates in the two groups were compared, it was found that
the vaccine had been significantly effective (P < 0.01) in preventing infection.
Prophylaxis of influenza has been a recurrent public health concern for many years, with frequent
reexamination of available vaccines and policies
for their use [1, 2]. Throughout, most attention
has been directed toward the influenza A viruses,
because strains of influenza B virus do not exhibit
antigenic shift with resultant pandemic spread and
because outbreaks of influenza B are not regularly
associated with excess mortality [3]. Yet definite
excessmortality does occur in some years when influenza B virus is epidemic, including 1979-1980,
and considerable morbidity is regularly observed,
especially in school-aged children [4-6]. For these
reasons, with rare exceptions, an influenza B virus
component has been included in the inactivated influenza virus vaccine distributed each year.
It has been recognized for over a decade that
live, attenuated influenza virus vaccines offer a
number of potential advantages over the inactivated virus vaccines [7]. As might be expected,
most attention has been devoted to strains of influenza A virus [8, 9]. As efforts toward development of such live, attenuated virus vaccines proceed, influenza B virus components will be needed

to give as broad protection with these products as
with the preparations of inactive virus. The present report describes the testing of a cold-recombinant (CR) influenza B virus vaccine in a group of
students at the University of Michigan in Ann
Arbor. This vaccine is similar in characteristics
to other CR influenza A virus vaccines which
have been extensively evaluated in various populations [10].
Materials and Methods
Production of recombinant viruses and testing
in ferrets. Methods of preparing a recombinant
cold-adapted virus from a naturally occurring wild
parent and an attenuated parent have been described in detail [11, 12]. B/Ann Arbor/I/66, a
local isolate, had been adapted to growth at 25 C
and further characterized to determine its suitability as an attenuated strain. The wild strain,
B/Hong Kong/8/73, was received from the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta. The two viruses were grown together in cultures of chick kidney cells at 25 C. Resultant viruses were passaged
in the presence of antisera to B/Ann Arbor/I/66
virus to select for strains bearing the surface antigens of the wild strain. After three plaque purifications at 34 C, a seed lot of the B/Hong KongB/Ann Arbor CR strain (CR7) was produced by
allantoic inoculation of specific pathogen-free
eggs at the Michigan Department of Public Health
Laboratories in Lansing [13].
Young adult ferrets that had been vaccinated
against canine distemper virus were obtained from

They were inoculated intranasally with 106 .
7 50%
egg infectious doses (EIDso) of CR7 virus vaccine/ml and the two parent strains; each virus was
inoculated into three ferrets. Temperatures were
taken twice daily, and the animals were killed 48
hr after inoculation by ip administration of pentobarbital. Individual 10% (wt/vol) suspensions of
turbinates and lower lobes of the lungs were made
in sterile broth. Tissue sample of turbinates and
lungs were placed in formalin. They were embedded, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin
and eosin for histopathologic examination.
Evaluation of vaccine in volunteers. During
the first part of November 1979, students at the
University of Michigan were asked to participate
in a controlled evaluation of the CR7 virus vaccine. Students were recruited during the period of
November 7-November 28, 1979. At the time of
enrollment into the study, the volunteers were
asked to complete a questionnaire and a blood
specimen was obtained. Each subject was given a
serial number that had previously been assigned
randomly by code to either the vaccine or the
placebo group. Thereafter, 0.5 ml of vaccine was
inoculated, 0.25 ml directly into each nostril. The
vaccine had been diluted 1:5 in Hanks' balanced
salt solution and was determined on the basis of
titration in embryonated chicken eggs to contain
5.8 EIDso per dose. The placebo used was vaccine
diluent (Hanks' balanced salt solution). After the
inoculation, participants were given a thermometer to take their temperatures twice a day and a
calendar device to record any complaints directly
involving the respiratory and gastrointestinal
tracts and systemic symptoms. On day 2, the
participants were asked to return and a throat
swab specimen was obtained. This specimen was
placed in veal infusion broth containing 0.5%
bovine serum albumin, 500 units of penicillin, and
2 JAg of amphotericin B/ml. Volunteers continued
to record symptoms, and on day 6 they returned
again, when the calendar was collected and
another blood specimen was obtained. The level
of serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase was
determined for this specimen and that collected
before vaccination. An additional blood specimen
was collected on day 21 after vaccination.
Starting at the beginning of January 1980, the
Student Health Service was asked to collect on a
daily basis information on the diagnoses given by
Monto, Miller, and Maassab
their physicians to individuals who came for care
of acute illnesses. Diagnoses were grouped into
three categories: influenza, upper respiratory
infection without mention of influenza, and otherwise unspecified viral disease. A similar categorization had been used to follow the 1977-1978 outbreak of influenza A (HIN1) [14]. The tally was
maintained through February, March, and the
first part of April. To document the nature of the
outbreak, the staff of the Health Service collected
specimens for isolation of virus from any individuals with respiratory illnesses that were diagnosed as influenza on clinical characteristics. A
total of 44 specimens was collected by throat
swabs and placed in the veal infusion broth.
At the start of the outbreak of influenza B, the
study participants, who still were unaware of
whether they had received vaccine or placebo,
were contacted by mail. They were asked to record
details on any acute illness they might have on a
specially designed form. The illnesses were characterized by date of onset, duration, presence of
fever, and systemic, respiratory, and enteric symptoms. Three weeks after the last isolation of influenza B virus, the participants were asked by mail
to return to the clinic. At that time, the illness
form was collected and a final blood specimen
was obtained.
Viral isolation and serologic procedures. All
sera collected were tested for antibody to influenza B virus by HAl test. For optimal detection of
increases in antibody titer, two virus antigens- BI
Hong Kong/5/72 (BXI-HP) and B/Tecumseh/21
77- were used. Sera bracketing the outbreak were
also tested with a third virus antigen - B/Tecumseh/2/80-which was added as a representative of
the strains then circulating. The B/Hong Kong
virus antigen was received from the Centers for
Disease Control. The other antigens were prepared locally by allantoic inoculation of embryonated chicken eggs. They were concentrated and
treated with ether, a procedure which has been
found to increase avidity for antibody [15]. For
performance of the HAl test, antigens were diluted to contain four units of hemagglutinin. Sera
were treated with receptor-destroying enzyme and
were serially diluted from an initial dilution of 1:8.
An increase in antibody titer was considered to
have occurred if, with a particular antigen, there
was no antibody at the 1:8 dilution of the serum
before vaccination or before the outbreak and

CR Influenza B Virus Vaccine
thereafter the titer increased to 1:16. A fourfold
increase from an initial antibody titer was also
considered significant.
Specimens for viral isolation were inoculated,
usually on the day of collection, into two tubes of
cynomolgus monkey kidney cells. They were incubated at 33 C on a roller drum for three weeks and
were hemadsorbed with guinea pig erythrocytes
twice a week. Isolates were passaged again in
monkey kidney cells and typed by HAl test using
sera provided by the Centers for Disease Control.
Isolates of vaccine virus were further passaged
allantoically in embryonated chicken eggs and
characterized as cold-adapted [11].
Results
Characterization of vaccine virus in vitro and in
vivo. CR influenza A viruses are both coldadapted (able to grow well at 25 C) and temperature-sensitive (with a shutoff temperature generally of 37-38 C) [10-13]. Similarly, the CR7 vaccine virus had a shutoff temperature in primary
cultures of chick kidney cells of 37 C. At 25 C the
recombinant grew to a titer of 3 X 107 pfu/ml; the
attenuated parent had a titer of 2 x 108 pfu/ml,
whereas the wild parent did not form distinct
plaques at that temperature.
The virulence of CR influenza A viruses in infected ferrets has correlated closely with the attenuation of the viruses in humans [10]. In general, the wild parent has grown in the lungs and
nasal turbinates, producing histopathologic lesions, whereas the attenuated parent and the attenuated recombinant have grown in the nasal turbinates alone with a minimum of lesions. For the
B/Hong Kong/8/73 parent, the level of shedding
from the turbinates at 48 hr was 4 x 107 pfu/ml;
the B/Ann Arbor/l/66 parent was shed at a level
of 3 x 106 pfu/ml, whereas the CR7 virus was
shed at a level of 5 x 104 pfu/ml. The B/Hong
Kong/8/73 wild virus produced purulent exudate
in the lumina of the turbinates with edema and
prominent inflammatory exudate in the lamina
propria. In the lungs, there was focal atelectasis
and prominent numbers of lymphocytes perivascularly and peri bronchially; in one animal patchy
pneumonia was also observed. In contrast, the
B/Ann Arbor/l/66 attenuated parent produced
an occasional clump of purulent exudate in the lumen of the turbinates with mild focal inflamma59
tion in the lamina propria. The lungs were essentially normal. Ferrets inoculated with the CR7
virus had turbinates closely resembling those of
the ferrets given the attenuated parent, with rare
patches of exudate in the lumen and no inflammation of the lamina propria. The lungs of one of
these ferrets showed sparse perivascular and peribronchial lymphocytes; the lungs of the other two
ferrets were essentially normal. These results indicated that the recombinant virus was probably
attenuated.
Response to vaccination and its acceptability in
human volunteers. A total of 154 individuals received 5.8 EIDso of the CR7 virus vaccine and 152
received placebos. The participants took their
temperature twice a day and recorded symptoms
during the first six days after inoculation. Occurrence of symptoms on each of these days was compared for the vaccine and placebo groups. Only
one symptom - sore throat- was significantly
more frequently reported among vaccinees than
nonvaccinees on any single day. No difference was
observed on the day of vaccination, but on the
next day 15.6OJo of vaccine recipients reported the
symptom, compared with 6.6OJo of the placebo recipients (P = 0.01). The difference increased on
day 2 (18.8OJo in vaccinees vs. 5.3% in control subjects; P <0.0005), decreased on day 3 (13.6% vs.
6.6%; P <0.05), and became insignificant on day 4.
Therefore, attention was directed to the first
three days. Table 1 shows the number of individuals reporting each symptom and temperatures of
~100 F on one or more days during this period.
Significant differences again were found only for
sore throat; the excess of individuals reporting the
symptom in the vaccine group compared with the
placebo group was 15.5OJo. Among the other
symptoms shown in table 1, coryza, hoarseness,
and muscle aches were somewhat more common
among the vaccinees, but not at the level of statistical significance. Fever was also slightly more
common among the vaccinees. No additional significant differences in symptoms and fever were
found when groups were subdivided by antibody
titer before and after vaccination.
The antibody response to vaccination was determined by HAl test using two standard influenza B
virus antigens and also by detecting shedding of
virus on day 2 after inoculation. Of the 154 individuals who were vaccinated, 58 (37.7%) had an
increase in antibody titer to B/Hong Kong/72

virus antigen and 56 (36.4070) to B/Tecumseh/77
virus antigen. In total, 66 (42.9070) exhibited a
fourfold increase in antibody titer to one or both
of the antigens. Virus was recovered from eight
(5.2070) of the vaccinees on day 2. The isolates
grew readily at 25 C on propagation in cultures of
chick kidney cells, the typical characteristic of
cold-adapted vaccine virus. Six of the individuals
from whom virus was isolated had not exhibited
an increase in antibody titer, a result suggesting
that an increase in HAl antibody titer was not a
very sensitive indication of infection; this finding
has been noted in other studies of attenuated influenza virus vaccines [16]. Therefore, a total of
72 (46.8070) of the 154 vaccinees showed evidence
of infection with the vaccine virus. Infection was
more common among individuals without or with
low levels of antibody before vaccination than
among those with higher levels. For example, with
B/Hong Kong/72 virus antigen, 75.0070 of those
with infection had HAl antibody titers of 1:8,
whereas among those vaccinees who were not infected, 59.8070 had such a titer (P < 0.05).
Overall antibody titers among the 154 vaccinees
before and after inoculation were calculated as another means of assessing the effect of vaccination
(table 2). The test with the B/Tecumseh/77 virus
antigen was somewhat more sensitive in detecting
antibody than was that with the B/Hong Kong/72
virus antigen. However, with both antigens the
relative increase in geometric mean titer after vaccination was similar. The increase in antibody titer
after vaccination could also be seen by examining
the prevalence of antibody at a particular level.
Antibody titers of the placebo recipients before
inoculation were not significantly different from
those of the vaccine recipients, and no increases in
titer were observed.
Levels of serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase were measured in the blood samples collected before and six days after inoculation of placebo or vaccine. Results were within normal limits
or showed minor fluctuations - all less than twice
normal levels-except for one 19-year-old male
student. This individual received the vaccine and
showed an increase in level of serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase from normal levels before
inoculation to 202 international units/liter on day
6. Other studies were performed on sera collected
from this student on days 0, 6, and 21. The results
of all tests were normal on day O. On day 6 the
level of serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase was
196 international units/liter; the total bilirubin
concentration was 1.0 mg/ 100 ml, with a concentration of 0.3 mg/IOO ml in the direct fraction;
and the level of alkaline phosphatase was four

tory illnesses recorded in the peak week [14]. The
first isolation of influenza B virus by the Student
Health Service was from a specimen collected on
February 11, 1980. Specimens were collected
through March 26, and the last isolate of influenza
virus was from a specimen collected on March 18;
thus, the period of isolation of influenza virus
covered six weeks. Of the 44 specimens collected,
influenza B virus was isolated from 29 (65.90/0).
Two-thirds of the isolates were during the first
three weeks, the period when frequency of influenza-like illness was increased.
Participants were contacted during the week of
February 10, 1980, and received a device to record
characteristics of any acute illnesses they might experience from that week on. They were given appointments to return from April 7 to 17, and at
that time the illness histories were reviewed and a
final blood specimen was collected. A total of 144
in the vaccine group and 140 in the placebo group
completed this phase of the study. The frequency
of respiratory illnesses of various characteristics
was examined in both groups during the six weeks
that influenza B viruses were isolated. No particular constellation of symptoms produced results
different from those found by calculating the frequency of respiratory illnesses as a whole. Table 3
shows the occurrence of illness with two or more
respiratory symptoms with onsets during the sixweek period. Overall, respiratory illnesses were
somewhat more common in the placebo group
than in the vaccine group, but the differences were
not statistically significant. This lack of clear ability to distinguish an effect of vaccine on symptomatic illness alone is not surprising in view of the
CR Influenza B Virus Vaccine
times the initial level. On day 21, all levels had returned to normal except that of alkaline phosphatase, which had decreased to twice the initial level.
On review of his diary, it was found that this student already had an illness characterized by coryza, sore throat, and cough on the day of inoculation. He continued to be symptomatic for the next
six days of observation. Symptoms gradually increased; by the day after inoculation he was febrile, and his temperature peaked at 103.4 F on
day 4. Thereafter, he gradually improved, and on
his return on day 21 he was well. There was no evidence that he had been infected by the vaccine
virus. The student had not come in on day 2 for
collection of a specimen for viral isolation, and his
paired sera collected on days 0 and 21 did not
show a fourfold increase in titer of antibody to influenza B virus by HAl or neutralization tests. Increases in titer were also not found for antibody to
10 other viruses, including hepatitis A and B viruses, Epstein-Barr virus, and cytomegalovirus.
Thus, it is not possible to determine the etiology of
the illness; no previous episodes of this type have
followed inoculation of live, attenuated influenza
A or influenza B virus vaccine.
The 1979-1980 influenza outbreak. Influenza
B virus was isolated in southeastern Michigan in
late January 1980. The isolates were identified as
B/Singapore/79- and B/Buenos Aires/79-like by
the World Health Organization Collaborative
Center for Influenza of the Centers for Disease
Control. Beginning in early February, visits to the
Student Health Service of the University of Michigan were monitored, and specimens for isolation
of virus were collected from patients there with
influenza-like disease. Figure 1 depicts the frequency of visits by week for acute respiratory conditions, divided into three categories based on
clinical characteristics. Frequency of visits for
clinically defined influenza was moderately elevated during the three weeks of February 10 to
March 1. The week of March 2 was a university
vacation, which most likely contributed to the decrease in that period. The high rate of upper respiratory illness in February did not parallel the occurrence of influenza, nor did viral illness. This
pattern is in sharp contrast to the pattern seen two
years before, when an outbreak of influenza A
(HINl) was monitored in the student population
by the same mechanism; at that time, all three
classes of illness increased markedly, with about
540 visits for clinical influenza and acute respira130

defined as at least two respiratory symptoms. Titers of antibody to three influenza B virus antigens-B/Hong Kong/5/72 (BX1-

and thereafter the titer increased to 1:16 or if there was a fourfold increase from an initial antibody titer. Data are no. (010).

large number of noninfluenzal respiratory illnesses that occurred during the period, as indicated by the pattern of visits to the Student Health
Service.
Infection with influenza B virus during the outbreak was detected serologically in study participants by identifying increases in antibody titer; in
addition to the two virus antigens previously used,
a third - B/Tecumseh/2/80 - was added as representative of the strains then circulating. Table 3
also shows that 19 increases in titer were detected
with one or more of the antigens. Nearly 11070 of
the placebo recipients were infected, compared
with 2.8070 of the vaccinees (P < 0.01). Of the 15
individuals in the placebo group with increases in
antibody titers, four were detected with one antigen, six with two antigens, and five with all three
antigens. All four infected vaccinees had increases
in titer of antibody to only one antigen. There had
been extensive drift between the 1973 influenza B
virus in the vaccine and the 1980 infecting virus; it
was not possible to determine whether this drift
was responsible for the failure to protect the four
vaccinees because with such small numbers of subjects no pattern in virus-specific antibody could be
observed. However, only one of the four infected
vaccine recipients had had an increase in antibody
titer after vaccination, and preinfection titers of
antibody to B/Tecumseh/80 virus antigen were
<1:8 in two individuals and 1:8 in the other two.
Illness experience of those with and without infection was also examined. Of the 144 persons in
the vaccine group, two (1.4070) had both an increase in titer and respiratory illness during the
six-week period of virus circulation; similarly, of
the 140 persons in the placebo group, eight (5.7070)
had serologically confirmed respiratory illnesses
(P < 0.05).
Discussion
Cold-adapted influenza A viruses have been produced for the last 15 years using for recombination a single attenuated parent- AIAnn Arbor 16/60 - and a currently circulating strain as the
wild parent [11, 17, 18]. Usually the wild parent
contributes the two gene segments coding for the
surface antigens, whereas the other six gene segments are derived from the attenuated parent [19].
When such a recombinant has been produced it
has been shown to be regularly attenuated, both in
the laboratory in ferrets and in humans [20]. Two
markers are present in the attenuated strains: they
are temperature-sensitive (with a shutoff temperature of 37-38 C), and they are cold-adapted (grow
well at 25 C), which is not a characteristic of wild
influenza viruses [21,22]. Because of multiple lesions in the genome of the attenuated strains, they
have been stable on infection in humans, with no
significant tendency to revert.
The CR influenza B viruses are produced by a
procedure similar to that for the influenza A virus
recombinants. They too are temperature-sensitive
and cold-adapted, but much less is known about
their genetic makeup. Again, ferrets have been a
reliable model to confirm the vaccine acceptability
of the strain produced; such confirmation is of importance because it is not yet possible to determine
whether all six desired genes are contributed by the
attenuated parent. CR influenza B virus vaccines
have been demonstrated to be suitably attenuated
in humans [13, 23]. The present results confirm in

CR Influenza B Virus Vaccine
larger numbers that, although a significant effect
of vaccination can be identified, the symptoms
produced are mild and are confined to the upper
respiratory tract.
The antibody response to vaccination with live
influenza virus has in general not been as great as
that seen with inactivated virus. This difference in
response does not indicate that the attenuated
virus vaccines are not protective; in volunteer
studies, recipients of such vaccines have been regularly protected against challenge with wild virus
[24]. The lower degree of antibody response was
not as apparent with strains of influenza A
(H3N2) virus as it is with strains of influenza A
(H 1N1) virus and now strains of influenza B virus
[16]. It is difficult to know whether this variation
is related to known differences in the sensitivity of
the test for antibody or to the past experience of
the study population with the virus [25]; in any
event, the finding should be evaluated further.
The participants in the present study were exposed to natural challenge within three months of
receiving the CR virus vaccine. The outbreak of
influenza B was not a major one and was caused
by a virus antigenically different from that in the
vaccine. However, it was possible to show serologically that the vaccine did significantly protect
against infection with influenza B virus. The use
of serologic infection rates in determining the protective efficacy of inactivated virus vaccine has
been questioned and defended. The major issue
here is the high antibody titers induced after vaccination; some investigators have suggested that
individuals with such high titers cannot respond
further if infected [26], whereas most researchers
have disagreed, citing a large body of data [27]. In
contrast, with the CR virus vaccine the antibody
response is generally modest. Thus, because serologic determination of protective efficacy is acceptable with inactivated virus vaccines, it certainly is
appropriate with attenuated virus preparations.
The protective efficacy of 750/0 cannot be treated
as a firm figure because of the relatively small
numbers involved. Therefore, it is premature to
compare the efficacy of these attenuated virus vaccines to the inactivated virus vaccines.
School-aged children are largely responsible for
dissemination of influenza A virus in the community by introducing infections into the home.
Evidence in support of this statement comes from
observational studies, epidemic models, and vaccination of a large proportion of school-aged chil63
dren in a community [5, 6,28,29]. In epidemics of
influenza B, children experience much of the morbidity, and school closings frequently occur [30].
Thus, in infections with both types of influenza
virus, vaccination of children and young adults
would seem to be a logical method to prevent
disease in vaccinees and to control further community spread. Because of the ease of administration and the potential for long-lasting protection,
use of live, attenuated virus vaccines offers a
number of advantages over the currently used inactivated virus vaccines. Because a vaccine containing both influenza A and influenza B virus
components would be desirable for such a population, the finding that CR influenza B viruses, like
CR influenza A viruses, appear protective and acceptable encourages the hope that such community control will be possible.
