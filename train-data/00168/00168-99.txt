after vaccination with Pandemrix: a populationand registry-based cohort study with over 2 years
of follow-up. J Intern Med 2014; 275: 172–190.
Objectives. To investigate the association between
vaccination with Pandemrix and risk of selected
neurological and immune-related diseases including narcolepsy.
Design. Population-based prospective cohort study
using data from regional vaccination registries and
national health registries.
Setting. Seven healthcare regions in Sweden comprising 61% of the Swedish population.
Subjects. Study population of 3 347 467 vaccinated
and 2 497 572 nonvaccinated individuals (vaccination coverage 60%) followed between 2009 and
2011 for 6.9 million person-years after exposure
and 6.0 million person-years without exposure.
Main outcome measure and analysis. First recorded diagnosis of neurological and immune-related diseases. Relative risks [hazard ratios (HRs) with
95% confidence intervals (CIs)] assessed using
Cox regression, adjusted for covariates.
Results. For all selected neurological and immunerelated outcomes under study, other than allergic
vaccine reactions (for which we verified an expected
increase in risk) and narcolepsy, HRs were close to
1.0 and always below 1.3. We observed a three-fold
increased risk of a diagnosis of narcolepsy (HR:
2.92, 95% CI: 1.78–4.79; that is, four additional
cases per 100 000 person-years) in individuals
≤20 years of age at vaccination and a two-fold
increase (HR: 2.18, 95% CI: 1.00–4.75) amongst
young adults between 21 and 30 years of age. The
excess risk declined successively with increasing
age at vaccination; no increase in risk was seen
after 40 years of age.
Conclusions. For a large number of selected neurological and immune-related diseases, we could neither
confirm any causal association with Pandemrix nor
refute entirely a small excess risk. We confirmed an
increased risk for a diagnosis of narcolepsy in
individuals ≤20 years of age and observed a trend
towards an increased risk also amongst young
adults between 21 and 30 years.

Introduction
In September 2009, the ASO3 adjuvanted (including squalene and alpha tocopherol) A(H1N1)
vaccine Pandemrix (GlaxoSmithKline, Brentford,
UK) was authorized for use in the EU; over 30
million individuals were subsequently vaccinated
[1]. In Sweden, Pandemrix was exclusively used in
172 ª 2013 The Association for the Publication of the Journal of Internal Medicine
Original Article
a mass vaccination programme launched in October 2009, resulting in an overall vaccination coverage of about 60% [2].
In mid-2010, an unexpected increase in the occurrence of narcolepsy in children and adolescents
emerged from adverse drug reaction reports on
Pandemrix in Sweden and Finland, and these
reports have since been substantiated in epidemiological studies in these two countries [3–5]. We
have previously reported a four-fold increase in the
risk of a diagnosis of narcolepsy in Sweden [3].
Similar observations have been made regarding
narcolepsy risk in children/adolescents in Ireland
[6], the UK [7] and France [8]. With respect to
adults, a three- to five-fold increased risk of narcolepsy was recently reported in Finnish individuals aged 20–64 years [9], and the findings of the
French study [8] suggested a four-fold increased
risk of narcolepsy in vaccinated individuals (mainly
with Pandemrix) 20 years of age and above [8].
Because of an assumed immunological mechanism
in the pathophysiology of narcolepsy, possible
adverse effects of vaccination on other neuroimmunological and autoimmune diseases are considered relevant.
Previous experience of other influenza vaccines has
led to concerns about the risks of immune-related
reactions [10, 11] and neurological adverse events
such as Guillain–Barre syndrome (GBS) [12  –14]
and Bell’s palsy [15, 16]. Data on the safety of the
adjuvanted vaccine Pandemrix (other than with
regard to narcolepsy) have, however, so far been
lacking. A small excess risk of GBS was suggested
in a Canadian cohort study [17], but no change in
the risk of GBS amongst vaccinated individuals
was found in two European studies [18, 19]. The
risk of convulsions in vaccinated children did not
seem to be increased in two recent studies [20, 21].
In a previous registry study, no adverse effects
were observed on GBS, multiple sclerosis (MS),
type 1 diabetes (T1D) or rheumatoid arthritis,
whereas small excess risks were found for Bell’s
palsy, paraesthesia and inflammatory bowel disease in individuals with medical risk factors
(analyses of narcolepsy were not conclusive due
to small numbers of cases) [22]. However, this
study was limited to the Stockholm population and
to a follow-up of about 1 year after vaccination.
Because of the findings regarding narcolepsy, concerns have been raised for the general safety of the
Pandemrix vaccine leading to the initiation of the
present broad safety study of targeted neurological
and immune-related outcomes in a large study
population and with a prolonged follow-up period.
The objectives of this study were (i) to investigate
the association between vaccination with Pandemrix and selected neurological and immune-related
diseases, (ii) to confirm the association with narcolepsy in vaccinated children/adolescents and (iii)
to explore this association in adults.
The study was undertaken by the Medical Products
Agency (MPA) in collaboration with Karolinska
Institutet and the seven participating healthcare
regions/counties.
Subjects and methods
Study design
We performed an observational register-based
cohort study with prospectively collected population-based data.
Setting
Vaccinations with Pandemrix were carried out
between 1 October 2009 and 31 March 2010. All
Swedish residents were offered the ASO3 adjuvanted vaccine Pandemrix. Healthcare workers
and groups considered to be at high risk of
complications from influenza, such as pregnant
women and patients with serious medical conditions (i.e. chronic heart or lung disease, diabetes
mellitus, chronic liver or kidney failure, immune
suppression, extreme obesity and severe neuromuscular disease), were prioritized to receive early
vaccination. The overall vaccine coverage in our
study population was 57%, but varied with geography and with age (highest at 0–9 years of age and
lowest at 20–29 years) (Table 1).
Participants
The original study population of 5 933 762 individuals consisted of all inhabitants, as of 1 January 2009, of seven Swedish regions (the healthcare
regions of Skane and Vastra G € otaland and the €
counties of Kalmar, Osterg € otland, Stockholm, €
Varmland and Norrbotten). We excluded individu- €
als who died (n = 40 656), emigrated from Sweden
(n = 13 633), had inconsistent information on
migration (n = 43) or moved out of the study area
(n = 34 391) before the start of the study period on

1 October 2009; thus, 5 845 039 eligible individuals remained for follow-up, that is, 61% of the
Swedish population (Table 1).
Data sources and exposure
Registration of vaccination status was considered
to be complete in four of the seven regions, because
in these regions reimbursement to the vaccination
centres required registration of the vaccinated
individual. In the three other regions (the counties
of Kalmar, Varmland and Norrbotten; together €
comprising 13% of the study population), a webbased system for vaccination registration was
used, which required informed consent. As a result
of the absence of consent, 16–22% of the vaccinated individuals in these three counties could not
be correctly ascertained as exposed because their
personal identification number (PIN, the unique
10-digit number, that is given to every newborn in
Sweden) could not be included and thus not be
linked to the vaccination registers; therefore, they
remained in the study population as unexposed.
Registrations included the PIN, vaccine dose (half
the adult dose is initially given to children below
12 years of age), order of vaccination (first, and in
children also the second dose) and the date and
site of vaccination.
Using the PIN, the individual’s vaccination data
were linked to the following nationwide and virtually complete registers: (i) the Population Registry
(Statistics Sweden), to delineate the study population and to define the exposed (i.e. all those
registered as vaccinated) and the unexposed
(assumed to be all remaining individuals belonging
to the study population) cohorts, and further to
define socio-economic and demographic variables,
(ii) the National Patient Register, the Prescribed
Drug Register and the Cancer Registry (National

Board of Health and Welfare), to identify hospitalizations and non-primary care outpatient visits to
identify the outcomes under study, and covariates,
(iii) the Medical Birth Register (National Board of
Health and Welfare), to identify pregnancy status
at vaccination, which was used as a covariate, and
(iv) the National Cause of Death Register (National
Board of Health and Welfare), to define deaths
during follow-up.
Outcomes
We selected a set of neurological and immunerelated outcomes for the present study based on (i)
previous influenza vaccine safety issues including
narcolepsy [3–5, 10–16], (ii) results from our previous study of H1N1 vaccination in Stockholm county
[22], and (iii) recommended follow-up of adverse
events of special interest [23]. On the basis of data on
physician-assigned International Classification of
Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10) codes from hospitalizations and outpatient specialized care visits (i.e.
referrals) from the Patient Register, supplemented
with data on prescriptions from the Prescribed Drug
Register, 10 neurological outcomes including narcolepsy and 31 other immune-related conditions
were defined (Table 2). As many of the outcomes
reflect chronic conditions that may have an insidious onset, and because we had access to data for
dates of visits and admissions rather than the date of
the actual onset of first symptom of a disorder, we
also identified possible ‘prodromal’ conditions, or
outcome-specific medications (Table 2). In all
analyses, those individuals fulfilling the outcome
definition before study start, using a 5-year ‘lookback’ period, were considered to have prevalent
disease and were excluded from risk assessment.
Statistical analysis
In an observational real-life study of de facto
vaccination with outcomes derived from routine
healthcare data, we sought to address the two
main threats to the validity of the findings: (i) the
possibility for selection bias due to targeted recruitment to vaccination of high-risk groups, and (ii) the
possibility of reverse causality because of prodromal states (preceding the date of the end-point
diagnosis) that may lead to vaccination rather than
the other way round. Thus, a stepwise statistical
approach was adopted.
First, we explored potential and measureable
predictors of vaccination: age, gender, county,
education, income, ethnicity, number of hospital
admission, number of ambulatory care visits at
specialist clinics and presence of diagnosed conditions (according to ICD-10 codes) during 1 year
prior to the start of the study. Potential predictors
were listed (Table 1) and assessed using Cox
regression. Analyses of the association between
vaccination and the occurrence of the outcomes
under investigation were subsequently adjusted
for these predictors in different models (see
below).
Secondly, because medical risk groups were initially considered a priority, all assessments of
vaccination risks were stratified according to the
time-point of vaccination (first 45 days of the
programme were categorized as ‘early’, and vaccinations occurring thereafter as ‘late’).
Thirdly, to avoid erroneous inclusion of prevalent
outcomes, we used outcome definitions (Table 2),
that is, prodromal diagnoses or treatments, to
exclude individuals with existing disease (in addition to the basic outcome definition, based on first
occurrence according to the diagnosis code).
Fourthly, for each study outcome, relative risks
were presented overall and by time since vaccination, as well as with respect to age at vaccination
for selected outcomes.
Fifthly, to verify that the study design was able to
identify expected outcomes, vaccination reactions
(ICD-10 code T88.1) were included as a ‘positive
control’.
Finally, to illustrate the impact of selection to/not
to vaccinate individuals with particular characteristics and morbidities, all-cause mortality was
included as an outcome.
Follow-up began on 1 October 2009 and ended on
the first date of a registered outcome, migration
from the study region, death or 31 December 2011
(the end of the study period; maximum follow-up
was 27 months).
The associations between vaccine exposure and
the predefined outcomes were assessed through
Cox regression using calendar time as the timescale with zero defined as 1 October 2009. Vaccination status was introduced as a time-dependent
dummy variable taking the value 0 from study
start until the date of vaccination and thereafter

the value 1, that is, individuals contributed unexposed person-time until their date of vaccination
(if vaccinated), and exposed person-time thereafter.
Five models were applied, the first by adjusting for
age (in 5-year bands), gender and county (model 1),
then successively adding potential confounders:
education and income (model 2), number of hospital
admissions and ambulatory care visits (model 3),
pregnancy status and presence of diagnoses defined
by ICD-10 codes (model 4) and ethnicity (model 5).
Variable categorizations are shown in Table 1. We
used the SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary,
NC, USA) in all analyses.
Results are presented as hazard ratios (HRs) with
95% confidence intervals (CIs). Because this was a
safety study with the aims of detecting possible
outcomes and confirming narcolepsy, we chose not
to adjust for multiple comparisons. In the main
results, HRs are presented from model 4, except
T1D and all-cause mortality for which the results
from model 5 are shown (ethnicity was considered
to be of potential importance for these outcomes).
All analyses were further stratified for different
aspects of time. First, analyses were stratified
according to the time-point of vaccination – within
45 days from the start of follow-up (early cohort)
and after more than 45 days (late cohort) – in order
to determine the potential residual effect of bias
due to channelling of high-risk groups (expected to
be over-represented early on in the vaccination
campaign). This stratification of vaccinated individuals was obtained by separate time-dependent
variables for the early and late cohorts. The reference group for the two exposure groups was all
individuals still not vaccinated at each calendar
day of follow-up. Secondly, we assessed risk
according to the time of vaccination (time during
the vaccination period in quartiles) both in
comparison with nonvaccinated and also as an
internal comparison within vaccinated individuals.
Thirdly, to reflect outcomes with a suspected
rapid onset after vaccination (e.g. GBS and Bell’s
palsy), analyses were stratified by follow-up time (i)
within 6 weeks versus more than 6 weeks since
vaccination and (ii) within 1 year versus more than
1 year after vaccination, to determine whether
associations were sustained in the longer term.
This stratification of risk according to time for
vaccinated individuals was also assessed by timedependent covariates where separate dummy
variables were created for the first 6 weeks/1 year
after vaccination versus more than 6 weeks/1 year
after vaccination. The reference group for these two
strata of exposed person-time is all unexposed
person-time at each calendar day of follow-up.
Ethical approval
The study was approved by the Ethics Review
Board in Uppsala in January 2011. Approval was
granted, conditional on information about the
study being reported through newspapers in the
seven regions/counties (Registration No. 2011/
427).
Results
Characteristics of the cohorts and predictors of vaccination
Overall, we found that vaccinated individuals had a
higher level of education, higher income, were more
often born in a Nordic country and consumed more
healthcare compared with nonvaccinated individuals (Table 1). Virtually, all groups of medical
diagnoses were more prevalent amongst those
who were vaccinated (data not shown). There were
also differences in the above-mentioned characteristics between individuals vaccinated early
(≤45 days) and later during the study period. Those
vaccinated in the early phase had a greater disease
burden in terms of prior healthcare consumption,
whereas those vaccinated later seemed to have a
lower or baseline prevalence in comparison with
unvaccinated individuals. We noted similar patterns for vaccination prediction in individuals
≤20 years of age.
The overall observation times were approximately
6.9 million person-years in the vaccination cohort
after exposure and 6.0 million person-years in the
nonexposed cohort and in the exposed cohort
before the time of vaccination.
Occurrence and relative risks of vaccine reactions and death from all
causes
Overall, 147 vaccinated individuals were diagnosed
with vaccine reactions (i.e. reactions that were
sufficiently serious to require hospital contact, that
is, through specialist care or admission) resulting
in a 20-fold increased risk during the first 6 weeks
following vaccination (HR: 19.6, 95% CI: 10.5–
36.3), but little increase thereafter (Table 2)
(vaccine reactions in the unexposed cohort were
assumed to be associated with other vaccines).
The adjusted HR (model 5) for death from any
cause following vaccination was just below unity
I. Persson et al. Safety of Pandemrix vaccination
ª 2013 The Association for the Publication of the Journal of Internal Medicine 179
Journal of Internal Medicine, 2014, 275; 172–190
(HR: 0.95, 95% CI: 0.94–0.96; based on 65 490
and 57 877 deaths amongst the vaccinated and
nonvaccinated individuals, respectively). When
stratified by age, the mortality rate was more than
30% lower amongst young vaccinated individuals
(10–29 years) and reduced by 10–15% in older age
groups. When stratified by time since vaccination,
the mortality rate following vaccination was
increased by approximately 20% in those vaccinated during the first half of the vaccination period
compared with unvaccinated individuals, whereas
mortality was reduced by 20–30% in those vaccinated during the later period (Appendix Fig. A1).
Occurrence and relative risks of selected neurological outcomes
Table 3 and Fig. 1 show adjusted HRs (model 4, for
outcome definitions excluding cases with prodromal states or medications at the start of vaccination) for neurological outcomes (including
narcolepsy, for comparison). Of the 11 overall
HRs, six had a lower 95% CI above 1.0; however,
four of these HR estimates were below 1.1 (the
exceptions being narcolepsy and acute disseminated myeloencephalitis; the latter was based on
only three exposed cases in the ≤6-week window).
In the early vaccination cohort, the point estimates
for Bell’s palsy, polyneuropathy, paraesthesia and
epilepsy were slightly increased (all HRs below 1.2);
all risk estimates were close to baseline for GBS
and MS.
Occurrence and relative risks of selected immune-related outcomes
Table 3 and Fig. 1 show the HRs for non-neurological autoimmune or immune-related outcomes.
Overall, for the 30 investigated outcomes, we found
that HRs for 14 were above unity (with a lower 95%
CI above 1.0), 11 of which were in the range
1.1–1.2, but only three were greater than 1.2. The
increased estimates were generally at a higher level
in the early versus the late vaccination cohort, with
the highest estimates for Sjogren’s syndrome and €
agranulocytosis (HR: 1.48, 95% CI: 1.31–1.66 vs.
HR: 1.38, 95% CI: 1.27–1.50, respectively). For the
composite outcome of inflammatory systemic
diseases, the risk estimate was not different from
baseline (HR: 1.00; 95% CI: 0.85–1.17).
Occurrence and relative risks of a diagnosis of narcolepsy
A total of 126 cases of diagnosed narcolepsy (after
the exclusion of one prodromal case diagnosed
with another sleep disturbance) were observed
amongst vaccinated individuals ≤20 years of age,
resulting in an overall three-fold risk increase in
this age group (HR: 2.92, 95% CI: 1.78–4.79;
Table 3). The magnitude of the risk increase did
not vary markedly between the early and late
vaccination cohorts, nor was there any difference
in HRs between the first and second year following
vaccination (P > 0.05). We calculated that this
overall risk increase would correspond to an
attributable incidence of 4.0 additional cases per
100 000 vaccinated children/adolescents per year.
The risk estimate for narcolepsy was (i) increased
two-fold (HR: 2.18, 95% CI: 1.00–4.75) in young
adults (21–30 years; 23 exposed cases), (ii) slightly
increased (HR: 1.53, 95% CI: 0.68–3.44; 18 cases)
in individuals aged 31–40 years, and (iii) close to
the baseline level (HR: 1.06, 95% CI: 0.64–1.76; 40
cases) in those aged >40 years. Hence, the relative
risk of narcolepsy during the study period declined
successively with increasing age at vaccination
(P for trend = 0.012) (Fig. 2). However, the decreasing trend amongst adults as a group was not
statistically significant (P for trend = 0.14).
Figure 3 shows an increase in the crude incidence
rates of narcolepsy, for individuals ≤20 years of
age, in 2011 as compared with 2009–2010; this
increase was greatest in the vaccinated cohort, but
present also in the unvaccinated group. In those
aged 21–30 years, a smaller increase in the incidence was observed, but restricted to vaccinated
individuals. There was no change in the incidence
amongst vaccinated or unvaccinated individuals
above 31 years of age.
Discussion
The main findings of this study were that for a
broad range of selected neurological and immunerelated diagnoses, risk estimates varied around 1.0
and were, when increased, generally at a low level
(10–30% increase), providing no convincing evidence for an association with the vaccination.
Furthermore, we confirmed a positive association
between a diagnosis of narcolepsy and Pandemrix
vaccination both in individuals ≤20 years of age
and in young adults aged 21–30 years. These
associations seemed robust across models.
The main threats to the validity in this study were
the possibility that pre-existing morbidity may
have introduced bias and led to both over- and
underestimations of risks, and uncertainty regardI. Persson et al. Safety of Pandemrix vaccination

ing the true onset time for some of the studied
outcomes, which could lead to the inclusion of
prevalent cases and thereby an error of reverse
causality (vaccination could actually have occurred
after the true onset of disease).
Interpretation of the data was influenced by four
main observations. First, most HRs were reduced
in magnitude after adjustment for healthcare consumption in the preceding year. Secondly, the risk
estimate based on the first registered ICD code was
often reduced after the exclusion of individuals
with previous health care due to possible early
states of the disease under study (Appendix Table
A1). Thirdly, increased HRs were higher in the early
than in the late vaccination cohort (Fig. 1). Further, a systematic analysis showed that 24 of all 42
overall HRs analysed were reduced when comparing time of vaccination in the last half with that of
the first half of the vaccination period (data not
shown). Finally, it is noteworthy that the risk of
death (after adjustment) was lower in individuals
vaccinated late in the programme, compared with
unvaccinated individuals, but was higher in those
vaccinated early (Appendix Fig. A1). Thus, these
observations support the influence of selection of
individuals for vaccination.
For the vast majority of outcomes, except vaccine
reactions and narcolepsy, the adjusted HRs
(Table 3 and Fig. 1) were close to or only marginally
greater than 1. Thus, we believe that a cautious
interpretation is warranted; a residual or unmeasured confounding, or reverse causality, might
entirely or partly explain the low-level increases
for some of the associations. However, at the same
time and for this reason, a small increase in risk as
a result of vaccination cannot be completely ruled
out.
With the exception of narcolepsy, we could not
establish convincing associations between PandemFig. 1 Summary plots (hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals) for the entire study population and the early and late

rix vaccination and any of the neurological outcomes. This seemingly contradicts the results from
the previous smaller study in Stockholm with a
shorter follow-up period, in which small risk
increases were observed for polyneuropathy, paraesthesia and Bell’s palsy (which were considered to
be caused partially or entirely by selection bias) [22].
Regarding GBS, previous reports on the association with adjuvanted H1N1 vaccines have shown
inconsistent results [17–19, 22]. No association
has been reported between Pandemrix vaccination
and grand mal epilepsy convulsions [20, 21].
We also found that no positive associations could
be established between Pandemrix and any of the
immune-related disorders (except vaccination
reactions). The outcomes studied represent a large
group of autoimmune and chronic inflammatory
diseases with variable clinical course and different
pathogenetic mechanisms. For diseases such as
rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn’s disease and asthma
– with typically chronic and relapsing courses and
with the possible appearance of first symptoms
long before the established diagnosis – we believe
that it is difficult to determine the actual time of
onset. Taking this uncertainty into account, and
the increased risk estimates for Crohn’s disease
observed in individuals ≤20 years of age (Table 3),
we propose that further investigations could be
warranted. To date, the findings from one large
study of H1N1 vaccination and risk of flare in
Crohn’s disease did not provide support for an
adverse effect [24].
We did note slightly increased risk estimates for
T1D in subjects aged 10–19 years (Table 3). However, a positive association between H1N1 vaccination and T1D seems less plausible when
considering T1D incidence data from the nationwide SweDiabKids registry [25] in which the annual
number of new cases in the relevant age group was
relatively stable between 2007 and 2011 (440, 397,
411, 424 and 388 cases, respectively), thus with no
increase following vaccination in 2009.
The absence of an increase in risk of events related
to typical autoimmune diseases, for example systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis,
myasthenia gravis and autoimmune thyroiditis,
would suggest a very specific immunological mechanism underlying the development of narcolepsy
after Pandemrix exposure. It is of interest that most
organ-specific inflammatory diseases, often
regarded as autoimmune (with MS as an example),
have combined causes involving lifestyle/environmental factors and predisposing genes, particuFig. 2 Hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals (logarithmic scale) for diagnosed narcolepsy during the study
period, by age at vaccination (P for trend = 0.012).

larly HLA class II genotypes. Almost 100% of
patients with narcolepsy with cataplexy carry the
HLA class II allele DQB1*06:02 [26]. It is also
interesting that DRB1 and DQB1 genes are closely
located, and variants are in linkage disequilibrium;
that is, they are co-inherited. DRB1*15:01 and
DQB1*06:02 that predispose towards MS and
narcolepsy, respectively, are thus always present
together in the Swedish population. It is therefore
noteworthy that in the present study, we found no
risk increase for MS or monosymptomatic manifestations associated with MS, such as optic neuritis and sensory disturbances.
With regard to narcolepsy, our finding of a threefold increased risk corroborates previous reports of
an increased risk in children/adolescents [3–7,
27]. Of note, the higher-magnitude risk increases
in other studies, where determination relied on
clinical case ascertainment and medical record
data [4–9], are not directly comparable with the
present registry-based data. The overall risk estimate in the present study is somewhat lower than
in our previous registry study [3], using the same
registry-based ascertainment of diagnosed narcolepsy cases. This is likely to be due to the fact that
the incidence of diagnosed narcolepsy also
increased in the unvaccinated cohort in the current
study (Fig. 3), highlighting the possibility of stimulated detection, diagnosis and reporting from a
prevalent pool of cases. An increase amongst
unvaccinated individuals could also be an effect
of an external factor. This factor may be infection
with the H1N1 influenza virus itself, as indicated in
a study from China [28]; however, a recent study
from Finland based on serological data could not
demonstrate an association with the natural H1N1
infection [29].
Importantly, we also observed a two-fold increased
risk of narcolepsy in young adults (21–30 years of
age), which is considered to be valid in spite of the
methodological limitations discussed above. The
increased risk in adults is consistent with the
findings from a recent Finnish study in 20- to 64-
year-old participants [9] and a French study in
individuals aged 20 years and older [8]; however,
neither of these two studies presented results in
narrower age groups. Although we showed an
association in young adults and a declining risk
with age (Fig. 2), it is neither possible (due to
random variation) nor biologically relevant to
define more precisely an upper age limit for the
elevated risk.
Our findings raise questions regarding the mechanisms by which Pandemrix could exert differential
effects according to age. Even if the peak incidence
for naturally occurring narcolepsy is much in line
with the findings in the present study, that is,
<30 years of age [27], this does not rule out the
possibility of a causal relationship in older individuals.
There are several strengths of this study: (i) the
large study population (yielding about 6.9 and 6.0
million person-years of observation in the vaccinated and unvaccinated cohorts, respectively)
allowing for subgroup analyses, (ii) the population-based approach, (iii) the high completeness of
vaccination registration, (iv) the complete record
linkage follow-up of selected health outcomes in
national registries (independent of vaccination
exposure) for more than 2 years, (v) and the
availability of data on comorbidity and drug prescription registry data for definitions of incident
outcomes and covariates.
However, a number of limitations should also be
considered. Data from primary care were not
available. The opportunity for identifying an outcome might be greater for individuals with medical
risk factors, that is, those who were considered to
warrant early vaccination and who were mainly
cared for in a hospital setting, than for those
vaccinated in the late phase and who received
mainly primary care. Because of multiple analyses
for over 50 outcomes, a number of false-positive
risk estimates would be expected by chance.
There are also important limitations specifically
regarding narcolepsy. First, ascertainment of narcolepsy cases was based on registered diagnoses;
there was no opportunity in this study to validate
these diagnoses. However, in the previous registry
study [3], cases of narcolepsy from the National
Patient Register were validated against case data
from medical records examined by experts in a
case inventory study [4]. Thus, amongst 44 cases
subject to detailed scrutiny, the diagnosis was fully
verified in 89%. Further, in the case inventory
study [4], it was shown that the same diagnostic
procedure, the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT),
had been used for all included cases (n = 81).
Thus, neurologists consistently apply an objective
method such as MSLT for the diagnosis of narcolepsy in patients in Sweden. These observations
indirectly support the validity of our registry diagnoses in the National Patient Register.

Secondly, we had no information on the date of
onset of first symptoms of narcolepsy. Therefore,
there is a possibility of inclusion of prevalent cases
as well as of bias as a result of accelerated
diagnosis in vaccine-exposed individuals, especially amongst adults. Our findings of an association also in young adults are, however, supported
by the following observations: (i) a clear relationship with successively decreasing risk with
increasing age at vaccination was present (Fig. 2),
(ii) there was no indication of stimulated reporting
in adults aged 20 years and older (in the unvaccinated subjects) (Fig. 3), thus challenging the possibility of bias due to stimulated reporting, and (iii)
when comparing the results (crude incidence rates)
for the early (2009–2010) and late (2011) observation periods, the risk relationship was observed
also in the latter period for the age groups up to
21–30 years (Fig. 3). The problem of prevalent
disease bias would be expected to decrease as
observation time is extended; our finding would
thus support a real risk increase in this age group.
Furthermore, it is not plausible that a biological
effect would cease abruptly at the age of 20 years.
In the Swedish data, there was no clustering at the
lower boundary of the young adult age group, that
is, 12 cases were 21–25 years old and 11 cases
were 26–30 years of age.
Finally, we had no information on influenza infections and other potential immunological triggers
for individual study participants. Thus, there was
no opportunity to determine whether other factors
had acted in concert with the vaccination to affect
the risk of narcolepsy.
Conclusions
In this large cohort study, we found no convincing
evidence of a risk increase for selected neurological
or immune-related diseases, except narcolepsy, in
Pandemrix-vaccinated compared with unvaccinated individuals. We confirmed an increased risk
of diagnosed narcolepsy in individuals ≤20 years of
age vaccinated with Pandemrix and found a successively decreasing risk with age at vaccination,
as well as an indication of an increase in risk also
in young adults (aged 21–30 years).
We recognize that no epidemiological study, not
even a study of this size, may entirely rule out
small excess risks at the population level. Nor may
such a study establish a cause–effect relationship
in an individual patient. Nevertheless, the results
of this study should have implications not only for
future narcolepsy research but also for the development of new influenza vaccines.
