Abstract Although vaccines against influenza can reduce
maternal morbidity and mortality, large-scale data on
adverse effects in the offspring are scarce. Historical cohort
study in Stockholm County, Sweden. We linked H1N1
vaccination data (Pandemrix, a mono-valent AS03 adjuvanted H1N1 vaccine) with pregnancy and birth data from
21,087 women with singleton offspring conceived between
February 2009 and January 2010 (vaccinated during
pregnancy: n = 13,297 vs. unvaccinated: n = 7,790). Data
were analysed by conceptualizing the observational cohort
as a series of nested cohorts defined at each week of gestation. Logistic regression estimated odds ratios (ORs) for
low birth weight (LBW,\2,500 g), preterm birth (\37
completed weeks), small-for-gestational age (SGA, \10th
percentile of the gestational age-specific birth weight
within the cohort), low 5-min Apgar score (\7), and caesarean section. Data were adjusted for potential confounders, including maternal age, body mass index,
smoking, parity, civil status and comorbidities. Compared
with infants of non-vaccinated women, infants of vaccinated women had similar adjusted ORs (95 % CI) for LBW
(0.91; 0.79–1.04), preterm birth (0.99; 0.89–1.10), SGA
(0.97; 0.90–1.05), low Apgar score (1.05, 0.84–1.31), and a
marginal risk reduction for caesarean section (0.94,
0.89–0.99). H1N1 vaccination during pregnancy, using an
AS03-adjuvanted vaccine, does not appear to adversely
influence offspring risks of LBW, preterm birth, SGA, or
low Apgar score. Our results suggest that this vaccine is
safe for the offspring when used in different stages of
pregnancy.

Introduction
Influenza is associated with considerable mortality and
morbidity [1, 2], and regularly causes pandemics, due to its
ability to undergo antigenic shifts. In 2009 a new subtype
of influenza A, H1N1, was discovered [3, 4]. The H1N1
influenza virus is part of the Orthomyxoviridae family [5,
6], and was formally declared to cause a pandemic in mid2009 by the WHO [7]. The European Medicine Agency
(EMA) authorized three pandemic vaccines through an
accelerated procedure [8]. Due to the large demand for
H1N1 vaccines and consequent relative lack of available
antigens for vaccine production, the WHO recommended
the use of adjuvant-based H1N1 vaccines. In Sweden, one
single vaccine, Pandemrix (containing AS03 as adjuvant),
was offered to all residents free of charge.
Pregnant women are especially prone to develop severe
influenza [9, 10], and this was confirmed in the early phase
of the H1N1 pandemic [11–14]. Given this knowledge,
pregnant women were, in the Swedish national H1N1 vaccination campaign taking place in 2009–2010, recommended vaccination at any stage of the pregnancy [15].
Although H1N1 vaccination in pregnancy has obvious
advantages, it also involves several hypothetical risks for
the fetus [16]. Such adverse outcomes may be triggered
through reactions to viral or non-viral components of the
vaccine, or by antibodies produced in response to the vaccine. A number of papers have been published on adverse
pregnancy outcomes in women vaccinated against H1N1
during pregnancy [17–32], and most of these studies found
no association between vaccination against H1N1 during
pregnancy and risks of adverse pregnancy outcomes. Some
studies even report lower risks among vaccinated than
among non-vaccinated women, [19, 20, 23, 24, 30, 31]
findings that have been explained by selection bias.
Of relevance for the theoretical safety concern for the
Pandemrix vaccine is also the finding in several countries,
e.g. Sweden [33], Finland [34] and Ireland [35], of an
increased risk of narcolepsy in children/adolescents,
assumed to be caused by immunological mechanisms.
The main objective of this population-base cohort study
was to examine the risks of adverse pregnancy outcomes in
pregnant women undergoing H1N1 vaccination, by conceptualizing the observational cohort as a series of nested
cohorts defined at each week of gestation [36].
Methods
We linked H1N1 vaccination data (Pandemrix [15]) with
pregnancy and birth data from women recorded as pregnant
2009–2010 in the Stockholm County region; and calculated
odds ratios (ORs) of low birth weight (LBW), preterm birth,
small-for-gestational-age (SGA) birth, low 5-min Apgar
score and caesarean section in offspring to mothers who were
vaccinated during pregnancy compared with non-vaccinated.
Databases, registers and co-variates
Already before the H1N1 vaccination campaign, the Stockholm County had established a web-based vaccination register
called ‘‘Vaccinera’’ [37]. Each H1N1 vaccination (including
the patient’s personalidentity number [PIN] [38], batch number
of the vaccination, medical contraindications against vaccinations and prevalent chronic conditions meriting H1N1 vaccination) had to be registered in Vaccinera before the local health
care suppliers were reimbursed for their vaccination costs.
‘‘Obstetrix’’ (Siemens incorp.) is the electronic standardized antenatal, obstetric and neonatal record in use in
Stockholm County which has been mandatory since January 1st, 2008. Obstetrix prospectively collects information from first antenatal visit (commonly at 8–12
gestational weeks) until the mother and infant are discharged from the delivery hospital. Also, Obstetrix
includes a PIN used as the unique identifier, allowing for
linkage with other databases and registers. The PINs were
used to link the Obstetrix and Vaccinera databases. To
protect the integrity of individual patients in the research
project, PINs were replaced by unique serial numbers.
Participants
The study consists of a cohort of all liveborn singleton infants
in Stockholm County to Swedish mothers who conceived their
pregnancy between February 2009 and January 2010
(n = 21,087). Figure 1 describes the inclusion and exclusion
criteria of the study cohort. Estimated date of conception was
calculated from date of birth minus gestational age. Characteristics of study participants are presented in Table 1.
Exposure
The exposure was H1N1 vaccination (one dose of Pandemrix) at any time during the pregnancy before the 36th
week as recorded in the vaccination database ‘‘Vaccinera’’.

H1N1 vaccinations took place between October 2009 and
April 2010, and 90 % of the doses were given before the
end of 2009. In total, 13,297 women were vaccinated
against H1N1 during pregnancy before the 36th week.
Figure 2 shows the gestational age at the time to exposure
to H1N1 influenza vaccine according to date of
vaccination.
Reference individuals consisted of women abstaining
from vaccination during pregnancy or vaccinated against
H1N1 after the 36th week (n = 7,790).
Co-variates
At the mother’s first antenatal visit, the woman spends
around 1 h with the midwife for an interview and an
examination. The interview is to a large extent focused on
health-related issues. Women are asked about current
smoking habits, and are categorized into non-smokers (i.e.
non-daily smokers), moderate and heavy smokers (1–9
and C10 cigarettes per day, respectively). Body mass index
was defined as measured weight in kilograms divided by
self-reported height in m2
). Parity was defined as number
of previous childbirths. Information about maternal age
was collected at delivery. We used the ‘Stockholm Mosaic’
system [39] of living conditions and economic situation as
a proxy for socioeconomic status. The Mosaic system is
based on eleven mutually exclusive categories (e.g. living
in poor urban apartment, multicultural suburb, affluent
inner city, countryside etc.), and was originally devised to
create a cartographic background for urban planners and
citizens. The Mosaic system involves 120 smaller urban
agglomerations
Decisions to vaccinate may be influenced by co-morbidity, which also may affect pregnancy outcomes. We
considered prevalent co-morbidity before the time when
the general vaccination scheme started. We defined comorbidity as having any of the following conditions
recorded in the Obstetrix database at first antenatal visit:
cardiovascular disease including venous thromboembolism, psychiatric disease, jaundice, endocrinologic disorder, pulmonary disease/asthma, renal disease,
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), diabetes mellitus, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), epilepsy, and chronic
hypertension.
Outcome measure
Our five outcomes were low birth weight
(LBW, \2,500 g), preterm birth (B36 completed weeks),
small-for-gestational age birth (SGA, defined as less than
the 10th percentile of the gestational age-specific birth
weight within the cohort), low 5-min Apgar score (\7) and
caesarean section. Gestational age and the start of pregnancy was defined according to early second trimester
ultrasound, or if not available, according to date of last
menstruation period. Routine early second trimester ultrasonic scans were offered to all women free of charge, and
more than 95 % of the pregnant women accept this offer
[40].
Statistics
As previously described by Hernan et al. [36] in other
contexts, we conceptualized the observational cohort as a
sequence of nested cohorts defined at each week of pregnancy between October 13, 2009 (first date of vaccination)
and January 1st, 2010, by restricting the study population
to women who (1) had no events in that specific week; and
(2) had at the beginning of each week, not yet been vaccinated. In each nested cohort, mothers were considered
exposed if they were vaccinated in that gestational week
and were followed up until the end of pregnancy, Women
who were vaccinated at a later stage of the pregnancy,
contributed as unexposed in each nested cohort defined at
the gestational weeks before vaccination and as exposed in
the nested cohort defined at the gestational week when the
vaccination occurred. Hence, we pooled all cohort studies

in a single analysis and we evaluated the potential heterogeneity of the effect estimates of each gestational week
by including an interaction term between the vaccination
status and week of gestation. We estimated ORs of adverse
pregnancy outcome in vaccinated versus unvaccinated
women by fitting a logistic regression adjusted for a
number of potential measured confounders, including
maternal age, maternal body mass index at the beginning
of the pregnancy, smoking status, parity, socioeconomic
status, specific comorbidities measured at the first visit
during the pregnancy, and month at recruitment into the
specific cohort study. Since most women participated in
multiple cohorts, we estimated robust variance using
clustered sandwich estimators to allow for intra-group
correlation.
Furthermore, we stratified the pooled analyses by trimester of pregnancy, because vaccination in the first trimester was more likely to be administered to women with
comorbidities and exposures may have differential effects
depending on the timing of pregnancy.
To further check the robustness of our results to misclassification introduced by women who were not vaccinated at the beginning of follow-up but were vaccinated
later in pregnancy (on average, 30 % of the unvaccinated
women in each nested trial), we performed a sensitivity
analysis in which we excluded these women. This approach
is less prone to exposure misclassification but more
strongly affected by confounding by indication. When the
study was restricted to pregnancies ending at term (which
is necessary to avoid reverse causation if women vaccinated in late pregnancy are excluded), results from this
sensitivity analysis were very similar to those obtained in
the main analysis. We thus report only results from the
main analysis in the paper.
We defined statistical significance as 95 % CI for risk
estimates not including 1.0. Statistics were calculated using
STATA 11.1.
Ethics
The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee
of Karolinska Institutet, which deemed that no individual
informed consent was required.
Results
Of 21,087 liveborn infants in Stockholm County conceived
between February 2009 and January 2010, some 63.1 %
had been exposed to H1N1 vaccination (Table 1). Some
75 % of the women had been vaccinated between October
and November 2009; women vaccinated in December were
generally in the beginning of their pregnancy (Fig. 2).
There was evidence of socio-demographic differences
between vaccinated and unvaccinated women. Specifically,
compared to unvaccinated women, vaccinated women were
older, more often lived in the inner city (including affluent
inner city), or in an ‘‘affluent suburb’’ and were less frequently smokers. There were no major differences in
prevalence of pre-existing specific co-morbidities between
vaccinated and unvaccinated women (supplementary
Table 1, Appendix).
Main analyses
Proportions of LBW infants were 2.5 % among vaccinated
women and 3.9 % among unvaccinated women (Table 2).
Proportions of preterm births were 4.8 % in the vaccinated

respectively. Proportions of low Apgar score were 1.0 % in
the vaccinated group and 1.2 % in the unvaccinated group,
and finally proportions of caesarean section were 19.8 and
20.8 %, respectively.
Crude and adjusted ORs are reported in Table 3. Compared with infants of non-vaccinated women, infants of
vaccinated women had similar adjusted ORs for LBW
(0.91; 0.79–1.04), preterm birth (0.99; 0.89–1.10), SGA
(0.97; 0.90–1.05), low Apgar score (1.05, 0.84–1.31), and a
marginal risk reduction for caesarean section (0.94,
0.89–0.99).
There was no evidence of time-related heterogeneities of
the effects of vaccination on pregnancy reproductive outcomes (p = 0.16 for LBW, p = 0.46 for preterm birth,
p = 0.80 for SGA, p = 0.70 for Apgar score, p = 0.46 for
caesarean section). Results stratified by trimester of vaccination are reported in Table 3.
Discussion
In this population-based cohort study of pregnant women
with a vaccination rate of 63 %, we found no increased
risks of LBW, preterm birth, SGA, low Apgar score but a
marginally decreased risk for caesarean section in births
after H1N1 vaccination. This is reassuring because pregnant women are at risk for severe influenza and complications [11, 32]. Our results support that this particular
H1N1 vaccine (Pandemrix), given during different stages
of the pregnancy, was safe for the offspring, alleviating
concerns based on theoretical grounds or from pharmacovigilance reporting.

Until now research on adverse pregnancy outcomes in
women vaccinated against H1N1 during pregnancy has
been limited [17–32]. Of the eight larger studies (vaccinated women: n = 1,957–25,976), [19–21, 23, 24, 30–32]
four report statistically significantly decreased risks of
LBW [19, 20, 23, 30], while a Danish study (including
6,989 vaccinated subjects), using propensity score-matched
analyses of women vaccinated in the second or third trimester, found a non-significant positive association with
LBW (OR = 1.14; 0.94–1.38) [21], and a Norwegian study
reported a neutral relationship with LBW [32]. Vaccination
against H1N1 during pregnancy has in several previous
studies been associated with reduced risks of preterm birth
[19, 20, 23, 24, 31] and SGA births [20, 23]. The inverse
relationship between H1N1 vaccination and adverse pregnancy outcome has generally been explained by residual
confounding, and that healthier individuals to a larger
extent receive influenza vaccinations [41].
First among the strengths of the present study is our
access to detailed data on vaccination through the regional
Vaccinera Register, and during the study period 63 % of
pregnant women underwent vaccination. The vaccination
rate is high and likely representative. It should be compared with the vaccination rate of 12 % (of 155,526
women, 18,612 were vaccinated) as reported in an earlier
nationwide Swedish study based on records from the
Medical Birth Register [19]. Thus, it is obvious that the
vaccination coverage in the Swedish Medical Birth Register is incomplete with a risk of false-negative controls,
driving any risk estimate towards the null. A second
strength of the present study is the extensive data on
comorbidity (and the vaccination rate in these groups), as
well as our data on other potential confounders such as
smoking and BMI.
By analysing an observational study like a sequence of
nested cohort studies defined at each week of pregnancy,
we could use vaccination status as a time-dependent variable avoiding issues of reverse causality (i.e. duration of
pregnancy affecting the likelihood of vaccination) as well
as evaluate the potential heterogeneity of the effect estimates of each gestational week. From a clinical perspective, this approach allowed us to evaluate the effect of
vaccination on the reproductive outcomes for each gestational week. Further, it reduced the possibility for confounding by indication. It should be noticed that in each
nested cohort unexposed women at enrolment could still be
vaccinated at a later stage of the pregnancy, thus possibly
introducing misclassification of the vaccination status and
underestimation of the effect of the vaccine. As mentioned
in the methods, when we carried out a specific sensitivity
analysis aiming to decrease exposure misclassification (at
the expense of the likelihood of confounding by indication), results were not altered substantially, suggesting that
misclassification did not play a major role in our findings.
Since almost 100 % of all pregnant women attend the
free of charge maternal antenatal health care, Sweden has a
virtually complete coverage of pregnancies, selection bias
is unlikely. Furthermore, the vaccination program in
Sweden was free of charge. Spontaneous reporting can
serve as a tool for generating signals of adverse pregnancy
outcomes. However, such pharmacovigilance reporting is
likely to be incomplete and further more intense for
exposed individuals and at the time of vaccination due to
an enhanced awareness of adverse outcomes in pregnant
women. Spontaneous reports could therefore be biased or
miss long-term consequences of vaccination. In a U.S.
study, almost half of all adverse events were reported less
than a week after vaccination [17]. Furthermore, it seems

that individuals vaccinated in the beginning of a vaccine
campaign are more prone to self-report adverse outcomes
potentially due to publicity surrounding the campaign (‘‘the
Weber effect’’) [42]. In contrast, our study was based on
adverse events routinely recorded by personnel in the
health care system, independently of vaccination activities.
Another main strength of our study was the large number
of vaccinated women (n = 13,297), of whom more than 600
had a preterm birth. The statistical power and our access to
pregnancy dating and dates of vaccination allowed us to
stratify by trimesters. Some earlier studies have suffered
from small numbers of women vaccinated in the first trimester or lack of data on trimester altogether [18, 20]. Our
data on first trimester-vaccinations are important since some
authors have suggested that high-risk pregnant women were
likely to be vaccinated early in pregnancy [21]. In contrast
with Ka¨lle´n et al. [19], we found strikingly similar risk
estimates in the first versus the second/third trimester, suggesting that timing of H1N1 vaccination has little effect on
pregnancy outcome. Pasternak et al. [21] reported slightly
higher prevalence OR for preterm birth, and lower prevalence ORs or LBW and SGA in women vaccinated in the first
trimester. However their first-trimester data were only based
on 345 women undergoing vaccination, in contrast our study,
included 4,477 exposed women.
Earlier data have shown that vaccination against seasonal influenza is associated with a lower mortality [33].
We cannot rule out that vaccinated women live a healthier
life and that life style factors confer some benefits to their
offspring. Neither can we rule out that women with significant co-morbidity were more prone to undergo vaccination as shown by our research group earlier [33].
However, we adjusted for socioeconomic status using the
Stockholm Mosaic system [39], with no effect on the risk
estimates. In crude analyses, maternal vaccination protected against both LBW and SGA, but with adjustment for
potential confounders, the risk estimates approached unity
and were statistically non-significant. Although the rates of
LBW and preterm birth in our control population are
consistent with national data [43], we cannot however rule
out the existence of additional unmeasured confounding
influencing our results. We did not examine the risk of fetal
death after H1N1 vaccination. Earlier research has shown
that H1N1 vaccination during pregnancy is unlikely to
trigger fetal death [22, 30, 32].
Although we did not have access to individual-based
vaccination data against non-H1N1 seasonal influenza,
such vaccinations are uncommon in Sweden and highly
unlikely to influence our risk estimates more than marginally. During the influenza season 2009–2010 only 14
pregnant women in Stockholm County received such vaccination (personal communication, A˚ ke O¨rtqvist, Nov 18,
2012).
In conclusion, our study supports data from earlier
reports that H1N1 vaccination during pregnancy does not
adversely influence risks for LBW, preterm birth, SGA,
low Apgar score and caesarean section. Our results suggest
that this particular H1N1 vaccine administered during
different stages of pregnancy is safe for the fetus.
