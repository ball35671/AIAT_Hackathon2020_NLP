To monitor and evaluate the safety of the influenza A(H1N1) vaccine in pregnant women and its influence on the fetus and neonate, we performed a prospective study in which 122 pregnant Chinese women who received the influenza A(H1N1) vaccine and
104 pregnant women who did not receive any vaccine (serving as controls) were observed. The results indicated that the seroconversion rate in the vaccinated group was 90.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 82.6% to 95.5%). The rate of adverse events following immunization in the pregnant women who received the influenza A(H1N1) vaccine was 3.3%. The spontaneous abortion
rates in the vaccinated group and the unvaccinated group were 0.8% and 1.9%, respectively (exact probability test, P  0.470),
the prolonged-pregnancy rates were 8.2% and 4.8%, respectively (2  1.041, P  0.308), the low-birth-weight rates were 1.6%
and 0.95%, respectively (exact probability test, P  1.000), and the spontaneous-labor rates were 70.5% and 75%, respectively
(2  0.573, P  0.449). All newborns who have an Apgar score of >7 are considered healthy; Apgar scores of >9 were observed
in 38.5% and 57.7% of newborns in the vaccinated group and the unvaccinated group, respectively (2  8.274, P  0.004). From
these results, we conclude that the influenza A(H1N1) vaccine is safe for pregnant women and has no observed adverse effects on
fetal growth. (This study has been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov under registration no. NCT01842997.)
Pregnant women have a higher risk for serious complications
from influenza than nonpregnant women of reproductive age
(1–3). Since 1997, the Advisory Committee on Immunization
Practices (ACIP) has recommended that pregnant women receive
the inactivated influenza vaccine (4). Furthermore, in 2004, the
recommendation was expanded to cover all trimesters of pregnancy (5). In April 2009, the pandemic influenza A(H1N1) virus
infection was identified in China. Some studies showed that pregnant women had a higher rate of complications from the 2009
H1N1 virus infection than other populations (5–7). In September
2009, the China Food and Drug Administration licensed the first
2009 influenza A(H1N1) vaccines, which were inactivated splitvirus vaccines (8).
We conducted a prospective cohort study to monitor and evaluate the safety of pregnant women who have been inoculated with
the influenza A(H1N1) vaccine; our primary purposes were to
study the impact of the vaccine on the fetus and newborn and to
report the results.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design. The objectives of this study were to monitor and evaluate
the safety of the influenza A(H1N1) vaccine in pregnant women and to
determine the vaccine’s influence on the fetus and neonate. Healthy pregnant women with no history of novel influenza H1N1 virus infection or
novel influenza H1N1 vaccination were recruited. The recruited women
resided in 4 adjacent villages or communities of Xiangshui County in
Jiangsu Province. In the process of recruitment, all of the pregnant women
voluntarily participated in the study and were told that approximately half
of the participants would be administered 1 dose of influenza A(H1N1)
vaccine; however, the unvaccinated participants were allowed to request 1
dose of the influenza A(H1N1) vaccine at the end of the study, if appropriate. The pregnant women who received 1 dose of the influenza
A(H1N1) vaccine comprised the vaccinated group. Those in the control
group (unvaccinated) were defined as pregnant women who resided in the
same or adjacent village/community, had an age difference of 3 years
compared to the women in the vaccinated group, had a gestational age of
3 weeks, and had the same numbers of pregnancies as those in the
vaccinated group. The pregnant women in the control group were not
offered any vaccines. Blood samples of the pregnant women in the vaccinated group were collected once before vaccination and once 28 days after
vaccination. The pregnant women in the vaccinated group were also required to record any adverse experiences using a vaccination report card
(see Fig. 1 for a flow chart of the study).
We used active observation and passive reporting. Active observation
indicates that during the observation period of 30 min after the vaccination, doctors at the vaccination sites took the initiative to ask the vaccinated pregnant women about their reactions to the vaccination; the doctors also provided follow-up care at 72 h and 15 days. Passive reporting
indicates that before the vaccination, each participant signed an informed
consent form that included the vaccine varieties, function, and contraindications, the possibility of adverse events following immunization
(AEFI), and precautions. The participants were also told to report to the
doctors at the vaccination sites in a timely manner when fever, local swelling and induration, rash, or other symptoms occurred. The observation
time for the pregnancy outcomes lasted 28 days postpartum. The AEFI
and influenza-like illness were observed for 6 months after the vaccination.
Throat swab specimens from the pregnant women with influenza-like
illnesses were collected and sent to the influenza virus lab of the Jiangsu
Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Influenza A(H1N1)

virus reverse transcription (RT)-PCR detection kits obtained from the
national influenza virus lab were used for the purification and detection of
the influenza A(H1N1) virus. The kits contain two parts, (i) an influenza
A(H1N1) virus RNA purification kit and (ii) a ready-to-use detection kit
for the rapid and accurate detection of influenza A(H1N1) virus by
endpoint RT-PCR (9). Through the use of the kits, trained laboratory staff
completed the rapid extraction and quantitative detection of the H1
hemagglutinin viral RNA transcript of the influenza A(H1N1) virus in the
throat swab specimens from the participants.
Approval for the study was obtained from the Medical Ethics Committee of the Xiangshui County Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Each participant signed a written informed consent form.
Vaccine. A split-virion nonadjuvanted influenza A(H1N1) vaccine
(lot 200909008) produced by the Shanghai Institute of Biological Products was used. Each pregnant woman in the vaccinated group was administered 1 dose (15 g) of the H1N1 vaccine.
Safety observations. (i) AEFI. Any local reactions, such as redness,
pain, and induration at the injection site, systemic reactions, such as fever,
headache, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, and suspected adverse
reactions, such as anaphylactic shock, angioedema, urticaria, maculopapular rash, laryngeal edema, thrombocytopenic purpura, allergic purpura,
allergic local necrosis (Arthus) reaction, hot-water seizures, epilepsy, multiple neuritis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome, were reported.
(ii) Pregnancy complications and outcomes. Pregnancy complications include gestational hypertension disease, anemia, placenta previa,
placental abruption, preeclampsia and eclampsia, and liver disease. Adverse pregnancy outcomes include miscarriage, premature birth, stillbirth, low birth weight, and birth defects. Any such complications were
recorded by the maternity and child health care organizations or midwifery agencies included in this study, according to routine prenatal and
delivery services in the pregnant women’s health records. Each of these
organizations and agencies filled out a unified form on complications
during pregnancy and pregnancy outcome.
(iii) Report of influenza-like illness.Influenza-like illness was defined
according to WHO guidelines, which include documented fever
(38.0°C) and cough or sore throat. All of the participants were told to
contact the local vaccination site or the Xiangshui County Center for
Disease Control and Prevention in a timely manner once influenza-like
symptoms appeared. The local maternal and child health care organizations or midwifery organizations reported the influenza-like cases in a
timely manner to the Xiangshui County Center for Disease Control and
Prevention. After receiving the reports, the Xiangshui County Center for
Disease Control and Prevention was responsible for epidemiology surveys
and specimen collection.
Seroconversion. The seroconversion rate was defined as either a prevaccination hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) titer of 1:10 and a postvaccination titer of 1:40 or a prevaccination titer of 1:10 and a minimum 4-fold increase at 28 days postvaccination.
Statistical analysis. The following indicators were calculated when the
observation was completed: the incidence of AEFI, the incidence of spontaneous abortion, the incidence of induced abortion, the incidence of
preterm pregnancy, the incidence of postterm pregnancy, the proportion
of underweight babies, and the incidence of influenza-like illness. A chisquare test and an exact probability method were used to detect the differences between the 2 groups when appropriate. A Wilcoxon rank sum
test was used to compare the median duration of disease between the 2
groups. A P value of 0.05 was considered statistically significant, and all
of the tests were conducted using the R 3.0.0 statistical software (10).
RESULTS
Baseline of pregnant women observed. A total of 226 healthy
pregnant women 18 to 35 years old who had no history of novel
influenza H1N1 virus infection or novel influenza H1N1 vaccination participated in the study. The pregnancies ranged from 5
weeks’ to 32 weeks’ gestation. The subjects were divided into 1 of
2 groups, vaccinated (n  122) and unvaccinated (n  104) patients. The subjects in the vaccinated group were administered 1
dose (15 g) of H1N1 vaccine. The subjects in the unvaccinated
group received no vaccine and were considered controls for the
vaccinated group. Each group was divided into 4 age stratifications, 18 to 20 years, 21 to 25 years, 26 to 30 years, and 30 years.
The number of gestational weeks in the vaccinated group and
the unvaccinated group were stratified by patient age, as shown in
Table 1. There were no statistically significant differences in the
number of gestational weeks between the vaccinated group and
the unvaccinated group (2  2.898, P  0.408).
The numbers of gravidities in the vaccinated group and the
unvaccinated group were stratified by age, as shown in Table 2.
There were no statistically significant differences in the number of
gravidities between the vaccinated group and the unvaccinated
group (exact probability, P  0.327).
AEFI in the vaccinated group. Five suspected AEFI were reported: 2 fever reactions (1.6%; 95% confidence interval [CI],
0.2% to 5.8%), 1 complaint of dizziness and nausea (0.8%; 95%
CI, 0.1% to 4.5%), 1 complaint of abdominal pain (0.8%; 95% CI,
0.1% to 4.5%), and 1 incident of sudden deafness (this subject
recovered and was diagnosed with coupling). Therefore, the incidence rate of AEFI was 3.3% (4/122; 95% CI, 0.9% to 8.8%).
Pregnancy outcomes. In the vaccinated group, 1 spontaneous
abortion (0.8%) occurred. This pregnant woman was 28 years old
and had a history of 2 prior pregnancies; she received the influenza

vaccine during the 10th week of pregnancy. Fetal hydrocephalus
and stillbirth were detected in the 37th week of pregnancy. While
the Apgar scores in the vaccinated group were significantly lower
than those in the unvaccinated group, there were no statistically
significant differences in any of the other indicators between the
vaccinated group and the unvaccinated group (Table 3).
Incidence of influenza-like illness in the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups. There were a total of 12 influenza-like illness
cases found during the 6 months of the study. However, throat
swab specimens indicated that the suspected cases were not infected by the influenza A(H1N1) virus. Although the H1N1 virusnegative specimens were not further tested for other influenza
viruses, the clinical symptoms and the duration of the influenzalike illnesses indicated that the pregnant women most likely
caught the seasonal influenza A(H3N2) virus, which was diagnosed with routine surveillance during the previous 3 years. However, there were significant differences in the incidence rates of
influenza-like illness found between the 2 groups (Table 4).
The differences in the adverse events, outcomes, and main
clinical features (fever, sore throat, cough, rhinorrhea, fatigue,
and the median duration of disease) of influenza-like illness
between the vaccinated group and the unvaccinated group are
shown in Table 5.
Seroconversion in the vaccinated group. A total of 107 and 94
serum samples were collected before vaccination and 28 days after
vaccination, respectively. The seroconversion rate was 90.4% (85/
94; 95% CI, 82.6% to 95.5%). Figure 2 shows the geometric mean
titers (GMTs) and seroconversion rates before vaccination and 28
days after vaccination.
DISCUSSION
The populations at the highest risk for influenza A(H1N1) virus
infection are the elderly, young children, pregnant women, and
people with an original underlying disease (11–13). In particular,
pregnant women who are infected with the influenza A(H1N1)
virus can more easily suffer from dyspnea, hypoxemia, and acute
respiratory distress syndrome, which may lead to miscarriage,
premature delivery, fetal distress, or fetal intrauterine death (14,
15). Viruses can induce an increase in the symptoms of underlying
diseases, and in severe cases, these underlying diseases can lead to
death. For example, influenza A(H1N1) virus infection in a pregnant woman with an underlying disease can aggravate that underlying disease, which may result in death (13).
Administering the influenza vaccine during pregnancy is the
most effective way of preventing influenza and its complications,
and its administration is recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) (16–18). However, the influenza A(H1N1)
vaccine is a relatively newly licensed vaccine in China. Although its
immunogenicity has been effective (8, 16, 19, 20), there are very
few prospective reports addressing the safety of the vaccine in
pregnant women in China. Our study indicated that the seroconversion rate in the vaccinated pregnant women was 90.4% (95%
CI, 82.6% to 95.5%) and was not significantly different from that
in adults 18 to 60 years old in 2 other studies carried out in China
(8, 21).
As for the adverse events, the 2 incidences of fever and 1 incident of dizziness and nausea can be classified as non-pregnancyrelated maternal outcomes, with an incidence rate of 2.5% (95%
CI, 0.5% to 7.2%), which is consistent with the results of a study by
Zhu et al. (8) conducted in adults 18 to 60 years of age (incidence
rate, 6.7%; 95% CI, 2.7% to 11.3%). The 1 report of abdominal
pain can be classified as a pregnancy-specific adverse event or
outcome, with an incidence rate of 0.8% (95% CI, 0.1% to 4.5%),
which was significantly lower than those of other clinical trials on
pregnant women (5, 6, 22). This result should not be considered

evidence of the safety of the different H1N1 vaccines due to the
relatively small sample size and the lack of a control study including different H1N1 vaccines.
Furthermore, reactions, such as fever, dizziness, nausea, and
abdominal pain, had little impact on pregnancy, and the symptoms were mild and resolved within several days without requiring any treatment or hospitalization. No report was found regarding the impact of the influenza A(H1N1) vaccine on fetal growth.
There were no statistically significant differences between the vaccinated group and the unvaccinated group in spontaneous abortion, artificial abortion, postnatal death, premature birth, prolonged pregnancy, or low birth weight. These results suggest that
influenza A(H1N1) vaccination during pregnancy is safe. These
results were similar to those from the other studies conducted
with pregnant women (12, 18, 22).
The Apgar score is an important index by which to judge the
severity of hypoxia in newborns (22). The Apgar scores of all the
newborn infants in the vaccinated group and the unvaccinated
group were 7. However, the proportion of newborns with an
Apgar score of 9 in the vaccinated group was significantly lower
than that of newborns in the unvaccinated group. This is an interesting phenomenon that other relevant studies have not described. However, we do not consider this result evidence that the
vaccine is unsafe. First, a healthy newborn’s Apgar score is generally between 7 and 10; a score of 7 is considered mild asphyxia,
and a score of 4 is considered severe asphyxia, as other clinical
trials on pregnant women have shown (5, 9, 12). In this study, a
baby with a score of 7 to 8 at 1 min was reevaluated at 5 min. All of
the babies scored a 10 at the second evaluation. Second, there are
many risk factors that influence the Apgar score, including mother’s age, forceps delivery, gestational hypertension, birth complications, low birth weight, and birth deformities (23–25). Among
the 75 vaccinated pregnant women whose babies had an Apgar
score between 7 and 8, 1 baby had a low birth weight, 6 were
prolonged pregnancies, and 18 were cesarean deliveries. The other
pregnancies were normal and involved none of the aforementioned risk factors. Although the significant difference between
the vaccinated group and the unvaccinated group (61.5% versus
42.3%) regarding the proportion of Apgar scores between 7 and 8
may not be a safety concern of the vaccine, the potential impact of
the vaccine on pregnancy requires further study.

Safety of H1N1 Vaccine in Pregnant Women

Although no case of influenza A(H1N1) virus infection was
found in either of the two groups, the incidence of influenza-like
illness in the vaccinated group was significantly lower than that in
the unvaccinated group (2  4.285, P  0.038), suggesting crossprotection after influenza A(H1N1) vaccination (26). Although
no significant differences were found in adverse events and outcomes from influenza-like illness between the vaccinated group
and the unvaccinated group, there still may be benefits from the
vaccine. For example, the median duration of the influenza-like
illness in the vaccinated group was relatively short. Therefore, our
results reveal that the influenza A(H1N1) vaccine is safe for pregnant women, has no adverse effects on fetal growth, and may
prevent influenza-like illnesses, as indicated by the seroconversion
rate in the vaccinated group.
This study had some limitations. The sample size was small,
and the H1N1 virus-negative specimens were not tested for other
influenza viruses, such as H3N2. However, we have provided evidence regarding the safety of the H1N1 vaccines produced in
China, where few reports have been found. New evidence demonstrating the relationship between Apgar scores and the vaccines
should be explored further.
