OBJECTIVE: To estimate the risks for medically attended
events occurring within 42 days of receiving trivalent
inactivated influenza vaccine and to evaluate specific
risks of first-trimester vaccination.
METHODS: This retrospective observational cohort
study compared rates of medically attended adverse
events in trivalent inactivated influenza-vaccinated and
unvaccinated pregnant women in the Vaccine Safety
Datalink. Using a Poisson distribution and log link, we
calculated maternal adjusted incident rate ratios for
composite safety outcomes for the full cohort and the
subset vaccinated during the first trimester.
RESULTS: The cohort included 75,906 vaccinated (28.4%
in the first trimester) and 147,992 unvaccinated women
matched by age, site, and pregnancy start date. In the
first 3 days after vaccination, trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine was not associated with increased risk of
specified medically attended events, including allergic
reactions, cellulitis, and seizures (full cohort adjusted
incident rate ratio 1.12, 95% confidence interval [CI]
0.81–1.55; P5.48; first-trimester adjusted incident rate
ratio .97, 95% CI 0.53–1.78; P5.93). In the first 42 days,
no incident cases of Guillain-Barre´ syndrome, optic neuritis, transverse myelitis, or Bells palsy were identified.
Trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine was not associated
with thrombocytopenia (full cohort adjusted incident
rate ratio 0.90, 95% CI 0.68–1.19; P5.45; first-trimester
adjusted incident rate ratio 0.56, 95% CI 0.22–1.39;
P5.21) or an acute neurologic event (full cohort
adjusted incident rate ratio 0.92, 95% CI 0.54–1.6;
P5.75; first-trimester adjusted incident rate ratio 1.05,
95% CI 0.46–2.38; P5.91).
CONCLUSIONS: Receipt of trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine during pregnancy was not associated with
increased risk of adverse events in the 42 days after
vaccination, supporting its safety for the mother.

Pregnant women are at increased risk for serious
complications from influenza.1,2 The increased
burden of influenza during pregnancy was pronounced during the H1N1 pandemic;3–5 however,
even in nonpandemic seasons, pregnant women are
more likely than nonpregnant women to have an
influenza-related hospitalization.1 Influenza infection
during pregnancy also can adversely affect fetal
growth and is a risk for preterm delivery.6,7 When
administered during pregnancy, the trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine can prevent these adverse outcomes for expectant mothers and their fetuses.8–10

women in their second or third trimester of pregnancy.
In 2004, the Advisory Committee on Immunization
Practices changed its recommendations to include
women in any stage of pregnancy.11 These recommendations have been strongly endorsed by the
American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.12 However, concerns regarding vaccine safety
during pregnancy remain a persistent barrier to vaccination.13,14 Data from clinical trials,9,15,16 passive surveillance,17 and observational studies18 have not
suggested any associations between the trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine and maternal or fetal
adverse events. However, previous studies have been
underpowered to detect rare outcomes, and no previous studies have adequately assessed the safety of
first-trimester vaccination.19
Using a large, geographically diverse, retrospective cohort of pregnant women, the goals of this study
were to estimate the risks for medically attended
events occurring within 42 days of receiving trivalent
inactivated influenza vaccine and to evaluate specific
risks of first-trimester vaccination.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
In this retrospective observational cohort study, we
compared rates of medically attended adverse events
in pregnant women vaccinated with trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine and unvaccinated pregnant
women in the Vaccine Safety Datalink. The Vaccine
Safety Datalink is a collaborative effort between the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Immunization Safety Office and 10 health care systems across
the United States. It includes data for 9.5 million
individuals, comprising 3% of the United States
population.20 The current study is first large cohort
study of vaccine safety during pregnancy for the Vaccine Safety Datalink.21
Seven Vaccine Safety Datalink sites (Group
Health Cooperative, HealthPartners, Kaiser Permanente Colorado, Kaiser Permanente Northwest, Kaiser
Permanente Northern California, Kaiser Permanente
Southern California, and Marshfield Clinic Research
Foundation) contributed data for this study. This study
was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of all
involved sites. All data were derived from claims and
electronic medical records from the health care organizations. Pregnant women enrolled at those sites were
identified using a previously validated algorithm developed by Hornbrook et al22 and data were adapted for
use in the Vaccine Safety Datalink by Naleway et al.23
The algorithm uses a hierarchical approach to identify
pregnancy episodes, pregnancy outcomes (live births,
still births, spontaneous abortions, therapeutic abortions,
ectopic pregnancies, and gestational trophoblastic disease), and gestational age at pregnancy outcome. The
algorithm calculates a pregnancy start date equivalent to
the estimated last menstrual period. The first trimester
was defined as less than 14 weeks of gestation, the second trimester was defined as 14 to less than 28 weeks,
and the third trimester was defined as 28 weeks or more
of gestation. In a recent validation of this algorithm,
99% of live births were confirmed to occur within 30
days of the algorithm-defined dates, and there was 98%
agreement in gestational age between the algorithm and
manual chart review.23 Additional strategies used in this
algorithm to assign gestational age in weeks based on
the timing of common prenatal procedures have been
previously described.21
Women were retained in the cohort if they had
continuous insurance enrollment with no more than
a 30-day administrative enrollment gap from 6
months before the start of pregnancy until 2 months
after the end of pregnancy. The following pregnancies
were excluded: multiple gestation pregnancies;
ectopic pregnancies; gestational trophoblastic disease;
therapeutic abortions; and pregnancies in which the
outcome could not be determined based on available
data. In addition, women with no medical encounters
during pregnancy were excluded (Appendix 1, available online at http://links.lww.com/AOG/A348).
Receipt of trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine
was identified from the Vaccine Safety Datalink vaccine
files. The data sources for these files vary slightly across
sites but generally include vaccines captured through
claims and site-based vaccine registries. Data of workplace or pharmacy vaccination were available only
when manually entered by a health care provider, on
the basis of patient report. Exclusions included women
receiving trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine within
2 weeks of their estimated pregnancy start (because of
some uncertainty regarding dates). To avoid including
vaccines administered postpartum, women vaccinated
within 1 week of their pregnancy end date also were
excluded. In addition, women receiving other vaccines
during pregnancy were excluded.
After applying these inclusion and exclusion
criteria, all pregnant women 14 through 49 years old
retained in the cohort who received trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine during the 2002–2003 through
the 2008–2009 influenza seasons were matched 1:2
with replacement to unvaccinated women using a variable optimal matching algorithm.24 The original algorithm was modified so that matched vaccinated and
unvaccinated women would be equally likely to be
vaccinated during the same risk window. Match variables included age at pregnancy outcome (61 year),
520 Nordin et al Influenza Vaccine Safety in Pregnant Women OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY
estimated pregnancy start date (630 days), and Vaccine Safety Datalink site. Unexposed women were assigned an index date equal to the trivalent inactivated
influenza vaccine–exposed woman’s gestational age at
vaccination.
Adverse events were identified from International
Classification of Diseases 9th Edition, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes from inpatient, outpatient, or emergency department visits. Events on the
day of vaccination (day 0) were included only if
diagnosed at an inpatient or emergency department
visit. Specific outcomes and windows were selected
a priori based on biologic plausibility and past
Vaccine Safety Datalink research on influenza vaccine
safety in nonpregnant populations.25–28 For the first
3 days after vaccination, outcomes included allergic
reactions, cellulitis, fever or malaise, limb soreness or
swelling, rash, seizures, and altered mental status.
For the first 42 days after vaccination, outcomes
included autonomic disorders, cranial nerve disorders, degeneration of the central nervous system,
demyelinating disease, peripheral neuropathy or
neuritis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, meningoencephalitides, movement disorders, myoneural disorders,
paralytic syndromes, psychoses, spinocerebellar
disease, myocarditis or pericarditis, and thrombocytopenia. To improve specificity for Guillain-Barré
syndrome, only inpatient diagnoses were included.
Appendix 2 (http://links.lww.com/AOG/A349) provides a complete listing of outcomes and their specific
ICD-9-CM codes. Outcomes were included only if
they represented new events. Washout periods to
exclude pre-existing conditions were applied, and
they varied by outcome (Appendix 2, available online
at http://links.lww.com/AOG/A349).
As previously described, vaccinated and unvaccinated cohorts were matched by age, site, and estimated pregnancy start date. Data of additional
covariates that may have differed between these
cohorts also were gathered.14 Pre-existing conditions
(diabetes mellitus, heart disease, hypertension, neurologic disease, and pulmonary disease) and pregnancyrelated conditions (gestational diabetes, gestational
hypertension, and preeclampsia) were identified from
automated claims data from 6 months before pregnancy through the date of vaccination or index date.
Receipt of medical care during the first trimester and
hospitalization before the vaccination or index date
also were recorded. In the absence of socioeconomic
variables at the individual level, we used geocode files
to describe, for each participant, the percentage of
families in their census tract whose income was less
than 150% of the federal poverty level.29 In the
absence of a geocode, data for poverty was imputed
using the expectation maximization algorithm.30
We used x2 and Mann-Whitney U tests to compare baseline characteristics in vaccinated and unvaccinated populations (Tables 1). We report 0-day to
3-day and 1-day to 42-day rates for potential adverse
events in our exposed and unexposed cohorts per
10,000 pregnancies. Crude associations between individual outcomes and trivalent inactivated influenza
vaccine were analyzed using exact x2 tests.
Using the generalized estimating equation method
to account for the matching effect, with a Poisson
distribution and log link, we calculated maternal
incident rate ratios for the following composite safety
outcomes: any event occurring 0–3 days after vaccination (Table 2); any neurologic event occurring 1–42
days after vaccination; and thrombocytopenia (Table 3).
Incident rate ratios were adjusted for receipt of medical care during the first trimester, hospitalization,
and high-risk conditions before the vaccination or index
date. Associations are presented as 0-day to 3-day or 1-
day to 42-day adjusted incident rate ratios and 95%
confidence intervals (CIs). Analyses were conducted
for the entire cohort and for the subset of women vaccinated during the first trimester. In addition, we evaluated whether a cluster effect was present because of
women with multiple pregnancies over the 7-year
period or because of sampling controls with replacement. Results did not differ from our main analysis.
Because the intraclass correlation was minimal for most
models (,.001), and some models did not converge;
these effects were ignored in the main analyses.31
Most of the acute safety outcomes undergoing
investigation (groups of ICD-9-CM codes) were
expected to have 42-day incident background rates of
approximately 1 per 10,000 women.32 Analyses for
these outcomes had 80% power to detect a difference
of 0.05% or an adjusted incident rate ratio of 1.5 with an
a of 0.05. All analyses were performed using SAS 9.2.
RESULTS
Across the seven participating sites, from 1 June 2002
through 31 July 2009, a total of 807,563 pregnancies
among women aged 14 through 49 years were identified
from administrative and claims data. After applying
exclusions, 407,745 pregnancies remained; 19% received
trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine while pregnant.
Our final cohort consisted of 75,906 trivalent inactivated
influenza vaccine–exposed pregnancies matched by
age, Vaccine Safety Datalink site, and estimated pregnancy start date with 147,992 unvaccinated women
(Appendix 1 [http://links.lww.com/AOG/A348] provides a detailed diagram of inclusions and exclusions.)

The mean age of our cohort was 30.865.6 years.
Vaccination occurred in all three trimesters, including
21,553 women (28.4%) vaccinated during their first
trimester, 33,553 (44.2%) vaccinated during their second trimester, and 20,800 (27.4%) vaccinated during
their third trimester. Although most women received
medical care in the first trimester, rates were slightly
higher among vaccinated women (88.8% compared
with 86.4%). Compared with the unexposed, trivalent
inactivated influenza vaccine–exposed women were
more likely to have a pre-existing condition (14.5%
compared with 11.7%), but they were somewhat less
likely to be hospitalized before their vaccination or
index date (5.3% compared with 5.7%).
Rates for medically attended allergic reactions,
skin infections, fever and malaise, rash, seizures, or
altered mental status events 0–3 days after vaccination
were low; none exceeded 2 per 10,000 among both
the vaccinated and unvaccinated women. Compared
with unvaccinated women, no increase was observed
in the incidence of 0-day to 3-day events among vaccinated women (Table 1). In multivariable regression
models, after accounting for the matching effect and
adjusting for pre-existing conditions, receipt of care in
the first trimester, and hospitalization before their vaccination or index date, in the first 3 days after vaccination, receipt of trivalent inactivated influenza
vaccine was not associated with having a medically
attended event (adjusted incident rate ratio 1.12,
95% CI 0.81–1.55; P5.48). Similarly, in a regression
model restricted to first-trimester vaccinees and their
unexposed matches, in the first 3 days after vaccination, trivalent inactivated influenza vaccination was
not associated with having a medically attended event
(adjusted incident rate ratio 0.97, 95% CI 0.53–1.78;
P5.93).
The most common safety outcome in the 42 days
after vaccination or index date among both vaccinated
and unvaccinated pregnant women was thrombocytopenia, which occurred at a rate of 10.4 per 10,000
vaccinees and 11.5 per 10,000 unexposed women.
Among vaccinated women, there were no cases of
Guillian-Barré syndrome, optic neuritis, Bells palsy, or
transverse myelitis. For most other outcomes during
the first 42 days, incident rates were less than 1 per
10,000 vaccinees or unexposed women. We found no
evidence of increased risk in the 42 days after receiving
the trivalent inactivated influenza for any prespecified
neurologic outcome, myocarditis or pericarditis, or
thrombocytopenia (Table 2). After accounting for the
matching effect and adjusting for pre-existing conditions, receipt of care in the first trimester, and hospitalization before the vaccination or index date, in the first
42 days trivalent inactivated influenza vaccination was
not associated with receiving a new diagnosis of thrombocytopenia (adjusted incident rate ratio 0.90, 95%
CI 0.68–1.19; P5.45) or an acute neurologic event
(adjusted incident rate ratio 0.92, 95% CI 0.54–1.56;
P5.75) Similarly, in analyses restricted to women
receiving trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine during
their first trimester and their unexposed matches, trivalent inactivated influenza vaccination was not associated with a new episode of thrombocytopenia (adjusted
incident rate ratio 0.56, 95% CI 0.22–1.39; P5.21) or
an acute neurologic event (adjusted incident rate ratio
1.05, 95% CI 0.46–2.38; P5.91).
DISCUSSION
In this observational multisite study of 75,906 women
who received trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine
during pregnancy, no increased risk for adverse events
after vaccination was observed in the first 6 weeks after
vaccination. In the United States, it is estimated that
six million women become pregnant each year.33 Most
are pregnant for at least a portion of the influenza
season and therefore are strongly encouraged to be

vaccinated. This study should reassure these women
and their health care providers of the safety of influenza vaccination for the outcomes we studied.
Our study is unique because we report on a large
geographically diverse cohort of women, including
more than 20,000 women vaccinated during the first
trimester. Thus, our findings greatly expand on previous observational studies by Deinard et al34 and
Munoz et al.18 In 1981, Deinard et al studied 189 trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine–exposed and 517
unexposed pregnant women and found no differences
in maternal, perinatal, or neonatal complications.34
More recently, in 2005, Munoz et al evaluated the
safety of trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine administered to 252 pregnant women during their second
trimester or third trimester of pregnancy. When compared with 826 matched unvaccinated pregnant
women, no increased risk for adverse events in the first
42 days after vaccination was observed. In addition,
Munoz et al18 reported no difference in pregnancy or
neonatal outcomes between the trivalent inactivated
influenza vaccine-exposed and unexposed women.
Our findings complement and expand on results
recently reported from the Vaccine Adverse Event
Reporting System. Moro and colleagues reviewed the
Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System reports
among pregnant women who received the trivalent
inactivated influenza vaccine from 1 July 1990 through
30 June 2009. In this 20-year period, only 148 adverse
events after receiving the trivalent inactivated influenza
vaccine in pregnancy were identified; 20 (13.5%)
reports were classified as serious. No unusual patterns
of pregnancy complications or fetal outcomes were
observed. Three reports of Guillain-Barré syndrome in
pregnant women who received the trivalent inactivated
influenza vaccine were noted in the Vaccine Adverse
Event Reporting System; two of these cases were confirmed by chart review.35 As a passive reporting system, these reports are from an unknown denominator
of pregnant vaccinated women. Background rates of
Guillain-Barré syndrome in women of reproductive
age range from 1.5 to 2.3 per 100,000 person-years;32
risks for Guillain-Barré may increase up to threefold for
women during the first 30 days postpartum.36 Although
we were underpowered to detect differences in rates of
Guillain-Barré syndrome between trivalent inactivated
influenza vaccine–exposed and unexposed women, it is
reassuring that we had no incident cases in more than
76,000 vaccinated women.
Several limitations to this study should be noted.
First, as with all observational studies, there was potential
for confounding by indication. At baseline, vaccinated
women were more likely to have a chronic medical
condition such as asthma and diabetes, whereas unvaccinated women were slightly more likely to have been
hospitalized during the baseline period. We were able to
adjust for these baseline differences in our multivariable
models. However, it is likely that, similar to nonpregnant
populations, other unmeasured confounders differed
between vaccinated and unvaccinated women.37
Second, data regarding whether women received
the trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine were from
claims or electronic medical record–based registries.
Women vaccinated at nonmedical sites may have been
misclassified as unexposed, potentially biasing our
results. In a recent survey, up to 13% of women
receiving the trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine
while pregnant during the 2010–2011 influenza season
did so at a pharmacy, other store, school, or workplace.38 Rates for women in our cohort to receive the
trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine at alternative
sites were likely to be lower, but data about the site
of vaccination among pregnant women for 2002–2009
is limited. Third, our choice of ICD-9-CM codes and
outcomes were based on extensive previous research in
the Vaccine Safety Datalink. However, these outcomes
are still prone to misclassification because of errors in
coding. Both of these limitations may have reduced our
power to detect acute safety signals. In addition, we
were able to assess only medically attended adverse
events. Thus, our estimated rates for mild events such
as malaise or limb soreness are probably underestimates of their true rates. Furthermore, despite the large
size of our cohort, we had insufficient power to detect
increased risks for rare events or to conduct subgroup
analyses by year or vaccine manufacturer.
In this large observational cohort study, receipt of
the trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine during
pregnancy was not associated with increased risk of
medically attended acute adverse events in the 6 weeks
after immunization. These findings should reassure
pregnant women and their health care providers that
the seasonal influenza vaccination is unlikely to cause
the complications included in our study.
