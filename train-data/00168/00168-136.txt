Background Although the live attenuated influenza vaccine
(LAIV) prescribing information contains warnings⁄ precautions
against use during pregnancy, administration of LAIV to pregnant
women does occur. Data regarding maternal outcomes after LAIV
administration during pregnancy are limited.
Objectives Maternal outcomes after LAIV vaccination during
pregnancy were examined.
Methods Data from a health insurance claims database that
covers approximately 50 million individuals were analyzed for the
six influenza seasons from 2003–2004 through 2008–2009.
Emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations occurring
within 42 days of vaccination were analyzed by primary diagnosis;
outcomes were categorized as cardiopulmonary, obstetric, and
other. Cohort characteristics were analyzed using descriptive
statistics.
Results Of 834 999 pregnancies identified, 138 (0Æ017%) were
among women who received LAIV vaccinations. Of the 138
pregnant women, 13% were £19 years, 67% were 20–34 years, and
20% were ‡35 years of age. Eight events occurred within 42 days
of vaccination: one ED visit for bronchitis, two hospitalizations
for hyperemesis gravidarum and premature labor, and five ED
visits⁄ hospitalizations for common medical conditions. All
outcomes identified after LAIV exposure occurred at rates similar
to rates in unvaccinated pregnant women reported in the medical
literature.
Conclusions Administration of LAIV to pregnant women is rare;
the rate has remained constant since 2004–2005. In this cohort,
there was no evidence of significant maternal adverse outcomes
after receipt of LAIV. These data may offer some reassurance to
providers and pregnant women in the event of inadvertent LAIV
administration, but do not support the routine use of LAIV in
pregnant women.

Introduction
Women who are pregnant during the influenza season are
at increased risk for severe complications from influenza
infections.1–3 For this reason, influenza vaccination at any
time during pregnancy is recommended by the US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and
the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists
(ACOG).1,4 Two types of influenza vaccines are approved
in the United States: injectable trivalent inactivated influenza vaccines (TIV) and the intranasal live attenuated
influenza vaccine (LAIV). The safety of TIV during pregnancy has been well established.5,6 Accordingly, the US
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that TIV are used to vaccinate pregnant women during the influenza season. As with all live vaccines, LAIV is
not recommended for use during pregnancy.1,7 LAIV is
approved in the United States for use in eligible children
and adults 2–49 years of age, and more than 40 million
doses of seasonal trivalent LAIV have been distributed for
use in the United States from licensure in 2003 through
the 2010–2011 influenza season (MedImmune, data on
file).
It is not known whether LAIV administration during
pregnancy is associated with any maternal or fetal risks. To
date, there has been little information available. A 2010
analysis of data from the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting
System (VAERS) reported 27 pregnant women from 2003
through 2009 who received LAIV, 60% of whom did not
report any associated adverse event.8 Of those reporting
adverse events, the most common were spontaneous abortion (n = 3), fever (n = 3), vomiting (n = 3), headache

(n = 3), and sore throat (n = 2). No congenital anomalies
or adverse fetal events were reported. Additionally, a study
by Piedra et al. 9 described fetal outcomes among six adolescents who were inadvertently vaccinated with LAIV while
pregnant. Among these pregnancies, there were five fullterm healthy infants and one preterm delivery. The lack of
available information regarding maternal and fetal risks
after LAIV vaccination and concerns regarding inadvertent
vaccination of pregnant women has complicated vaccination efforts in some settings.10
Although LAIV is not recommended to be administered
to pregnant women, administration of LAIV to pregnant
women does rarely occur. The purpose of this study was to
quantify, using healthcare claims data, the frequency of
LAIV vaccination among pregnant women and to assess
maternal adverse events after vaccination with LAIV.
Methods
Anonymized patient-specific claims data were obtained
from the LifeLink Health Plan Claims Database (IMS
Health, Norwalk, CT, USA). At the time of data acquisition, the database included medical and pharmacy claims
from more than 50 million unique members from over 90
U.S. health plans. The database includes inpatient and outpatient claims, including diagnoses in ICD-9-CM format,
procedures in CPT-4 and HCPCS formats, and retail and
mail-order pharmacy claims containing National Drug
Codes (NDC). Date and place of service are included with
all claims. Information regarding influenza vaccinations for
which claims were not submitted was unavailable.
The study population consisted of females who were
12–49 years of age at the time they had a claim for delivery
of a child. For inclusion, individuals were required to have
at least 270 days of continuous enrollment in the database
before delivery. Data from October 2003 through September 2009 were included in the analysis. Because the database was unable to link claims data for a mother and her
offspring, no fetal outcomes could be examined.
Pregnant women were identified by a claim for a delivery
procedure code or an ICD-9-CM diagnosis code for a
delivery. Women could contribute more than one pregnancy and delivery to the analysis as long as the aforementioned criteria were met for each included delivery. For
pregnancies with multiple delivery codes during the period
of pregnancy, the investigators manually reviewed the
claims to ascertain the correct delivery date based on the
date of the delivery procedure code; if no delivery procedure code was present, the delivery date was assigned to be
the date of the first ICD-9-CM diagnosis code for a delivery. LAIV exposure during pregnancy was identified by the
presence of CPT code 90660 or an NDC code of
66019010001, 66019020001, 66019030001, 66019040001,
66019050001, or 66019060001. TIV exposure was defined
by the presence of an insurance claim with a CPT code of
90655, 90656, 90657, 90658, 90659, or relevant NDC code.
The 2009 monovalent H1N1 pandemic influenza vaccines
were not in use at the time of the study and were not
included in the analysis.
For each pregnancy, a date of conception was calculated
by estimating the duration of pregnancy from ICD-9-CM
codes associated with the delivery. If an ICD-9-CM code
for gestational age (765Æ2x) was recorded at the time of
delivery, the conception date was assumed to precede delivery by the upper limit of the range of weeks associated with
the specific code. We used the upper limit to maximize the
detection of LAIV vaccination during pregnancy. If the
765Æ2x codes were not present, but premature delivery was
indicated by codes 644Æ20 or 644Æ21, the date of conception
was assumed to be 245 days before delivery, the approximate gestational age for children born <37 weeks as
described by Martin et al.11 If neither the 765Æ2x nor the
644Æ2x codes were present, but the birth involved multiple
infants, then the conception date was assumed to be
256 days before delivery, the midpoint of the range of days
used by Cole et al.12 For all other pregnancies, the conception date was estimated as the date 270 days before delivery.13 The end of the first and second trimesters was
defined as 90 and 180 days after conception, respectively;
the end of the third trimester was the delivery date. The
gestational day at the time of vaccination was defined as
the number of days between LAIV vaccination and the estimated date of conception.
To evaluate the presence of underlying high-risk medical
conditions, available ICD-9-CM codes from claims as early
as January 1997 to the time of vaccination were reviewed.
To qualify as having a high-risk condition, a subject had to
have at least one hospital ⁄ emergency department (ED)
claim or two outpatient claims on separate dates for the
condition on or before the delivery date. The following
ICD-9-CM codes were used to define high-risk disease
groups: chronic cardiac disease (093, 393–398, 402–404,
410–414, 416, 424–425, 428–429, 440, and 745–746);
chronic pulmonary disease (277Æ0, 491–496, 500–506, 515–
517, and 519Æ9); diabetes mellitus (250 and 648Æ0); chronic
renal disease (581–583, 585, and 587, or CPT codes 800,
801, 90935, 90937, 90940); malignancy (140–199 [except
173] and 200–208); and immunosuppressive disorders
(042–044 and 136Æ3).3
Live attenuated influenza vaccine was first widely available in the United States in the fall of 2003. To calculate
the proportion of deliveries with LAIV vaccination during
pregnancy, we divided the number of eligible deliveries
with LAIV vaccination during pregnancy by the total number of eligible deliveries that occurred on or after October
1, 2003, through September 2009. The number of pregnant
Outcomes in women who received LAIV while pregnant

women vaccinated with LAIV in each influenza season was
divided by the number of doses distributed each season to
estimate the number of vaccinations per million doses distributed for each season.
To assess potential adverse outcomes among the cohort
of women vaccinated with LAIV during pregnancy, all
health insurance claims for hospitalization or ED visits
occurring within 42 days post-vaccination were reviewed.
Because the sample of LAIV-vaccinated pregnant women
was small, a qualitative description of adverse outcomes in
comparison with the rates published in the medical literature was provided. For each hospitalization or ED visit,
authors reviewed the primary discharge diagnoses and
grouped events into three categories: obstetric outcomes
(those not related to delivery), cardiopulmonary outcomes,
and other medical outcomes. For hospitalizations within
42 days post-vaccination listing a primary discharge diagnosis of normal delivery, all additional codes associated with
that hospitalization were also reviewed. Any diagnosis code
for a previously unrecorded medical condition that was not
related to routine labor and delivery and not related to a
fetal condition was considered to be a potential outcome of
interest. To evaluate any potential long-term side effects of
vaccination, primary discharge diagnoses associated with
hospitalizations from the time of vaccination up until, but
not including, the hospitalization at the time of delivery
were analyzed. To focus on serious adverse events, only
hospitalizations were considered in this analysis. If a subject
had a claim for an ED visit and hospitalization on the same
day, a single hospitalization event was counted. The number
and percentage of women who experienced either a hospitalization or ED visit was stratified by trimester of vaccination. Women with high-risk medical conditions were
included in the analysis and examined separately.
Because the delivery of a child was an entry criterion
and delivery data were only available through September
2009, the 2008–2009 cohort would not include first-trimester vaccinations of women with deliveries after September
2009. All analyses were performed using SAS 9.1.3 (SAS
Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) or Microsoft Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA). Because data were anonymized,
the protocol was granted Institutional Review Board (IRB)
review exemption by the RTI International IRB.
Results
The database search identified 834 999 women with a pregnancy resulting in a delivery between October 2003 and
September 2009. Of these, 138 women (0Æ017%) had a
claim for LAIV vaccination while pregnant. The number of
vaccinations increased throughout the study period with
14, 12, 17, 32, 22, and 41 occurring in the 2003–2004,
2004–2005, 2005–2006, 2006–2007, 2007–2008, and 2008–
2009 seasons, respectively. In the first year LAIV was available, there was a disproportionally high number of vaccinations during pregnancy, namely 31Æ1 per million LAIV
doses distributed. Since the 2003–2004 season, the rate of
LAIV vaccination during pregnancy per million LAIV doses
distributed has remained constant with an average of 7Æ9
per season (range: 5Æ7–12Æ3 per season). The characteristics
of those vaccinated with LAIV relative to those not vaccinated with LAIV were comparable (Table 1), with the
exception of LAIV-vaccinated women having a greater likelihood of being £19 years of age (13% versus 5%;
P < 0Æ0001) and of having >10 prenatal visits (21% versus
13%; P < 0Æ01). LAIV-vaccinated women were also less
likely to have a claim for vaccination with TIV (4% versus

12%; P < 0Æ01). Of those vaccinated with LAIV, 47%, 27%,
and 26% were vaccinated in the first, second, and third trimesters, respectively. Among the 65 first-trimester exposures, 42 occurred during the first 6 weeks of pregnancy.
When trimester of vaccination was analyzed by influenza
season, no trends were discernible among the small number
of vaccinations occurring each season (Fig. 1). Women vaccinated in each trimester were comparable with similar
mean age, number of high-risk medical conditions, and
number of prenatal visits.
In addition to pregnancy, 21 women had an underlying
high-risk medical condition, specifically cardiac disease,
pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, or malignancy. Six
patients vaccinated with LAIV also had a claim for TIV
during pregnancy; in 5 of the 6 patients, the TIV claim
occurred on the same date as the LAIV claim. All LAIV
vaccinations occurred between September and February of
each influenza season, with 87% occurring in October
through December. The specialty of the vaccinating physician was only available in 26 of the 138 cases and therefore
was not evaluated.
Eight unique individuals were found to have a claim for a
hospitalization or ED visit within 42 days post-vaccination
with LAIV (three hospitalizations, five ED visits; Table 2).
Two events were obstetric in nature (hyperemesis gravidarum and threatened premature labor), one event was cardiopulmonary in nature (bronchitis), and five events were
because of other medical conditions (pyelonephritis, epigastric symptoms, limb pain, diarrhea, and chest pain). One
woman was hospitalized twice for the same diagnosis (threatened premature labor without delivery) on days 9 and 12
post-vaccination, which was counted as a single hospitalization. The three women with ED visits for limb pain, chest
pain, and bronchitis, respectively, had pre-existing diagnoses
of degenerative thoracic scoliosis, diabetes mellitus, and
asthma with congestive heart failure, respectively. Overall,
5Æ8% of women experienced a hospitalization or ED visit
within 42 days post-vaccination with LAIV; 1Æ4%, 0Æ7%, and
3Æ6% experienced an obstetric event, cardiopulmonary event,
and other medical event, respectively. The rates of hospitalization and ⁄ or ED visits within 42 days post-vaccination
were higher among women vaccinated in the first and second trimesters (6Æ2% and 8Æ1%, respectively) than among
women vaccinated in the third trimester (2Æ8%). Similarly,
14Æ3% of women with high-risk underlying conditions experienced an event (three events among 21 women) compared
with 4Æ3% of women without high-risk conditions (five
events among 117 women).
Nineteen women were hospitalized for a delivery within
42 days post-vaccination. Among these women, four maternal medical conditions that had not been previously diagnosed during pregnancy and that were unrelated to routine
delivery were noted (polyhydramnios, anemia of pregnancy,
premature rupture of membranes, and transient hypertension). Five additional hospitalizations that occurred more
than 42 days post-vaccination were noted before delivery
(Table 3). Diagnoses included three obstetric conditions
(cervical carcinoma in situ, other placental condition, and
breech presentation) and two infections (pyelonephritis
and influenza). The subject who was hospitalized for pyelonephritis had a history of recurrent urinary tract infections,
before, during, and after pregnancy and was the same subject who was hospitalized for pyelonephritis within 42 days
post-vaccination. The subject hospitalized for influenza was
vaccinated with LAIV in December 2008 and diagnosed
with influenza in August 2009.

Discussion
This analysis of health insurance claims from a large U.S.
population during the 2003–2004 through 2008–2009 influenza seasons demonstrates that LAIV vaccination during
pregnancy is rare. The number of LAIV vaccinations during
pregnancy increased throughout the study period, commensurate with the total number of LAIV doses distributed

each season. When LAIV use in pregnancy does occur, it is
more likely to occur in adolescents, which is not surprising
given the extensive use of the vaccine in children and adolescents in the U.S. Additionally, LAIV use in pregnancy is
most likely to occur very early in the pregnancy, when a
pregnancy may be unrecognized. For second- and third-trimester vaccinations, it is likely that the pregnancy was
known and LAIV was administered owing to a lack of
knowledge regarding the recommended use of the vaccine.
Interestingly, LAIV vaccination in the second and third trimesters has not decreased in later years as LAIV use has
become more widespread, which suggests that some groups
of healthcare providers would benefit from increased education regarding the recommended use of LAIV.
Hospitalizations or ED visits were uncommon within
42 days of LAIV vaccination. All three hospitalizations that
occurred were because of common causes of antepartum
hospitalization: hyperemesis gravidarum, threatened premature labor, and pyelonephritis (all at a rate of 0Æ7%).
Hyperemesis gravidarum has been reported to occur in
0Æ3% to 1Æ5% of all live births, with most references reporting an incidence of 0Æ5%.14 Threatened premature labor is
the most common non-delivery cause of hospitalization
among pregnant women,15 with an incidence rate of firsttime hospitalization of 5Æ7% occurring in women from
24 weeks gestational age through delivery.16 Antepartum
hospitalization for pyelonephritis has been reported to
occur in 1–2% of all pregnancies.17,18 The five ED visits
within 42 days post-vaccination were because of common
medical conditions, and three of the women had underlying illnesses that may have played contributing roles. The
ED visit for bronchitis is notable given that LAIV is a live
attenuated virus vaccine. It is not possible to determine
whether there was a causal relationship between LAIV and
the episode of bronchitis. Acute respiratory infections are
common complications of pregnancy, and bronchitis has
been found to occur in 1% of all pregnancies.19 While
LAIV can cause minor upper respiratory symptoms such as
rhinorrhea or sore throat, clinical studies of LAIV in
healthy adults,20,21 children and adolescents with asthma,
and older adults with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease have not shown an increase in medically attended
respiratory events after vaccination.22,23 For the women
hospitalized for delivery within 42 days of vaccination, the
four diagnoses that were potentially new (polyhydramnios,
anemia of pregnancy, premature rupture of membranes
and transient hypertension) were all common obstetric
complications that can be noted for the first time during a
hospitalization for delivery.6,24
For the five hospitalizations occurring later than 42 days
post-vaccination, but before delivery, three were because of
common obstetric conditions,6,25 one was because of a
reoccurrence of pyelonephritis, and one was because of
influenza. For the influenza hospitalization, the dates of
vaccination and hospitalization suggest that the woman
was immunised with 2008–2009 trivalent seasonal LAIV in
December 2008 and diagnosed in August 2009 with pandemic H1N1 influenza. The 2008–2009 seasonal formulation of LAIV would not be expected to provide protection
against pandemic H1N1 illness.26
This analysis has several limitations. Despite the very
large sample size, the actual number of women in the study
who were exposed to LAIV during pregnancy was small.
The available sample size was sufficient, with 95% probability, to detect at least one event for outcomes occurring at a
frequency of 2Æ2% or greater. Additionally, the precision of
rate estimates for hospitalization and ED visits because of
specific adverse events among these vaccinated women is
limited. Consequently, rates of events occurring after vaccination with TIV were not generated for comparison. Furthermore, claims data may not include all diagnoses
experienced by a patient, and the codes may lack sufficient
specificity for some conditions. Also, because the date of
conception was estimated in this study, some misclassification of vaccine exposure by pregnancy status likely
occurred. Our study also assumes that there is accurate
coding of medical conditions and procedures via specific
coding systems. Coding errors could result in classifying
another medication or vaccine as LAIV or classifying LAIV
as another vaccine. Generally, the rare nature of such errors
has minimal impact on quantifying the rate of common
events. However, for rare events, such as LAIV vaccination
among pregnant women, such errors can erroneously overor underestimate the rate of the event of interest. Coding
errors may explain the five subjects who had claims for
TIV and LAIV on the same day. Additionally, as noted previously, the 2008–2009 cohort would not include first-trimester vaccinations of women with deliveries after
September 2009; however, these vaccinations would have
been expected to occur in January through June, months in
which LAIV vaccination was rare in the other influenza
seasons evaluated. Consequently, the number of 2008–2009
vaccinations that were not captured is expected to be low.
This study is also limited by its lack of claims data
regarding birth outcomes. The database we used was
unable to link maternal claims data to the claims data
describing their offspring. However, existing data from
clinical study case reports and spontaneous reports to
VAERS have not demonstrated any increased risk of
adverse fetal outcomes with LAIV administration during
pregnancy. In an analysis of 49 live births whose mothers
were vaccinated with LAIV while pregnant, 36 infants were
described as ‘healthy’, 11 had no additional details
reported, one infant was delivered prematurely (32–
33 weeks gestational age), and one infant was born with
clinodactyly,27 a relatively common hand anomaly characOutcomes in women who received LAIV while pregnant

terized by curvature of the fifth finger toward the adjacent
fourth finger. Also, no vaccine-related fetal malformations
or other evidence of teratogenesis were noted in animal
developmental toxicity studies.28 Despite the lack of data
regarding outcomes after fetal exposure to LAIV, it is reassuring to note that there is no known fetal injury that has
been linked to maternal exposure to wild-type influenza,
unlike wild-type viruses for which other live vaccines exist
(e.g., varicella and rubella).29,30
Finally, we limited evaluated pregnancies to those resulting in the delivery of a child and did not assess spontaneous abortions. Spontaneous abortions may not result in a
medical encounter, making the accuracy of the calculations
based on claims data unreliable. However, in an analysis of
67 documented LAIV vaccinations during pregnancy from
clinical trials and spontaneous VAERS reports, only eight
(11Æ9%) cases resulted in spontaneous abortions,27 a proportion that is similar to or below reported national rates
of spontaneous abortions and very similar to that reported
for TIV in VAERS reports from 1990 to 2009.8,31,32
Despite the aforementioned limitations, this study examined a very large database, which provided a broad reflection of real-world clinical practice within the U.S. The
study’s unique contribution is the quantification of the frequency of LAIV vaccination during pregnancy and of medically attended adverse event frequencies, which cannot be
estimated from spontaneous reporting systems such as
VAERS. In this analysis, vaccination with LAIV during
pregnancy was uncommon and did not reveal rates of
maternal adverse events that differed from those known to
occur in the general population of pregnant women. These
data may offer some reassurance to providers and pregnant
women in the event of inadvertent LAIV administration
during pregnancy; however, these data do not support the
routine use of LAIV in pregnant women.
