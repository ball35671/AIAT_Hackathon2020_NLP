Trivalent cold-adapted recombinant (CR) influenza virus vaccines containing types A (HINI
and H3N2) and B viruses were evaluated in two double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. Susceptible adults were randomly assigned to receive the following vaccines by intranasal drops I month
apart: two doses of trivalent vaccine, bivalent CR influenza A (Bi A) vaccine followed by monovalent B (Mono B) vaccine or vice versa, or two doses of placebo. All vaccines were well tolerated.
Shedding of each of the three vaccine viruses was reduced after the first dose of trivalent vaccine
compared with primary vaccination with Bi A or Mono B. Shedding was also reduced after
second vaccinations, whether homologous (trivalent-trivalent) or heterologous (Bi A/Mono B or
Mono B/Bi A). Reduced viral shedding was associated with reduced serum antibody responses.
Thus, both simultaneous and sequential inoculations of susceptible adults with CR influenza
vaccine viruses result in reduced viral shedding and serum antibody responses.
Epidemic influenza occurs annually throughout the world
as a cause ofsignificant morbidity and mortality [I]. In most
epidemics, a single influenza virus subtype is predominant,
but outbreaks caused by two types (A and B) or two subtypes
(A/HINI and A/H3N2) of influenza virus may occur [2].
While the major virus variant for a given year is often detected during the latter part ofthe preceding epidemic [3], it
is not possible at present to forecast the upcoming epidemic
virus(es) with certainty. Because the ability to predict which
viruses will circulate during the approaching season is limited, commercial influenza virus vaccines contain representatives of each of the contemporary influenza viruses (AI
HI N I, A/H3N2, and B). Protection against influenza virus
infection is currently provided primarily by means of annual
intramuscular immunization with trivalent inactivated influenza virus vaccines.

Live cold-adapted recombinant (CR) influenza viruses
given by nose drops are being considered as alternatives to
trivalent inactivated vaccines for prevention ofinfluenza [4].
CR influenza viruses are attenuated, genetically stable, well
tolerated, and immunogenic in susceptible children and
young adults. Significant protection against artificial challenge and naturally occurring influenza has been demonstrated after immunization with mono- and bivalent CR influenza A virus vaccines as well as with monovalent CR
influenza B virus vaccines [5-9]. Preliminary studies have
shown that viral shedding patterns and antibody responses
after receipt ofbivalent influenza A CR virus vaccines can be
equivalent to those after receipt of monovalent vaccine [5].
If CR influenza viruses are to contribute to the control of
influenza, it will be necessary to develop CR vaccines that
provide protection against each of the three influenza virus
types and subtypes that may circulate during a season. This
report describes a double-blind, placebo-controlled comparison of simultaneous and sequential administration of three
CR vaccine viruses for immunization of susceptible young
adults.
Materials and Methods
Viruses. The three vaccine viruses tested during the first
study were CR influenza A/Kawasaki/9/86 (HINI) CR 125,
A/Bethesda/I/85 (H3N2) CR 90, and B/Ann Arbor/I/86 CRB
117. During a second study, the H3N2 component was replaced
with the CR influenza A/Los Angeles/2/87 (H3N2) CR 149,
and different lots ofCR 125 and CRB 117 were used. CR 125,
CR 90, and CR 149 express the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase of wild-type A/Kawasaki (an A/Taiwan/I/86 [HINI ]-like
virus), A/Bethesda (an A/Mississippi/I/86 [H3N2]-like virus),

306 Keitel et al. JID 1993; 167 (February)
and A/Los Angeles (an A/Sichuan/2/8? [H3N2]-like virus), respectively, and the internal proteins of cold-adapted influenza
A/Ann Arbor/6/60 (H2N2). CRB II? expresses the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase of wild-type influenza B/Ann Arbor/I/
86 and the internal proteins of cold-adapted influenza B/Ann
Arbor/I/66.
Vaccine viruses were prepared for human use by Flow Laboratories (Rockville, MD) and were provided by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Viruses were diluted to
contain 107
.
1 TCIDsoofeach virus per 0.5-mL dose. Placebo was
normal allantoic fluid.
Clinical procedures. The design of both clinical trials was
similar. Healthy 18- to 40-year-old volunteers recruited from
Texas A&M University and the Texas Medical Center and environs were screened for susceptibility to the test viruses. For
study I, serum samples from volunteers with hemagglutination
inhibition (HAl) antibody titers < 1:8 against A/Taiwan were
tested against vaccine virus antigens in neutralizing antibody
assays. Volunteers with the lowest available levels were invited
to participate. Mean preinoculation serum neutralizing antibody titers are shown in table 3. For study 2, screening serum
HAl titers were 1:8 against the three influenza virus antigens.
Of these volunteers with low serum HAl levels, those with the
lowest available levels of serum neutralizing antibodies to the
test viruses were invited to participate. Subjects who were
acutely or chronically ill, allergic to eggs, or pregnant were excluded.
Studies with the vaccines were done on an outpatient basis.
Eligible volunteers were randomly assigned to receive two doses
of vaccine or placebo I month apart, as follows: two doses of
placebo, two doses ofa trivalent vaccine containing each ofthe
three CR influenza viruses, one dose ofbivalent CR influenza A
(H IN 1and H3N2) vaccine followed by one dose ofmonovalent
CR influenza B virus (Bi A/Mono B), or one dose of mono B
vaccine followed by one dose ofBi A. Vaccine and placebo were
administered by instilling one-half of the inoculum into each
nostril. Volunteers and medical personnel doing clinical evaluations were unaware of the inoculum each subject was given.
Subjects were examined and had nasal wash specimens collected for viral culture daily during the week after both inoculations (excluding day 6). Symptoms and signs were categorized
on a scale of 1-3+ (mild, moderate, severe); the subject's and
investigator's overall assessment of illness were also recorded.
Oral temperature and symptoms were recorded daily in a patient
diary during the week after inoculation. Review ofall records for
a final assessment of illness was done at the end of the clinical
observation period by a physician who was unaware ofthe inoculum groups [8].
Blood samples for antibody determinations were collected
prior to and I and 4 weeks after each inoculation. Eleven subjects shedding viruses other than influenza during the study
were excluded from analysis (2 from study 1 and 9 from study
2). Most of these were rhinovirus (n = 8); the remaining were
herpes simplex virus, enterovirus, and picornavirus (n = 1 for
each). Of 5 subjects who shed an adventitious virus in relation to
their first dose ofCR vaccine, none shed vaccine virus compared
with 55 of the remaining 59 vaccinees (P < .00002, Fisher's
exact test; see below).
Laboratory procedures. Tests for virus isolation and serum
antibody levels were done using previously described methods
[8, 10]. The days virus was detected was defined as the total
number of days during which virus was recovered. Test viruses
for the antibody assays of sera collected during the first study
were influenza A/Taiwan/I/86 (HINl), A/Mississippi/l/86
(H3N2), and B/Ann Arbor/l/86. Influenza A/Los Angeles
virus was substituted for A/Mississippi virus during the second
study. A fourfold or greater rise in serum antibody titer was
considered significant. Infection was defined by the presence of
virus in secretions or a fourfold or greater rise in serum antibody
between pre- and postinoculation samples or both.
Viruses present in nasal wash specimens were identified by
using a modification of a procedure developed by W. Gruber
(Department of Pediatrics, Vanderbilt University, Nashville,
TN): O. I mL ofserial 10-fold dilutions of nasal wash specimens
were inoculated onto confluent monolayers of MDCK tissue
culture cells grown in 12-well cluster dishes. After a l-h incubation, each well was overlaid with agar. Plates were incubated for
96 h at 34°C. Visible plaques were marked with a pen; then cells
were fixed with methanol and incubated with hemagglutininspecific monoclonal antibodies (provided by R. Webster, St.
Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis). The monoclonal
antibodies used to identify A/H IN I, A/H3N2, and B virus(es)
were raised against the following viruses: A/Baylor/I 1515/82,
A/Los Angeles/2/8?, and B/Memphis/6/86, respectively. Peroxidase-labeled antiglobulin was then added, followed byaddition of substrate for visualization of plaques. Positive controls
(CR virus harvests) were included in each assay. If the original
virus-containing nasal wash specimens failed to demonstrate
plaques, then the procedure was repeated using the MDCK harvest of the original positive specimen.
Results
Clinical responses. Responses ofsubjects inoculated with
CR influenza virus vaccines or placebo are summarized in
table 1. During the first study, mild upper respiratory illnesses developed in 50%ofsubjects given a first dose ofBi A
or trivalent vaccine; these subjects were significantly more
likely to report these symptoms than were placebo recipients
(10/20 vs. 0/10; P = .0 I) or Mono B vaccine recipients ( 10/
20 vs. 1/10; P = .05; Fisher's exact test). The frequencies of
respiratory symptoms and signs were low after the second
dose of virus, with no differences between the groups. No
vaccinee developed fever (oral temperature ~37.8°C); one
in the group given trivalent vaccine as a first dose experienced malaise and rhinitis that interfered with activity for
1 day.
During the second study, the frequencies ofsubjects with
upper respiratory symptoms or signs in the various groups
were not significantly different from each other after the first
or second dose ofvaccine or placebo, although the frequency
was somewhat higher in subjects given Mono B as a first
dose. One subject given Bi A as a first dose experienced mild
systemic and respiratory symptoms that interfered with usual
activities for I day.

Viral shedding. Table 2 shows the frequencies and duration of viral shedding in each group after each inoculation.
The data are the percentage of subjects whose nasal wash
specimens yielded the indicated influenza virus. Of 59 subjects who received a preparation containing one, two, or
three CR virus(es), 55 shed CR virus during the week after
the first inoculation. The mean number of days virus could
be detected in nasal wash specimens was similar for all
groups.
Frequencies of viral shedding after the second dose were
reduced even when heterotypic vaccine virus(es) were administered. Of 19 vaccinees given Mono B (n = 10) or Bi A
(n = 9) as a first dose during the first study, 17 (89%) shed
CR virus versus 4 (22%) of 18 given Mono B (n = 9) or Bi A
(n = 9) as a second dose (P < .000 I, Fisher's exact test).
During this study, all 10 subjects given Mono B as their first
vaccine shed influenza virus(es) after inoculation versus only
2 of9 given the same dose of Mono B I month after receiving
Bi A (P < .001, Fisher's exact test). Similar observations
were made after inoculation with Bi A vaccine: 7 of9 volunteers given Bi A as their first vaccine shed virus after inoculation versus only 2 of9 given Bi A I month after Mono B(P =
.057, Fisher's exact test).
This effect was less pronounced during the second study.
Eighteen (95%) of 19 given Mono B(n = 10) or Bi A (n = 9)
as a first dose shed CR virus compared with 11 (58%) of 19
given Mono B (n = 9) or BiA (n = 10) as a second dose (P <
.02, Fisher's exact test). All 10 volunteers given Mono B as a
first dose in the second study shed virus compared with 70f9
given Mono B as a second dose. Of9 volunteers given Bi A as
a first dose in the second trial, 8 shed virus compared with 4
of 10 given Bi A I month after Mono B (P = .057, Fisher's
exact test). Of 18 volunteers given a second dose oftrivalent
vaccine in the two studies combined, none shed virus (data
not shown).
The identities ofindividual CR viruses shed in nasal wash
specimens are summarized in the bottom oftable 2. During
the first study, frequency and mean peak titer of HI N I virus
shed were lower when HI N I virus was given as part of a

secondary Bi A vaccination or as a component of primary
trivalent vaccine compared with primary administration of
HI N I in Bi A vaccine. Of 9 volunteers given HI N I as a
primary vaccination with Bi A, 7 shed HI N I compared with
2 of 9 given Bi A as a second dose (P = .057, Fisher's exact
test). The frequency of HI N I shedding after primary receipt
of trivalent vaccine was intermediate (6/II) and not significantly different from the other groups; however, the mean
number of days HI N I virus was detected in secretions of
vaccinees who shed was significantly lower for recipients of
primary trivalent vaccine than for recipients of primary Bi A
vaccines (1.8 vs. 4.1 days, P < .05, Wilcoxon rank sum test).
The number ofsubjects shedding CR influenza B virus was
significantly lower when CRB was given as a secondary
Mono B vaccination than when CRB was given as a primary
dose of Mono B (see above) or as part of trivalent vaccine
(2/9 vs. 10/ II; P = .005, Fisher's exact test). A peak titer of
> 10 TCIDso/mL ofCRB in secretions occurred significantly
more frequently after receipt ofMono Bas a primary vaccination than after primary receipt oftrivalent vaccine (5/10 vs.
0/ I0; P = .03, Fisher's exact test, data not shown). Only I
subject shed influenza A/Bethesda (H3N2) CR 90 during
the first study.
The data in table 2 also reveal evidence ofreduced replication of viruses given as a second dose or as a component of
trivalent vaccine in the second trial. Shedding of the HI N 1
component in study 2 was detected less frequently in subjects given Bi A as a secondary than as a primary vaccination
(4/10 vs. 8/9, P = .057, Fisher's exact test). Shedding ofCR
influenza B virus after primary vaccination in study 2 was
greater in subjects given this virus as Mono B than in those
given it as part oftrivalent vaccine by measures including the
frequency of persons who shed CR influenza B virus (10/ I0
vs. 5/10; P = .03, Fisher's exact test); days virus could be
detected (4.0 vs. 1.2 days; P < .0 I, Wilcoxon rank sum test;
and the mean peak titer (2.1 vs. 0.8 loglO TCIDso/mL; P <
.05, Wilcoxon rank sum test). Likewise, the frequency of
shedding, mean number of days CR influenza B virus was
detected, and peak titer ofthe B component were somewhat
higher when Mono B was given as a first dose than as a
second dose; for example, significantly more volunteers shed
CR influenza B virus > I day after primary than secondary
vaccination with Mono B (10/10 vs. 2/7; P = .003, Fisher's
exact test, data not shown). During the second study, the
frequency of shedding of the H3N2 component was significantly higher after primary vaccination with Bi A than after
secondary vaccination with Bi A (6/9 vs. 1/10, P = .02,
Fisher's exact test) or primary receipt of trivalent vaccine
(6/9 vs. 1/10, P = .02, Fisher's exact test).
Antibody responses. Serum antibody responses after inoculation with the CR influenza virus vaccines are summarized
in table 3. During the first study, serum antibody responses
to HI N I were less frequent when this virus was received in a
secondary than in a primary vaccination with Bi A (3/9 vs.
8/9, P < .05, Fisher's exact test), but although shedding of
HI N I was reduced after receipt oftrivalent vaccine as noted
above, 10 of II volunteers developed serum antibody responses after two doses ofthe latter. Frequencies ofantibody
responses against HI N I virus in study 2 were similar in all
groups.
In both studies, the frequency ofserum antibody response
to the B component was greatest in subjects given a primary
Mono B vaccination. During the first study, 6 of 9 subjects
who received Mono B as a primary vaccination developed an
antibody response compared with 2 of 9 that received it as a
secondary vaccination (not significant); also, in contrast to
results with A/H IN I, two doses oftrivalent vaccine failed to
overcome reduced replication of CR influenza B virus for
induction of serum antibody, and only 2 of II volunteers
developed a serum antibody response (P = .06 compared
with Mono B/Bi A group, Fisher's exact test). A similar trend
was noted during the second study; 7 of 10 subjects given
Mono B as a primary vaccine developed an antibody response compared with 4 of 9 given Mono B as a secondary
vaccine and 2 of 10 given two doses of trivalent vaccine.
Geometric mean serum antibody levels before and I month
after the first dose ofCR influenza B virus were not significantly different between groups, but subjects given Mono B
as a first dose had somewhat higher levels at I month in both
studies.
A low frequency ofserum antibody responses against the
H3N2 antigen was observed in the first study. The highest
frequency of response was in the group given CR 90 as a
component of primary vaccination with Bi A, but the differences between groups were not significant. Preinoculation
serum antibody titers against H3N2 virus were significantly
lower in this group compared with those of other vaccine
groups (P = .02, analysis of variance). Postinoculation titers
were not significantly different between groups. The frequencies of antibody response.to the H3N2 virus in the second study were similar in all groups, and pre- and postinoculation titers were not different between groups.
Geometric mean serum antibody levels against each ofthe
test viruses I month after a second dose of trivalent vaccine
were similar to those seen I month after the first dose (data
not shown).
Infection frequencies. The overall frequencies of infections with the three CR influenza virus vaccines in the
various vaccine groups are summarized in table 4. A high
level ofinfectivity ofinfluenza A/Kawasaki (H IN I) CR 125
was demonstrated in both studies; the lowest rate (56%) was
noted during the first study when CR 125 was given as a
component of Bi A I month after the CR influenza B virus
vaccine. In both studies, all subjects given Bi A vaccine as a
first dose were infected with CR 125.
Only 8 of 29 subjects were infected with A/Bethesda
(H3N2) CR 90 during the first study; infection rates were

Discussion
The safety ofmonovalent (H IN I, H3N2, or B) or bivalent
A (HINI and H3N2) CR influenza vaccine has been established in clinical trials after administration of>20,000 doses
[II]. Our experience with several CR vaccines among susceptible young adults indicates that about one-third will experience mild upper respiratory symptoms early after vaccination [8] (unpublished data). These symptoms and signs are
generally considered trivial by vaccinees, who characterize
them as mild colds. Observations during the present studies
suggest that inoculation of susceptible subjects with a trivalent vaccine containing each ofthe three strains ofinfluenza
currently circulating results in a level ofreactogenicity equivalent to that which develops after receipt of bivalent CR
influenza A or monovalent CR influenza B virus vaccines.
A trivalent CR influenza virus vaccine has also recently
been reported to be safe and immunogenic in triply seronegative infants and young children [12]. Although most of the
children were infected by all three CR vaccines, the study
design did not permit evaluation for the occurrence ofinterference. Our study design allowed us to compare the efficiency of several trivalent immunizing regimens: simultaneous inoculation in a trivalent vaccine with two doses a
month apart and sequential inoculations with bivalent CR
influenza A and monovalent CR influenza B vaccines or vice
versa 1 month apart. Serum neutralizing antibody assays
were used to select eligible volunteers because this type of
assay is a more sensitive measure of susceptibility to infection than is the serum HAl antibody assay.
The frequency ofHI N I viral shedding in both ofthe present studies and of A/H3N2 in study 2 was reduced in sub-

jects given trivalent vaccine compared with that ofsubjects
given bivalent vaccine as a first dose. The frequency ofserum
antibody responses against the CR influenza B virus in both
studies was significantly lower in groups given trivalent vaccine than in those given monovalent CR influenza B virus
vaccine as the first dose (4/21 vs. 13/19; P = .003, Fisher's
exact test). Whether subjects who shed virus in the absence
of a detectable serum antibody response will be protected
against naturally occurring influenza is unknown.
Previous studies with live attenuated influenza virus vaccines have demonstrated similar findings. Spencer et al. [13]
noted a reduction in the frequency of antibody responses to
influenza A/England/42/72 (H3N2) in a group of volunteers given bivalent vaccine containing inhibitor-resistant influenza A/H3N2 virus and influenza B (R-75) viruses compared with a group given monovalent inhibition-resistant
influenza A/H3N2 virus, suggesting that the influenza B
virus interfered with the influenza A virus infection. Others
[14, IS] have reported that simultaneous inoculation of humans with live attenuated influenza A/H3N2 and A/H IN I
viruses results in a lower rate of antibody responses to the
H3N2 component than does inoculation with monovalent
influenza A/H3N2 virus. Animal studies using hamsters and
ferrets have been initiated to determine if effective trivalent
vaccine formulations can be identified. Preliminary data indicate that interference might be overcome by adjusting the
doses of each monovalent vaccine.
Significant reductions in viral shedding and a trend toward
lower serum antibody responses were also observed after inoculations with heterotypic CR influenza viruses as a second
vaccination. When data from both studies are combined, significantly more subjects given monovalent CR influenza B
virus vaccine as a first dose were infected (20/20 vs. 10/18; P
< .001, Fisher's exact test) and developed a serum antibody
response (13/19 vs. 6/18; P = .05, Fisher's exact test) than
did subjects given the same vaccine I month after receiving
bivalent CR influenza A virus vaccine. Likewise, significantly more subjects given bivalent CR influenza A virus
vaccine as a first dose shed HI N 1and H3N2 virus and developed an antibody response against the HI N I virus than did
those given bivalent CRA vaccine I month after receiving
monovalent CR influenza B virus vaccine. These data suggest that nonspecific resistance to infection develops after
inoculation with both CR influenza A and B viruses and can
persist 1 month.
Similar results were obtained when volunteers were inoculated sequentially with heterotypic rhinoviruses [16]. In the
latter study, a nonspecific resistance to viral shedding accompanied by a reduction in illness was noted after reinoculation
with heterotypic virus at 5 weeks but had disappeared by 16
weeks. Our findings suggest that a l-month interval for successive doses of different CR influenza virus vaccines is suboptimal; a second dose of trivalent vaccine resulted in little
increase in the overall infection rates. Future studies are
needed to identify the optimal means for multivalent vaccination with CR viruses.
Antibody responses to the CR influenza A/H3N2 virus
used in our first study were uniformly low, reflecting both the
relatively poor immunizing efficiency ofCR 90 as well as the
relatively high level ofimmunity present in the study population. The median human infectious dose (HID5o) of A/Bethesda is estimated to be -- 106
.
5 in adults with preinoculation serum HAl antibody levels 1:8 [17], which is 3-10
times higher than the HID 50 ofearlier CR influenza A/H3N2
viruses [18, 19] (unpublished data). The H3N2 virus vaccine
used during the second study was considerably more infectious for subjects with an inoculum containing a similar
number ofTCID, which suggests a need for better indicators
for human infectivity ofthe CR viruses. Nevertheless, observations made during the two studies suggested that both simultaneous and sequential interference with shedding ofthe
H3N2 CR virus also occurred despite similar frequencies of
serum antibody responses.
In summary, two similar studies were done of susceptible
young adults given trivalent CR influenza virus vaccines. In
both studies, reduced viral shedding and serum antibody responses against vaccine viruses were observed. Moreover,
two doses of trivalent vaccine given 1 month apart, the
current recommendation for use ofinactivated trivalentinfluenza virus vaccine in unprimed subjects, did not restore responses to the level of those given a single dose ofthe monovalent B or bivalent A CR vaccines. While these
observations indicate that trivalent CR influenza virus vaccines are well tolerated, interference between the three
strains may pose an obstacle to the use oftrivalent vaccines
among persons susceptible to > I strain.
