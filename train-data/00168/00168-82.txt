The role of influenzalike illnesses and influenza vaccination in the development of Guillain-Barre´ syndrome
(GBS), particularly the role of A/H1N1 epidemics and A/H1N1 vaccination, is debated. Data on all incident GBS
cases meeting the Brighton Collaboration criteria that were diagnosed at 25 neurology centers in France were
prospectively collected between March 2007 and June 2010, covering 3 influenzavirus seasons, including the
2009–2010 A/H1N1 outbreak. A total of 457 general practitioners provided a registry of patients from which 1,080
controls were matched by age, gender, index date (calendar month), and region to 145 cases. Causal relations
were assessed by multivariate case-control analysis with adjustment for risk factors (personal and family history
of autoimmune disorders, among others), while matching on age, gender, and calendar time. Influenza (seasonal
or A/H1N1) or influenzalike symptoms in the 2 months preceding the index date was associated with GBS,
with a matched odds ratio of 2.3 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.7, 8.2). The difference in the rates of GBS
occurring between influenza virus circulation periods and noncirculation periods was highly statistically significant
(P ¼ 0.004). Adjusted odds ratios for GBS occurrence within 6 weeks after seasonal and A/H1N1 vaccination were
1.3 (95% CI: 0.4, 4.1) and 0.9 (95% CI: 0.1, 7.6), respectively. Study results confirm that influenza virus is a likely
risk factor for GBS. Conversely, no new concerns have arisen regarding influenza vaccination.

Guillain-Barre´ syndrome (GBS) is an immune-mediated
disorder of the peripheral nervous system usually presenting
as an acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy. Patients with GBS often recover within a few
months; however, nearly 20% develop permanent neurologic disabilities. In a nationwide study conducted in the
Unites States from 2000 to 2004, the mortality rate was
2.6%; rates as high as 10% have been reported (1–8). The
incidence of GBS varies between 1 and 4 cases per 100,000
person-years worldwide (4, 8). Men are at higher risk
(1.5 times) of GBS than women (8). Epidemiologic studies
from Europe and North America showed that GBS incidence increased with age and was 4 times higher in persons
aged 75 years or more than in those aged 30 years or less (8).
Infectious agents may trigger the immunopathologic process leading to GBS. Case-control studies have consistently
shown an association between previous infections caused
by Campylobacter jejuni or cytomegalovirus and GBS
occurrence (9). The data available on Epstein-Barr virus,
Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and other infections as possible
causative agents for GBS are less consistent. Anecdotal
reports following influenza virus infection or influenzalike
illnesses have been recently confirmed by analysis of the
United Kingdom’s General Practice Research Database

showing an association of influenza and influenzalike illnesses with GBS (10, 11).
Following implementation of the National Influenza
Immunization Program against swine influenza in the
United States in 1976, a possible increase in GBS incidence
was reported following A/New Jersey/76/H1N1 influenza
vaccination, leading to suspension of the vaccination program (12). In a few subsequent studies, investigators reported an increased risk of GBS following administration
of influenza vaccine (13, 14), while others did not find any
significant association (10, 15). Among these studies, only
1 concomitantly studied the presence of influenzalike illnesses and vaccination, providing evidence of a causative
role of influenza viruses as a risk factor for GBS rather than
the vaccine (10). To our best knowledge, no investigators
have reported specifically on A/H1N1 influenza and GBS
so far. In response to the emergence of a pandemic influenza
A/H1N1 virus outbreak in 2009, new influenza A/H1N1
vaccines were promptly developed and introduced in the
general population. In many countries, national vaccination
programs were launched, and vaccine safety monitoring
was a major concern for medical agencies and public health
authorities.
In 2007, we started a prospective case-control study
to explore the relation between exposure to medicines (including vaccines) and subsequent development of GBS.
Within this study, we examined whether influenza itself
and vaccination against influenza (i.e., seasonal influenza
and A/H1N1 influenza) might be associated with an increased risk of GBS. We also examined the temporal distribution of the GBS cases recruited by the participating study
centers during the periods with and without circulation of
influenza viruses.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study population
To be eligible for the study, cases and controls had to
be resident in continental France and had to be able to read
and respond to a telephone interview. Participation was
not restricted by age. The study protocol was submitted to
the Ethical Review Committee of Paris-Ile de France III
(Comite´ de Protection des Personnes Ile de France III)
and approved by the French Data Protection Authority
(Commission Nationale de l’Informatique et des Liberte´s).
All participants signed an informed consent form.
Cases
All university and major regional hospital centers (n ¼ 83)
from metropolitan France known to include a large
neurology clinic were approached to participate in the
Pharmacoepidemiologic General Research eXtension
(PGRx) System (LA-SER, Paris, France) network in neurology (PGRx-Neuro). In addition, 9 centers known to treat
neurologic diseases in children were approached. Among
the adult PGRx neurology centers, 46 (55.4%) agreed to
participate, of which 22 reported treating GBS and thus
were considered for the GBS registry (PGRx-GBS); 2 were
neurologic intensive care units. Of the pediatric centers, 6
(67%) agreed to participate, of which 3 were neuropediatric
units treating GBS cases; they were all considered for this
study. Consecutive subjects presenting with a clinical pattern evocative of GBS were prospectively identified by the
participating centers, and every eligible case was registered.
The recruiting neurologist completed a detailed medical
data form. Cases were ascertained for diagnostic certainty
using an algorithm based on the Brighton Collaboration
criteria for case definition (12, 16–19) considering clinical,
electrophysiologic, and cerebrospinal fluid data. Borderline
cases were reviewed by 2 independent experts who were
blinded to medication and vaccination exposure. Each case
was qualified according to the Brighton Collaboration levels
of certainty into level 1, 2, or 3 (Table 1) (12, 16–19). Cases
not meeting the criteria for any of these levels were not
retained. The index date of a case was defined as the date of
the first sign or symptom indicative of the episode of GBS
that led the subject to consult a physician (general practitioner or neurologist).
Each one of the GBS centers was visited every 2 months
at a minimum by an external clinical research assistant for
exhaustive recruitment. A formal audit of completeness of
inclusion and quality of data entered was done for every
center; a period of 2 months was randomly selected for this
audit. No additional eligible cases were found.
In anticipation of the influenza A/H1N1 vaccination
program, which started in October 2009, the 21 adult PGRx
neurology centers not specializing in GBS were surveyed to
locate all possible leads for capture of new GBS cases. The
neurology centers did not identify any GBS cases and are
not included in this report.
Controls
Controls were selected from a registry comprising general
practitioners from across France, which is made available
for studies using general practice patients (20). The 457
participating general practitioners were located in the same
regions as the neurology centers and had been contacted
after random selection from the French national list of
general practitioners. The participating general practitioners
were instructed to recruit patients regardless of their reasons

for consulting a physician. The general practitioners identified, registered, and recruited the first male patient and the
first female patient who presented to their practice and
agreed to take part in the study, for each of the following
age categories: <3, 3–6, 7–12, 13–17, 18–34, 35–49, 50–64,
65–79, and 80 years. For the age categories 50–64 years
and 65–79 years, the second male and the second female
presenting to the practice were also recruited. A registry of
8,147 subjects was thus constituted.
Physicians were requested to complete an electronic data
form for every subject in the registry, which included medical information (chronic diseases and comorbid conditions,
medical risk factors, and routine biologic data). Controls
were selected from this registry. All subjects fulfilling
the inclusion criteria and not meeting any of the exclusion
criteria were identified by the research team, and as many
controls as were available were individually matched to
cases. This was achieved by using an iterative matching
process, with a control being dropped from the pool after
matching. The dates for control recruitment were matched
(by calendar month) to the index date of the associated case.
Additional matching criteria included gender, age (65 years
for cases aged 18 years or more and 61 year for cases
younger than 18 years), and place of residence (northern
or southern France).
Data collection
In France, annual vaccination against seasonal influenza
is recommended for children aged 6 months–18 years,
adults aged 65 years or older, health-care workers, anyone
at least 6 months of age with certain underlying chronic
conditions, pregnant women, and people who come into
direct contact with anyone at high risk. However, following
the influenza virus outbreak in 2009, all residents of France
were urged to be vaccinated against A/H1N1. National vaccination coverage is assessed by the French Institute for
Public Health Surveillance (Institut de Veille Sanitaire).
Each participant (or one of his/her parents if under age
18 years) was interviewed by telephone, blindly to case/
control status. Participants had been previously sent a guide
to the structured interview. The guide included a list and a
packaged visual display of drugs and vaccines, compiled
according to a method used previously (21). Self-reported
data on use of drugs and vaccines for the last 2 years were
collected. Starting with the beginning of the French influenza A/H1N1 vaccination program, participants (cases and
controls) were specifically asked whether they had undergone vaccination for protection against influenza A/H1N1
virus, which was administered in specialized centers and
thus easily identifiable.
Objective confirmation of vaccine use was sought and
obtained in a sample of 40% of cases and controls for the
seasonal vaccination. The proportion was raised to 100%
during the A/H1N1 vaccination program. Confirmation of
vaccination included copies of vaccination sheets or certificates and/or a health agenda, vaccine batch numbers, attestation of vaccination against A/H1N1 viruses, or verification
that the latter vaccination had been received at a specialized
A/H1N1 vaccination center.
Other data
Additional data collected during the interview included
information on occupation, frequency of consultation with
a physician during the past 12 months, and use of other
drugs and vaccines. Additional information collected from
the physicians included data on family history of autoimmune diseases and major comorbid conditions (cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, musculoskeletal diseases, and
neurologic diseases).
Data about the temporal pattern of influenza epidemics
in France for the years 2007–2010 were obtained from the
French Regional Groups for the Surveillance of Influenza
(Groupes Re´gionaux d’Observation de la Grippe (GROG))
(22). The GROG network collects data related to influenza
incidence—seasonal and/or A/H1N1—across France. Each
day was categorized according to whether or not it was
included within a circulation period using GROG methodology (23).
Statistical analysis
The possible relation between influenza vaccines—seasonal
and A/H1N1—and GBS was investigated in the cases and
matched controls included in the case-control study. For the
influenza A/H1N1 vaccine, analysis was restricted to the GBS
cases that had occurred from commencement of the French
national vaccination program on October 20, 2009, to 6 weeks
after the end of the vaccination campaign on March 31, 2010.
Time windows at risk
The primary time window at risk was fixed at 6 weeks
according to the US Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (24). Secondly, 7-week to 3-month and 4-month
to 6-month time windows were also considered, as reported
by Stowe et al. (10).
Statistical methods
For each time window and vaccine, odds ratios with 95%
confidence intervals were computed using conditional logistic regression models taking into account the variable number of controls per case (25). Two logistic regression models
were used for each analysis. In model 1, results were specifically adjusted using the matching variables (matched
odds ratio). Model 2 estimated odds ratios adjusted for the
risk factors considered for each analysis. Separate models
were fitted for each main variable under consideration.
For the study of influenza vaccination, use of seasonal
influenza vaccines and/or A/H1N1 influenza vaccines was
considered with respect to the index date for the primary
time window at risk. The risk factors considered for this
analysis were: 1) administration of any other vaccine during
the time window for exposure under study (yes/no); 2) past
use of influenza vaccine(s)—report of vaccination for previous influenza seasons (1 or more years preceding the index
date) (yes/no); 3) family history of autoimmune diseases
(yes/no); 4) number of physician visits in the previous year
(0–2, 3–6, 7–12, or 13); 5) receipt of antibiotic or antiviral
treatments during the 2 months preceding the index date

(yes/no); and 6) antipyretic intake during the 2 months preceding the index date (yes/no).
The study of the effect of influenzalike illnesses included
the presence of influenza or influenzalike illnesses during
the 2 months preceding the index date, adjusted for receipt
of influenza vaccine (seasonal and/or A/H1N1 vaccines) and
factors 1–4 above. For the sensitivity analysis, recent bacterial or viral infection was defined as reporting of influenza,
reporting of influenzalike symptoms, and/or use of antibiotic, antiviral, or antipyretic agents during the 2 months
preceding the index date (data on influenza and influenzalike illnesses were collected from October 2009 onward).
To assess the potential effect of overmatching by age
(which was thought to be related to the probability of exposure to influenza vaccine), we performed 2 sensitivity
analyses: 1) an unconditional logistic regression analysis
including age as a continuous variable for the same population of cases and controls as the one used for the main
analysis and 2) a conditional logistic regression analysis
adjusted for age (in addition to the criteria used for the main
analysis adjustment) performed using a new set of controls
selected from the reference population by matching only on
date, gender, and place of residence.
We also examined the temporal distribution of the GBS
cases with regard to the influenza circulating period data in
the centers participating from October 2008 to March 2010
(in the preceding year, only a few centers had joined the
study). The mean monthly numbers of GBS cases occurring
in circulating and noncirculating periods were compared
using a t test. Both A/H1N1 and seasonal influenza vaccination in the reference population was compared with expectations. For that purpose, the vaccination proportion
observed in the recruited sample was standardized for
the age and gender structure of the French population. Standardization to gender and age strata used for recruitment
was based on the 2009 census survey (http://www.insee.fr/)
from the French National Institute of Statistics and Economic
Studies (Institut National de la Statistique et des E´tudes
E´ conomiques).
RESULTS
Between March 2007 and June 2010, 175 subjects were
referred to the study centers and recruited for the study in
the 25 GBS-specialized adult and pediatric neurology centers. None of the recruited subjects was seen at the additional 21 PGRx neurology centers not specializing in GBS.
Among the cases referred, 173 met Brighton level 1, 2, or 3
criteria for GBS; 1 was later confirmed as a case of chronic
polyradiculoneuritis, and another case not meeting the
Brighton criteria for GBS was rejected. From the 173 included cases, 18 persons accepted but could not be reached
for the interview (after several attempts were made up
to 45 days following recruitment), 3 refused to participate
afterwards, and 7 were interviewed but no control from the
general practitioners’ registry was found to match them in
the appropriate time window (Figure 1). Thus, 145 cases and
1,080 matched controls were included in this study. Among
the included cases, 33 (22.7%) were first seen in emergency
rooms of other hospitals in the same geographic area as
the GBS-specialized centers but without units specializing
in GBS; none of these were tertiary referrals.
The clinical features of the GBS cases are summarized
in Table 2. The incident cases meeting the Brighton criteria
were distributed as follows: 113, 29, and 3 cases for levels
1, 2, and 3 of GBS, respectively. The main characteristics
of cases and controls included in the case-control study are
shown in Table 3. The mean age of cases was 48.6 years
(standard deviation, 18; range, 4–79), and 61% were male.
While 56% of the subjects had merely a motor syndrome,
31% showed both sensory and motor symptoms (Table 2).
At hospital admission, 29% of the subjects had severe motor
disorders and/or major respiratory difficulties (Hughes score
4–5). No in-hospital deaths were reported. The mean delay
between the first sign or symptom and inclusion in the study
was 58.9 days (standard deviation, 24.6; range, 3–92).
Overall, the comparison between cases and controls
showed no meaningful difference (Table 3) with regard to
sociodemographic factors, occupation, history of neurologic
disorders, or family history of autoimmune diseases. The
most frequent diagnoses among controls at the time of
recruitment were cardiovascular and musculoskeletal disorders, as expected for this general practice population
(results not shown). The frequency of consultation with a
general practitioner was similar for both groups.
Table 4 displays the mean rate of occurrence of GBS
cases per month in the participating centers between
October 2008 and March 2010 using the dates of the cases’
first symptoms, separating the periods of influenza virus
circulation and noncirculation according to the GROG
method. In the absence of influenza virus circulation, the
rates were 4.24 cases per 30 days in 2008 and 4.36 cases per
30 days in 2009 (average ¼ 4.29 cases per 30 days). During
the 2008–2009 seasonal influenza circulating period, the
rate was 6.22 cases per 30 days, and during the corresponding period in 2009–2010, when both the seasonal and
A/H1N1 influenza viruses were circulating, the rate was 8.03
cases per 30 days (average for influenza circulating periods ¼ 7.26 cases per 30 days). The difference between the
rates of GBS case occurrence during circulating and noncirculating periods was statistically significant (P ¼ 0.004);
this was not the case for the comparisons within circulation
and noncirculation periods. Unexpectedly, 17 cases occurred
in January 2010 alone (8 cases in January 2009).
In the case-control analysis of patients recruited from
October 2009 onward, the presence of influenza or influenzalike illnesses during the 2 months preceding the index
date was associated with the occurrence of GBS, with
a matched odds ratio of 2.33 (95% confidence interval
(CI): 0.66, 8.19) (data recorded from October 2009 onward)
and an adjusted odds ratio of 2.11 (95% CI: 0.57, 7.73)
(Table 5). In the analysis using the whole patient population
recruited, the adjusted odds ratio for GBS associated with
influenza, influenzalike illnesses, or markers of acute infection (antibiotic, antiviral, or antipyretic use) during the 2
months preceding the index date was 2.04 (95% CI: 1.18,
3.50) (Table 5).
Among the 2,077 potential referents recruited between
October 20, 2009 (the start of the A/H1N1 influenza
GBS and A/H1N1, Seasonal Influenzalike Illness, and Vaccination 329

vaccination season) and June 2010, 147 (7.1%) had been
vaccinated (at any point in the past) against A/H1N1, corresponding to 7.3% (95% CI: 6.0, 8.6) when standardized
to the structure of the French population. Similarly, during
the winter of 2009–2010, among the 2,355 potential referents recruited from September 10, 2009 (the start of the
seasonal influenza vaccination season) to June 2010, 589
(25.0%) had been vaccinated with seasonal influenza vaccines, corresponding to 20% (95% CI: 18, 21) when standardized to the structure of the French population. These
percentages of use of both influenza vaccines were comparable to expectations (7.9% and 26% for A/H1N1 and
seasonal influenza vaccination coverage, respectively,
according to the Institute for Public Health Surveillance).
For subjects aged 65 years or older, 67% and 8.5% were
vaccinated against A/H1N1 and seasonal influenza, respectively, which is very close to observed figures in the
French population.
The proportion of subjects who had been exposed to
an influenza vaccine—either or both seasonal vaccine and
A/H1N1 vaccine—during the 6-week time window was
4.1% for GBS cases and 3.0% for controls (Table 6). For
this primary time window, exposure to any influenza vaccine
was associated with GBS, with an adjusted odds ratio
of 1.22 (95% CI: 0.45, 3.32). When seasonal and A/H1N1
vaccination were examined separately, the adjusted odds
ratio for exposure to seasonal influenza vaccine within the
6 weeks before GBS onset was 1.30 (95% CI: 0.41, 4.12);
for the influenza A/H1N1 vaccine, the odds ratio was 0.92
(95% CI: 0.11, 7.55). In the secondary analysis using the
7-week to 3-month and 4-month to 6-month time windows,
the odds ratio estimates were all under or around unity and
were not statistically significant (Table 6).
In the sensitivity analysis using the same populations
of cases and matched controls as the ones used for the
main analysis in unconditional logistic regression, the
crude and adjusted odds ratio estimates for exposure within
the 6 weeks before GBS onset were 1.41 (95% CI: 0.58,
3.44) and 1.22 (95% CI: 0.48, 3.14), respectively, for
all influenza vaccines; 1.64 (95% CI: 0.61, 4.39) and 1.41
(95% CI: 0.49, 4.06), respectively, for seasonal influenza
vaccines; and 0.78 (95% CI: 0.10, 6.26) and 1.02 (95% CI:
0.11, 9.04), respectively, for influenza A/H1N1 vaccines.
Additionally, the selection of controls without matching
on age (matched only on gender and index date) yielded
151 cases and 5,054 matched controls over the entire study
period and 40 cases and 1,162 matched controls over
the period from October 20, 2009, to March 31, 2010.
The matched crude and adjusted odds ratio estimates for
exposure within the 6 weeks before GBS onset were 0.93
(95% CI: 0.39, 2.24) and 1.11 (95% CI: 0.45, 2.75), respectively, for all influenza vaccines; 0.95 (95% CI: 0.36,
2.49) and 1.13 (95% CI: 0.42, 3.08), respectively, for seasonal influenza vaccines; and 0.81 (95% CI: 0.11, 6.20)
and 1.03 (95% CI: 0.13, 8.26), respectively, for influenza
A/H1N1 vaccines.

DISCUSSION
The present study had the unique advantage of starting
long before the A/H1N1 pandemic was announced and in
the absence of any alert, and it combined both exhaustive
recruitment of cases in the study centers and a case-control
analysis. In addition, to our knowledge, it is the sole study
on this topic using clinical data where GBS cases have been
confirmed. A significantly higher occurrence of GBS was
observed during influenza virus circulating periods in 2008–
2009 and 2009–2010 than during comparative noncirculating periods. Whether these differences could be attributable
to vaccination as opposed to the viral infection itself was
studied with the case-control analysis. It also found that
subjects with a recent history of influenza or influenzalike
symptoms showed higher odds of GBS but that vaccination
itself was not associated with significantly elevated odds
ratios, regardless of whether the vaccine was seasonal or
A/H1N1 vaccine.
Practically all influenza viruses circulating in the 2009–
2010 winter season were the A/H1N1 strain, whereas seasonal influenza viruses were circulating during the same
period in 2008–2009. The rate of GBS occurrence in
2009–2010 was slightly higher than that in 2008–2009,
but this difference was not statistically significant.
Our findings were consistent with those of Stowe et al.
(10) and Tam et al. (11), who reported an increased risk
of GBS during the 2-month period following influenza or
influenzalike illness in patients from the United Kingdom’s
General Practice Research Database. Stowe et al. (10) also
reported no appreciable evidence of an increased risk of
GBS with seasonal influenza vaccines.
According to figures released by the European Medicines
Agency in early May 2010, 46 million Europeans had been

immunized against influenza A/H1N1 virus and 111 GBS
cases had been reported following vaccination, yielding
an estimated GBS incidence of 2.4 cases per million
among vaccinated persons (26). Experts from the European
Medicines Agency concluded that there was no indication of a risk similar to the one feared during the 1976
influenza vaccination program in the United States (26).
However, in view of possible underreporting of cases,
epidemiologic studies were recommended.
In the United States, several studies have pointed towards
an increased incidence of GBS associated with influenza
vaccines, including A/H1N1. Preliminary data from the
GBS surveillance conducted by the US Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention after 2009–2010 influenza A/H1H1

vaccination showed incidences of 1.9 per 100,000 personyears and 1.2 per 100,000 person-years among vaccinated
and unvaccinated persons, respectively (24). Our data did
not support such an association, but our study had limited
statistical power to address this question. Interestingly,
Lasky et al. (14) had previously reported an adjusted relative risk of 1.7 for GBS and influenza vaccination in the
combined 1992–1993 and 1993–1994 periods, using a
population-based study. Juurlink et al. (13) reported a relative incidence of 1.45 when comparing between exposure
and control periods where the majority of vaccines administered to adults were assumed to be for influenza. However,
the 3 US studies (13, 14, 24) could not control for some
confounding factors, such as influenza illnesses before the
GBS index date. In our study, the numbers of GBS cases
referred to the study centers were similar during the influenza A/H1N1 vaccination programs in 2009–2010 and the
corresponding 2008–2009 periods.
A case-control study is a valid and efficient design with
which to examine the risk of rare events, also appraising
causal associations and potential confounding, while matching for factors associated with calendar time (21). Usual

threats to validity with the use of such a design are selection
bias and recall bias. The systematic recruitment of subjects
in the PGRx registry used for this study, verified through
the audit of study centers, greatly minimized the possibility
of selection bias. A major strength in this respect consists
of the study’s being launched in the absence of any alert,
nearly 2 years before the influenza A/H1N1 virus pandemic
and the beginning of the French vaccination program.
The reliability of the exposure data also contributes to its
strength, further validated by the study of objective sources
of information, which confirmed reported exposures in all
subjects in the sample studied. The overall rate of exposure to influenza vaccines in controls, notably exposure to
A/H1N1 vaccination (7.3% over the entire study period),
are almost identical to expectations derived from national
statistics (7.9% also for the A/H1N1 vaccine). The consideration of influenzalike illness as a potential confounder
in a substudy and the consideration of seasonality through
the matching on calendar time by month are additional
advantages of our study, since these confounders were
not always considered fully in some of the studies cited
above (13, 14, 24). Persons vaccinated against influenza are more likely to have been recently exposed to
influenza and to have developed the initial symptoms of
the disease. Such protopathic bias may represent a serious
confounder in studies not controlling for the presence of
these symptoms (13).
There were some limitations to our study. Firstly, both
of the general-practice-based studies conducted by Stowe
et al. (10) and Tam et al. (11) estimated odds ratios of
approximately 18 (16.64 and 18.64 for 1-month and 2-
month at-risk periods, respectively), suggesting that exposure misclassification might have occurred in our study.
The resulting odds ratio of 2.3 is probably due to the retrospective collection of data on exposure. In fact, the statistical corrections for misclassification of Campylobacter
infection reported by Tam et al. in their study (11), for
example, resulted in considerably higher odds ratios than
originally estimated. Secondly, the statistically significant
difference observed between the rate of GBS cases occurring during influenza circulating and noncirculating periods
should be cautiously interpreted. Because no such data
are available from previous years, this difference could
be explained either by the circulation of influenza viruses
or by seasonal variations due to circulation of other GBScausing pathogens. Thirdly, only 40 GBS cases occurred
during the influenza A/H1N1 vaccination program; therefore, the ability to detect a small increase in GBS risk was
very limited. The addition of 1 more exposed case might
have resulted in substantial changes in the odds ratio estimates. Thus, our findings cannot rule out a risk of very
small magnitude associated with influenza vaccination.
The case-control analysis of influenza A/H1N1 vaccination
had little statistical power, but no signal emerged from
the monitoring study of 46 large neurology centers throughout the country: Only 1 confirmed GBS case exposed to
A/H1N1 vaccination during the previous 6 weeks was observed at the 25 GBS-specialized neurology centers, which
were constantly monitored over the study period. No GBS
cases at all occurred at the remaining 21 large neurology
centers that were monitored during the A/H1N1 vaccination
campaign, despite several million persons being vaccinated
throughout the country.
Influenza infections and influenzalike illnesses are likely
risk factors for GBS and should therefore be considered
serious confounders in future studies of GBS and vaccination. On the other hand, no new concerns about influenza
vaccination, notably use of the A/H1N1 vaccine, have been
identified. However, in view of the very rare incidence of
GBS and the resultant paucity of available data, monitoring
of influenza vaccine safety is still needed.
