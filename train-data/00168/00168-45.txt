Influenza Immunization: Field Trial on a University Campus
Robert H. Waldman and Wilmer J. Coggins From the Department of Medicine, University of
Florida College of Medicine, Gainesville, Florida
The purpose of this field trial on influenza vaccine, which was done with a population of university students, was to compare the aerosol route with the subcutaneous route of vaccine administration and the Hong Kong influenza vaccine
with the older A2 influenza vaccine ("bivalent" vaccine). Side-effects of the vaccines were significantly higher in the groups that received the vaccine subcutaneously. There were no more side-effects in those who received vaccine by aerosol.
There was a significant reduction in the rate of illness in all groups vaccinated
except for the group given bivalent vaccine subcutaneously. Recipents of Hong
Kong vaccine had significantly greater protection than did recipients of the bivalent vaccine. Recipients of aerosol vaccine had significantly better protection
than did those who received vaccine by the subcutaneous route. The data suggest
that protection was closely related to the ability of the vaccine to stimulate nasalsecretion antibody to the A2 Hong Kong influenza virus.
In a field trial conducted during the epidemic of
Asian influenza in 1967-1968, the effectiveness
of influenza-virus vaccine administered by aerosol inhalation was compared with that of the same
vaccine given subcutaneously. The data indicated
that immunization by aerosol resulted in a lower
incidence of side-effects, afforded more protection
in terms of both number of cases and duration of
illnesses during the epidemic, was easier to give,
and was more pleasant for the recipient [1].
However, results of field trials with vaccine can
be variable, as shown by the results of field trials
with the subcutaneous influenza vaccine [2, 3].
Therefore, when it became evident in 1968 that
there had been a major antigenic change in the
prevalent influenza virus, a similar field trial was
conducted, this time in an open population rather
than in a prison population and with larger numbers of participants. In addition to comparing the
aerosol route with the subcutaneous route of vaccine administration, the study was designed to
answer two questions: (1) how much protection
was afforded by the vaccine previously in use

(the "bivalent" vaccine), given either by aerosol
or subcutaneously in the epidemic of Hong Kong
influenza, and (2) how much (if any) additional
protection was imparted by a booster immunization, whatever the route or vaccine used.
Materials and Methods
Volunteers. Volunteers were students at the
University of Florida and students and employees
at the University College of Medicine and its
teaching hospitals (Shands Teaching Hospital
and the Veterans Administration Hospital). The
volunteers were assigned randomly to groups and
were immunized in a double-blind manner as
shown in table 1.
Vaccines. Two vaccines were used; the Hong
Kong influenza vaccine consisted of 200 chickcell agglutinating (CCA) units of A2/ Aichi/l/68
virus (kindly provided by Lederle Laboratories,
Pearl River, N.Y.), and the bivalent influenza
vaccine consisted of 150 CCA units each of A2/
Japan/170/62 and A2/Taiwan/l/64 strains and
200 CCA units of B/Massachusetts/3/66 virus
(Lederle). These vaccines had not been purified
by zonal ultracentrifugation.
Placebo. Placebo used was 0.9% NaC!.
Administration of vaccine or placebo. Each
volunteer received 1 ml of material subcutaneously and 1 ml of similar or different material
by aerosol (table 1). The dates of immunizations
were December 2-6, 1968 and January 11-13,

1969. All vials and bottles were coded and
wrapped so that the optical density could not be
ascertained by the volunteer or by the person dispensing the material. Two differences between the
vaccines were not "blindable," i.e., the taste of
the aerosol vaccine and the pain of administration
of the sc vaccine. However, there appeared to be
no difference between the taste or pain caused by
the Hong Kong and bivalent vaccines (see sideeffects results below), and very few volunteers.
knew that the vaccines tasted or felt differently.
The aerosolized vaccine was administered with
the DeVilbiss no. 286 compressed-air atomizer
(DeVilbiss, Toledo, Ohio), which emits particles
with a mean size of about 50f.tm. Previous studies.
from this laboratory had shown that this size
stimulated optimal antibody response in nasal'
secretions and sputum [4]. One-half milliliter
was administered into the posterior oropharynx
during deep inspiration, and 0.25 ml was administered into each nostril.
Specimens. Blood and nasal washings were
obtained before immunization and immediately
before the booster immunization in about 10%
of the volunteers, selected in a random fashion.
The method used to collect the nasal washings
has been described [5]. Blood was obtained during acute illness and three weeks later in about
one-third of those who reported illness.
Hemadsorption-inhibition-neutralization test.
Specimens of sera and nasal secretions were
tested against 30-300 50% tissue-culture infectious doses (TCID50) of A2/Hong Kong/8/68
and/or A2/Bethesda/10/63 influenza viruses by
the neutralization test previously described [6].
Isolation of virus. In about one-third of those
who reported illness, specimens from throat gargles were obtained on the day of onset of illness,
using Gey's medium. Within 1 hr, 0.1 ml of the
fluid was inoculated into rhesus monkey-kidney
tissue-culture tubes in duplicate, and blind passage was done three days later. Hemadsorption
was tested on the first- and second-passage tissueculture cells, using guinea-pig erythrocytes. Four
positive samples were passed once more, and 100
TCID50 were mixed with various dilutions of antisera to A2/HK/8/68, A2/Bethesda/1O/63, and
B/Massachusetts viruses; the resultant mixture
was then tested for the presence of virus, again
in monkey-kidney tissue-culture tubes.

the time of the first immunization, each volunteer
was given a card on which to circle possible sideeffects of the vaccine. If the cards were not returned by one week after immunization, vaccinees
were contacted by letter, and then by telephone
after one more week. Side-effects were divided
into three categories: (l ) local (pain and/or
tenderness and redness and/or swelling at the site
of injection); (2) general (fever, muscle pain,
nausea or vomiting, diarrhea, and malaise); and
(3) respiratory (stuffy and/or runny nose, sore
throat, cough, and shortness of breath). A positive side-effect was only one which had not been
present before immunization. The number of
positive responses for each of the groups of sideeffects was totaled.
Evaluation of illness. Volunteers were given
forms on which to keep daily records of their
symptoms. The forms were returned weekly. If
they were not returned within one week, the individuals were contacted. Twenty-seven volunteers
(3%) did not return all of their questionnaires,
and they were dropped from the study. Volunteers were asked to call one of the investigators
or to go to the student infirmary if they became
ill. Influenza-like illness was defined as a febrile
respiratory illness. Volunteers were asked to take
their temperature or to have it taken, and fever was
considered to be an oral temperature of over
99.5 F. Duration of illness was defined as the
number of days a person had a respiratory symptom and fever.
Results
Side-effects. When compared with the group
who received the placebo, only the groups that

Waldman and Coggins
received vaccine subcutaneously had significant
side-effects (table 2). Both local (pain, tenderness, swelling, redness) and general (fever,
malaise, etc.) reactions were greatest in those
who received the A2/Hong Kong vaccine sc
(P < .05), but both types of reaction were also
significantly elevated in those who received the
bivalent vaccine sc. There was no increase in local
side-effects (rhinorrhea, sore throat, or cough)
in any of the groups that received a vaccine by
aerosol when they were compared with the placebo group.
Serologic results of immunization. Data is
available only on the antibody response after the
primary immunization; however, differences were
noted (table 3). The antibody responses in both
the serum and nasal washings were less in those
who received the A2/Hong Kong vaccine by
aerosol than in those who received the bivalent
vaccine by aerosol, when tested against the homologous strains. However, there was no apparent difference between the immunogenicity of the
two vaccines when administered subcutaneously.
In fact, the antibody response in nasal washings
was of greatest magnitude after the subcutaneous
bivalent vaccine. With both vaccines, the best
nasal-secretion antibody response was seen in the
groups receiving aerosol, and the best serum response in the groups immunized sc.
Incidence of influenza-like illness. Compared
with the placebo group, there was significant
(;(2 < .05) reduction in rate of illness in all
groups except the group that received bivalent
vaccine sc (see table 4 and figure 1). Recipients
of Hong Kong vaccine had significantly greater
protection than did recipients of bivalent vaccine

.02). Recipients of aerosolized vaccine had significantly greater protection than did recipients
of sc vaccine (28 of 389 ill, compared with 44
of 377, P < .05). The type of vaccine was more
important, however, than the route of immunization, since the group who received Hong Kong
vaccine sc had greater protection than did the
group who received aerosol bivalent vaccine.
With respect to the epidemic, most of the illnesses occurred during Christmas vacation; this
was unfortunate because the students were less
prompt in reporting their illness. However, the
timing of the illnesses had the advantage of
spreading the students, so that there is little
chance that illness occurred in clusters of vaccinees living in groups. Illnesses during the first
one or two weeks after the primary immunization
were not excluded from analysis, since the onset
of effectiveness of influenza immunization is unknown; this follows from the fact that the mechTable 4. Incidence of influenza-like illness among

present in 16. In four cases this agent was tested
to determine its antigenic relationship to the older
Asian strains, the Hong Kong strain, or a B strain.
In all four cases the hemadsorbing agent was an
A2/Hong Kong virus.
Serologic response after influenza-like illness.
Acute and convalescent sera were available from
28 persons in the groups receiving placebos or
bivalent vaccine. Of these, 24 exhibited a fourfold or greater rise in serum neutralizing antibody
to A2/Hong Kong/8/68 virus. Serologies were
not performed on the recipients of Hong Kong
vaccine, since it would be difficult to differentiate
rises in antibody due to vaccine from those due
to illness.
Duration of illness. The mean duration of
illness was 2.5 days for the volunteers who became ill and who had received the bivalent vaccine by aerosol, 2.8 days for the group who had
received Hong Kong vaccine sc, 3.0 days for the
group who had received placebos, and 3.1 days
for the group who had received aerosol Hong
Kong vaccine. None of the differences are statistically significant.
Symptoms of volunteers who became ill. An
oral temperature above 101 F was recorded by
56% of those who had "influenza-like" ilness,
with an average duration of 1.5 days; a temperature of over 102 F was recorded by 33% for 1.7
days. The most common symptom (78%) was
nasal, either stuffiness or rhinorrhea, with an
average duration of 3.7 days. Next in order were
cough (72%,3.9 days), sore throat (67%,4.5
days), headache (56%, 3.6 days), chills (50%,
3.2 days), chest pain (33%, 4.7 days), and
lymphadenopathy (6 %, 2.0 days). The various
symptoms appeared independently of each other;
e.g., chills were no more common in those with
high fever than in those with low fever.
Effects of age and previous influenza immunization. The average age of the volunteers was
21.0 years, as compared with 22.4 years in the
volunteers who became ill with influenza-like
illness (P < .05). Of all volunteers, 64% reported no prior influenza immunization, 6% had
been immunized before 1965, 4% in 1965, 6%
in 1966, and 19% in 1967. Of the volunteers
who became ill, 78% had no prior influenza immunization, 8% had been immunized before
1965, 6% in 1965, 1% in 1966, and 8% in
1967 (P < .05).
Waidman and Coggins
Discussion
This study was set up to compare three variables
in influenza immunization: route of immunization, old vs. new vaccine, and necessity of a
booster. The results partially answer the first two
questions, but the fact that the booster was given
at the end of the epidemic makes evaluation of
the third variable impossible.
Several other field trials have been reported in
which aerosol and subcutaneous immunization
have been compared. In one done in a prison
population during the epidemic of Asian influenza
in 1967-1968, the group immunized by the aerosol route had a protection rate about fourfold
greater than did the group immunized subcutaneously [1]. In another field trial during the same
epidemic as the one reported in this study (1968-
1969), the effect of booster immunization was
evaluated; among those who received only one
immunization, the groups immunized subcutaneously had protection rates about four-fold greater
than the groups receiving aerosol, while those
who had two immunizations had about equal
rates of protection [7]. In yet another field trial
in 1968-1969, immunization by aerosol was ineffective [8]. In the present study, those receiving
the Hong Kong vaccine by aerosol or subcutaneously had about equal rates of protection, while
of those receiving the bivalent vaccine, the group
given vaccine by aerosol had about twice as much
protection.
There are several possible explanations for
these variable results. Among these are (l) possible differences in the immune response in persons with preexisting antibody, as opposed to
persons without, and (2) the difference in the
technique of immunization. The differences among
the populations studied in the various field trials
with Hong Kong vaccine are probably insignificant. If this is indeed true, then the different results obtained are most likely due to the difference
in technique of administration of vaccine by
aerosol. There is evidence that this is true, in
that the serum and nasal-secretion antibody responses in the other two studies mentioned were
greatly reduced as compared with those observed
in the present study [7, 9].
The major difference between the results of the
1967-1968 study and those of this study is that
in the former, the group receiving aerosol was
 at University of Manitoba on June 20, 2015 http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from 
Influenza Vaccine Field Trial
protected against illness to a much greater extent
than was the group receiving vaccine subcutaneously, while in the present study, the two routes
of immunization with the Hong Kong vaccine
gave approximately equal protection. The rates
of protection indicate that this equalization of the
two routes was not due to a fall in the protection
rate of the group receiving aerosol but to a rise
in the rate for the group receiving vaccine subcutaneously in 1968-1969. Protection afforded
by subcutaneous immunization may be inversely
related to the level of preexisting serum antibody,
for in the 1967-1968 trial, the preexisting titer
against the "Asian" A2 influenza virus was 1:40;
in the 1968-1969 trial it was 1:60 against the
"Asian" A2, but <1:4 against A2/Hong Kong.
Since the serum or respiratory-secretion antibody
response to subcutaneous immunization could be
effected by the presence of preexisting antibody,
we compared the serum and nasal-secretion antibody response to the two vaccines. This is obviously less desirable than comparing the response
to the same vaccine in people with and without
preexisting antibody, but the latter was not possible since, at the time of the study, nearly everyone had antibody to the Asian A2, and no one
had antibody to the Hong Kong variant. The
results indicate that the nasal-secretion antibody
response was less in those with preexisting serum
antibody, but that the serum antibody response
was similar whether or not preexisting antibody
was present in serum.
The second question in this field trial was the
evaluation of the effectiveness of the "old" (bivalent) vaccine which contained inactivated virus
only minimally related to the epidemic A2/Hong
Kong virus. When the bivalent vaccine was given
subcutaneously, the protection rate was 40% of
that after aerosol immunization with the Hong
Kong vaccine. When the bivalent vaccine was
given by aerosol, the protection rate was 75%
of that resulting from aerosolized Hong Kong
vaccine. Although we have reported the antibody
response to the bivalent vaccine against both the
Asian A2 influenza virus and the A2/Hong Kong
virus, the response to the latter would seem to be
more relevant to protection against infection with
A2/Hong Kong virus. There was no rise in serum
antibody in the recipients of the bivalent vaccine
by either route, which conforms with the data
on the very low level of serologic cross-reaction
247
between the old A2 viruses and the A2/Hong
Kong variant [to]. In contrast, there was a nasalsecretion antibody response to the bivalent vaccine in 27% who received the vaccine by aerosol.
This apparently greater degree of cross-reactivity
of nasal-secretion antibody is consistent with data
reported in two other recent studies of serum and
respiratory-secretion antibody after influenza immunization [11, 12]. The protection in the recipients of the bivalent vaccine supports the data
indicating that respiratory-secretion antibody
plays a protective role, and that this is most efficiently stimulated by local application of the
antigen.
Evaluation of the unwanted side-effects of the
vaccines in this study is in agreement with the
results of the other studies comparing side-effects
of aerosol vs. subcutaneous vaccine; i.e., although
there are significant local and general side-effects
after subcutaneous vaccination, the side-effects,
local or general, after aerosol administration are
not different from those after placebo administration. The incidence of side-effects in all groups
appears to be extremely high, possibly due to the
crude nature of the vaccine used (not purified
ultracentrifugally). The side-effects reported include both subjective and objective symptoms,
including side-effects such as a painful arm, which
many people experience transiently after the injection of normal saline. We feel that the absolute percentages of side-effects are not as important as the comparison of the percentages between
the various vaccine groups.
Duration of illness was the same in all groups,
i.e., about 2.5-3.0 days. In the field trial in 1967-
1968, there were significant differences in duration of illness in the various groups; however,
because of the type of population studied
(prison), the duration was evaluated differently,
i.e., by the duration of release from work duties,
granted by a medical technician.
One other interesting difference that was noted
between those who became ill and the whole
study group was their history of influenza immunization. Significantly fewer of those who became
ill gave a history of prior influenza immunization;
this was particularly noticeable for recent years. It
is recognized that college students, with an average age of about 20, who have been immunized
by various procedures over the years, would not
be likely to give a highly accurate history of vac-

cination. The error, however, might be equal
in those who were ill in and those who were not.
Those who reported their illness, (i.e., those with
a low threshold) are known to be a more healthconscious group [13] who would probably tend
to remember their past "flu shots," in contrast to
the students who remained well. The serologic
data are not helpful in explaining the apparent
effect of influenza vaccine in earlier years. The
titers before immunization of serum and nasalsecretion antibody against both the A2/Hong
Kong and A2ITaiwan viruses showed no effect
of influenza immunization in prior years.
