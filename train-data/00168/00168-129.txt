Objective To study the impact of influenza vaccine administered to pregnant women during all trimesters on the
rates of preterm and small for gestational age (SGA) births, evaluating both increased and decreased risk.
Study design This retrospective observational matched cohort study involved 7 Vaccine Safety Datalink sites
across the US for the 2004-05 through 2008-09 influenza seasons. Cohort eligibility and outcomes were determined
from administrative, claims, medical records, and birth data. In propensity score– and vaccine exposure time–
matched analyses, ORs for preterm and SGA births were calculated.
Results Among 57 554 matched vaccinated and unvaccinated pregnant women, including 16 240 women in the
first trimester, maternal vaccination was not associated with increased or decreased risk for preterm birth (OR for
delivery at <37 weeks gestation, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.93-1.02]; for delivery at #32 weeks gestation, 0.98 [95% CI, 0.86-
1.12]; and for delivery at #34 weeks gestation, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.88-1.04]) or SGA birth (OR for <5th percentile weight
for gestational age, 1.02 [95% CI, 0.96-1.09], and for <10th percentile weight for gestational age, 1.00 [95% CI,
0.96-1.04]). Similarly, first trimester vaccination was not associated with increased or decreased risk for preterm
or SGA birth.
Conclusion Receipt of trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine during pregnancy was not associated with
increased or decreased risk of preterm or SGA birth. These findings support the safety of vaccinating pregnant
women against influenza during the first, second, and third trimesters, and suggest that a nonspecific protective
effect of the influenza vaccine for these outcomes does not exist. (J Pediatr 2014;164:1051-7).
Numerous studies have evaluated the relationship between influenza vaccination during pregnancy and birth outcomes.1-10 This research has evaluated the safety of both the seasonal trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine
(TIV)1,2,6,9 and the 2009 monovalent influenza A virus (H1N1) pandemic influenza vaccine.3,5,7,8,10 To date, no studies
have detected an increased risk for preterm or small for gestational age (SGA) birth following maternal influenza vaccination;
however, none of these studies has reported on a large cohort vaccinated during the first trimester.1-10
Several reports have documented potential nonspecific protective effects of influenza vaccination during pregnancy,
including decreased risk of preterm birth,3,7,9,10 beneficial effects on birth weight,1,6 or both.2,4,5 The H1N1 studies were started
either late in or after the second wave of the pandemic, and thus exposure to the H1N1 virus was minimal.11 Therefore, any
protective effect of maternal H1N1 vaccination on birth outcomes presumably would be related to a nonspecific response, independent of vaccine efficacy.
Two studies of maternal TIV exposure showed improved birth outcomes after maternal vaccination during periods of influenza virus circulation.1,2 One of these studies was a randomized trial,1 and together the studies provide evidence of vaccine
effectiveness.
Two recently reported studies do not support the theory that maternal vaccination provides a nonspecific protective effect on
birth outcomes. Using multiple strategies to control for potential confounding and bias, Pasternak et al8 found no effect of the
H1N1 vaccine on preterm or SGA birth. Similarly, in a reanalysis of the Mother’s Gift Project, (a randomized trial of influenza
vaccination of pregnant women in Bangladesh), Steinhoff et al1 found no effect of maternal influenza vaccination on preterm or
low birth weight deliveries during periods when the influenza virus was not circulating.
Using a large, geographically diverse cohort, our group is currently conducting
a systematic study of TIV safety during pregnancy,12 and an absence of acute
maternal or obstetric events after TIV vaccination in this cohort has been reported previously.13,14 The goals of the present study were to evaluate the possibility of increased or decreased risk of preterm and SGA births by trimester of
maternal TIV vaccination.

Methods
In this retrospective observational cohort study, we assessed
ORs for preterm and SGA births in propensity score–
matched and vaccine exposure time–matched TIVvaccinated and unvaccinated pregnant women in the Vaccine
Safety Datalink (VSD), as part of a larger study of TIV vaccine
safety.12 The VSD is a collaboration between the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention’s Immunization Safety Office and several integrated health care systems across the
US. The VSD evaluates vaccine safety issues using large standardized linked databases.15 This study was approved by the
Institutional Review Boards at each participating site, as well
as by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Seven VSD sites contributed data for this study: Group
Health Cooperative, HealthPartners Institute for Education
and Research, Kaiser Permanente Colorado, Kaiser Permanente Northwest, Kaiser Permanente Northern California,
Kaiser Permanente Southern California, and Marshfield
Clinic Research Foundation.
As described previously,12 pregnant women enrolled in the
participating sites were identified using an algorithm developed and validated by Hornbrook et al16 and adapted for
use in the VSD by Naleway et al.17 The algorithm uses a hierarchical approach to identify pregnancy episodes, pregnancy
outcomes (ie, live birth, stillbirth, spontaneous abortion, or
therapeutic abortion), and gestational age at pregnancy
outcome, using claims and administrative data. The gestational age at delivery was then used to assign an estimated
pregnancy start date, equivalent to the estimated last menstrual period.
Pregnancies with a lapse in insurance enrollment from
6 months before pregnancy start through the end of pregnancy were excluded from our analysis. Additional exclusion
criteria were multiple gestation pregnancy, ectopic pregnancy, gestational trophoblastic disease, therapeutic abortion, pregnancy in which the outcome could not be
determined from available data, and receipt of the live attenuated influenza virus vaccine while pregnant. Also excluded
were women who received TIV within 2 weeks of their last
menstrual period, owing to the estimated nature of the pregnancy start date, and women vaccinated in their last week of
pregnancy, to ensure that postpartum administrations were
not included. Women with no outpatient medical claims
during pregnancy were excluded as well (Figure 1; available
at www.jpeds.com).
For the larger VSD study of TIV vaccination of pregnant
women, those aged 14-49 years meeting the previously
mentioned inclusion criteria who received TIV during the
2002-03 through the 2008-09 influenza seasons were matched
1:2 with replacement to unvaccinated women using a variable
optimal matching algorithm.18 Match variables included age
at pregnancy outcome (1 year), estimated pregnancy start
date (30 days), and VSD site. From this larger sample, a
smaller sample was drawn comprising all pregnancies during
the 2004-05 through 2008-09 influenza seasons ending in a
live birth, with birth data available, a birth weight of
$500 g, and gestational age of $22 weeks. Women from
the earlier seasons were excluded because they predate Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommendations for vaccination throughout pregnancy. This sample of
pregnant women is referred to as the main cohort (Figure 1).
The exact date of receipt of TIV was identified from the
VSD vaccine files. Data sources for these files include vaccines
captured through claims and site-based vaccine registries.
Data on vaccination at nontraditional sites (eg, pharmacies)
were available when manually entered by a health care provider based on patient report. Timing of vaccination was
stratified by trimester,19 with first trimester defined as
<14 weeks gestation, second trimester as 14 to <28 weeks,
and third trimester as $28 weeks.
Outcomes
The 2 primary study outcomes were preterm birth and SGA
birth. Gestational age and pregnancy start date were obtained
from the clinical estimate of gestational age on the birth record.19 Preterm birth was defined as delivery before 37 weeks
gestation. Very and moderately preterm births were defined
as delivery at #32 and #34 weeks gestation, respectively.
Weight-for-gestational age percentiles were obtained from
Oken et al,20 who provide comprehensive reference values
for distributions of birth weights at 22-44 completed weeks
of gestation derived from broadly based nationwide data,
stratified by sex. Using these standards, we defined 2 cutoffs
for SGA birth, <10th and <5th percentiles.
Covariates
All data on relevant covariates or risk factors for preterm or
SGA birth that were available in the VSD files were gathered.
Preexisting conditions were identified from International
Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes recorded in electronic health care records at inpatient, outpatient, or emergency department visits for the
period starting 6 months before conception through the
end of the pregnancy (Table I; available at www.jpeds.
com). Preexisting conditions included hypertension,
diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and renal disease. Health
care utilization was measured by receipt of medical care
during the first trimester and the Kotelchuck Adequacy of
Prenatal Care Utilization Index.21,22 Health care utilization
measures were identified from electronic health care data.
The number of hospitalizations during the first 2 trimesters
was used as a proxy of complication during pregnancy.
Infant race/ethnicity was identified from birth data and
used as a proxy for maternal race/ethnicity. In the absence
of socioeconomic data at the individual level, we used
census tract poverty level, defined for each subject as the
percentage of families in his or her census tract with annual
income below 150% of the federal poverty level.23 When
maternal address was missing, data on poverty were
imputed using the expectation maximization algorithm.24
This algorithm was based on a regression model that
includes health care utilization covariates, demographic

1052 Nordin et al
variables, and preexisting conditions. Information on census
tract was not available for 30 000 pregnancies (20%).
Statistical Analyses
Using methods similar to those of Pasternak et al,8 women
were classified by whether TIV was available during each
trimester of pregnancy. Potential dates for exposure to TIV
varied by influenza season and thus were determined directly
from TIV vaccination dates in the VSD vaccine data files. For
each trimester, unvaccinated women who could have been
exposed to influenza vaccination served as controls. To minimize confounding by indication, the analysis used a propensity score–matched cohort. When evaluating the risk for
preterm delivery, women vaccinated after 31, 33, and 35
completed weeks of gestation for the #32-, #34-, and
<37-week prematurity evaluations, respectively (and the corresponding matched unexposed women), were deleted from
the analysis. This equalized the exposure time when women
could be vaccinated between groups. An exploratory analysis
without equalization of vaccine exposure time between
groups was conducted as well.
For each pregnancy, influenza season, and trimester of potential vaccine exposure, a propensity score was estimated as
the probability of being vaccinated given the aforementioned
covariates, using a generalized additive model. All factors
were entered as main effects, with age at delivery and calendar
week of pregnancy beginning date as smooth variables.
Model fit was evaluated by the c statistic. Individual matching
was then done by trimester and season on propensity score
with a 1:1 allocation, using the Parson algorithm.25
Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate ORs
with 95% CIs for the propensity score–matched cohort.
From the 2004-05 through 2008-09 influenza seasons, at least
1 component of TIV changed each year26; thus, ORs were
explored for preterm delivery and SGA birth by influenza season. All analyses were done using SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina).
Results
Across all sites, between June 1, 2002, and July 31, 2009, a total of 807 563 pregnancies among women aged 14-49 years
were identified from the VSD data. After applying exclusions,
the resultant main cohort comprised 150 089 pregnancies
(92 440 unvaccinated and 57 649 vaccinated). In the propensity score–matched cohort, there were 57 554 each in the
vaccinated and unvaccinated groups, with 16 240 matched
pairs in the first trimester (Table II). In the propensity
score–matched cohort, baseline covariate differences were
minimal as compared with those observed in the full
cohort (Table II). The c-statistic for the trimester influenza
season propensity models ranged from 0.661 to 0.842.
Outcomes
SGA. In the propensity score–matched cohort, TIV
vaccination was not associated with increased or
decreased risk of SGA birth. Using a cutoff of <5th
percentile, the OR for SGA after TIV vaccination in any
trimester was 1.02 (95% CI, 0.96-1.09). With a cutoff of
<10th percentile, the OR for SGA birth after TIV vaccination was 1.00 (95% CI, 0.96-1.04) (Table III). These
findings were consistent in analyses stratified by
trimester of TIV exposure (Figure 2). No increased risk
for SGA delivery (<10th percentile) by influenza season
was detected (Table IV).
Preterm. In the propensity score–matched cohort, in primary analyses, when comparing cohorts with equivalent
time to potential vaccination, TIV vaccination was not
associated with increased or decreased risk for preterm delivery at the predetermined cutoffs. In this cohort, the ORs
for delivery at #32 weeks, #34 weeks, and <37 weeks were
0.98 (95% CI, 0.86-1.12), 0.96 (95% CI, 0.88-1.04), and
0.97 (95% CI, 0.93-1.02), respectively. In the analyses stratified by trimester, no increased or decreased risk was
observed in any trimester, including the first (Figure 2).
No increased risk for preterm birth by influenza season
were detected (Table IV).
In an exploratory analysis conducted without restricting the cohorts to women with equivalent time to be
vaccinated, vaccination was associated with decreased
risk of preterm birth at <37 weeks gestation (OR, 0.93;
95% CI, 0.88-0.97). All of the decrease in risk in this analysis was associated with vaccination during the third
trimester.
Discussion
Our data show that receipt of TIV during pregnancy did not
increase the risk of preterm or SGA birth during the first, second, or third trimester. The vaccine also appears to have no
nonspecific protective effect for these outcomes. Our findings
did not vary by trimester of vaccine exposure.
The present study expands the available data on the safety
of first trimester vaccination, including birth outcomes for
more than 16 000 women who received TIV in the first
trimester. Previous data on the safety of influenza vaccine
during the first trimester for these outcomes are sparse. In
2012, Pasternak et al8 investigated the safety of an adjuvanted
H1N1 vaccine during pregnancy in Danish women using
propensity score matching. Similar to this report, the authors
found no significant differences in the rates of preterm and
SGA deliveries between vaccinated and unvaccinated women.
That Danish cohort included only 330 first trimester vaccine
exposures, however.
Along with the large sample size, a notable strength of
the present study is the availability of birth data for
capturing birth weight and gestational age. The validity of
birth data for these variables has been well demonstrated.27-29 In a recent multisite study, gestational age in
birth data was confirmed through medical record review
in 94% of cases. Similarly, a birth weight of <2500 g was
confirmed by medical record review for 99% of cases.29
Thus, although some misclassification of birth outcomes

was possible, it likely would not have biased our results to a
significant degree.
Kallen and Olausson10 suggested a nonspecific protective
effect of influenza vaccination during pregnancy and found
a decreased rate of preterm births in women vaccinated during the third trimester. In our cohort, in an exploratory analysis without equalization of exposure time, all of the apparent
protective effect on preterm birth was associated with vaccination during the third trimester; however, no efficacy was
expected, given that 70% of women vaccinated in their third
trimester were no longer pregnant when the influenza virus
circulated. The remaining third trimester vaccines averaged

only 7 days of exposure to influenza circulation. This demonstrates a common source of bias in observational studies of
pregnancy.30,31
In the present study, we used several analytical techniques to control for bias, including propensity matching,
alignment of vaccinated and unvaccinated women by their
pregnancy start date, and, in the analysis of preterm deliveries, restricting comparisons to women with equivalent
time to be vaccinated. Most previous observational studies
have not used all of these techniques.2-7,9,10 The propensity
matching allowed us to compare risks after vaccination between cohorts that, based on available data, had an equal
likelihood of being vaccinated.32 Alignment of pregnancy
start date was also important, because, independent of
vaccination status, the risks of adverse pregnancy outcomes
vary by season.30 A recent British study found that winter
delivery was associated with a 10% increased risk of prematurity.33 Because TIV vaccination is a seasonal exposure,
observational studies that do not ensure similar pregnancy
start dates in vaccinated and unvaccinated women would be
prone to bias. In addition, to avoid secular trends in coding
practices,34-36 the sample was stratified by influenza season
before the propensity matching. This also allowed evaluation of potential risks associated with annual changes in
vaccine formulation.
Several limitations of this study should be noted. First, as
with all observational studies, there was potential for residual
confounding by indication. Adjustment for known baseline
differences was achieved using propensity matching; however, it is likely that other unmeasured confounders differed between the vaccinated and unvaccinated women.37 For
example, data were not available on smoking status, prepregnancy body mass index, parity, previous obstetric history,
and marital status, and thus these variables could not be
included in the propensity score. However, Dodds et al6 reported that in their cohort, where these covariates were available, they did not confound the relationship between
maternal vaccination and birth outcomes.
Second, data on whether women received TIV were obtained from validated, standardized databases that include

electronic medical record–based registries, supplemented
with claims data,15 and women vaccinated at alternative sites
might have been misclassified in our cohort. In a recent survey, >13% of women receiving TIV while pregnant during
the 2010-2011 influenza season did so at a pharmacy, school,
or workplace.38 Data on influenza vaccination of pregnant
women at pharmacies, schools, and workplaces in previous
seasons are not available; however, rates were likely lower
in the period for this cohort.
Third, the propensity score–matched cohort was a subsample of a previously sampled cohort. With each sampling comes
the risk that the findings might not be generalizable to all pregnant women. Notably, the population included only women
with stable insurance coverage, at least 1 outpatient medical
visit during pregnancy, and available birth data; these women
represented <20% of the pregnancies originally identified.
Finally, this sample was limited to live births, and focused
on 2 specific perinatal outcomes. Other important birth outcomes were not analyzed. Inclusion of stillbirths or evaluating risks for spontaneous abortion would require
alternative analytical approaches and additional data not
available for this large cohort at the time of this study. Nonetheless, it is reassuring that a recent study from Denmark
found no association between H1N1 vaccination and stillbirths.39 Similarly, a recent case-control study from the
VSD found that TIV did not increase the risk of early pregnancy loss in the 4 weeks after vaccination.40
The present study adds to the body of scientific knowledge supporting the safety of influenza vaccination
throughout pregnancy. In our large cohort, receipt of TIV
during any trimester of pregnancy was not associated with
increased or decreased risk of preterm or SGA birth. This
study provides data on a substantial number of women
vaccinated during the first trimester. These findings should
reassure women and their health care providers regarding
the safety of seasonal influenza vaccination during pregnancy for these common outcomes. Combined with other
safety studies13,14 and with evidence of effectiveness for
these outcomes of the vaccine during periods of influenza
virus circulation,1,2 this study strongly supports the vaccination of pregnant women with influenza vaccine. Our analysis suggests no nonspecific protective effect of TIV for
these outcomes. Future studies should continue to monitor
influenza vaccine safety and risks for other important
maternal and child health outcomes. n
