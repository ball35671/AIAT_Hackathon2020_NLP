INTRODUCTION
During the earliest trials of influenza vaccines (Francis & Magill, 1935-6, 1937)
reactions to the inoculum were noticed. Hirst, Rickard & Friedewald (1944) found
that about 1 in 200 of those inoculated with 1-0 ml. of formalized vaccine developed
a fever of more than 100° F. and that moderately sore arms were common.
Norwood & Sachs (1947) noted that 77-3% of a group of industrial workers
suffered from sore arms after vaccination and 29-5 % of them became febrile.
Salk (1948) showed that reactions were associated with the virus content of the
vaccine and not with the presence of impurities. Griffin (1959) found that the
proportion of U.S. Army personnel requiring treatment after influenza vaccination fell from 11-33/1000 in 1953 to 2-83/1000 in 1955 and in view of the large
numbers of inoculations given this might have reflected an improvement in the
vaccine. In Britain, Cope (1960) inoculated over 3000 people and reported 'about
half a dozen' were absent from work as a result. Early trials using oil adjuvant
vaccines (Henle & Henle, 1945) were marred by the high incidence of local reactions yielding residual sterile abcesses, and Beebe, Simon & Vivona (1964) showed
that cysts occurred in 3 % of subjects in large-scale trials of 1951—3 although an
improved technique of inoculation was used. However, using a purified emulsifying
agent, Himmelweit (1960) found none of these reactions in his group of 160
volunteers.
Although it seemed from these recent trials that both the aqueous and oil
adjuvant vaccines were now relatively innocuous, Clarke (1962) and also Meichen,
Rogan & Howell (1962) reported that contemporary commercial aqueous influenza
vaccines were causing an undesirable number of reactions. Because of these
conflicting reports, trials were carried out to assay reactions to various types and
doses of influenza vaccines and this paper describes the results.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Trials
Two trials were carried out, the first over the winter of 1962-3 and the second
in 1963-4.
First trial
In the first trial there were two parts. In both parts the volunteers were first to
fifth-year medical students at the Queen's University of Belfast. In the first
part, which began in November 1962, all volunteers whose date of birth was an
odd number (e.g. 1st, 3rd, etc. of the month) were given aqueous vaccine, and
those with even-numbered birthdays received placebo. The second part started in
January 1963, in such a way that there were 8 weeks between inoculations. The
same group of volunteers took part, with a few changes detailed below, and now
all those with birthdays in the first half of a month were given an adjuvant vaccine,
and those born in the second half of a month received aqueous vaccine.
In each part inoculation was carried out in the morning and the volunteers were
examined on the same afternoon, and thereafter on the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 7th days,
and finally 21 days after the first inoculation and 28 days after the second. Blood
samples for antibody studies were taken at the time of inoculation and at each last
examination.
At every examination each volunteer's card was marked with the degree
(0-3) of local or general reactions found. The card bore columns for erythema,
pain, tenderness, lymphadenitis, malaise, fever, generalized aches and pains,
nausea or vomiting, diarrhoea or constipation, headache, coryza, allergic manifestations and other signs and symptoms. Neither the volunteers nor the examiners
were aware of which inoculum had been given until after the trial.
Second trial
In the second trial the volunteers were first-year medical students of the
Queen's University or nurses from the Royal Victoria and Royal Maternity
Hospitals, Belfast. All these volunteers were given a new adjuvant vaccine and
were examined 2, 7, 28 and 90 days after inoculations. The same manifestations
were sought as in the first trial, but the layout of the cards was modified and improved. Owing to the absence of a control group, the information can only be
regarded as supplementing that from the first trial. Blood samples were taken at
inoculation and at 28 and 90 days afterwards.
Vaccines
The first inoculations of the 1962-3 trial were 0-5 ml. volumes of either placebo
(phosphate-buffered saline) or aqueous vaccine (Invirin, Glaxo). These were
administered subcutaneously over the triceps. In the second part of the trial either
1-0 ml. Invirin, subcutaneously, or 0-25 ml. oil adjuvant vaccine, into the belly
of the triceps, was given. In the second trial the new, augmented, adjuvant vaccine
(Admune, Evans Medical) was inoculated into the upper part of the long head of
the triceps.

RESULTS
First trial, part 1 (November-December 1962)
Three hundred and eighty volunteers took part, but only 281 were examined on
every occasion and yielded complete records. The remainder missed one or more
sessions. Absenteeism was apparently not governed by the vaccine received
(0-3 > P > 0-2), but was associated with the inconvenience of attending for
examination. The results of those who had incomplete records were not markedly
different from those with complete records. The figures supplied refer to the
records of all volunteers.
Local reactions
The principal local reactions were erythema, pain and tenderness.
Erythema around the site was scored from 0 to 3. An area up to 15 mm. in
diameter was indicated by ' 1', more than 15 mm. by ' 2', and widespread erythema
by'3' .
Pain was assessed by asking volunteers whether their arms hurt or hindered
them and was scored '0', '£' (minimal), '1 ' (slight), '2 ' (moderate) and '3 '
(severe). Minimal pain amounted to awareness of having been inoculated.
Tenderness was elicited by the response to questioning and firm palpation of the
inoculated area. It was graded in the same way as pain.
Compared with the placebo injection of 0-5 ml. of saline, the same volume of
Invirin produced reactions significantly more often. Erythema only occurred after

the vaccine and there were more reports of tenderness from those who were given
vaccine at each examination for the first 3 days (0-05 > P > 0-025 some hours
after inoculation, P < 0-0005 on days 1-3). However, a few hours after the
inoculation 'pain', as denned above, appeared to be a function of the injection
process itself because it was only on the second examination that the vaccinated
group yielded more complaints, (0-01 > P > 0-005).

Although induration and swelling of the inoculated arm only occurred in those
who received vaccine the incidence was small, the greatest on any day being 6/175.
An attempt to use the measurement of arms as an index of reaction had to be
abandoned as swelling was so inconspicuous. Both types of inoculation caused
bruising at the site in a proportion of cases, but rather more bruises followed
vaccine. The greatest number was seen on the third day when 10-3% of the
vaccinated group and 6-0% of those with placebo had bruises.
Systemic reactions
There was no evidence that this small dose of vaccine caused systemic reactions.
In the first 3 days after the inoculation, coryza, influenzal symptoms and malaise
were more common among those given placebo (coryza in 3-8% against 1-5%).
Two cases of migraine and one of paroxysmal tachycardia during the week after
inoculation occurred in students given placebo.
No allergic manifestations occurred before 3 days after inoculation. After this,
one case of a transient maculo-papular rash and one of localized urticaria occurred
in students who had been given vaccine and a more pronounced urticaria in one of
those given placebo.

General responses
On the seventh day, each volunteer was asked whether the inoculation had interfered with work, play or social activities. Five complaints were received, three
from volunteers who had received placebo and two from those given vaccine.
First trial, part 2 (January-February 1963)
Three hundred and forty-two volunteers took part in this phase, and 267 were
examined on all occasions. Three extra volunteers who had received no vaccine
before joined the trial; 26 of the placebo group and 15 who had had vaccine left
the trial. The reactions of those who left had been no more severe than the average.

* Number of volunteers.
Local reactions
Erythema, pain and tenderness were analysed in the same way as previously.
The dose of Invirin recommended by the manufacturers is 1-0 ml. and this
contains five times as much antigen as a dose of adjuvant vaccine. However, the
presence of the oily vehicle and the intramuscular site of deposition of the adjuvant vaccine might be expected to offset the reduction in reactions caused by
the smaller amount of antigen.
The adjuvant vaccine was not associated with erythema and the full, 1-0 ml.,
dose of Invirin caused less reddening of the skin than the half-dose given previously. About half those inoculated complained of pain and the arms of twothirds or more were tender. Invirin elicited complaints of both pain and tenderness
from a greater proportion of the volunteers than adjuvant vaccine and in both
instances this excess is found in the early examinations. Invirin in general was
associated with a larger incidence of reactions and caused them more rapidly but
for rather a shorter time. By 7 days, however, there were no complaints of pain
but 10 of tenderness (3 %) from all the volunteers.

volunteers (four and two, respectively) and all occurred following Invirin. Bruising
at the inoculation site, however, occurred more frequently with the adjuvant
vaccine (eight cases) than with Invirin (four). This was possibly because of the
different mode of inoculation. One student suffered transient symptoms in the
distribution of the radial nerve after intramuscular injection of adjuvant vaccine.
No chronic swellings, induration or cystic lesions referable to the adjuvant were
found either in those who had received this vaccine a month after inoculation or
in any of the 143 of 158 volunteers of this group examined 8 months later.
Systemic reactions
It was difficult to detect any unequivocal pattern of these. There were 12 reports
of coryzal symptoms among those given Invirin, and seven after adjuvant vaccine
(0-4 > P > 0-3). In addition, one case of migraine, two of headache and two of
malaise occurring within 3 days of inoculation were all within the group given
Invirin. However, as this disparity of cases of coryza and other constitutional
symptoms was also present at 7 and 28 days after inoculation the relation of these
symptoms to the vaccines is not clear.
None of the volunteers said that the inoculation had interfered with work,
play or social activities.

In both parts of the trial, at the time of the final examination, 3 and 4 weeks
after the inoculation respectively, the volunteers were asked whether they thought
the inoculation would be worth while if it prevented influenza. In neither part of
the trial did the answers distinguish between the different inocula, but there was a
significant difference between the responses to the first and second parts of the
study (0-025 > P > 0-01).
Those volunteers who had been in both parts of the trial were asked how the
two inoculations received compared. No significant preference was revealed for
one vaccine over another (0-7 > P > 0-6) or for placebo over vaccine.

(P = 0-16), pain (0-2 > P > 0-1) and tenderness (0-2 > P > 0-1). However, in
the second trial more complaints of pain were recorded from the nurses than from
the students.
Bruising was much more marked in the second trial, and, in the main, this was
accounted for by the high incidence among the nurses. This might have been
associated with the use of larger gauge needles for inoculating this group.
Transient swelling of the inoculated arm was reported by three nurses and three
medical students.
Miscellaneous complaints included one, from a nurse, of mild regional axillary
lymphadenitis for 2 days after inoculation. At 28 days another nurse reported
some residual stiffness in the inoculated arm. On examination no objective sign
was found.
In three of the nurses and in one student, all women, subcutaneous nodules at
the site of inoculation were detected at the examination at 28 days. These nodules
were fairly well denned and slightly tender on pressure. They were separate from
the skin and underlying muscle and first appeared about 2 weeks after inoculation.
On follow-up, one had disappeared 2 months after inoculation. In the other three,
the nodules regressed slowly, and by 6 months were barely detectable.
Systemic reactions
No allergic manifestations were reported or seen. Inoculation was followed by a
feeling of faintness in one case, and a nurse reported that a ' cold' started on the
evening of the inoculation. Two volunteers complained of attacks of nausea and
vomiting starting 24-36 h. after the inoculation. In one case, these symptoms
also occurred in unvaccinated home contacts.
General responses
Of 96 volunteers questioned on the 7th day, nine said that the inoculation had
troubled or hindered them. Eight of these were nurses. All graded the nuisance as
'slight'. Although none of the volunteers felt that the inoculation had curtailed
work, play or social activities, two of the male students said they would not be
inoculated again—because they never got influenza!
DISCUSSION
The evidence above shows that standard doses of aqueous and adjuvanted
influenza vaccine caused a substantial number of local reactions. If those persons
who had only minimal pain and tenderness are discounted, 1-0 ml. of Invirin
caused about the same incidence of local reactions as recorded by Clarke (1962).
The adjuvant vaccine, in comparison, caused rather fewer reactions; a finding
which agrees with Howell & Mackenzie (1964).
On the other hand, although Clarke (1962) found 30 % had general malaise and
6 % allergic reactions and Howell & Mackenzie (1964) reported that influenza-like
symptoms soon after injection and malaise persisting for a fortnight occurred
in 9-8 and 22-4 % of those given adjuvant and 8-5 and 22-4 % of those given

aqueous vaccine respectively, in our experience systemic reactions were not a
problem.
The authors of many reports have found it difficult to assess the acceptability
of vaccines, particularly against less dreaded diseases, in objective terms. In the
current trials the incidence of pain and tenderness revealed objectively did not
correspond with the paucity of those who said the inoculations curtailed activities.
However, the fact that nurses, doing more manual work, were more affected than
students and the increased proportion of students denying the ' worthwhile '-ness
of vaccine after a second inoculation tend to reinforce doubts (Howell & Stott,
1964, Richardson & Kilpatrick, 1964) whether an average population would
support a programme of annual re-inoculation.
In addition, as children are particularly prone to reactions (Davenport &
Hennessy, 1960), much less irritant vaccines would be needed to attempt the
logical step of controlling influenza epidemics by vaccinating schoolchildren.
The purified haemagglutinin vaccine described by Davenport et al. (1964) could
well provide a more acceptable product.
The oil adjuvant vaccine presented a problem of its own. The occurrence of
persistent nodules in some of our volunteers and an incidence of cysts of 3-3/
10,000 in the Medical Research Council (1964) trial contrast with the earlier, more
optimistic, reports (Himmelweit, 1960; Meiklejohn, 1962). For vaccination that is
liable to be repeated and particularly for a disease of the nature of influenza such
local reactions are not acceptable (Tyrrell, 1966). Also, with so small a dose of
antigen much of the pain and tenderness associated with the inoculation was
probably due to the adjuvant components themselves. McCarthy (1964), using
hexadecane and octadecane, has demonstrated the ability of mammals to metabolize preparations of straight-chain hydrocarbons given orally. However, from the
observed persistence of oil at the site of adjuvant inoculations this breakdown
must occur slowly in the tissues and possibly the equivalent fatty acids that are
formed during metabolism may themselves be irritant just as the greater toxicity
of early batches of adjuvant was due to excess free oleic acid in the emulsifying
agent.
Several approaches to solve this difficulty have been made. Wilner et al. (1963),
in limited experiments, found that a pure branched-chain hydrocarbon oil produced a better adjuvant effect than the usual Drakeol 6VR with less toxicity.
Workers at the Merck Institute (Woodhour et al. 1964; Peck et al. 1964) have
reported on the efficacy of a metabolizable adjuvant comprising peanut oil,
aluminium monostearate and Arlacel A and found in animal experiments that the
reactions produced were quantitatively less than with mineral oil. Herbert (1965)
described a 'multiple emulsion' in which the adjuvant emulsion was dispersed in
fine droplets in an aqueous phase and thus might be less able to cause cysts. It is
likely that one, or a combination of these developments, may lead to more acceptable adjuvant vaccines.
While the vaccines used in the trials did not cause many systemic reactions they
are clearly not entirely satisfactory but there is evidence that better products may
be forthcoming.

SUMMARY
Trials of aqueous and oil adjuvant vaccines in young adult volunteers showed
that severe local reactions were rare. However, the incidence of minor symptoms
was too high for a vaccine which requires to be administered repeatedly. In
contradistinction to some reports, systemic and allergic reactions did not constitute
a problem.
I should like to thank my colleagues at the Department of Microbiology for their
assistance in inoculating, bleeding and checking reactions in the volunteers. Without the co-operation of the volunteers this study would not have been possible. I
also wish to thank Prof. G. W. A. Dick for his encouragement and advice, and
Mr T. D. Merrett, who kindly gave advice on the statistical analysis of the results.
The vaccines and placebo were supplied by Glaxo Laboratories Ltd., and financial
assistance for the study came from the Northern Ireland Hospitals Authority
and the National Fund for Research into Poliomyelitis and other Crippling
Diseases.
