n the United States, influenza vaccination is universally recommended
for all children 6 months-18 years of age
due to the large burden of influenza hospitalizations and outpatient visits in this
age group.1 Infants 6 months of age
have the highest rates of pediatric influenza hospitalizations,2-6 but none of the
influenza vaccines are licensed for this
age group.7-9 Hence, influenza vaccine is
recommended for all close contacts of
infants to reduce the likelihood of transmission.10 It is also recommended for
pregnant women since they have an increased risk of influenza-related complications and hospitalizations, with the
highest risk during the third trimester.11-16 National data indicate that the
proportion of pregnant women who received influenza vaccine has increased
from a low of 9% in 2002 through 2003 to
a high of 51%in 2009 through 2010 during
the H1N1 influenza pandemic.1,17,18
Influenza vaccination during pregnancy is primarily recommended to protect pregnant women themselves. However, a recent randomized controlled
trial from Bangladesh and an observational study among Native American
populations reported benefits of influenza vaccine both for mothers and their
young infants.19,20 Influenza antibodies
are efficiently transferred across the plaWe sought to determine whether maternal vaccination during pregnancy was associated
with a reduced risk of laboratory-confirmed influenza hospitalizations in infants 6
months old. Active population-based, laboratory-confirmed influenza surveillance was
conducted in children hospitalized with fever and/or respiratory symptoms in 3 US counties
from November through April during the 2002 through 2009 influenza seasons. The
exposure, influenza vaccination during pregnancy, and the outcome, positive/negative
influenza testing among their hospitalized infants, were compared using logistic regression
analyses. Among 1510 hospitalized infants 6 months old, 151 (10%) had laboratoryconfirmed influenza and 294 (19%) mothers reported receiving influenza vaccine during
pregnancy. Eighteen (12%) mothers of influenza-positive infants and 276 (20%) mothers
of influenza-negative infants were vaccinated (unadjusted odds ratio, 0.53; 95% confidence interval, 0.32– 0.88 and adjusted odds ratio, 0.52; 95% confidence interval, 0.30 –
0.91). Infants of vaccinated mothers were 45-48% less likely to have influenza hospitalizations than infants of unvaccinated mothers. Our results support the current influenza
vaccination recommendation for pregnant women.

centa and have been observed to provide
indirect protection to infants for the first
2-3 months of life, when infants are too
young to receive influenza vaccine.20,21
We sought to determine whether maternal vaccination during pregnancy was
associated with a reduced risk of laboratory-confirmed influenza hospitalizations in infants 6 months of age living
in 3 geographically diverse US counties
over 7 consecutive influenza seasons. We
focused on influenza hospitalizations
because they are associated with the
highest costs and because most childhood deaths occur among hospitalized
patients.22,23
Materials and methods
The New Vaccine Surveillance Network,
funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, conducted active,
population-based, laboratory-confirmed
influenza surveillance among children
hospitalized with influenza in 3 US
counties: Davidson County, Tennessee
(Nashville); Hamilton County, Ohio
(Cincinnati); and Monroe County, New
York (Rochester).2 Children were eligible for enrollment if they were hospitalized with fever and/or acute respiratory
symptoms during the winter from November through April and resided
within these 3 counties. Seven consecutive influenza seasons were included:
2002-2003 through 2008-2009 in Nashville, TN, and Rochester, NY, and 2003-
2004 through 2008-2009 in Cincinnati,
OH. In 2008 through 2009, the seasonal
influenza season ended in April 2009,
which was prior to the detection of
H1N1 in this network.
All enrolled children had nasal and
throat swabs obtained for viral culture
and/or reverse transcription polymerase
chain reaction for influenza A or B as
previously described.24 Parents of enrolled children had a standardized questionnaire administered to ascertain presenting symptoms and their duration,
birth and medical history, history of maternal influenza vaccination during
pregnancy with the enrolled child, and
social history. The medical record was
reviewed after discharge.
The study population comprised inpatients 6 months of age enrolled
through hospital surveillance with fever
and/or acute respiratory symptoms during 1 of the 7 consecutive influenza seasons. Most infants were enrolled as inpatients although some were enrolled as
outpatients and subsequently hospitalized. For infants with multiple hospitalizations during an influenza season, only
the first hospitalization during the study
period was included. Each influenza season was defined as the period spanning
the first to last influenza-positive nasal/
throat swab among all study infants.
Since the opportunity for the mother to
receive the influenza vaccine varied by
birth month, we divided each influenza
season into early, middle, and late season
tertiles, based on the day of enrollment
of influenza-positive infants. A control
group of hospitalized infants without
laboratory-confirmed influenza were assigned to early, middle, and late tertiles
by comparing their dates of enrollment
with the influenza-positive cases.
The primary exposure variable was
maternal influenza vaccination status
during pregnancy, and the primary outcome variable was the presence or absence of laboratory-confirmed influenza
among their hospitalized infants. Categorical variables that can influence hospitalizations in general and thus could
potentially influence influenza-related
hospitalizations in infants were compared by 2 analysis. For adjusted analyses, we created 3 multivariate logistic
regression model analyses a priori based
on demographic, medical, and social risk
factors previously shown to be associated
with increased risk of influenza or respiratory hospitalizations.2,3,5,25-29 The
core demographic model included the
following covariates: age, sex, race/ethnicity, site, study year, and tertile of the
influenza season. The second model
evaluated the core demographic model
and 2 medical covariates: prematurity
and presence of any high-risk medical
conditions in the infant for which influenza vaccine was recommended in persons 6 months of age.16 The third
model included the core demographic
model and 5 additional variables: smoke
exposure at home, number of siblings (0 to
3), day care attendance, insurance status
(public/private/none), andwhether theinfant was ever breast-fed. All model covariates were treated as categorical variables.
Confidence intervals (CI) were calculated
at the 95% level; P values  .05 were considered statistically significant. All analyses
were computed using STATA software
10.0 (StataCorp, College Station, TX).
From 2005-2006 through 2008-2009,
we asked mothers of young infants if
they had an influenza-like illness during
pregnancy because an influenza illness
during pregnancy could lead to the development of protective antibodies for
that influenza serotype in the infant.
Hence, we performed a subanalysis of
the unadjusted and the 3 adjusted models described above to determine the
protective effect of either maternal vaccination for all years or influenza-like illness during pregnancy from the last 4
years of the study period.
Human and nonhuman
experimentation
The study was approved with informed
consent from the parent or guardian by
the institutional review boards at each
site and the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention.
Results
Over 7 influenza seasons, 2122 hospitalized infants were eligible for enrollment
in the 3 New Vaccine Surveillance Network sites and 1423 (67%) of the eligible
infants were included from the inpatient
setting (Figure 1). Reasons for exclusion
were 307 (44%) protocol deviations at
Cincinnati, OH, 132 (19%) parental refusal, 130 (19%) parents missed or not
available, 89 (13%) lack of language
translator, 38 (5%) discharged prior to
being approached, and 3 (1%) physician refusal. Of these 1423 hospitalized
and enrolled infants, 57 (4%) had unknown or missing maternal influenza
vaccination status, 3 (0.2%) had indeterminate influenza status (ie, negative
RNA control), 3 (0.2%) had unknown
race/ethnicity, and 23 (2%) represented
a second study hospitalization during
the influenza season and were excluded
from analysis. The overall study population comprised these 1337 eligible infants enrolled solely from the inpatient
setting and an additional 173 eligible inSupplement www.AJOG.org

fants who were hospitalized following
enrollment in the emergency department and fulfilled all inpatient enrollment criteria. Among these 1510 infants
hospitalized with fever and/or respiratory symptoms during the influenza season (Table 1), 151 (10%) had laboratoryconfirmed influenza–with 136 (90%)
influenza A and 15 (10%) influenza B.
Among all hospitalized infants, a higher
proportion of infants 2 months than
those 2 to 6 months of age were influenza positive. The proportion of infants
who were influenza positive varied significantly across study years, ranging
from 3% in 2006 through 2007 to 15% in
2003 through 2004.
A total of 294 (19%) mothers reported
that they had received the influenza vaccine during that pregnancy (Table 2).
This proportion varied by influenza season, ranging from 10% in 2003 through
2004 to 38% in 2008 through 2009, and
by age of the infant at the time of enrollment during the influenza season, ranging from 24% for neonates 1 month of
age to 9% for infants 4-5 months of age.
The proportion of infants whose mothers were vaccinated varied from only
13-15% at the Cincinnati, OH, and
Nashville, TN, sites up to 33% at the
Rochester, NY, site. The proportion of
infants whose mothers were vaccinated
was 15% for blacks, 21% for whites, and
22% for Hispanics. Infants with private
insurance were more likely to have a vaccinated mother than those with public or
no insurance. Breast-fed infants were
more likely to have mothers who reported being vaccinated than infants of
mothers who never breast-fed. Nonsmoking households had a higher proportion of infants whose mothers were
vaccinated than households with a
smoker.
Among influenza-positive infants during all study years, 12% of their mothers
reported influenza vaccination during
pregnancy, while among influenza-negative infants, 20% of their mothers reported
influenza vaccination, yielding an unadjusted odds ratio (OR) of 0.53 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.32–0.88). Similar results were obtained in the 3 multivariate
models shown in Figure 2. Since a significant proportion of data from Cincinnati,
OH, was excluded for protocol violations,
a sensitivity analysis that included only
Rochester, NY, and Nashville, TN, data
was performed and yielded similar results
to the combined data. In the core demographic model, adjusting for age, sex, race/
ethnicity, site, study year, and early, middle, or late influenza season, the OR for
having an influenza-positive, hospitalized
infant among vaccinated mothers was 0.55
(95%CI,0.32–0.95).Model2included the
core demographic model plus prematurity
and high-risk conditions and had an OR of
0.55 (95% CI, 0.32–0.94). These medical
covariates did not impact the estimate and
were not included in the third model.
Model 3 included the core demographic
model, exposure to smoke, siblings, day
care, insurance, and presence of breastfeeding and had an OR of 0.52 (95% CI,
0.30 –0.91). As shown, adjustmentsfor covariates did not affect the results substantially. Overall, results of the multivariate
modeling suggest that maternal vaccination reduced the risk of influenza by
45-48%.
A total of 110 mothers from 2005-2006
through 2008-2009 reported a history of
influenza-like illness during pregnancy, of
which 81 (74%) had not received theinfluenza vaccine during that pregnancy. In a
subanalysis combining both maternal influenza vaccinationfor all7 years and a history of an influenza-like illness during
pregnancy for 4 years, we found that the
unadjusted and adjusted estimates were
similar with a 45-49% reduced risk of influenza in the infant.
Comment
Our results indicate that hospitalized infants whose mothers received influenza
vaccine during pregnancy were 45-48%
less likely to have laboratory-confirmed
influenza during their first influenza
season compared with infants of unvaccinated mothers. Adding history of influenza-like illness during pregnancy to
the analyses had little impact on the OR
for having an influenza-positive, hospitalized infant. Given that infants 6
months of age have the highest hospitalization rate among all children2-6 and
that the vaccine is not licensed for that
age group,16 these data support that infants born to vaccinated mothers benefit
from the transfer of maternally derived
antibodies.
Four previously published studies
support our conclusions. First, a prospective, observational study among Native Americans from 2002 through 2005
found that infants of vaccinated mothers
had a 41% reduction of the risk of laboratory-confirmed influenza infection in
the inpatient and outpatient settings as

determined by viral culture or antibody
titers (relative risk, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.37–
0.93).20 A second study, a randomized
controlled trial of maternal influenza
vaccination during pregnancy, was conducted in Bangladesh in 2004 through
2005. In this tropical country with yearround influenza circulation, investigators reported fewer rapid test– confirmed influenza cases among infants of
mothers who received influenza vaccine
compared with infants of unvaccinated
mothers (6 vs 16 infants, respectively)
for a vaccine effectiveness estimate of
63% (95% CI, 5– 85%). Among 110 infants in the influenza vaccine group and
153 infants in the control group, vaccine
effectiveness against unspecified respiratory illness with fever was 29% (95% CI,
7– 46%).19 Third, a matched case-control study compared hospitalized infants
with physician-ordered direct fluorescent antibody for seasonal influenza
from 2000 through 2009. Cases with a
positive influenza test result and controls
with a negative test result were matched
by date of birth and date of hospitalization. Maternal vaccinations were included only if they were confirmed and
given at least 14 days prior to delivery.
Effectiveness of maternal vaccination
among infants 6 months of age was reported to be 91.5% (95% CI, 62–98%).30
Fourth, a Northern California Kaiser
Permanente database study over 5
influenza seasons (1997 through 2002),
found that maternal vaccination was associated with a decreased risk of pneumonia or influenza hospitalization in
their infants with an adjusted hazard ratio of 0.63 (95% CI, 0.30 –1.29), translating into 37% protection.31 Our 95% CIs
for protection of maternal vaccination
from influenza hospitalizations among
infants 6 months of age overlap those
from each of these studies.
Our study differs from the previously
published studies in several ways. First,
we included 7 consecutive influenza seasons and used prospective, populationbased and laboratory-confirmed surveillance to identify eligible infants. By
systematically testing all eligible infants
using culture and molecular methods to
define influenza infections, we utilized
sensitive and specific methods and

avoided the biases associated with physician-ordered testing; the study utilizing
physician-ordered testing to identify eligible infants had a much higher proportion of infants with high-risk conditions
than our study population. Second, we
focused on hospitalizations whereas 2
previous studies included more outpatient visits than hospitalizations. Third,
we included 3 diverse geographic regions
of the United States whereas all previous
studies reported data from 1 geographic
region.
Our study has several limitations. Although we enrolled a large proportion of
eligible infants, a number of them had to
be excluded because of protocol violations, and infants who were and were not
included in the study population could
have systematically differed. Neither
confirmed influenza vaccination status
nor documented influenza disease status
was available from mothers, and serologic assays were not performed on either infants or mothers. Since the study
focused on hospitalized infants and not
those seen only in the outpatient clinic or
emergency departments, the generalizability of these results to outpatient settings is unknown. However, admission
criteria for infants with fever and respiratory symptoms change over the first
few weeks of life, so limiting the study
population to solely inpatients allowed
us to focus on severe outcomes.
Our estimates of maternal vaccination
are consistent with national estimates17
and lower than estimates from one
health care system that implemented interventions to increase their maternal
vaccination rates.32 We have previously
reported higher influenza vaccine coverage among children 6-59 months of
age in Rochester, NY, than in Nashville,
TN, or Cincinnati, OH.33 Because of
this consistent pattern, these differences
seem to reflect geographical differences
in influenza vaccination patterns. We
found higher rates of maternal vaccination when the infant had private insurance compared with public or no insurance. This differs from the seasonal
influenza vaccine coverage reported by
the Rhode Island Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System, which found
similar coverage between women with

public and private insurance. Given that
obstetrician-gynecologists have consistently identified financial costs as a major
barrier to influenza vaccination of pregnant women,34-36 it is possible that differences in vaccine coverage between public
and private insurance vary geographically.
Maternal vaccination during pregnancy
is recommended since pregnant women
have an increased risk of influenza-associated morbidity and mortality.11-15 However, despite this recommendation, pregnant women have traditionally had the
lowest influenza vaccine coverage of any
group for whom influenza vaccine is specifically recommended.17 Although most
(84.5%) obstetricians support influenza
vaccination of all pregnant women,34 few
mothers (20%) report being offered influenza vaccination during pregnancy.37 Obstetricians play a critical role in the influenza vaccination coverage of pregnant
women. For first pregnancies, obstetricians are often the only medical professional seeing the pregnantwomen;for subsequent pregnancies, pregnant women
may see the pediatrician, however, pediatricians do not tend to vaccinate pregnant
women since they are not their patients.
Half of all pregnant women who received
the monovalent H1N1 vaccine in 2009
through 2010 reported receiving it in the
obstetrician-gynecologist office and none
reported receiving it in a pediatric office.18
Because numerous studies have demonstrated comparable or increased influenza antibody titers in the cord blood
when compared with maternal levels,3,38-43 maternal vaccination should
afford some protection of newborn infants against influenza and is supported
by our study. Similar to other studies, we
found between 45% and 48% protection
against laboratory-confirmed influenza
hospitalizations among infants whose
mothers reported receiving influenza vaccine during pregnancy. Using data from
our earlier studies of 4.5 influenza-attributable hospitalizations among 1000 infants6months of age2
and census data of
4,251,095live-birthsin theUnitedStatesin
2008,44we project that there are an average
of 19,130 influenza-attributable hospitalizations among infants 6 months of age
per year. A 45-48% reduction in this burden would yield an estimated 8600-9200

fewer influenza-attributable hospitalizations among young infants each year.
Thus, our findings suggest that influenza
vaccination of pregnant women may reduce the risk ofinfluenza-attributable hospitalization among infants in the first 5
months of life, further supporting the current influenza vaccination recommendations for pregnant women. f
