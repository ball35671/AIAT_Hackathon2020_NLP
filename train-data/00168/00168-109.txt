Objective: To assess the effect of seasonal influenza vaccination during pregnancy on laboratory-confirmed influenza in infants to 6 months of age.
Design: Nonrandomized, prospective, observational
cohort study.
Setting: Navajo and White Mountain Apache Indian reservations, including 6 hospitals on the Navajo reservation and 1 on the White Mountain Apache reservation.
Participants: A total of 1169 mother-infant pairs with
mothers who delivered an infant during 1 of 3 influenza
seasons.
Main Exposure: Maternal seasonal influenza vaccination.
Main Outcome Measures: In infants, laboratoryconfirmed influenza, influenzalike illness (ILI), ILI hospitalization, and influenza hemagglutinin inhibition
antibody titers.
Results: A total of 1160 mother-infant pairs had serum
collected and were included in the analysis. Among infants, 193 (17%) had an ILI hospitalization, 412 (36%)
had only an ILI outpatient visit, and 555 (48%) had no
ILI episodes. The ILI incidence rate was 7.2 and 6.7 per
1000 person-days for infants born to unvaccinated and
vaccinated women, respectively. There was a 41% reduction in the risk of laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infection (relative risk, 0.59; 95% confidence interval,0.37-0.93) and a 39% reduction in the risk of ILI
hospitalization (relative risk, 0.61; 95% confidence
interval,0.45-0.84) for infants born to influenzavaccinated women compared with infants born to
unvaccinated mothers. Infants born to influenzavaccinated women had significantly higher hemagglutinin inhibition antibody titers at birth and at 2 to 3 months
of age than infants of unvaccinated mothers for all 8 influenza virus strains investigated.
Conclusions: Maternal influenza vaccination was significantly associated with reduced risk of influenza virus infection and hospitalization for an ILI up to 6 months
of age and increased influenza antibody titers in infants
through 2 to 3 months of age.

NFLUENZA VIRUS ACTIVITY AND DISease severity varies from season
to season; however, studies have
consistently identified young
children to be at high risk of influenza complications. Among healthy
children younger than 5 years, annual influenza-associated hospitalization rates are
approximately 100 per 100 000, while children with underlying medical conditions
have ratesof approximately500 per
100 000 in the United States.1-4
Influenza virus infection in infants is
generally more frequent among those aged
6 to 12 months than in the first 6 months
of life, potentially owing to the protection conferred by maternal influenza antibodies acquired transplacentally or
through breastfeeding.5 However, during
severe influenza seasons, morbidity and
mortality rates among infants younger than
6 months have been reported to exceed
those of older infants.6-11
The US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends that
pregnant women receive influenza vaccine because of the increased risk of influenza complications in pregnant women.4 Maternal influenza vaccination may
also confer a benefit to infants born during influenza season, as they are ineligible for vaccination until 6 months of age.
Several studies have investigated the
ability of maternally derived influenzaspecific antibodies to protect infants from
influenza virus infection and/or to reduce
severity of illness.12-14 Findings among infants attributable to maternal influenza vaccination have included delayed onset of inFor editorial comment

fection, older age when infected, and 1 randomized trial
showing a reduction in laboratory-confirmed influenza.
Navajo and White Mountain Apache children have
rates of acute respiratory infection that are significantly
higher than in the general US population.15-17 Because influenza vaccination of all pregnant women is recommended, a randomized clinical trial was not possible in
the United States. Therefore, we conducted a nonrandomized, prospective, observational cohort study to evaluate the effect of seasonal influenza vaccination during pregnancy on influenza virus infection in infants compared
with that of infants born to unvaccinated women.
METHODS
SETTING
The study was conducted on the Navajo and White Mountain
Apache Indian reservations in the Southwest region of the United
States. Health care is administered through the Indian Health
Service, an agency of the federal government, or through the
tribe; services are provided without fees to registered tribal members. Six Navajo hospitals (Chinle, Gallup, Fort Defiance,
Shiprock, Tuba City, and Winslow) and 1 (Whiteriver) on the
White Mountain Apache reservation participated in this study.
DESIGN
The study was conducted during 3 influenza seasons from November2002toSeptember2005.Theenrollmentperiodsforeach
yearwereDecember1,2002,toMarch15,2003;November1,2003,
to March 8, 2004; and November 1, 2004, to March 15, 2005. Inclusion was restricted to mothers who delivered a healthy infant
at 36 weeks’ or later gestation during the enrollment periods. Eligible infants were aged 2 weeks or younger at enrollment.
RECRUITMENT
Mother-infant pairs were recruited after delivery at Indian Health
Service hospitals on the Navajo or White Mountain Apache reservation either at the hospital or by home visit. Written informed consent was obtained from all mothers. For all subjects, the study began following delivery. The decision for
influenza vaccination was made by the treating clinician and
the pregnant woman; study personnel had no involvement in
these decisions. We provided annual training/education to medical providers and the community regarding influenza vaccine
recommendations and the purpose of the study. Prior to the
study, less than 10% of eligible pregnant women received influenza vaccine. Donations of thimerosal-reduced inactivated
influenza vaccine were made annually to the Indian Health Service hospitals to assure adequate supply for pregnant women.
DATA COLLECTION
Questionnaires were administered verbally at study enrollment and the end of the influenza season to collect information on demographics, breastfeeding status, potential influenza risk factors, and influenza vaccination status of all
household members. The mother’s medical record was reviewed for the period from first prenatal care visit to delivery
for information on prenatal visits, illnesses, birth information,
and the administration and timing of an influenza vaccine.
Surveillance for all medically attended illnesses in enrolled infants was conducted at Indian Health Service and nearby private
facilities during the influenza season, defined as November through
April, for each year of the study or until the child reached 6 months
of age (whichever came first). The primary outcome of interest
was medically attended influenzalike illness (ILI). This outcome
was defined as a medical visit with at least 1 of the following signs
or symptoms reported: fever of 38.0
C or higher, diarrhea, or respiratory symptoms (including cough, runny nose, or difficulty
breathing). Diarrhea was included in this definition because young
infants can experience diarrhea with influenza virus infection.18,19 Daily active surveillance for ILI episodes included review of the clinic, emergency department, and inpatient pediatric ward logs. Parents were asked to contact research staff whenever
their child had a medical visit for a respiratory, diarrheal, or febrile illness. Medical record reviews were conducted to identify
missedepisodes.WhenanILIwasdocumentedintheinfant’schart,
information was collected on demographics, clinical symptoms,
laboratory data including rapid influenza diagnostic testing and
respiratory syncytial virus antigen testing, severity of illness, and
diagnosis. A nasopharyngeal aspirate specimen for viral culture
was obtained from infants with ILI within 72 hours of the medical visit.
Postpartum blood was obtained from the mother at or within
14 days of delivery. Umbilical cord blood was collected at delivery or, if unavailable, an infant blood specimen was collected within 14 days of delivery. Venous blood was obtained
from the infant at 2 to 3 months and 6 months of age.
LABORATORY TESTING
Blood specimens were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes. The collected serum was divided into 2 aliquots of at least
0.5 mL each, frozen at −70°C, and shipped on dry ice to the
Influenza Division, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, for serological testing. Serum specimens were tested for
influenza virus strain–specific antibodies using a standard hemagglutinin inhibition (HI) antibody assay. Specimens were
tested for antibodies to influenza A and B vaccine strains and
predominant circulating strains (if antigenically distinct from
vaccine strains) for the corresponding season of interest: for
the 2002-2003 season, A/New Caledonia/20/99 IVR-116 (H1N1)
(A/New Cal; vaccine strain), A/Panama/2007/99 respiratory syncytial virus 17 (H3N2) (A/Panama; vaccine strain), A/Wyoming/
3/2003 X-147 (H3N2) (A/Wyoming; predominant strain),
B/Hong Kong/330/2001 (B/HK, vaccine strain from B/Victoria/
2/87 lineage), and B/Sichuan/379/99 (B/Sichuan, circulating virus from B/Yamagata/16/88 lineage) were used; for the 2003-
2004 season, the same as the 2002-2003 season were used except
B/Brisbane/32/02 (B/Brisbane) instead of B/HK (B/Brisbane was
dominant B/Victoria/2/87 lineage virus during the season); and
for the 2004-2005 season, A/New Cal (H1N1 vaccine strain),
A/Wisconsin/67/2005 (H3N2) (A/Wisconsin; predominant virus), B/Shanghai/361/02 (B/Shanghai, vaccine strain from
B/Yamagata/16/88 lineage), and B/HK.
Nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens were mixed with viral
transport media (Remel, Lenexa, Kansas), transported on wet
ice, frozen and stored at –70°C, and shipped on dry ice to the
University of Iowa for viral culture. Nasopharyngeal aspirate
specimens were inoculated into Madin-Darby canine kidney cell
culture, and viruses were detected by cytopathic effect and hemadsorption. Influenza virus infection was confirmed by indirect fluorescent antibody staining of infected cells.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Maternal influenza vaccination status was based on medical record review or, if missing, by maternal report at enrollment. Hemagglutinin inhibition antibody titers of 1:40 or higher were

considered evidence of immunity. Serum specimens with undetectable HI antibody titers were assigned a titer of 5.
The primary analytical outcome, laboratory-confirmed influenza, was defined as the first episode of ILI with (1) isolation of influenza virus from the nasopharyngeal aspirate specimen, (2) a 4-fold or greater rise in HI antibody in serum collected
at 2 to 3 or 6 months compared with the previous serum specimen, indicating influenza virus infection during the time interval, or (3) a positive rapid influenza diagnostic test result
with a medical diagnosis of influenza. The secondary analytic
outcome of interest was ILI. Logistic regression was used to investigate the relationship between maternal influenza vaccination status, cord blood influenza HI antibody titers, and the occurrence of ILI or laboratory-confirmed influenza. In addition,
ILI was further stratified by hospitalization status. Potential confounders such as daycare attendance, household smoking, wood
or coal burning stove in the home, and breastfeeding were investigated. Relative risks with 95% confidence intervals not including 1.0 were considered significant.
To describe and compare influenza-specific antibodies, HI
antibody titers were converted to a logarithmic scale. Geometric mean titers (GMTs) of influenza virus–specific antibody in
postpartum, cord, 2 to 3–month, and 6-month serum specimens were calculated for influenza-vaccinated and unvaccinated mother-infant pairs. Comparisons between these 2 groups
used a 2-sided t test. For each virus strain, the proportion of
infants in each group with cord blood HI antibody titers of 1:40
or greater were calculated and compared using the Fisher exact test. Cord blood GMTs and the proportion of infants with
cord blood HI antibody titers of 1:40 or greater were compared between mothers vaccinated in the second and third trimester using Wilcoxon rank sum and 2 tests, respectively.
Stata 8.1 (Stata Corp, College Station, Texas) software was
used for the statistical analyses. The study was approved by the
Navajo and White Mountain Apache tribes and the institutional review boards of the Navajo Nation, Phoenix Area Indian Health Service, and the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School
of Public Health.
RESULTS
POPULATION AND OUTCOMES
Overall, 1169 mother-infant pairs were enrolled in the
study for the 2002-2003 (n=241), 2003-2004 (n=574),
and 2004-2005 (n=354) influenza seasons. Of these, 1160
(99%) mother-infant pairs had at least 1 blood specimen collected and were included in the analysis. Fortynine percent of infants (n=573) were born to mothers
who received influenza vaccine during their pregnancy.
Infants born to influenza-vaccinated and unvaccinated
mothers were similar except that those born to vaccinated mothers were more likely to have a wood or coal
burning stove in the house and to be breastfed (Table 1).
Of the 1160 infants, there were 908 ILI episodes; 193
children (17%) were hospitalized for ILI (84 had at least

1 outpatient ILI episode in addition to their ILI that required hospitalization), 412 (36%) had only outpatient
ILI, and 555 (48%) had no medically attended ILI episodes. The ILI incidence rate was 7.2 per 1000 persondays and 6.7 per 1000 person-days for infants born to
unvaccinated and vaccinated women, respectively (our
article on epidemiology is in preparation).
MATERNAL INFLUENZA VACCINATION
AND PROTECTION FROM INFECTION
Fifty-two percent (n=605) of infants had an ILI, of which
14% (83) were laboratory-confirmed influenza. Ten of
the laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infections were
confirmed by virus culture, 71 by serology, and 2 by positive rapid influenza diagnostic testing. The mean infant
age at first ILI was 47 days (median,41; range, 0-175)
and did not differ between infants born to vaccinated and
unvaccinated mothers.
We found a 41% reduction in the risk of laboratoryconfirmed influenza virus infection (relative risk
[RR],0.59; 95% confidence interval,0.37-0.93) for infants of influenza-vaccinated mothers compared with infants of unvaccinated mothers (Table 2). A significant
reduction in influenza virus infection risk was also observed with increasing cord blood HI antibody titers (log
scale) (RR range, 0.42-0.68) and among children with
HI antibody titers of 1:40 or greater compared with those
with titers of less than 1:40 (RR range, 0.14-0.54) for all
8 virus strain antigens (Table 2). When the analysis was
restricted to serologically confirmed influenza virus infection, there was a significant association between increasing cord blood titers and decreasing risk of influenza virus infection (Table 3). This finding was observed
for all 8 virus strains, although only statistically significant for A/NewCal (H1N1), A/Panama (H3N2), A/Wyoming (H3N2), B/Sichuan, and B/Brisbane.
No statistically significant associations were found between maternal influenza vaccination status or influenza
strain–specific cord blood HI antibody titers and ILI occurrence(Table2).However,whentheoutcomewasrestricted

reduction in the risk of the ILI resulting in hospitalization

We found no statistically significant associations between smoking in the household, daycare attendance of
household children, a wood- or coal-burning stove, or infant breastfeeding and the occurrence of any of the outcomes (data not shown). Therefore, we did not adjust the
univariate regression models by these factors as originally
planned.

www.archpediatrics.com). The actual percentages and differences varied by influenza virus strain. For A/Wisconsin, only 3% and 7% of the postpartum and cord blood
HI antibody titers, respectively, were 1:40 or greater compared with 12% and 19% for the vaccinated group. For
A/Panama, the percentage of unvaccinated subjects with
postpartum and cord blood HI antibody titers of 1:40 or
greater were 37% and 41%, respectively, compared with
78% and 79% for the vaccinated group. This was also true
for infants’ 2- to 3-month sera, with the exception of B/HK
(unvaccinated group ranged from 2% [A/Wisconsin] to
17% [A/Panama]; vaccinated group, 4% [A/HK] to 32%
[A/Panama]). At 6 months, no significant differences were
found in the percentage of infants with HI antibody titers of 1:40 or greater for any of the 8 influenza virus
strains between infants born to influenza-vaccinated and
unvaccinated mothers (eTable).
MATERNAL INFLUENZA VACCINATION TIMING
Of the 522 influenza-vaccinated mothers with a cord blood
specimen, 123 were vaccinated in the second trimester
and 390 in the third trimester. For all 8 influenza virus
strains, there was no difference in the cord blood titers
(GMTs or proportion with titers 1:40 or greater) according to trimester of vaccination (Table 4).
COMMENT
This prospective study demonstrated that maternal influenza vaccination was associated with a 41% reduced
risk of laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infection and
a 39% reduced risk of ILI hospitalization among the infants born to these mothers. The ILI incidence rate among
infants of unimmunized mothers was 7.2 per 1000 persondays of observation; 9% of infants born to unimmunized mothers had laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infection in the first 6 months of life, a proportion
comparable with the 10% seen in a randomized trial of
maternal influenza vaccination in Bangladesh.14
The mechanism of reduced influenza virus infection
risk in infants of vaccinated mothers could include reduced influenza exposure of the infant from the mother,
increased protection of the infant following exposure
through increased transplacentally acquired antibody titers, or residual confounding not controlled for in the
study. We did not evaluate maternal illness patterns during or following pregnancy but did evaluate influenza
strain–specific antibody status of the infants and the correlation between these antibodies and influenza virus infection. We found significantly higher influenza HI antibody titers in infants born to women vaccinated during
pregnancy compared with infants of unvaccinated mothers at 2 to 3 months of age and demonstrated a correlation with a reduced risk of influenza virus infection in
young infants with higher antibody titers. These findings are consistent with the serologic data from the Bangladesh clinical trial.20
Findings from previous studies are inconsistent about
the effects of maternal influenza antibody levels or vaccination on infant outcomes. Together, 3 prospective USbased observational studies concluded that higher infant influenza antibody titers delay the age at first infection
and decrease the severity of influenza illness but could
not identify a reduced risk of illness episodes.12,13,21 This
last observation, which was also seen in a cohort study
by France et al,22 may be attributable to the lack of laboratory confirmation and use of nonspecific clinical outcomes for influenza. A recent prospective, randomized
study conducted in Bangladesh investigated the association between maternal influenza vaccination and protection from influenza illness in infants. Infants born to
influenza-vaccinated mothers were 63% and 29% less
likely to have illness defined by a positive result on a rapid

influenza diagnostic test and febrile respiratory illness,
respectively, compared with infants in the control group.14
There are several limitations to our study. We investigated mother-infant characteristics that could confound the
findings and found no associations with vaccination or outcome; however, there is always the possibility of uncontrolled residual confounding. Furthermore, the study was
conducted during 3 relatively mild influenza seasons. Although we only identified a small number of cultureconfirmed influenza illnesses, we serologically identified
many additional infants with influenza. Serologic detection is not 100% sensitive for influenza virus infection; however, assuming the sensitivity does not vary according to
maternal vaccination status, any lack of sensitivity would
reduce the power for detecting a difference. If the sensitivity of detecting rising antibody titers is lower in infants
of vaccinated than unvaccinated mothers, which could occur as a result of falling passively acquired antibodies, then
the odds ratio would be overestimated. We do not believe
this is a significant issue because of the interval of blood
drawing and the rate of declining antibodies. Serological
data strengthened our findings and indicated that influenza HI antibodies in cord blood and infant sera up to 2 to
3 months of age provided protection against laboratoryconfirmed, clinically apparent, mild, and asymptomatic influenza virus infections. Investigation of these associations during more severe seasonal or pandemic epidemics
may add to and further enhance these associations.
This study found that influenza vaccination of pregnant women was significantly associated with increased
influenza antibody titers in their infants through 2 to 3
months of age and protection from influenza virus infection and ILI hospitalization during the first 6 months
of life. Although influenza vaccination is recommended
for pregnant women to reduce their risk of influenza complications, these findings provide support for the added
benefit of protecting infants from influenza virus infection up to 6 months, the period when infants are not eligible for influenza vaccination but are at highest risk of
severe influenza illness. These findings are particularly
relevant with the emergence of 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus, which had a substantial effect on
pregnant women and high hospitalization rates among
young infants.23,24 The 2009 H1N1 virus strain is included as a component of the 2010 Southern and 2010-
2011 Northern Hemisphere seasonal trivalent influenza
vaccines.25-27 The findings of this study underscore the
public health importance of maternal influenza vaccination to prevent influenza in both pregnant women and
their infants.23,24
