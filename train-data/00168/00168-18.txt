Efficacy of repeated annual
immunization with inactivated influenza
virus vaccines over a five year period
Wendy A. Keitel*§, Thomas R. Gate*, Robert B. Couch*,
Linda L. Huggins*$ and Kenneth R. Hess?
Some reports have suggested that inj?uenza virus vaccine is less eflective in persons that
have received prior annual vaccination(s) than in those receiving it for the first time. This
issue was addressed by evaluating the eJ%cacy of annual in..uenza vaccinations over a
5 year period in healthy adults employing commercially-available, inactivated whole-virus
vaccine. Influenza vaccination had minimal efSects on overall respiratory illnesses during
epidemic periods. However, it reduced influenza virus shedding by an average of 38.8% and
conferred protection against influenza virus infection during each epidemic. Some
variation in infection rates were noted between vaccine groups given one or more than one
annual immunization, and between years, but no consistent pattern of d@erences was
noted in relation to number of successive years of vaccination. These results suggest that
the current recommendation for annual influenza vaccination of persons at special risk of
serious disease and complications is appropriate, but that continued eflorts to improve the
eflectiveness qf our prophylactic measures against iqfluenza are needed. 0 1997 Elsevier

Annual influenza vaccinations are currently recommended for protection of persons at greatest risk for
developing complications or dying from influenza virus
infection’. Many studies have confirmed that these
vaccinations can protect against influenza virus infection and/or its complications2”. However, the value of
repeated annual influenza vaccinations was called into
question by observations during a longitudinal trial of
inactivated vaccine in an English boarding school for
boys5. During three successive outbreaks of A/H3N2
virus infection, vaccination conferred significant protection upon susceptible boys only if they were receiving
vaccine for the first time, and not if they had also
received it in prior years. Also, a report from Australia
described significant protection by inactivated influenza
vaccine against A/Victoria/75 (H3N2) infection among
hospital staff with little or no prior vaccination history,
but no reduction in infections among laboratory
workers or geriatric home residents that had received

prior annual vaccinations$ protection in the latter
‘groups was limited to reduced work absenteeism and
subjective moderation of illness severity.
The present study was designed to assess more completely the effects of repeated annual influenza vaccinations of adults on serum antibody responses and efficacy
against infection and illness in a prospective, controlled
manner over a 5 year period. Epidemics of influenza
occurred each year of the study, offering an opportunity
to measure the efficacy of these vaccinations against
infections with influenza A/HlNl, A/H3N2 and type B
viruses. Results of the first 2 years of the trial (1983-85)
were published previously’. This report summarizes the
efficacy of annual immunizations for the entire 5 year
study period (1983-88).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Volunteers
Details of the study design were published previously’. In brief, healthy 30-60-year-old volunteers
were recruited each fall from institutions of the Texas
Medical Center in Houston, Texas, and surrounding
businesses. Subjects were enrolled after giving written
consent according to protocols approved by local and
National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases
review boards for human studies. Those with no recent
history of immunization against influenza were assigned
randomly to receive trivalent inactivated influenza virus

vaccine (first vat group) or placebo (placebo group).
Those who had received vaccine within the preceding
3 years were revaccinated (multivac group). Volunteers
that received placebo during their initial year of participation were again randomized each fall until they received vaccine; after that, they received vaccine each fall.
Thus, the multivac group progressively increased in size,
but recruitment was necessary each year to maintain the
size of the placebo and first vat groups. Volunteers were
unaware of the type of vaccine they were given each
year.
Vaccines
Connaught Laboratories, Inc. (Swiftwater, PA) provided influenza virus vaccines for this study. They were
commercially-available, whole-virus vaccines containing
strains recommended for the year of use. A single 0.5 ml
dose of vaccine or saline placebo was administered into
the deltoid muscle. Two injections of 0.5 ml of vaccine
(or placebo) were required in the fall of 1986 to accommodate a supplemental influenza A/Taiwan/l/86
(HlNl) subvirion vaccine recommended for that year.
Surveillance
Sera were collected before and about 1 month after
vaccination for determining antibody responses to the
vaccine. Examinations of the study population for influenza virus infection and illness were activated when an
increase in influenza virus-associated febrile respiratory
disease was detected in continuous community surveillance*. At that time, participants were asked to come in
for examination if they developed any respiratory or
influenza-like illness. Neither the volunteers nor medical
personnel that evaluated these “prospectively-reported”
illnesses for severity and anatomic location were aware
of the subjects’ vaccine group. Symptoms and signs
involving the nose, pharynx, larynx and/or ear were
designated as upper respiratory illness (rhinitis, pharyngitis, laryngitis and/or otitis), while diagnosis of “lower
respiratory illness” required involvement of the trachea,
bronchi and/or lung (tracheitis, bronchitis and/or pneumonia). Complaints of myalgia and/or some combination of malaise, fatigue, lethargy, chills, sweats and/or
anorexia were required for a diagnosis of systemic
illness. An oral temperature of 37.8”C or higher
measured by the patient or by medical personnel at the
time of examination was considered fever. The mean
severity of symptoms (l=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe) in
a given anatomic site was used to define the illness as
mild, moderate or severe.
During acute illness evaluations, nasal washes (NW)
for virus culture were performed with lactated Ringer’s
solution; NW specimens were mixed with veal infusion
broth concentrate to yield a normal broth content and
held at 4°C until inoculation onto four types of tissue
culture: Madin-Darby canine kidney with added
trypsin; LLC-MK2; WI-38 human embryonic fibroblasts; and HEp-2. A throat swab specimen was added
to each NW specimen after the first year. Specimens for
virus culture were obtained on all subjects presenting
within 5 days of the onset of illness. Serum samples
were collected during the acute illness evaluation and
3-4 weeks later. Sera were also obtained from all subjects several weeks after each epidemic, at which time
volunteers were asked to describe any illnesses that had
not been reported over the winter season. For subjects
who had not reported an illness prospectively and were
later found to have serological evidence of an influenza
virus infection, the latter “retrospective” illness reports
provided an estimate of the number that may have
suffered an infection-associated illness.
Serology
Hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) antibody titers
were determined for all sera each year using standard
methods with an initial serum dilution of 1:49. Test
viruses were the one or two influenza epidemic strains
for that year (i.e. those accounting for 25% or more
of the isolates from community surveillance cultures)
and the antigenically related vaccine strain(s) when not
identical to the epidemic variant(s). For the 1985-86
epidemic, serum neutralizing antibody assays were performed against influenza B/Ann Arbor virus because
they provided optimal detection of infection”. Infection
was diagnosed by recovery of an influenza virus and/or a
fourfold or greater rise in serum antibody titer detected
in paired samples collected any time between postimmunization and post-epidemic periods.
Statistics
Differences in proportions were assessed using
Pearson’s xZ tests. Effects of the number of annual
immunizations on antibody responses and infection
rates were assessed using multivariate logistic regression
(program BMDPLR, BMDP Statistical Software, Inc.,
Los Angeles, CA). Only subjects randomized to receive
vaccine or placebo in their first year of participation
were included in the latter analyses (i.e. those initially
assigned to the multivac group because of an undocumented history of one or more vaccinations in the
preceding 3 years were excluded). The effect was
measured in terms of the odds ratio, which indicates the
increase in the risk of infection for each additional
annual immunization. For this purpose, the logarithm
of the odds ratio was modeled as a linear function of
the number of immunizations, and the analyses were
adjusted for any confounding effects of age (coded
as four groups: ~40, 41-50, 51-60, 61+), race (white,
other), sex (male, female), site (Texas Medical Center,
other), cohort (number of years in study), and health
occupation (yes, no). Data for the 1983-84 influenza B
virus outbreak were too sparse for an adjusted analysis,
so the odds ratio evaluated for that year was the
unadjusted, univariate result.
RESULTS
Volunteer enrollment and retention
Annual enrollment ranged between 675 and 985 subjects over the 5 year period between 1983 and 1987
(Table Z); 89-97% of those entered each year were
evaluable for that season. A majority of volunteers who
entered in 1983 remained in the study for the entire
5 year period (62%); the proportion of participants that
enrolled each succeeding year and remained in the study
until completion increased from 75% in 1984 to 89% in
1986.

Influenza vaccine and epidemic variants
Influenza virus antigens contained in the vaccine and
the predominant epidemic virus(es) in the community
for each year of the study are shown in Table 2. An
influenza epidemic occurred during each of the five
winter seasons of observation. Seven different viruses
(two influenza A/HlNl, two A/H3N2 and three type B
strains) caused 25% or more of community infections
during these epidemics. Vaccine and epidemic variants
were antigenically identical on only two occasions
[ 198485 A/Philippines (H3N2) and 1986-87 A/Taiwan
(HlNl)].
Serum antibody titers following vaccination
Mean post-immunization serum antibody titers
against vaccine and epidemic viruses are shown in Table
3 for recipients of placebo and of different numbers of
sequential annual influenza vaccinations. Results were
similar for randomized volunteers who had received
different numbers of annual immunizations in all years
except 1987-88. During the latter year, a small but
statistically significant reduction in mean postimmunization titers was noted with increasing numbers
of prior annual immunizations. Evidence of the latter
can be seen in the downward trend of antibody titers
after one-through-six sequential annual vaccinations for
two 1987-88 influenza virus antigens in Table 3, A/Los
Angeles (H3N2) and B/AnnArbor (P~O.001 and 0.01,
respectively; multiple linear regression). A similar trend
of borderline significance was observed for A/Leningrad
(P=O.O6), the influenza AlH3N2 vaccine antigen for that
year. The mean titers against these vaccine viruses
following the sixth annual vaccination were in the range
seen after one or two vaccinations. The number of
subjects, however, was only 39 vs 102-175 for those that
received one to five vaccinations.
Illnesses during epidemic periods
The percent of subjects that came in for evaluation of
an illness during each intluenza epidemic period are
shown in Table 4 for the placebo, first vat and multivac
groups. Illnesses are categorized into any respiratory
and/or systemic illness that caused the volunteer to come
in (“any”), those diagnosed as moderate or severe lower
respiratory and/or systemic illnesses (“flu-like”), and
those associated with fever. Over the five epidemic
periods, the percent of placebo, first vat and multivac
volunteers that came in with “any” illness averaged 30.3,
26.9 and 27.9% per year, respectively; average rates for
flu-like illness were 12.1, 10.4 and 11.3% per year,
respectively, while those for febrile illness were 6.7, 5.3
and 4.8%, respectively. Only twice was the frequency of
one of these categories of illness during an individual
epidemic period significantly lower by x2 for a vaccine
group than the corresponding value for the placebo
group: febrile illness for the Multivac group in 198687
(P<O.Ol), which represented a 52.3% reduction; and
flu-like illness for the first vat group in 1987-88
(P~0.05) which represented a 48.7% reduction. In two
other instances, the frequency of a category of illness
was 30% lower for an influenza vaccine group than
corresponding values for the placebo group though not
statistically significant; these were febrile illness for the
first vat group in both 198687 (32.3% lower) and
1987-88 (40.2% lower). Nevertheless, examination of the
relative rankings of the percent with febrile illness for the
three volunteer groups during each epidemic period reveals that one of the influenza vaccine groups invariably
had the lowest percent, and the placebo group had the
highest percent for all except the first epidemic period.
Influenza virus shedding
Frequencies of influenza virus shedding and infection
with each of the seven epidemic strains are summarized
for the volunteer groups in Table 5. The percent of
placebo recipients from whom an influenza virus was
isolated ranged between 2.9% in 198485 (all A/H3N2)

virus isolates from the placebo group during the two
seasons when two strains were prevalent was similar to
that observed in a community surveillance. Frequencies
of isolation of the epidemic virus strains from the first
vat and multivac groups are shown in data columns two
and three, respectively; each averaged 3.3%, a 38.8%
reduction from the average value for the placebo group.
Among subjects from whom a sample was collected for
virus culture, the mean day of presentation was similar
for the three groups for all years of study with the
exception of 1987-88. During the last year of the study,
subjects in the placebo group who were cultured for
influenza presented significantly later than those in the
first vat or multivac groups (2.8, 1.8 and 2.2 days in the
placebo, first vat and multivac groups respectively;
P=O.O2, analysis of variance). No significant difference
was noted between first vat and multivac groups.
Influenza virus infection
The percent of volunteers in the placebo group infected with an influenza virus based on virus isolation
and/or serology ranged from a low of 13.8% in 198687
(all A/HlNl) to a high of 23.2% in 198485 (all
A/H3N2), and averaged 17.5% per year (Table 5). Rates
of infection with the epidemic strains for the first vat
and multivac groups averaged 6.8% and 6.6% per year,
respectively. Rates of infection with each epidemic strain
were significantly lower for each influenza vaccine group
than were those for the placebo group (x’, P-=0.05) in all
but four of 14 comparisons, and borderline (P=O.O7) for
two of these four. In 4 out of 7 years, both the isolation
and infection rates were somewhat higher in the multivat than the first vat group and in 3 out of 7 years, these
rates were somewhat higher in the first vat than the
multivac group. No significant differences in virus
shedding or infection were noted between first vat and
multivac groups during any epidemic.
The two reductions in infection rates for an influenza
vaccine group relative to the placebo group with no
trend toward statistical significance (P>O.lO) occurred
in association with the two lowest placebo infection
rates: influenza B in 1987-88 (placebo 5.5% vs multivac
3.4%); and A/HlNl in 1983-84 (placebo 7.4% vs first
vat 5.6%). Such low infection rates allow chance variations to have a greater effect, but another factor may be

involved with A/HlNl in 1983-84. Influenza vaccination during the first few years after the return of
A/HlNl viruses in 1977 was protective against this
subtype primarily in persons born before 1950, during
previous circulation of A/HlNl viruses”. Two influenza
vaccinations a month apart were recommended for
younger adults who had not previously received an
A/HlNl-containing vaccine from 1977 until the time
that the present study began. It is thus noteworthy that,
during the 1983-84 A/HlNl epidemic, multivac volunteers were somewhat less likely than those in the first vat
group to become infected with A/HlNl (2/138 vs 9/162,
respectively; P=O.O6). Age ~36 years was also associated with an increased risk of infection of first vat
volunteers during the 198687 A/Taiwan epidemic (adjusted odds ratio=0.38; CI=O.22, 0.67; P=O.O008 in a
multivariate analysis), but protection was noted for the
group.
A concern with analyses of infection rates using serum
antibody titer rise as an indication of infection is that
their result may depend in part on the inability of those
with high antibody titers induced by prior infection or
vaccination to develop a further significant rise after a
The effect of increasing numbers of annual immunizations on influenza virus shedding and infection rates
was determined using a multivariate logistic regression
analysis (Figure 1 and Table 6). For these analyses only
subjects randomized to receive the indicated number of
annual injections were included (see Section 2). No
significant changes in influenza virus infection rates with
increasing numbers of annual immunizations were observed during any epidemic period (Table 6). Likewise,
no significant changes in the frequencies of influenza
virus shedding with increasing numbers of prior annual
immunizations were observed during any epidemic
period with the exception of 1987-1988 (Figure 1).
During the last epidemic studied, the risk of shedding
influenza AlH3N2 virus was significantly increased
with increasing numbers of annual immunizations
(O.R.= 1.48; 95% CI= 1.1 l-l .97; P=O.O06). A significant
inverse correlation was found between risk of infection
and post-vaccination serum antibody levels during each
year (data not shown).

current infection. This issue was evaluated among
randomized subjects with influenza virus isolates and
paired serum specimens for demonstration of an antibody response. Among 61 placebo recipients with an
influenza virus isolate, 38 (62.3%) developed an antibody response. For the first vat group, 12 (46.2%) of 26
with an influenza virus isolate developed an antibody
response, while 22 (46.8%) of 47 multivac volunteers did
so (x’ vs placebo, P>O.lO for both comparisons). The
frequency of an antibody response among isolatepositive volunteers for the first vat and multivac groups
combined, 34 (46.6%) of 73, was somewhat lower than
that for the placebo group (P=O.O69; x2).
Influenza virus infection-associated illnesses
An average of 30% of the placebo volunteers reported
a respiratory and/or systemic illness during each year’s
epidemic period. Of these an average of 3 1.6% could
be attributed to laboratory-confirmed influenza virus
infection (derived from Tables 4 and 7). Average annual
The percent of volunteers with prospectivelyevaluated, influenza virus infection-associated illnesses
during the epidemic period are shown in Table 7 for
each volunteer group according to the epidemic strain
involved. For the placebo group, annual rates of “any”
infection-associated illness ranged from 6.9% for the
198687 epidemic period (all type A/HlNl) to 12.5% for
1987-88 (9.7% A/H3N2 plus 2.8% type B), and averaged
9.2%) x2 analyses of data from which the percentages in
Table 7 were derived reveal significant reductions in
rates for an influenza vaccine group from those for the
placebo group during the two seasons when vaccine and
epidemic strains were identical (for the multivac group
during the 198485 influenza A/Philippines (H3N2) epidemic; and for both first vat and multivac groups during
the 198687 influenza A/Taiwan (HlNl) epidemic), and
for the multivac group during the 1985-86 influenza B
epidemic. Average reductions from the placebo rate for
“any”, “flu-like” and febrile illnesses associated with
infection by one of the seven epidemic strains were 50,
48 and 30%, respectively, for the first vat group, and 44,
50 and 43%, respectively, for the multivac group.

proportion of the total illnesses can be accounted for by
influenza virus infection than occurred with the “any”
illness category, but the proportion for the placebo
group was still greater than for either of the two
influenza vaccine groups. Average annual rates of influenza virus infection-associated flu-like illnesses for the
placebo, first vat and multivac volunteers represented
38, 29 and 23”/0, respectively, of the total flu-like illness
seen among these subjects. Similarly, average annual
infection-associated febrile illness rates for the placebo,
first vat and multivac groups represented 45, 43 and
35%, respectively, of the total febrile illness within these
groups.
Other etiologies of illnesses
The data presented suggest that agents other than
influenza viruses accounted for a majority of respiratory
and/or systemic illnesses experienced by these healthy,
ambulatory adults during the influenza epidemic periods
studied. From among 1149 epidemic illnesses evaluated,
156 yielded an influenza virus on culture, which represents 38.5% of the total of 405 influenza virus infections
diagnosed. Collection of a single sample only and failure
of many subjects to come in within the first days of
illness were likely major contributors to low influenza
virus isolation rates. Other viruses isolated included 64
picornavirus isolates (33 rhinovirus; 17 enterovirus and
14 untyped), 10 respiratory syncytial virus isolates, 7
Herpes simplex, 4 adenovirus, and 4 parainfluenza type 3
virus isolates. The number of these other viruses did not
differ significantly for the three volunteer groups, but
would account for no more than 8% of the respiratory
and/or systemic illnesses seen. Thus, the etiology of the
majority of these illnesses remains undefined with the
methods employed.
Retrospectively reported illnesses
Data were also acquired on subjects found to have
serological evidence of influenza virus infection in assays
of paired post-vaccination and post-season sera but who
failed to report prospectively a respiratory and/or systemic illness during that interval. Of 405 influenza virus
infections diagnosed in the laboratory during this study,
140 (34.6%) fell into this category. Possible influenza

infection-associated illnesses were reported retrospectively by 461199 (23.1%) placebo volunteers, 6/54
(11.1%) first vat volunteers, and 18/152 (11.8%) multivac
volunteers. Since these retrospectively reported illnesses
are not included in the tables, their greater frequency
within the placebo group may indicate an underestimation of the calculations of vaccine efficacy.
DISCUSSION
The efficacy of repeated annual immunization with
inactivated influenza virus vaccines over a 5 year period
was demonstrated in this placebo-controlled evaluation
conducted in a healthy middle-aged population. Annual
immunization was associated with reductions in influenza virus shedding and infection, as well as infectionassociated illness during each epidemic. Modest but
significant reductions in mean serum antibody levels and
increased shedding of influenza AlH3N2 virus were
noted with increasing numbers of annual immunizations
during the last year of the study, but no significant loss
of protection against infection (virus shedding and/or
antibody rise) was seen.
Evidence of a beneficial effect of repeated annual
vaccinations was clearly apparent with A/HlNl in
1983-84 when the multivac group had a lower frequency
of infections than the first vat group, and with A/H3N2
in 198485 when the multivac group had somewhat
greater reductions in the frequency of infectionassociated illnesses than the first vat group. In a casecontrol study of influenza vaccine efficacy, Ahmed and
his colleagues documented a reduction in mortality
during the 1989-90 influenza A/H3N2 epidemic among
vaccinated subjects”. Vaccination reduced mortality to
a greater extent in those who had been vaccinated
previously when compared with those vaccinated for the
first time. Thus, it appears that the efficacy of influenza
can depend on factors such as the population’s prior
experience with influenza virus infection and/or vaccination and the match between vaccine and epidemic
strains. The antigenic changes that influenza viruses
regularly undergo and the observation by some
investigators that vaccine efficacy does not last longer
than a year in high risk individuals, even when the
epidemic virus does not change13, are strong arguments 
Influenza vaccine efficacy: W.A. Keitel et al.
in favor of the policy of annual influenza virus vaccinations for the latter persons. The present study found no
consistent differences in efficacy of primary influenza
vaccination vs sequential annual revaccination, and thus
supports this policy. On the other hand, in most years
repeated immunization does not appear to confer any
special advantage over immunization for the first time.
Suggestions in the last year of the study (1987-88) of
a possible decrease in efficacy with repeated annual
vaccinations included decreasing post-vaccination serum
antibody titers against the vaccine strains with increasing numbers of prior annual vaccinations and somewhat
greater reductions in illnesses associated with A/H3N2
and type B virus infections among first vat as compared
to multivac volunteers. The differences were small and
multivariate logistic regression analysis of the frequency
of laboratory-diagnosed influenza virus infections with
increasing numbers of annual immunizations revealed
no significant change in rates. However, 95% confidence intervals all include values that are consistent with
either increases or decreases in efficacy with increasing
numbers of annual immunizations for these two viruses,
Findings in the present study are consistent with the
previously described difficulty of using serological evidence of influenza virus infection to measure vaccine
efficacy. Vaccination was associated with a somewhat
reduced frequency of serum antibody responses to
culture- proven influenza virus infection. Therefore, dependence upon serological responses for measuring protection against infection by influenza virus vaccination
could lead to an overestimation of vaccine efficacy. Over
60% of the diagnoses of influenza virus infection in this
study were based upon serological responses. That a
disproportionate number of infections may have been
missed among subjects given influenza vaccine as compared to placebo recipients is suggested by the finding
that infection-associated illnesses accounted for a lower
percentage of overall illnesses in each category for
influenza vaccine groups than for the placebo group. No
evidence was found that more frequent infections with
other viruses among influenza vaccine recipients could
account for this difference. Under-estimation of vaccine
efficacy also could have occurred as suggested by the
analysis of retrospectively reported illness.
The 2 years in which a very close match existed
between vaccine and epidemic influenza virus strains,
1984-85 [A/Philippines/2/82(H3N2)] and 198687
[A/Taiwan/l/86 (HlNl)], yielded the strongest evidence
of vaccine-induced reductions in infection-associated
illness. Improved surveillance for influenza resulted in
an identical antigenic match of vaccine and epidemic
viruses during the 4 years immediately following this
study (Nancy Cox, Ph.D.; Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia; personal communication); similar evidence of effectiveness could be expected for this period. However, analysis of illnesses
during influenza epidemic periods without regard to
laboratory evidence of infection reveals that, of the two
close vaccine-epidemic strain matches in the present
study, only A/Taiwan (HlNl) was associated with reductions in frequency of an illness category (i.e. febrile
illness). Moreover, despite relatively poor matches
between 1987-88 vaccine and epidemic strains for both
A/H3N2 and type B viruses, overall reductions in flulike illness and, to a lesser extent, febrile illness, were
seen for the first vat group.
The effect of influenza virus vaccine on overall occurrence of respiratory and/or systemic illness among
healthy, ambulatory adults was minimal during the five,
mild-to-moderate influenza epidemics evaluated in this
study; it consisted primarily of reductions in the frequency of febrile illness. Vaccination was associated
with a 38.8% reduction in the frequency of virus shedding by the subjects, a finding that could contribute to a
reduced likelihood that they would transmit influenza
virus infection. In the nursing home setting, vaccineinduced protection against any influenza-like illness has
been reported to be only 3540%, while protection
against increasingly severe complications such as illness
requiring hospitalization, pneumonia and death progressively increased to levels ca 75%14. Moreover, high
vaccination rates of nursing home residents (70%) can
actually prevent outbreaks through “herd immunity”15.
The major aim of our investigation was to determine
whether inactivated influenza virus vaccines continue to
provide protection against infection when administered
on an annual basis. Our results apparently differ from
those reported by Hoskins et ~1.~ However, differences in
the ages of the populations studied (children vs adults),
epidemiologic setting (boarding school vs community)
and prior experience with influenza virus are factors
which may account for the observed differences. Nevertheless, the results of our study provide reassuring
evidence that annual immunization of adults with inactivated influenza virus vaccine confers significant protection against infection each year. The findings of this
study are supportive of the current recommendations for
annual immunization of adults against influenza. At the
same time, they underscore the continuing needs for
effective worldwide surveillance to guide selection of
vaccine strains, as well as efforts to improve the effectiveness of our prophylactic measures against influenza.
