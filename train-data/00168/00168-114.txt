Objective: To evaluate the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes following A/H1N1 vaccination in pregnant
women.
Methods: This observational cohort study compared vaccinated and non-vaccinated pregnant women in
EFEMERIS, a French prescription database including pregnant women. Women who ended their pregnancy in South Western France between October 21, 2009 and November 30, 2010 (the period of the
French vaccination campaign) were included. Two non-vaccinated women were individually matched to
each vaccinated woman by month and year of pregnancy onset. Conditional logistic regression and Cox
proportional hazards regression were used to evaluate associations between each outcome (all-cause
pregnancy loss, preterm delivery, small for gestational age (SGA) and neonatal pathology) and A/H1N1
vaccination during pregnancy.
Results: 1645 women of the 12,120 (13.6%) in the database who were administered A/H1N1 vaccine
during pregnancy were compared to 3290 non-vaccinated women. Most were vaccinated in December
2009 (61%) with a non-adjuvanted vaccine (93%). The risks of pregnancy loss (adjusted HR = 0.56; 95%
CI = 0.31–1.01), of preterm birth (adjusted HR = 0.82; 95% CI = 0.64–1.06), and of neonatal pathology
(adjusted OR = 0.70; 95% CI = 0.49–1.02) did not differ between the vaccinated and the non-vaccinated
groups. The rate of SGA was lower in the vaccinated group than in the non-vaccinated group (0.5% vs.
1.4%; adjusted OR = 0.36; 95% CI = 0.17–0.78).
Conclusion: There was no significant association between adverse pregnancy outcomes and vaccination
with a non-adjuvanted A/H1N1 vaccine during pregnancy.

1. Introduction
During the A/H1N1 pandemic of 2009–2010, pregnant women
were at increased risk of severe illness, hospitalization, and complications, especially during the second and third trimesters [1–5].
The World Health Organization (WHO) and Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) initiated a worldwide vaccination
campaign in 2009 for populations most at risk of severe illness with
the aim of minimizing the impact and spread of the A(H1N1)v09
strain. Pregnant women were one of the main groups prioritized by
the vaccination campaign [6]. Thus, during the A/H1N1 influenza
outbreak in 2009, French health authority guidelines were to

vaccinate all pregnant women with a non-adjuvanted vaccine
during the second and third trimesters [7].
The French vaccination campaign started on October 21, 2009.
Vaccination was offered free of charge at vaccination centers,
first to health care workers and those in various risk groups,
and then to the entire population. A two-dose vaccination was
planned but from the end of November 2009 just one dose was
administered to most individuals. Five vaccines were available in
France: the non-adjuvanted Panenza◦ (Sanofi Pasteur), the AS03-
adjuvanted Pandemrix◦ (GlaxoSmithKline), the non-adjuvanted
Celvapan◦ (Baxter), the MF59-adjuvanted Focetria◦ (Novartis
Vaccines and Diagnostics) and the AF03-adjuvanted Humenza◦
(Sanofi Pasteur).
The French National Health Insurance Fund for SalariedWorkers
(Caisse National de l’Assurance Maladie des Travailleurs Salariés;
CNAMTS) centralized and recorded all vaccination data in order
to manage and to monitor the campaign. During the A/H1N1

pandemic, vaccinationcenters were required to reportA/H1N1 vaccinations to the CNAMTS; consequently, the vaccination data are
considered to be close to complete.
Because of the emergency nature of the A/H1N1 vaccine production and of the vaccination centers used for this particular
vaccination campaign, there was some mistrust in the general population about safety. Indeed, there was a lack of vaccination safety
data. This led to a low rate of vaccination in general population and
an even lower rate among pregnant women, despite the risks of
influenza being well known for this subpopulation.
Recent retrospective comparative studies, conducted after the
A/H1N1 pandemic, have provided reassuring findings aboutthe use
of A/H1N1 vaccines for pregnant woman. No increased risk of fetal
death, adverse fetal outcomes or birth defects have been reported
[8–19]. A small number of non-comparative studies have investigated the potential effects of a non-adjuvanted vaccine [20–22].
The only comparative study was by Opperman et al. [23] including
323 women exposed to a non-adjuvanted vaccine. Their findings
did not indicate any increased risk of spontaneous abortion, major
malformation or preterm birth.
This first French retrolective comparative study was designed
to evaluate the potential adverse effects of A/H1N1 vaccination,
mainly with a non-adjuvanted vaccine, during pregnancy in France.
2. Materials and methods
This observational cohort study evaluated adverse pregnancy
outcomes for pregnant women exposed or not exposed to an
A/H1N1 vaccine. The study was based on EFEMERIS, a French prescription database including pregnant women, and on the CNAMTS
vaccination database.
2.1. Data collection
EFEMERIS is a French database of prescriptions in the general
population constructed to evaluate risks associated with drugs duringpregnancy. Data are fromfourdifferent sources. First,the French
Health Insurance System (Caisse Primaire d’Assurance Maladie;
CPAM) of Haute-Garonne (South Western France) records all the
reimbursed drugs (name, ATC code, date of dispensation) that are
prescribed and dispensed to patients under general state coverage.
All drugs are classified according to the World Health Organization’s Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification [24]. Second,
the Mother and Child Protection Center (Protection Maternelle
et Infantile; PMI) records data from children’s certificates filled
out during the compulsory medical examinations at ages 8 days,
9 months and 2 years. These health certificates contain data
about the health of both mother (maternal characteristics, some
pathologies during pregnancy) and child (weight, size, APGAR
score, neonatal pathologies, psychomotor development, congenital malformations). Third, the Antenatal Diagnosis Center (Centre
de Diagnostic Anténatal; CDA) centralizes data corresponding to
all the occurrences of major and minor malformations in the
maternities of the region where therapeutic termination has been
considered (cause and date of termination). Four, the French hospital medical information system (Programme de médicalisation des
systèmes d’information; PMSI) provides the nature and date of termination (legal termination, stillbirth, and spontaneous abortion)
from Toulouse university hospital center. The date of the start of
pregnancy is transmitted by the CPAM. The date of birth is provided by the CPAM, CDA and PMSI. The mother and the outcome
of her pregnancy (live birth or pregnancy loss) are linked with an
anonymous irreversible identifier. More details about the design
and features of EFEMERIS are presented elsewhere [25].
Vaccination data (name of vaccine and date of vaccination) were
recorded in the CNAMTS database rather than the CPAM database.
Vaccination data were made anonymous using the same procedure as that used by CPAM, CDA, PMI and PMSI, and linked with
the anonymous irreversible identifier to the EFEMERIS database to
document the vaccination status of all pregnant women included
in EFEMERIS. The French data protection agency (Commission
Nationale des Informations et Libertés; CNIL) and the French institute on health data (Institut des données de santé; IDS) gave ethical
approval for this specific study.
2.2. Participants
At the time of the study, 58,171 mother-outcome pairs with
women who delivered in Haute-Garonne between July 1, 2004 and
December 31, 2010 were recorded in EFEMERIS.
A/H1N1 vaccination status for all the women in EFEMERIS
cohort was provided by the CNAMTS with the name of the vaccine
administered and the date of vaccination.
Our study cohort was restricted to pregnancies ending between
October 21, 2009 (the start of the vaccination campaign) and
November 30, 2010 (9 months after the vaccination centers had
closed), and that had started before January, 31 2010. For each
mother-outcome pair exposed to A/H1N1 vaccine during pregnancy two mother-outcome pairs were randomly selected from
among individuals in the study population who did not receive
A/H1N1 vaccine during pregnancy but who were matched for
month and year of the start of pregnancy. For the women who
received more than one dose of vaccine, exposure was defined as
the time of the first dose.
2.3. Outcome measurements
The main outcomes studied were all-cause pregnancy loss,
preterm delivery, small size for gestational age (SGA) and neonatal
pathology.
All-cause pregnancy loss was defined as any loss occurring during pregnancy (legal and therapeutic termination, spontaneous
abortion, stillbirth and ectopic pregnancy). A birth before 259 days
of amenorrhea (37 completed weeks) was defined as a preterm
delivery [26]. SGA was defined as any singleton with a birth weight
< 2 standard deviations (SD) from the French reference weight
mean, adjusted for gestational age and sex [27]. Neonatal pathologies (for example respiratory distress, pneumothorax, neonatal
jaundice, metabolic disorders, or sepsis) were identified from the
children’s health certificates established on the 8th day, as recorded
by the physician during medical consultation; these records provided little detail about the conditions.
2.4. Potential confounders
Maternal characteristics considered to be time-constant potential confounders were maternal age (<25 years, 25–29 years,
30–34 years, >=35 years), multiple births, presence of a longterm adverse health condition, preeclampsia, gestational diabetes,
pregnancy-induced hypertension, number of different active substances prescribed during pregnancy, folic acid supplements
during organogenesis, the use of teratogens during organogenesis
(retinoids, antiepileptics, and antivitamin K), the use of neuraminidase inhibitors, and seasonal flu vaccination.
2.5. Statistical analysis
Continuous variables are expressed as means (±SD), and
categorical variables as percentages. Quantitative variables or proportions were compared between the two groups (vaccinated and
1256 A.B. Beau et al. / Vaccine 32 (2014) 1254–1258
unexposed) using simple conditional logistic regression. When
exposure was restricted to a shorter period than the whole pregnancy, percentages or proportions were calculated only for the
completed matched-pairs.
To evaluate the association between A/H1N1 vaccination and
all-cause pregnancy loss and preterm delivery, Cox proportional
hazards regressions were used. Survival analyses were used with
time-dependent variable to take into account the time-dependent
nature of exposure [28,29]. Cox proportional hazards regression
was applied to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence
intervals (CIs), comparing the hazard rates of all-cause pregnancy
loss and preterm delivery between vaccinated and unexposed
women. Vaccination was treated as a binary time-dependent variable: a woman was considered “vaccinated” from the day of
vaccination until delivery but “unexposed” prior to the vaccination
or if she did not receive any dose of any A/H1N1 vaccine during
pregnancy. The time metric used was gestational days. Analysis of
the risk of preterm delivery was restricted to vaccination before 37
completed weeks of amenorrhea.
The associations between A/H1N1 vaccination and each of SGA
and neonatal pathology were studied for live births, by conditional
logistic regression analysis based on calculating unadjusted odds
ratios (ORs), along with 95% CIs. All variables were considered as
constant-time variables. For rare outcomes, exact conditional logistic regression was used. Analysis of the risk of neonatal pathology
was also restricted to exposure during the third trimester of pregnancy.
We identified confounders, using simple Cox proportional hazards regression or simple conditional logistic regression to evaluate
the association between each potential confounder and each outcome. Only the variables meeting the Greenland entry criteria
(P < 0.20) and that were clinically significant were selected for
inclusion in the multivariable model [30]. Subsequently, we used
conditional forward stepwise regression to calculate adjusted HRs
or adjusted ORs, and their 95% CIs.
Cases with missing data for any of the covariates were excluded
from the multivariable analyses. All statistical tests were 2-tailed
with P < 0.05 considered to indicate statistical significance. All analyses were performed using SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary,
NC).
3. Results
In the EFEMERIS cohort, 12,120 pregnancies ended between
October 21, 2009 and November 30, 2010 and had started before
January 31, 2010. A total of 1645 (13.6%) of these women were
vaccinated with an A/H1N1 vaccine during pregnancy. These 1645
vaccinated women were compared to 3290 unexposed women.
Fifty-one per cent ofthem received two doses of vaccine. Thirty-five
per cent received the first dose in November 2009, 61% in December
2009 and 3%inJanuary 2010. Thenon-adjuvanted Panenza◦ was the
vaccine dispensed to most of these pregnant women (93%). Eight
per cent of the vaccinations were during the first trimester, 52%
during the second and 40% during the third. Only 46 (3%) women
were exposed to an A/H1N1 vaccine during organogenesis.
Selected maternal characteristics, morbidities and drug use
for A/H1N1 vaccinated and unexposed women are presented in
Table 1. Women in the vaccinated group were less likely to be
employees (48.9% vs. 63.7%) and more likely to have a high-level
occupation (35.5% vs. 19.5%) than women in the unexposed group.
There was no difference between A/H1N1 vaccinated women and
unexposed women for obstetrical complications of pregnancy.
Folic acid supplements were significantly more prescribed during
organogenesis to the women of the A/H1N1 vaccinated group
than unexposed group (27.4% vs. 18.5%; P < 0.0001). There was no
difference between the two groups concerning the prescription
of the neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir or zanamivir during
pregnancy, and no difference for the prescription of a seasonal
influenza vaccine during pregnancy.
There was no significant difference for all-cause pregnancy
loss between A/H1N1 vaccinated women and unexposed women
(adjusted HR = 0.56, 95% CI = 0.31–1.01) (Table 2).
There was no significant association between preterm delivery
(adjusted HR = 0.82, 95% CI = 0.64–1.06) and A/H1N1 vaccination
during pregnancy (Table 2), even if only singleton births were
included in the analysis (adjusted HR = 0.93, 95% CI = 0.70–1.25).
There was no significant difference for neonatal pathology between
A/H1N1 vaccinated women and unexposed women (adjusted
OR = 0.70, 95% CI = 0.49–1.02). This was also true for exposure only
during the third trimester of pregnancy (Table 2).
The proportion of infants born SGA was significantly smaller in
the A/H1N1 vaccinated group than in the unexposed group (0.5%
vs. 1.4%, OR = 0.36, 95% CI = 0.17–0.78) (Table 2).
4. Discussion
This study did not find any significant association between
all-cause pregnancy termination, preterm delivery, or neonatal
pathology andA/H1N1 vaccinationduringpregnancy.However,the
rate of SGA was lower among A/H1N1 vaccinated than unexposed
women.
4.1. Comparison with other studies
No A/H1N1 vaccine has been tested in an animal reproductive
model [31]. Nevertheless, some clinical studies have investigated
the potential adverse effects of A/H1N1 vaccination on the fetus
and on newborn health. Pasternak et al. [8] conducted a study with
330 women vaccinated with an AS03-adjuvanted A/H1N1 vaccine
during the first trimester and about 6500 vaccinated during the
second or third trimester. They found no increased risk of birth
defects, preterm birth or SGA. Similarly, another large study in
Sweden with 18,612 AS03-adjuvanted A/H1N1 vaccinated women
led to the same conclusions; indeed, it even indicated lower rates
of stillbirth, preterm birth and low birth weight among the vaccinated women [9]. In Germany, Oppermann et al. [23] studied the
effect of A/H1N1 vaccination (mostly a non-adjuvanted vaccine)
during pregnancy. They found no difference for the risk of spontaneous abortion, major malformation or preterm birth between
323 vaccinated and 1329 non-vaccinated women. There have also
been descriptive studies of the use of the non-adjuvanted A/H1N1
vaccine during pregnancy in France. Omon et al. [20] described
pregnancy outcomes among 569 women vaccinated with a nonadjuvanted influenza vaccine in South Western France. Similarly,
the PREGVAXGRIP study [21] described pregnancy outcomes in a
cohort of 2415 French pregnant women receiving a non-adjuvanted
A/H1N1 vaccine. Neither descriptive study found any evidence
for concern about potential adverse effects of A/H1N1 vaccination on pregnancy outcomes. The results of our comparative study
reported here provide reassurance about the safety of using of a
non-adjuvanted A/H1N1 vaccine during pregnancy.
4.2. Strengths and limitations
We present one of the first comparative studies on exposure to
a non-adjuvanted A/H1N1 vaccine during pregnancy. The methodological strengths of the EFEMERIS database are substantial, and
include the data being linked at the individual level. Information
about the outcomes and medications are registered prospectively
such that the possibility of recall bias is limited. The data contain

dates of start and end of pregnancy. Furthermore, for 73% of the
infants, data from the follow-up at age nine months were available.
Nevertheless, our study suffers some methodological insufficiencies, particularly as a consequence of its pharmacoepidemiological nature. Some other, unmeasured, confounders may have
influenced the results despite our multivariable analysis. For example, potential confounders such as medical and obstetric histories,
or pre-existing maternal pathologies, could not be evaluated. Data
on smoking habits and alcohol consumption were available in children’s health certificates, butmay not be reliable, as is often the case
in such studies. We were not able to adjust for influenza infection
becausediagnoses ofinfluenza werenot available.Nevertheless, we
could adjust for the prescription of an antiviral drug during pregnancy. We also had information about seasonal flu vaccination, but
only 26 women were vaccinated; we chose to treat this confounder
as a time constant-variable.
The women’s occupation appeared to be significantly different
between the two groups, and suggested a higher socioeconomicstatus for the vaccinated than non-vaccinated women. COFLUPREG,
a French prospective study conducted in three tertiary maternity
centers in Paris during the A/H1N1 pandemic, reported a similar
finding [32]: about 63% of the pregnant women did not receive the
A/H1N1 vaccine and the rate of vaccination was even lower among
pregnant women with low socio-economic status. Due to missing
data for occupation (25%) the variable was not introduced into any
final multivariable model. Nevertheless, analysis using only the
completed data did not result in any difference in the estimates
(data not shown).
A greater proportion of the vaccinated women than the
non-vaccinated women received folic acid supplements during
organogenesis. This may have reflected a difference in pregnancy
monitoring between the two groups of women. Thus, the association between a lower rate of babies born SGA and A/H1N1
vaccination during pregnancy might reflect of a difference of
socioeconomic status between the two groups. This apparent positive effect of A/H1N1 vaccination on SGA may also have been
secondary to a possible lower rate of maternal influenza infection
in women who were vaccinated.
The number of women vaccinated against A/H1N1 during
organogenesis was small (n = 46), due to the French vaccination
recommendations. Thus, it was not possible to assess the potential
effects of such vaccination on congenital malformation.

This study was powered to exclude only a minimum of a 1.45-
fold increase in risk of all-cause pregnancy loss, a 1.40-fold increase
in risk of neonatal pathology and preterm birth, and a 1.95-fold
increase in risk of SGA. Due to the matching by month and year of
the start of pregnancy, it was not possible to include more unexposed women per vaccinated woman and thus not possible to
increase the study power.
5. Conclusion
The A/H1N1 vaccination rate among pregnant women in our
region of France was relatively low (13.6%), probably because of
concerns about the safety of the vaccines; this value is nevertheless similar to those in other European countries [8,33]. Our
comparative study did not find any significant association between
the risk of all-cause pregnancy termination, preterm delivery or
neonatal pathology and non-adjuvanted A/H1N1 vaccination during pregnancy. These results confirm previous findings and provide
reassurance about the safety of using a non-adjuvanted A/H1N1
vaccine during pregnancy.
