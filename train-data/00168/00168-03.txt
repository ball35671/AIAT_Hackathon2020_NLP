Background. A new trivalent inactivated split-virus influenza vaccine (TIV) was recently introduced in the
United States. We assessed the efficacy of TIV against culture-confirmed influenza A and/or B.
Methods. In this double-blind trial conducted from September 2006 to May 2007 in the Czech Republic and
Finland, participants aged 18–64 years were randomized to receive 1 dose of TIV ( ) or placebo ( n p 5103 n p
2549). Influenza-like illnesses (ILI) (defined as at least 1 systemic symptom [fever {oral temperature, 37.8C}
and/or myalgia] and at least 1 respiratory symptom [cough and/or sore throat]) were identified by both active
(biweekly phone contact) and passive surveillance. Nasal and throat swab specimens were collected for viral culture.
Results. The attack rate for culture-confirmed ILI was 3.2% in the placebo group, with most strains identified
as influenza A (all except 1 were H3N2) matching the vaccine strain. There were 6 cases of influenza B, all of
which were of a different lineage (Yamagata) than the vaccine strain. Vaccine efficacy against culture-confirmed
influenza A and/or B due to strains antigenically matched to the vaccine was 66.9% (95% confidence interval
[CI], 51.9%–77.4%; ) and to any strain was 61.6% (95% CI, 46.0%–72.8%; ). P ! .001 P ! .001
Conclusion. TIV is efficacious against culture-confirmed influenza in healthy adults.
Trial Registration. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00363870.
Each year, trivalent influenza vaccines are produced that
contain the 3 strains (2 influenza A and 1 influenza B)
predicted by the World Health Organization (WHO)
to be the predominant circulating strains for the next
influenza season [1, 2]. A trivalent inactivated splitvirus influenza vaccine (TIV) manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Biologicals in embryonated eggs has
been available in several countries since 1987 but was
only recently approved for use in the United States
[3, 4, 5].

sore throat) was based on that used by the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) [7]. The study was powered on
the basis of the assumption that the attack rate of cultureconfirmed influenza in the placebo group would be 4%. However, the actual attack rate was much lower (0.9%), so the study
lacked the power to demonstrate efficacy [6]. Furthermore, the
majority of the cases were influenza B cases, which were found
to have been caused by a strain of a different lineage than the
vaccine strain [6].
We undertook a second prospective, randomized, placebocontrolled, efficacy study of TIV among healthy adults during
the 2006–2007 influenza season. The same method was used
but with the following refinements: the sample size was based
on the assumption of a lower attack rate; to increase case capture, a less stringent case definition of ILI was used than in the
previous study; and efficacy against culture-confirmed influenza
for strains antigenically matched to the vaccine was specified
as the primary objective.
METHODS
Study design and objectives. This was a randomized, doubleblind, placebo-controlled study conducted during the 2006–
2007 influenza season at 15 centers located in the Czech Republic and Finland. The protocol and study documents were
approved by the ethics committees of each country.
The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy of TIV
versus placebo in the prevention of culture-confirmed influenza
A and/or B due to strains antigenically matched to the vaccine.
Secondary efficacy objectives included the evaluation of (1) TIV
in the prevention of culture-confirmed influenza due to strains
antigenically matched to the vaccine for each of 2 vaccine lots,
(2) TIV in the prevention of culture-confirmed influenza A
and/or B attributable to any influenza A or B strain, and (3)
TIV in the prevention of ILI. Other secondary objectives were
the assessment of safety and, in a subset of subjects, the assessment of vaccine reactogenicity and immunogenicity.
Participants. Eligible participants were self-referred women
or men who were between 18 and 64 years of age, had no significant clinical disease at the time of vaccination, and provided
written informed consent. Blinding to treatment assignment was
maintained until study analysis.
Vaccination and blood sampling. Participants were randomized to receive 1 dose of TIV (lot 1 or lot 2 of Fluarix) or
placebo (normal saline solution) at the first study visit (day 0)
by intramuscular injection. Each 0.5-mL dose of TIV contained
15 mg of each of the hemagglutinin antigens of strains A/New
Caledonia/20/99(H1N1) IVR-116, A/Wisconsin/67/2005(H3N2),
and B/Malaysia/2506/2004 (from the Victoria lineage).
Blood samples for the evaluation of influenza vaccine immunogenicity were obtained from the randomly selected,
planned subset of ∼500 participants just prior to vaccination
and 21–28 days later.
Case definitions. Culture-confirmed influenza A and/or B
due to strains antigenically matched to the vaccine (primary
end point) was defined as an episode of ILI occurring after
administration of the study vaccine or placebo for which a
nasal or throat swab specimen yielded influenza virus A and/
or B in cell culture. The virus isolate was classified as matching
the vaccine A and/or B strains on the basis of its reaction with
influenza strain–typing reagents (see the section on laboratory
assays below).
ILI (a secondary end point and the trigger to collect a specimen for influenza virus detection) was defined as at least 1
systemic symptom (fever [oral temperature, 37.8C] and/or
myalgia) and at least 1 respiratory symptom (cough and/or
sore throat). An ILI episode was defined as the period from
the first day of ILI symptoms to the last day of ILI symptoms.
A new episode was considered to have occurred only after the
complete resolution of the previous one.
Surveillance and follow-up. From the day of vaccination,
all subjects were instructed to report any ILI symptoms to the
investigator (passive surveillance for ILI). Active surveillance
(biweekly phone contact) for ILI was conducted from 2 weeks
after vaccination to the beginning of May 2007.
For each case of suspected ILI, a nasal and throat swab specimen (composed of a swab of both nasal sinuses and a second
swab of the throat) was collected for culture (as much as possible on the same day as the ILI report and, at the latest, 5 days
after the ILI onset). Each subject was provided with a calibrated
thermometer to measure temperature and a diary card to record
temperatures and symptoms during the ILI episode.
Laboratory assays. The nasal and throat specimens were
stored at 70C and transferred to Quest Diagnostic Clinical
Trials Laboratory (Heston, Middlesex, UK) for conventional
influenza virus culture in Madin Darby Canine Kidney and
Rhesus Monkey Kidney cells. Cultures were determined to be
positive for influenza virus on the basis of cytopathic effect,
and identification as either influenza A or influenza B was based
on immunofluorescence staining. Frozen aliquots of culture
supernatants from positive viral cultures were sent to J.
Treanor’s laboratory (University of Rochester Vaccine Evaluation Unit Influenza Serology Laboratory, Rochester, New York)
for identification of virus-matching isolates by conventional
hemagglutination-inhibition testing (using H1 and H3 antisera
from the CDC and B/Malaysia antiserum from the WHO).
Serum samples were stored at 20C until blinded analyses
were conducted at GSK Biologicals in Dresden, Germany. All
samples were tested in a validated microtiter hemagglutinationinhibition test using chicken erythrocytes, with the 3 virus
strains present in the TIV used as antigens, as described elsewhere [5].

Statistical analysis. On the basis of an attack rate of 2%
in the placebo group for culture-confirmed influenza (type A
and/or B) cases for strains antigenically matched to the vaccine
(primary end point), it was estimated that a total of 77 cases
(7218 total evaluable subjects) were needed to demonstrate with
at least 90% power that the lower limit of the 95% confidence
interval (CI) for the vaccine efficacy (VE) was 135%, assuming
a VE of 70% with (1-sided). a p 0.025
VE against the primary and secondary end points was estimated as 1 minus the relative risk of the event of interest
among the TIV group versus the placebo group. The 95% CIs
for VE were calculated using a conditional exact method. The
attack rates in each treatment group were compared using the
Fisher exact test.
The primary analysis of VE was performed in the intentionto-treat (total vaccinated) cohort for efficacy over the whole
study period. Efficacy against ILI was also assessed in the perprotocol cohort for efficacy in the influenza season (Figure 2A).
The influenza season was defined on a country-by-country basis
as the period beginning on the Monday of the first week with
2 culture-confirmed influenza cases reported in the study and
ending on the Sunday of the week with the last culture-confirmed case reported in the study.

sons before enrollment. Most subjects (98%) were followed up
until the end of the influenza season.
Overview of influenza cases. During surveillance (September 2006 to May 2007), ILI was reported by 1052 of 7652
subjects. Some subjects had 11 episode of ILI, and the total
number of ILI episodes was 1205. As illustrated in Figure 2A,
the number of ILI episodes peaked in February 2007. Nasal
and throat specimens were collected for 1151 (95.6%) of the
ILI episodes. There were 145 subjects with ILI who had cultureconfirmed influenza A and/or B; of these, 123 subjects had
disease due to strains antigenically matched to the vaccine. The
majority (195%) of culture-confirmed cases occurred between
January and March 2007 (Figure 2B). As shown in Table 1,
most culture-confirmed cases (95%) in both groups were identified as H3N2 influenza A. Most cases (84.8%) were typed as
antigenically matched to the vaccine’s influenza A/Wisconsin/
67/2005(H3N2) strain. Only 1 case of H1 influenza A was identified, but it was not antigenically matched to the vaccine’s A/
New Caledonia/20/99(H1N1) strain. There were 3 cases of influenza B in each group, which were all from the Yamagata lineage
[8] and therefore not antigenically matched to the vaccine’s B/
Malaysia/2506/2004 strain from the Victoria lineage [8].
Approximately 50% of the culture-confirmed cases in both
groups and 28.8% (TIV) and 36.4% (placebo) of ILI episodes
presented with a combination of all 4 ILI symptoms (fever,
myalgia, cough, and sore throat). The presence of at least fever
in culture-confirmed influenza cases (TIV, 90.5%; placebo,
92.7%) tended to be more common than in ILI episodes (TIV,
66.5%; placebo, 72.5%). The presence of at least cough in culture-confirmed cases (TIV, 96.8%; placebo, 96.3%) also tended
to be more common than in ILI episodes (TIV, 79.9%; placebo,
84.3%).
The majority of nasal and throat specimens were collected
by day 2 after ILI onset (Figure 3), with a mean time period
of 1.7 days after ILI onset in both groups.
Efficacy. The primary objective of the study was met because statistically significant VE for TIV (66.9%; ) was P ! .001
demonstrated against culture-confirmed influenza A and/or B
due to strains antigenically matched to the vaccine, with a lower
CI limit (51.9%) 135% (Table 2). The estimates of VE were
consistent for the 2 lots of TIV administered (Table 2). Statistically significant VE was also demonstrated against cultureconfirmed influenza A and/or B due to any influenza strain
(61.6%; ) (Table 2), although there were only a limited P ! .001
number of cases attributable to drift strains detected. Statistically significant efficacy was demonstrated against ILI in both
the intention-to-treat cohort (17.9%; ) and specifically P ! .001
during the influenza season in the per-protocol cohort for efficacy (25.6%; ). In contrast to culture-confirmed in- P ! .001
fluenza, the estimates of efficacy against ILI tended to increase
for those cases in which fever was present with or without
myalgia (27.1% and 38.3%, respectively; ). No evidence P ! .001
of efficacy against ILI was found before the start of the influenza
season (3.9%; ). P p 0.688
We performed a preliminary assessment of the effect of vaccination in older subjects aged 50–64 years. The majority of
influenza cases occurred in the !50-year-old group (who made
up ∼70% of the study population), for whom the attack rate
in the placebo group was 3.6%, whereas for those aged 50–64
years the attack rate in the placebo group was 1.1%. Although
there were too few cases in the 50–64-year-old group to calculate VE by standard statistical methods, a trend toward a
lower VE was observed.

strong antibody response (as assessed by hemagglutination-inhibition assay) against all 3 vaccine strains. The responses exceeded the acceptability criteria of both the Center for Biologics
Evaluation and Research (CBER) [9] and the Committee for
Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) [10].
DISCUSSION
Our study demonstrates that, among adults 18–64 years of age,
the TIV evaluated is efficacious against culture-confirmed influenza A and/or B, as well as against clinical cases of ILI. The
TIV that was evaluated elicited a strong humoral immune response that exceeded both CBER and CHMP acceptability criteria [9, 10]. However, the possible relationship between a postvaccination hemagglutination-inhibition antibody level and
protection from disease could not be deduced by this study
because postvaccination blood specimens were collected from
only a subset of participants.
Despite publication of a large number of studies of the effectiveness or efficacy of influenza vaccines, the evidence supporting the clinical benefit of a number of marketed TIVs is
limited, because many studies were either nonrandomized
(chiefly cohort studies) and/or conducted among a small number of volunteers [11]. Moreover, clinical diagnosis of influenza
is known to be of low specificity and hence does not offer an
accurate means to estimate a vaccine’s protective efficacy; laboratory confirmation by detection of virus is essential to overcome nonspecificity and ascertainment bias [12–16].
Our study was designed to overcome these design limitations:
it was a placebo-controlled and randomized study with influenza cases confirmed by virus culture. To allow generalization

of results from season to season, all virus isolates were typed
as matching the vaccine strain or not. We used passive and
active surveillance (biweekly contact) to detect ILI cases, and
because 98% of the subjects remained in follow-up from vaccination until the end of the influenza season, the conditions
for case capture were optimal. For the majority of ILI episodes,
the nasal and throat swab specimen was collected by day 2 after
onset. Timely collection of specimens is important because viral
shedding peaks during the first 24–72 h of illness [17]
Although the culture-confirmed placebo attack rate (3.2%)
in this study was higher than that in our previous study [6],
it was still at the lower end of the range (1.4%–16%) published
for placebo groups in other randomized studies of healthy
adults with laboratory-confirmed end points found in the
Cochrane database [18].
The importance of factoring low attack rates into the study
design has been illustrated by 2 studies of inactivated vaccine
conducted over 2 consecutive influenza seasons. In an adult
population aged 18–48 years in Michigan, VE for inactivated
influenza vaccine against culture-confirmed influenza was estimated to be 77% (95% CI, 37%– 92%) in the first season
when the placebo attack rate was 5.8% but only 23% (95% CI,
153% to 73%) in the following season, when the attack rate
was 1.8% [18, 19]. In the first season of a study conducted
among children in Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, when the attack
rate for culture-confirmed influenza was 15.9% in the placebo
group, VE was estimated to be 65% [95% CI, 4%–82%],
whereas in the second season, when the attack rate was 3.3%,
VE was negative [21]. Despite the relatively low attack rate in
our study, we demonstrated statistically significant ( ) P ! .001
VE for the TIV evaluated against culture-confirmed influenza
for antigenically matched strains in the vaccine (66.9% [95%
CI, 51.9%–77.4%]) and any strain (61.6% [95% CI, 46.0%–
72.8%]).
Apart from the studies described above [19, 20, 21], viral
culture as the sole method for laboratory confirmation of cases
has rarely been used as an efficacy end point for inactivated
influenza vaccines. Most studies have used laboratory confirmation by serological analysis or a mixture of serological testing
and culture. Serological analysis of acute-phase and convalescent-phase serum samples can, however, be confounded by the
presence of vaccine-induced antibodies. In a recent review of
Cochrane database studies involving healthy adults with laboratory end points, Jefferson et al [18] estimated that trivalent
inactivated vaccines with content matching WHO recommendations were 80% efficacious against influenza when strain circulation was high. However, when data collected during the
1968–1969 pandemic were excluded, the estimate of 80% decreased to 73%. In the same review, the efficacy of parenteral
nonpandemic influenza vaccines against ILI was found to be
limited (16% in the best-case scenario). The clinical case definition of ILI used in the different studies was variable [18].
Our analysis of clinical symptoms in ILI and culture-confirmed
cases indicated that fever and cough were the most pathognomonic symptoms for culture-confirmed influenza disease.
The importance of fever as a positive predictor of influenza
has also been reported by others [14, 15, 22]. We also observed
that TIV tended to be more effective against ILI cases when
fever was present (38.3% [95% CI, 25.8%–48.5%] during the
influenza season) than against cases with fever OR myalgia
(25.6% [95% CI, 12.8%–36.4%]). This illustrates further the
potential bias of comparing VE data across studies when different case definitions were used.
Because this study was conducted using a wider age range
(18–64 years) than other studies (which often just choose subjects up to 49 years of age), we attempted to assess the effect
of vaccination in older subjects aged 50–64 years. Unfortunately, there were too few cases in this age group to draw
conclusions on VE. Indeed, the attack rate for culture-confirmed influenza was much lower than that among those aged
!50 years. The reason for the lower attack rate in the older
population is not clear, but factors that may be responsible
include lower exposure to disease, different susceptibility to
disease, or lower sensibility of the culture method in older
subjects.
In conclusion, this study of healthy adults aged 18–64 years
has shown that TIV, evaluated during a season (2006–2007) in
which H3N2 viruses well matched to the vaccine strain predominated, was efficacious and offered clinical benefit that
greatly exceeded risk.
