Objective: To determine whether influenza vaccination of pregnant women prevents visits for respiratory
illness in their infants born during the influenza season.
Design: Retrospective matched cohort study.
Setting: Four managed care organizations in the United
States.
Patients: A total of 41 129 infants (3160 and 37 969 born
to vaccinated and unvaccinated mothers, respectively)
born between 1995 and 2001.
Main Exposure: Maternal influenza vaccination. Infants were considered exposed if their gestational age at
birth was at least 30 weeks, if the time from maternal vaccination to birth was at least 28 days, and if they were
exposed to at least 14 days of the influenza season.
Main Outcome Measures: Incidence of acute respiratory illnesses (outpatient, emergency department, and
inpatient settings combined) and incident rate ratios
(IRRs) for infants exposed and unexposed to maternal
vaccination during the following 4 periods: peak influenza, respiratory syncytial virus predominant, periseasonal, and summer weeks. The time to the first acute respiratory illness during peak influenza weeks was also
assessed.
Results: During the peak influenza weeks, infant visit
rates were 15.4 and 17.1 per 100 person-months for exposed and unexposed infants, respectively (IRR, 0.90; 95%
confidence interval, 0.80-1.02). Adjusted IRRs for the 4
periods found a protective effect of infant female sex,
whereas Medicaid status and maternal high-risk status
increased infant visit rates. Maternal influenza vaccination did not reduce visit rates during any of the 4 time
periods (IRR for peak influenza season, 0.96; 95% confidence interval, 0.86-1.07) and did not delay the onset
of first respiratory illness.
Conclusion: We were unable to demonstrate that maternal influenza vaccination reduces respiratory illness
visit rates among their infants.

BEGINNING IN 2004, THE ADvisory Committee on Immunization Practices has
recommended universal influenza vaccination of children aged 6 to 23 months.1 This recommendation was based primarily on studies
that found high hospitalization rates for
infants attributable to influenza illness,2,3
particularly for infants younger than 6
months.3 Influenza vaccination of infants younger than 6 months has not succeeded owing to the poor immunogenic
response elicited by vaccination in this age
group4,5; also, the immature immune system of neonates has posed a challenge to
the efforts of vaccinating newborns.6 Tetanus immunization of women during pregnancy has been very successful in reducing the incidence of neonatal tetanus
worldwide.7 Experts have proposed that
influenza vaccination of the mother during pregnancy could protect infants during the first few months of life through
transplacentally acquired antibodies or by
reducing exposure to a mother with influenza infection.8-10
To date, 2 small studies have explored
the effect of maternally acquired antibodies on influenza illness in infants. Puck et
al11 found a direct correlation between the
level of cord blood antibody to influenza A
and the time of culture-documented influenza A infection in 26 infants younger than
4 months: infants with high levels of antibody to influenza A had a delay in influAuthor Affiliations are listed at

enza A infection. Reuman et al12 followed up 39 families
in Houston, Tex, and found no difference in the rate of influenza virus infection between infants based on levels of
cord blood antibodies to influenza A (H1N1). The onset
of illness from the beginning of the influenza season was
significantly later for infants with high antibody levels in
cord blood (27.0 vs 8.2 days), and the duration of respiratory symptoms (cough and rapid breathing) was shorter.
In both of these studies, cord blood antibodies to influenza A werefrom naturally acquired infections in the mothers rather than from influenza vaccination during pregnancy. A third study by Englund et al13 assessed the effect
of maternal influenza vaccination on infant cord blood antibodies to influenza virus and found significantly increased levels of IgG specific to influenza virus in the cord
blood of infants born to vaccinated mothers compared with
those born to unvaccinated mothers.
We undertook this study to determine whether infants born to mothers who received influenza vaccination during their pregnancy had lower incidence rates of
medically attended acute respiratory illnesses (MAARIs)
(combined outpatient, inpatient, and emergency department settings) during peak influenza weeks compared with
infants born to unvaccinated mothers. A study performed in 2003 at Northern California Kaiser Permanente that assessed the effectiveness and safety of the influenza vaccine among pregnant women and their infants
found no impact of the mother’s vaccination on the rates
of infant health care visits during the influenza season.14
Our current study expands on this work by using viral surveillance data to define peak influenza weeks, by requiring 4 weeks from vaccination to birth to ensure maternal
antibody transfer, and by measuring incidence of acute respiratory illness across 4 periods (peak influenza, respiratory syncytial virus [RSV]–predominant, periseasonal, and
summer weeks). We hypothesized that the incidence rate
ratio (IRR) would be less than 1 (ie, protective) during peak
influenza weeks, whereas the IRRs during the RSVpredominant and summer weeks would equal 1 (ie, no protective effect). Our secondary objectives were to determine whether infants born during the peak influenza weeks
to vaccinated mothers had a delay in their first acute respiratory illness compared with infants born to unvaccinated mothers and to determine whether the proportion
of infants with severe MAARIs (eg, pneumonia and hospitalization) differed between these 2 groups.
METHODS
STUDY POPULATION
Infants who were born before or during the influenza season at
4 managed care organizations (MCOs) (Kaiser Permanente Colorado, Denver; Kaiser Permanente Northern California, Oakland; Kaiser Permanente Northwest, Portland, Ore; and Group
Health Cooperative, Seattle, Wash) between October 1, 1995,
and September 30, 2001, were eligiblefor studyinclusion.Motherinfant pairs were included in the final study population if (1)
the mothers were aged 18 to 45 years and enrolled in the MCO
for longer than 1 year; (2) the infants’ gestational age was at least
30 weeks at birth; (3) the infants were continuous MCO members for at least 14 days during the influenza season; and (4) the
infants had a least 1 outpatient visit during the first 3 months of
life. To ensure adequate maternal transfer of IgG, an infant was
considered exposed if the mother was vaccinated against influenza during the pregnancy and there were at least 28 days from
the vaccination date of the mother to the birth date of the infant.15 Infants of mothers vaccinated within 27 days of birth were
excluded from the primary analysis. Infants born during the influenza season began contributing person-time on the day after
their birth hospitalization discharge; if the date of discharge from
the birth hospitalization was unavailable, person-time began after the first outpatient visit.
In comparing acute respiratory illness rates between exposed and unexposed infants, important potential confounders include age, MCO site, and season. Unexposed infants were
therefore matched by birth week and MCO to exposed infants, and thus also matched for influenza season.
HEALTH SERVICES DATA
We used data sets created for the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD)
Study to perform all analyses. The VSD is a large, linked database project that is funded by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC).16 Member enrollment dates, vaccination histories, and inpatient, outpatient, and emergency department visits are included in these data sets. During the study period (1995-
2001), a specific MCO site would contribute data only for those
years in which reliable data were available. For example, outpatient data were available from Kaiser Permanente Northwest from
1997 through 2001. The study was approved by the institutional review boards at each of the 4 MCOs and the CDC.
Comorbid conditions in the mother were defined by the codes
from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision
(ICD-9) assigned to medical encounters in the year before delivery. Mothers were considered at high risk for complications
of influenza if, in the year before delivery, they had an ICD-9
diagnosis code for a high-risk condition (cardiac, pulmonary,
renal, or hematologic disease; diabetes or metabolic disorders;
neoplasm or immunodeficiencies; or hepatic or neurological
disorders1
). A total of 1617 ICD-9 codes across the 10 conditions were used; this list was developed for a CDC-sponsored
study of the impact of influenza on adult health care services
utilization (available from the authors on request). In addition to high-risk status, other maternal variables used in the
analyses include influenza vaccination status (current and preceding season), age, high-risk status, and Medicaid insurance
coverage. Other variables used include infant gestational age
at birth, MCO site, and influenza season.
Influenza illness in young children is not often coded as influenza, per se, but as a number of illnesses that can be caused
by the influenza virus (eg, upper respiratory infection, febrile
illness, sepsis, and pneumonia). A visit was defined as a MAARI
if any of the following ICD-9 codes were used: 460, 462, 463,
464.0, 464.10, 464.11, 464.20, 464.21, 464.4, 465.0, 465.8,
465.9, 478.9, 487.1, 487.8, 490, 078.89, 079.99, or 786.2 for
viral or upper respiratory infection; 466, 480.8, 480.9, 481.0,
482.2, 482.3, 482.4, 482.41, 482.49, 484.0, 484.1, 485, 486,
487.0, or 511.9 for lower respiratory infection or pneumonia;
038 for sepsis; 780.31 or 779.0 for febrile seizure; or 780.6 for
fever. To maximize power, we combined outpatient, emergency department, and inpatient visits for acute respiratory illnesses in the primary analysis.
VIRAL SURVEILLANCE DATA
AND STUDY PERIODS
For each influenza season, peak influenza and RSVpredominant weeks were defined using viral surveillance data

from each of the MCO sites. Influenza surveillance data for each
MCO’s area were provided by the CDC and were collected as
part of the World Health Organization Influenza Surveillance
system.17 Annual RSV data were collected by the National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System at the Respiratory Enteric Viruses Branch of the CDC.18 Laboratories participating in these 2 national surveillance systems are in state
or local health departments, universities, and hospitals. Because the surveillance data for the Portland area were unreliable for the 1999-2001 influenza seasons, we used the Northern California Kaiser Permanente laboratory viral surveillance
data to define the peak influenza and RSV-predominant seasons in the Portland area. The 1997-1999 influenza surveillance data for Northern California Kaiser Permanente have a
sensitivity of 69% and a specificity of 97% in matching peak
influenza weeks to the 1997-1999 influenza surveillance data
for Kaiser Permanente Northwest.
For this study, we defined 4 seasonal study periods:
1. Peak influenza weeks as any week from October 1 to April
30 in which influenza accounted for at least 5% of the season’s
total number of influenza virus isolates. Other viruses such as
RSV could have been circulating during these weeks.
2. RSV-predominant weeks as any week from October 1 to
April 30 in which RSV accounted for at least 5% of the season’s total number of RSV virus isolates and influenza accounted for less than 5% of the season’s total influenza virus
isolates.
3. Periseasonal weeks as any week from October 1 to April
30 in which each week accounted for less than 3% of total RSV
isolates and less than 3% of influenza virus isolates.
4. Summer weeks as the period each year from July 1 to September 30.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
OF THE STUDY HYPOTHESES
The primary hypothesis of this study was that the incidence of
MAARI visits during peak influenza weeks would be lower for
infants born to mothers vaccinated against influenza compared with infants born to unvaccinated mothers and that the
MAARI incidence rates during the RSV-predominant and summer weeks would be equal between the exposed and unexposed groups. We estimated a priori that there would be 4500
exposed and 40 000 unexposed infants in the VSD cohort based
on an observed 2% annual maternal influenza vaccination rate
at Kaiser Permanente Colorado and on the pregnancy rate across
the MCOs. We assessed the power of this sample size by 2 methods. First, we determined our ability to see a reduction of a rare
event, pneumonia, among exposed infants. Given a background incidence of 2.4 per 100 person-months, we would have
80% power to see a 20% reduction in the incidence of visits
for pneumonia. Second, we determined that 1900 exposed infants during the peak influenza weeks would be needed to detect a 20% reduction in febrile illness, a common event, based
on an assumed risk of 0.11 for developing this diagnosis during an 8-week period (estimate based on Kaiser Permanente
Colorado data). Planned secondary analyses included the time
to first illness, limited to infants born during the peak influenza weeks, and the severity of MAARI, assessed by comparing the proportion of MAARI coded as upper respiratory infection, pneumonia, and hospitalization.
Bivariate comparisons between exposed and unexposed infants were evaluated with the 2-tailed, unpaired t(or if not normally distributed, Wilcoxon signed rank) and 2 tests for continuous and discrete variables, respectively. We calculated crude
IRRs of exposed to unexposed infants during the 4 study periods for MAARI outcomes in all settings while ignoring matching by MCO site and infant birth week. We generated adjusted
IRRs by Poisson regression, accounting for the matching by MCO
site and infant birth week while controlling for other covariates. We obtained coefficients and their standard errors using
generalized estimating equations that take into account the dependence of the data introduced by matching.19 Cox proportional hazards regression modeling was also performed to evaluate the time to the first MAARI outcome between exposed and
unexposed infants while controlling for other covariates. For
all regression models, customary residual and influential statistics were examined to assess model fit and to evaluate influential outliers. All analyses were conducted using commercially available software (SAS version 8.2; SAS Institute Inc, Cary,
NC).
RESULTS
Before matching, a total of 54 385 women meeting all other
inclusion criteria gave birth at the 4 MCOs between October 1 and April 30 of the included study years (1995-
2001). The proportion of mothers vaccinated against influenza during a given season ranged from 0.7% to 20.8%
across the 4 MCOs. Diagnoses for a condition that increased maternal risk for a complication from influenza
infection were present in 11.5% of mothers (range across
MCOs, 9.2%-12%); almost two thirds of these were for
a pulmonary condition (primarily asthma). Combined
data were available from 21 site-specific influenza seasons (6 seasons from 2 sites; 5 seasons from the third site,
and 4 seasons from the fourth site). There were 124 peak
influenza weeks, 97 RSV-predominant weeks, 310 periseasonal weeks, and 336 summer weeks among the 4 MCOs.
Only 1 of the influenza seasons (1997-1998) had a notable mismatch between circulating influenza strains and
the strains used in the seasonal vaccine.
In all, 3815 infants were born to vaccinated mothers
during the study period. The mean number of days between maternal influenza vaccination and birth of the infant was 68 (range, 1-172), and the mean gestational age
of the infant at the time of maternal vaccination was 29.4
(range, 9.8-41.6) weeks. Six hundred fifty-five infants were
exposed less than 28 days in utero and were excluded.
A total of 37 969 infants born to unvaccinated mothers
were matched by birth week and MCO to the 3160 infants exposed at least 28 days in utero, yielding 41 129
infants in the matched cohort (Figure).
Table 1 compares exposed and unexposed mothers
and infants across study variables. Vaccinated mothers
were more likely to have a high-risk condition than were
unvaccinated mothers (P.001). The mean age of the exposed infants at the end of the influenza season was 65
(range, 14-177) days; of unexposed infants, 75 (range,
14-180) days. There were no meaningful differences in
gestational age or birth weight between the groups. Hospital discharge dates were present in 98.4% of infants.
Table 2 lists the crude incidence rates for acute respiratory illnesses across the 4 study periods in exposed
and unexposed populations matched by infant age, MCO
site, and influenza season. The IRRs across the 4 study
periods were all similar: 0.90 (95% confidence interval
[CI], 0.80-1.02) for the peak influenza weeks; 0.93 (95%
CI, 0.84-1.02) for the RSV-predominant weeks; 1.12 (95%

CI, 0.94-1.34) for the periseasonal weeks; and 1.04 (95%
CI, 0.99-1.10) for the summer weeks. The MAARI incidence during the summer weeks, when the mean age of
the exposed infants was 210 days, was similar to the
MAARI incidence during the peak influenza weeks, when
the mean age of the infants was 65 days.
Models using generalized estimating equations included the following independent variables: maternal
vaccination status, infant gestational age at birth, infant
sex, maternal age, Medicaid coverage, maternal history
of prior influenza vaccination, and maternal high-risk
status. Exposed infants were matched to unexposed infants by MCO site and birth week. Female sex was significantly associated with reduced infant MAARI incidence, whereas maternal high-risk status and infant
Medicaid coverage were significantly associated with
increased MAARI incidence (Table 3). Maternal influenza vaccination did not reduce MAARI incidence: the
adjusted IRRs (95% CIs) for the peak influenza, RSVpredominant, periseasonal, and summer periods were
0.96 (0.86-1.07), 0.95 (0.84-1.06), 1.12 (0.91-1.37),
and 1.04 (0.98-1.10), respectively.
For infants born during the peak influenza weeks, the
mean time in days from birth to the first MAARI did not
vary by exposure status: exposed and unexposed infants’ mean times to first acute respiratory illness were
49 and 53 days, respectively (P=.84). A Cox proportional hazards model comparing the time to the first

MAARI between exposed and unexposed infants born during the peak influenza weeks, controlling for maternal
risk status, maternal age, gestational age, MCO site, and
season, found no difference between exposed and unexposed infants (hazard ratio, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.83-1.25).
During peak influenza weeks, of all acute respiratory
illnesses experienced by exposed infants, 59 (89.4%) were
an upper respiratory infection, 4 (6.1%) were pneumonia, and 3 (4.5%) were hospitalizations. Similarly, in 851
(92.9%), 39 (4.3%), and 26 (2.8%) of the unexposed infants, acute respiratory illnesses were upper respiratory
infections, pneumonia, and hospitalizations, respectively. The proportions between exposed and unexposed infants were not statistically significant (P=.32).
COMMENT
Our study found no reduction in the incidence rate of
MAARIs during peak influenza weeks among infants born
to mothers vaccinated against influenza during their pregnancy. This finding is consistent with the work by Black
et al14 performed at Kaiser Permanente Northern California. The presence of other circulating respiratory viruses during the peak influenza weeks could mask any
potential reduction in MAARI visits associated with maternal influenza vaccination. Similarly, we did not see any
evidence that maternal influenza vaccination delayed the
onset or reduced the severity of MAARI illness among
infants born during the peak influenza weeks. This study
was designed to maximize the possibility of seeing an effect
on infant MAARI visits of maternal influenza vaccination, and therefore the analysis was limited to infants who
had at least 28 days in utero for development and transfer of maternal antibodies, focused on peak influenza
weeks, required infants to contribute person-time during the influenza season, and used data from a large linked
database to maximize the number of study subjects. Although our study confirmed known predictors of acute
respiratory illness visits in infants (sex and Medicaid coverage), we did not see an effect of maternal vaccination
on rates of infant MAARI health care visits. Although it
may be that maternal influenza vaccination reduces the
risk of serious influenza illness among infants during their
first months of life, this does not translate to a decrease
in the number of visits to the physician’s office or hospitalizations for acute respiratory illnesses.
We overestimated the maternal vaccination rate across
our MCOs, which ranged from 0.7% to 20.8% during the
6 seasons, and thus had a smaller-than-expected number of infants exposed to maternal influenza vaccination. Because of the smaller sample size, our study is limited in its power to detect a reduced visit rate among
exposed infants. Although we did not have the power to
look at the effect of maternal vaccination on rare events
such as infant pneumonia, our power to assess our primary outcome, MAARI incidence during peak influenza weeks, was good: We had the power to detect a 15%
or greater reduction in MAARI visits (IRR, 0.85) during
the peak influenza weeks (=.80;=.05; unexposed background incidence, 17 per 100 person-months).
Although we had information on important variables
that predict infant health care services utilization (eg, sex,
gestational age, and Medicaid coverage), some variables
predicting the incidence of acute respiratory illness in infants are not available in the VSD data. These include the
number of siblings in the home, parental smoking status, breastfeeding, and attendance at day care. Glezen et
al20 studied influenza illness during the first year of life
and found that having at least 3 siblings constituted a significant risk for infant influenza infection. More data from
another database are available on the 5530 Colorado infants in this study, which suggest that there may not be
great differences between families of exposed and unexposed infants, because the numbers of first-time mothers (45% exposed vs 43% unexposed), mothers intending to breastfeed (83% exposed vs 78% unexposed), and
mothers who smoked (8.4% exposed vs 10% unexposed) are all similar.
Influenza illness in the first 6 months of life is more
likely to present as an afebrile upper respiratory infecTable 3. Adjusted IRRs for Acute Respiratory Illnesses Among Matched Infants

tion compared with the second 6 months of life. Glezen
et al20 reported that 58% of influenza illness among infants younger than 6 months were afebrile, compared with
28% among infants aged 6 to 11 months. Parents of afebrile infants with an upper respiratory infection may be
less likely to seek medical care, and these infants would
be missed in our study. Higher MAARI incidence rates
among infants aged 6 to 11 months compared with 0 to
5 months could explain our finding of similar incidence
rates of MAARIs for infants during the peak influenza
(mean age, 2½ months) and the summer weeks (mean
age, 7 months). Work by the New Vaccine Surveillance
Network Group21 confirms this lower rate of influenza
illness among infants younger than 6 months. Outpatient surveillance of all children younger than 5 years at
2 study sites, in which viral culture or reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction testing for influenza virus was performed on nasal and throat swabs, found low
rates of influenza infection—that is, less than 10% of acute
respiratory infections occurring among infants aged 0 to
5 months during the 2002-2003 and 2003-2004 influenza seasons were due to influenza virus.21
Any study of the effect of maternal influenza vaccination on acute respiratory tract infection in infants faces
a number of challenges. A randomized placebocontrolled trial would best control for unknown imbalances in confounders; however, given the current national recommendation that all pregnant women be
vaccinated against influenza, it would be unethical to randomly assign women to vaccination or placebo. Any controlled trial allowing mothers to select vaccination could
potentially suffer from confounding. The restrictive period studied reduces the number of mother-infant pairs
available to study: the VSD files have more than 200 000
newborns during the study years, yet only 40 000 contributed to this work. The small number of peak influenza weeks during the winter months (average, 9.5 weeks
per influenza season) means that even with large numbers of children, there will be limited person-time experience for analysis. A mismatch between the circulating
strains of wild influenza virus and the strains used for
vaccine development could explain the absence of an effect
of maternal vaccination on MAARI visits. However, only
1 of the 6 seasons (1997-1998) was considered a fair rather
than a good match. Finally, influenza cohort studies are
challenged by the vagaries of the influenza season: the 2
influenza seasons after our study (2001-2002 and 2002-
2003) were both unusually mild, whereas the 2003-
2004 season was early (November to January), eliminating much opportunity for maternal influenza to protect
infants born during that season against moderate to severe influenza infection. Future work should include multiple influenza seasons, use accurate tools such as viral
culture and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction to diagnose influenza, and focus on hospitalization as the outcome of interest. Small effect sizes, such
as a reduction in hospitalization of 10% to 30%, will require large numbers of subjects to detect. Although this
vaccination did not appear to have an effect on the rates
of infant health care visits, vaccination is still important
and is primarily recommended to protect the health of
the mother.

When Is the Right Time for Toilet Training?
Only a child can decide when the time for toilet training has come. Any pressure parents may feel from grandparents, nursery schools, or helpful friends had better
be disregarded. It’s got to be his achievement, not theirs.
