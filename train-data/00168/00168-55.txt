Monovalent influenza A/Victoria/3/7S whole-virus vaccines prepared by Merck
Sharp and Dohme (West Point, Pa.) and Merrell-National Laboratories (Cincinnati,
Ohio) and split-virus vaccines prepared by Parke, Davis and Company (Detroit,
Mich.) and Wyeth Laboratories (Philadelphia, Pa.) containing 200, 400, and 800
chick cell-agglutinating units per dose were compared with a placebo in double-blind
trials in which 208 adults participated. Titers of hemagglutination-inhibiting antibody of ====1 :20 were found in >80% of the volunteers 21 days after vaccination. Seroconversion, defined as a fourfold or greater increase in antibody titer, occurred
more frequently among seronegative volunteers than among seropositive volunteers. The geometric mean titers obtained with the whole-virus or split-virus vaccines were not significantly different. Reaction rates had no relation to seroconversion, nor did seronegative subjects have more reactions than seropositive subjects.
Local reactions from all vaccines increased with increasing dose. Significantly more
overall reactions, "bothersome" reactions, and febrile reactions occurred in the
recipients of whole-virus vaccine. Of nine volunteers who reported temperatures
of >100 F, one had received split-virus vaccine, seven had received whole-virus vaccine, and one had received the placebo. Most systemic reactions were mild, and all
were self-limited.
Although the main thrust of the National Influenza Immunization Program was to provide influenza A/New Jersey /76 virus vaccine to the
population of the United States [1], a vaccine
against the most recent isolate causing epidemic
disease, A/Victoria/3/75, was also thought to
be necessary for high-risk groups. This strain was
responsible for an estimated 11,000 excess deaths
due to pneumonia and influenza during the
1976 influenza season [2], the highest number
since the 1968-1969 epidemic of Hong Kong influenza, and there was a substantial chance that
this strain, or a closely related variant, would
again cause disease during the winter of 1976-
1977. This study was undertaken to look at the
HAl antibody responses and the number and
types of reactions induced by different dosages

of four different experimental monovalent influenza A/Victoria/3/75 virus vaccines injected
im into healthy seronegative and seropositive
adult volunteers.
Materials and Methods
Population. Healthy adult volunteers were
recruited from the University of Maryland professional school complex located in downtown
Baltimore, Md. More than 90% of the volunteers
worked in the professional schools, and the majority were in the health science field.
Vaccines. The experimental vaccines were
provided by four U.S. manufacturers: Wyeth
Laboratories (Philadelphia, Pa.); Parke, Davis
and Company (Detroit, Mich.): Merrell-National Laboratories (Cincinnati, Ohio); and Merck
Sharp and Dohme (West Point, Pa.), The Wyeth and Parke, Davis vaccines were produced by
disruption by chemical treatment (split-virus vaccine), and the Merrell-National and Merck Sharp
and Dohme vaccines were whole-virus vaccines.
Each vaccine was provided in 200, 400, and 800
chick cell-agglutinating (CCA) units of antigen/

0.5 ml in coded vials. The vaccines were tested
for purity and CCA content by the Bureau of
Biologics (Food and Drug Administration, Bethesda, Md.) as described elsewhere in this supplement [3]. A placebo preparation consisting
of a buffered saline diluent was also provided in
coded vials.
Serologic studies. Serum samples were obtained before and 21 days after vaccination. Serum was immediately separated, stored at -20 C,
and sent to the Center for Disease Control (Atlanta, Ga.) to be tested for HAl antibody as described elsewhere in this supplement [3a]. Serum was also drawn from a small group of volunteers five months after vaccination.
Procedure. The vaccines were administered
in a placebo-controlled, double-blind fashion,
and reactions were recorded on a standardized
sheet.
Each volunteer was given a detailed explanation of the protocol and was told about possible
adverse reactions to the vaccine. Witnessed and
informed written consent was then obtained. If
oral temperature was normal, a blood sample
was taken, and the volunteer was given 0.5 ml of
fluid im from one of the coded vials. Volunteers
were then provided with thermometers to take
8485
their own temperatures at 8 hr after inoculation.
At 24 and 48 hr, subjects were seen and questioned for reactions, and the inoculation site was
examined. All volunteers returned at 21 days,
blood samples were taken, and subjects were
again questioned about any reactions that had
occurred during the 21-day period. All volunteers
who did not have a reciprocal titer of HAl antibody of >20 on day 21 were inoculated again at a
later date.
A systemic reaction was counted as any symptom described by the patient that was not directly
at the inoculation site and had occurred within
48 hr after vaccination. The reaction was called
"bothersome" if the subject rated the local reaction greater than I+ out of a possible 0 to 3+
or reported any systemic reaction. Any oral temperature of~100 F was considered a febrile response.
The reaction index of each vaccine was calculated as the sum of 0 to 3+ responses for each
systemic symptom and 1+ for each degree of
fever above 99.9 F divided by the number of recipients of each vaccine.
Statistics. Reaction rates were compared by
X2 analysis, and geometric mean titers (GMT)
were compared by Student's r-test.

Results
Two hundred ten volunteers enrolled in the
study. and 208 volunteers completed the study;
analysis was carried out only for" the volunteers who completed the study. The mean age for
the entire group was 28.8 years (range, 18-64
years); there were 109 males. There was random
distribution among the groups receiving vaccine
and placebo with regard to sex and age of the
subjects.
Before vaccination 54% of the entire group
had no detectable serum HAl titer at a I: 10 dilution and were considered seronegative. The
GMT of those individuals with a detectable titer
was I :20. The seronegative and seropositive volunteers were randomly distributed among all
vaccine groupS.
Immunologic response. Table I shows the
distribution of titers of HAl antibody to influenza AjVictoriaj3j75 virus 21 days after vaccination. In each group of .-16 volunteers, ~80% had
reciprocal titers of ~20, a level generally associCaplan et al.
ated with protection against the homologous
strain [4-6]. Reciprocal GMT of 8-23 before vaccination increased 2.6- to 1l.8-fold after vaccination, and 44%-81 % of each vaccine group exhibited fourfold or greater increases in titer of HAl
antibody. No differences were apparent between
vaccines, nor was their any significant increase in
GMT with increasing CCA units of the same
vaccine.
Reciprocal GMT of the seronegative and seropositive subjects in each vaccine group before
and after vaccination are shown in table 2. There
were only slight differences in GMT after vaccination, and the GMT of the subjects who were
seropositive before vaccination were not significantly higher after vaccination than the titers of
the seronegative volunteers. The Gl\;IT of the
recipients (both seropositive and seronegative) of
combined split-product vaccine and the GMT of
the recipients of whole-virus vaccine were not
significantly different, but in each case the GMT
of recipients of split-product vaccines was slightly
higher. However, when the subjects without preTable 2. Serum HAl antibody responses to influenza AJVictoria/75 virus vaccines among healthy adults with

existing antibody were compared with those with
preexisting antibody, there was a marked difference in the rate of seroconversions (a fourfold or
greater increase in titer) that occurred in the 21-
day period after vaccination. This difference was
significant in the split-virus vaccine recipients
(P =0.001) as well as in the recipients of the
whole-virus vaccine (P =0.0001). Thus, the vaccine only increased the titer slightly in subjects
seropositive before vaccination, but when no titer was present before vaccination, a significant
increase in titer could be found with all the vaccines.
Duration of HAl titer. Blood samples were
taken from 30 of the original volunteers five
months after vaccination as part of another study.
Seventeen had received one of the split-product
vaccines, and 13 had received one of the wholevirus vaccines. At five months, all three specimens for each of the subjects were tested, and the
titers were found to be lower by approximately
one dilution than the previously obtained values. Of interest, however, was the fact that the
reciprocal GMT at five months were only slightly
S487
lower than those of the specimens taken at three
weeks. The reciprocal GMT for the split-product
vaccine recipients were 21 before vaccination,
242 at three weeks, and 166 at five months, whereas for the recipients of whole-virus vaccine, the
GMT were 21 before vaccination, 121 at three
weeks, and 116 at five months. Thus, for this
small sample at least, a substantial titer was maintained over the period studied.
Reactions. The types of reactions reported by
each of the volunteers are shown in table 3. Sixtytwo percent of the volunteers who received splitproduct vaccine had no reaction, whereas only
35% of those who received the whole-virus vaccine had no reaction, a difference that is highly
significant (P =0.0002). Volunteers who received
the whole-virus vaccine had significantly more
febrile (P =0.04) and "bothersome" reactions
(P = 0.003) than those who received the splitproduct vaccines.
The individual reactions related to each of the
vaccines are shown in table 4. Tenderness at the
injection site was reported in 37% of all vaccine
recipients, and local reactions accounted for half

of all reported reactions in both groups and almost half of the reactions in the placebo group.
The number of local reactions increased with increasing dose of each of the vaccines. The most
frequently reported systemic reactions were malaise and myalgia, which occurred in 11%' and
headache, which occurred in 12% of all volunteers. All reactions were reported about twice as
often by the recipients of the whole-virus vaccines as by those who received the split-product
vaccines.
The systemic reaction index of the combined
whole-virus vaccine groups was more than twice
that of the combined split-virus vaccine groups,
and all but the lowest dosage groups receiving
the whole-virus vaccines had systemic reaction
indexes greater than that of the placebo group.
With respect to systemic reactions, only the Merck
Sharp and Dohme whole-product vaccine showed
increasing reactivity with increasing dose. Fortyfour percent of the recipients of the Merck Sharp
and Dohme 200-CCA unit vaccine had reactions,
whereas 94% of those receiving 800 CCA units
of the Merck Sharp and Dohme vaccine reported
reactions. Five of the nine febrile responses encountered in the study occurred in the groups
receiving higher doses of the Merck Sharp and
Dohme vaccine.
There was no greater reaction rate among the
volunteers who had preexisting titers of HAl
antibody than among those without preexisting
antibody, either when the vaccine groups were
considered individually or when they were combined. There was also no difference in reactions
between persons with and those without seroconversion, a finding which suggests that the ability
to induce serologic response had nothing to do
with the reactogenic potential of the vaccines.
Unusual reactions. Only one individual
missed work after receiving the vaccine, and this
was attributed to severe nausea on the day following vaccination. Two individuals, both recipients of 200 CCA units of the Merrell-National
vaccine, developed transient rashes lasting only a
few hours. Other reactions reported included sore
throat in two subjects, sore neck in two subjects,
chills in two subjects, light-headedness in two
subjects, soft stools in one subject, indigestion
in one subject, and earache in one subject.

the 15 recipients of the buffered-saline placebo
had no reactions. One volunteer had a fever of
100 F, local pain and burning, and an upset
stomach on the night of the inoculation. Six of
the controls had local pain and tenderness, two
had malaise, one had one loose stool, and one
felt feverish with a temperature of 99.8 F. Two
of the controls complained of headaches, and
one complained of a sore neck. All reactions lasted for <24 hr.
Discussion
More than 80% of individuals receiving one of
the 12 monovalent influenza AjVictoriaj75 virus vaccines tested produced HAl titers of ~1:20,
a level shown by others [4-6] to be associated with
protection against the natural disease. All vaccines gave comparable GMT. We found no appreciable increase in the HAl titer associated
with the increasing number of CGA units. Mostow et al. [7], using whole-virus vaccine, and Ruben and Jackson [8], using split-virus vaccine,
found increasing levels of HAl antigen with vaccines containing increasing amounts of CCA
units, but at much higher levels of CCA units
than used in this study.
Seronegative individuals had significantly more
seroconversions than seropositive volunteers in
both the whole-virus and split-product vaccine
groups. Barry et al. [9] found a significant difference between rates of seroconversion in seronegative recipients of whole-virus vaccines and
those receiving tributylphosphate-treated splitproduct vaccine. However, in that study all vaccines were administered sc, and others [8] have
shown that the im route induces higher HAl
levels than the sc route with split-product vaccines.
Since most influenza vaccines are administered
in the fall and most influenza disease occurs during the winter, the protective effect of the vaccine should remain for at least a five- or six-month
period; previous studies have shown that sc injections produced antibodies that lasted at least
this length of time [9-11]. In the present study,
the GMT examined at five months had declined
very little from the level at three weeks in the
vaccinees who received either the whole- or splitproduct vaccine. That this sustained titer was
5489
due to exposure to wild influenza virus is unlikely since this persisting immunity occurred
over the summer months and no influenza activity
was recorded in the general population.
There is little doubt that the currently available influenza vaccines cause less severe reactions
than previously available vaccines [12, 13]. However, public acceptance remains poor because of
experiences with previous vaccines [I3]. We have
shown that all vaccines administered by the im
route produce few reactions sufficient to change
daily life styles. Although many reactions did occur, the vast majority were mild and transient.
Local reactions were associated with incresing
levels of CCA units in all of the vaccines tested,
a finding also reported by others [6, 14, 15]. However, whole-virus vaccines produced significantly
more overall reactions, febrile reactions, and
"bothersome" reactions.
Although it is difficult to compare reactions
that are for the most part subjective and mild,
most other studies have labeled reactions as either local or systemic, with systemic usually meaning febrile [6, 15, 16]. Systemic reaction indexes
are provided here in the interest of uniformity of
presentation in this symposium; however, we feel
that this index is misleading because of the arbitrary and empiric basis for assigning values to
symptoms. We chose to use the term "bothersome" with the implication that there was some
inconvenience to the volunteers. Thus, local reactions that were greater than 1+ out of a possible 3+ and all systemic reactions were called
"bothersome." We found that while individuals did not have febrile reactions, many had
headaches, myalgia, or malaise that, although
usually mild, did cause them some inconvenience. It is interesting to note that 40% of the recipients of the placebo complained of "bothersome" reactions, again predominantly myalgia,
malaise, and headaches. How many of the systemic reactions were due to the "ordeal" of receiving an im injection as well as to having blood
drawn can only be speculative, but this must certainly be considered in the evaluation of the
reactogenicity of parenteral vaccines in the adult
and even more so in the pediatric population.
Based solely on the ability to produce HAl
titers and low reactogenicity, our findings indicate that any of the split-virus vaccines were su-

perior to the whole-virus vaccines. Until studies
comparing the efficacy of the newer vaccines are
performed, the therapeutic index of influenza
vaccines will remain unknown.
