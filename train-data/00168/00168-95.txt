United States, 1979-1980 and 1980-1981
Lack of an Association With Influenza Vaccination

\s=b\An ongoing surveillance program was intensified during the 1979-1980
and the 1980-1981 influenza seasons to determine whether an increased risk
of acquiring Guillain-Barr\l=e'\ syndrome (GBS) within eight weeks after influenza
vaccination existed for adults in the United States who received influenza
vaccine, when compared with adults who had not been vaccinated recently.
Five hundred twenty-eight cases of GBS with onset between Sept 1 and
March 31, including seven following recent vaccination, were reported by
participating neurologists in 1979-1980; 459 cases, including 12 following
recent vaccination, were reported in 1980-1981. The relative risk of
acquiring GBS following influenza vaccination\p=m-\0.6in 1979-1980 and 1.4 in
1980-1981\p=m-\wasnot significantly different from 1.0 in either season. These
results suggest that there was no increased risk of acquiring GBS associated
with the influenza vaccines administered during these seasons and that the
causative "trigger agent" in the A/New Jersey (swine) influenza vaccine
administered in 1976 has not been present in subsequent influenza vaccine
preparations.
(JAMA 1982;248:698-700)
FOLLOWING the documentation of
an epidemiologic association between
A/New Jersey (swine) influenza vac¬
cination and the subsequent develop¬
ment of Guillain-Barré syndrome
(GBS) in 1976,1 a national GBS sur¬
veillance system was established by
the American Academy of Neurology
(AAN), the Conference of State and
Territorial Epidemiologists, and the
Centers for Disease Control (CDC).2 A
major purpose of the system was to
investigate the possible association
between GBS and influenza vaccines
administered in the United States
after 1976. To achieve this goal, sur¬
veillance was intensified during the
first influenza season (1978-1979) in
which the system was in operation.3
The results of the 1978-1979 surveil¬
lance suggested that there was no
association between GBS and the
inactivated trivalent vaccine adminis¬
tered during that season.3 This article
summarizes the results of surveil¬
lance during the following two sea¬
sons (1979-1980 and 1980-1981) with
emphasis on the relationship between
GBS and influenza vaccines adminis¬
tered during those years.
METHODS
In March 1978, members of the AAN
were invited to participate in a national
GBS surveillance system supported by the
AAN, the state and territorial epidemiol¬
ogists, and the CDC. The details con¬
cerning the system, and the methods by
which surveillance was intensified during
the influenza season, have been described
previously." Briefly, the surveillance peri¬
od during each influenza season (1979-1980
and 1980-1981), as was the case in 1978-
1979, began on Sept 1 (before the start of
the influenza vaccination campaign) and
ended on March 31 (approximately eight
weeks after essentially all influenza vac¬
cine for the season had been adminis¬
tered). Neurologists were contacted by
mail, telephone, or both, at the beginning
of each influenza season and were asked to
submit a case report form for each case of
GBS diagnosed, whether the patient had
been vaccinated before the onset of neuro¬
logical symptoms or not. The participation
of each neurologist was documented by at
least one telephone conversation during
the latter months of each influenza season
(1979-1980 and 1980-1981). On the basis of
this requirement, 1,648 neurologists par¬
ticipated in 1979-1980, and 1,557 in 1980-
1981. All case report forms completed by
the neurologists and received at CDC by
Sept 1, 1980 (1979-1980 season), and by
Aug 1, 1981 (1980-1981 season), were
included.
For purposes of our analysis, a "vacci¬
nated" case of GBS was one in which
influenza vaccine had been administered
to the patient within eight weeks before
the onset of neurological symptoms. This
period corresponds to the period of maxi¬
mum risk that followed A/New Jersey
(swine) influenza vaccination in 1976.' All
other cases of GBS that occurred during
the surveillance period were designated
"unvaccinated."
As in the 1978-1979 season, estimates of
the adult resident population in the con¬
tiguous United States as of July 1, 1979,
and July 1, 1980, were obtained from the
Bureau of the Census. The estimated num¬
bers of adults who had received influenza
vaccine between September 1979 and Jan¬
uary 1980, and between September 1980
and January 1981, were obtained from
national immunization surveys conducted
by Burke Marketing Research Inc, in 1980
and in 1981."

GBS with onset of symptoms between

reported by the 1,648 neurologists
who participated during the 1979-
1980 season. Four hundred fifty-nine
cases were reported by the 1,557 neu¬
rologists participating in 1980-1981.
The months of onset of these cases of
GBS are shown in Fig 1. Of the 985
cases (99.8% of the total) in which the
age of the patient was known, 346
(35%) occurred in persons between
the ages of 15 and 39 years, and 429
(44% )
in persons between the ages of
45 and 74 years (Fig 2). Five hundred
sixty-two cases of GBS (57%) were in
males, 425 (43% )
in females. Eightytwo percent of the patients were
white, 8% black, 4% hispanic, and 2%
American Indian, Asian, or Pacific
Islander. The percentages of patients
with the preceding age, sex, and race
characteristics were similar in both
study seasons.
Nineteen patients (seven in 1979-
1980 and 12 in 1980-1981) had received
influenza vaccine within eight weeks
before onset of neurological symp¬
toms (Figs 1 and 2). All 19 of these
cases were in adults (18 years or
older). The intervals in weeks be¬
tween vaccination and development of
GBS for these cases were scattered
over the eight-week period (Fig 3).
The investigation of the relation¬
ship between GBS and influenza vac¬
cination, as during the 1978-1979 sea¬
son,1 involved only adult (18 years or
older) cases of GBS, since practically
all influenza vaccine in the United
States is administered to persons in
this age group. Of the 528 cases of
GBS reported in 1979-1980, 437 were
in adults (seven of these were vacci¬
nated, 412 unvaccinated, and for 18
the vaccination status was unknown);
of the 459 cases reported in 1980-1981,
375 were in adults (12 were vacci¬
nated, 347 unvaccinated, and for 16
the vaccination status was unknown).
The numbers of susceptible-personweeks for vaccinated persons during
each season was calculated by multi¬
plying the adult population in the
contiguous United States minus
Maryland (which has its own GBS
surveillance system and does not par¬
ticipate in national surveillance) by
the percentage of adults who reported
having received influenza vaccine
during the respective season, by eight
(the number of weeks after vaccina¬
tion during which a vaccinée was
considered susceptible, and within
which period a case of GBS was
designated "vaccinated"). For 1979-
1980, this product was 153.6X106
X10% X8=122.9X106 susceptible-per¬
son-weeks. For 1980-1981, the product
was 158.5X106X9%X8=114.1X106 sus¬
ceptible-person-weeks. The number

vaccinated persons during each sea¬
son was found by subtracting "vac¬
cinated" susceptible-person-weeks
from the total number of susceptibleperson-weeks for the population un¬
der study during the seven-month (30
week) surveillance period. For 1979-
1980, the number of unvaccinated
susceptible-person-weeks was 153.6

COMMENT
The usefulness of the GBS surveil¬
lance system, and its limitations in
assessing the relationship between
influenza vaccination and GBS, has
been discussed previously.3 Briefly,
the system provides information
about a large number of patients with
GBS and makes possible an estima¬
tion of the relative incidence of GBS
in vaccinated and in unvaccinated
persons, although the neurologists
who participate in the system consti¬
tute only about a third of those who
might see cases of GBS in the United
States. Provided that no bias exists in
the ratio of vaccinated to unvacci¬
nated cases seen by the participating
neurologists, however (and there is no
evidence to suggest such a bias), this
sampling should not affect our rela¬
tive-risk analysis.
Our data show no statistically sig¬
nificant epidemiologic association be¬
tween GBS and influenza vaccination
in either 1979-1980 or 1980-1981. The
relative risk for acquiring GBS with¬
in eight weeks following influenza
vaccination v becoming ill at other
times during the surveillance period-0.6 in 1979-1980, and 1.4 in 1980-
1981—was not significantly different
from 1 in either season. Furthermore,
both relative-risk values were signifi¬
cantly below the relative risk (greater
than 6) that would have been
expected if attack rates had been
similar to those observed in 1976
after A/New Jersey influenza vacci¬
nation.1
Further evidence against a rela¬
tionship between GBS and influenza
vaccination during 1979-1980 and
1980-1981 is provided by the intervals
between vaccination and the onset of
GBS in "vaccinated" cases. The peak
interval
.
of two to three weeks
observed in 19761 was not apparent
for vaccinated cases of GBS in either
the 1979-1980 or the 1980-1981 season,
although three patients in 1980-1981
became ill in the second week after
vaccination (Fig 3).
As in any national surveillance sys¬
tem, we are aware that not all cases
of GBS diagnosed by participating
neurologists are reported on a case
report form. To help estimate the
proportion of vaccinated cases among
patients with GBS for which no case
report form was received at CDC, we
used our telephone contacts with neu¬
rologists to obtain basic identifying
information and vaccination history
for all adult cases of GBS in the
1980-1981 season. Although much of
this information was obtained over
the telephone from secretaries and
office personnel (rather than from
the neurologists themselves) and was
generally regarded as less reliable
than the written reports of cases
submitted to CDC, we learned of 354
probable cases of GBS in adults dur¬
ing the 1980-1981 season that were
not reported by case report form.
Four of these cases occurred in per¬
sons who had received influenza vac¬
cine within eight weeks before onset
of neurological symptoms. These re¬
sults suggest that a significant num¬
ber of cases of GBS in adults are not
reported in writing. However, the
ratio of vaccinated to total (vacci¬
nated plus unvaccinated) cases for the
cases reported by telephone (4/
354=0.011) was less than that for
cases reported by case report form
(12/359=0.033). Since the relative risk
for acquiring GBS after influenza
vaccination is proportional to the
ratio of vaccinated to total cases of
GBS, the results of our telephone
contacts with neurologists (or their
office personnel) suggest that the
relative risk that we calculated—
1.4—might actually exceed the true
relative risk of acquiring GBS follow¬
ing influenza vaccination in 1980-1981.
Since six of the vaccinated cases of
GBS in 1979-1980 and 1980-1981
occurred in persons younger than 50
years (Fig 2) and influenza vaccine is
not routinely recommended for per¬
sons in this age group, we were
concerned that younger persons
might be more likely to acquire GBS
after influenza vaccination than older
persons. Therefore, for the two sea¬
sons combined, we calculated relative
risk values separately for adults aged
18 to 49 years and for adults 50 years
or older. The results (1.0 and 0.8,
respectively) suggested no trend
toward an increased risk in either
subgroup.
Our results, coupled with those
reported by Hurwitz et al3 for the
1978-1979 season, suggest that the
epidemiologic association between
GBS and influenza vaccination docu¬
mented in 1976 was unique and that
the causative "trigger agent" in the
A/New Jersey (swine) influenza vac¬
cine has not been present in subse¬
quent vaccine preparations.
