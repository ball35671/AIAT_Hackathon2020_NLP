Abstract
Aim: No maternal mortality from pandemic (H1N1) 2009 occurred in Japan. However, the reasons for this lack
of maternal deaths remain unknown. This study was performed to investigate how many pregnant women
were infected, how many women took antiviral drugs for prophylaxis or treatment, and the rate of vaccination
effectiveness.
Material and Methods: A questionnaire study was given to 20 500 postpartum women before leaving obstetric
facilities between December 2009 and May 2010 in Hokkaido, asking about antiviral drugs, vaccination, and
infection with pandemic (H1N1) 2009.
Results: Approximately one-third (n = 7535) of women given the questionnaires responded. Of these, 268
women (3.5%) indicated that they had contracted influenza. 353 (4.7%) women took antiviral drugs for
prophylaxis after close contact with an infected person and 140 (39.7%) of 353 women finally contracted
influenza during or after prophylaxis with antiviral drugs, accounting for 52.2% (140/268) of all patients. 229
(85.4%) of 268 patients took antiviral drug for treatment and 6 (2.2%) needed hospitalization, but not mechanical ventilation or intensive care unit. 196 of 268 (73.1%) patients were already infected before the availability of
a vaccine. Among 7328 candidates for vaccination, 4921 (67.2%) were vaccinated. Infection occurred in 0.22%
(11/4921) and 2.1% (50/2407) of vaccinated and non-vaccinated women, respectively.
Conclusion: Frequent use of antiviral drugs for prophylaxis and treatment may partially explain the low
infection rate and no maternal mortality from pandemic (H1N1) 2009 in Japan. Vaccination reduced infection
by 89% in pregnant Japanese women.
Key words: H1N1, influenza, Japan, pandemic, pregnancy.
Introduction
The novel pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza virus was
identified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of the USA on 21 April 2009.1 This
caused an outbreak of a febrile respiratory infection
that began in Mexico and spread rapidly worldwide,
and a pandemic was declared by the World Health
Organization on 11 June 2009.2 The first case in Japan
was confirmed in May 2009, and the outbreak spread
rapidly as seen in other countries3 with the first case in
Hokkaido confirmed in early June 2009. The Japanese
Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (JMHLW)
requested all prefectures to report the numbers of

patients admitted to hospital for treatment of flu,
details of patients with serious clinical conditions, and
details of patients who died from flu during the period
from June 2009 to June 2010. They began to release
these data weekly on their website at the beginning of
July 2009.
The Japan Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology
(JSOG) aggressively intensified outreach to pregnant
women, policy-makers and medical workers, including
medical doctors, midwives and nurses, to minimize the
number of cases of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 infection
among pregnant women, especially after online publication of the Lancet article at the end of July4 in which the
CDC suggested that pregnant women were especially
prone to developing severe disease on infection with
pandemic H1N1 virus. For example, JSOG recommended prompt use of antiviral drugs for treatment of
pregnant women on 8 May on their website, and an
early visit to the general practitioner when febrile on 16
June, active use of antiviral drugs for prophylaxis after
close contact with an infected person on 4 August, and
vaccination against pandemic (H1N1) 2009 on 7 September. The number of accesses to the JSOG website
increased from 106 760 in January 2009 to 193 705 in
October 2009.
Although data collected by the JMHLW included the
numbers of pregnant patients who required hospitalization, it was not clear how many pregnant women contracted flu, how many women took antiviral drugs for
prophylaxis or treatment, and how effective vaccination
for pandemic (H1N1) 2009 had been. Accordingly, we
designed this questionnaire study in November 2009 to
estimate these figures. No maternal deaths from pandemic (H1N1) 2009 have yet been reported to the
JMHLW as of 22 July 2010. The reasons for this lack of
maternal deaths in Japan are discussed based on the
results of our study together with information released
by the JMHLW.
Material and Methods
In Japan, women usually stay at obstetric facilities for 4
to 8 days after giving birth. We conducted an anonymous questionnaire study among postpartum women
before leaving obstetric facilities. In November 2009, we
requested all 121 obstetrical facilities in Hokkaido to
deliver a questionnaire form (Table 1) to all postpartum
women who gave birth between 1 December 2009 and
31 May 2010 during their stay at obstetric facilities. The
questionnaire consisted of 12 questions, as shown in
Table 1. Hokkaido is the northernmost and the second
largest island of Japan, with an area of ~78 417 km2
,
equivalent to that of Austria, a population of approximately 5.5 million and a birth rate of 41 000 births annually, accounting for 4.3% of the total population of 127
million and 3.7% of the 1.1 million births annually in
Japan.
This study was conducted after receiving approval
by the Institutional Review Board of Hokkaido University Hospital for Clinical Research and/or Ethics Committee of each obstetric facility.
All data are presented as means  SD. For statistical
analysis of categorical data, c2 or Fisher’s exact test was
applied. In all analyses, P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The statistical software package StatView 5.0 for Macintosh (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA)
was used for all data analyses.
Results
A total of 7535 postpartum women participated in the
study by completing the questionnaire form (Table 2).
As there were approximately 20 500 births during the
study period in Hokkaido, approximately one-third of
women responded to the survey. Of the 7535 women,
268 (3.5%) reported that they had contracted flu
during their pregnancy. Of the 268 patients who contracted flu during the period from June 2009 to May
2010, 196 (73.1%) were already infected by the end of
November 2009. Vaccination for pandemic (H1N1)
2009 became available in mid-November in Japan
(Fig. 1a,b). Six of 268 (2.2%) patients reported that they
required hospitalization on September in two, October
in two and November in two, but not treatment at an
intensive care unit (ICU) or mechanical ventilation.
None of the women experienced encephalopathy or
stillbirth.
There were no significant differences in the distributions of maternal age or birthweight of infants between
the 268 infected and 7267 non-infected women
(Table 2). In the infected group, three infants with birthweights of less than 1500 g were born 6 months,
3 months, and an unknown period after infection in one
case each, suggesting that influenza did not significantly increase the rate of preterm delivery in
Hokkaido.
The outbreak of influenza occurred earlier in Hokkaido than in other areas of Japan (Fig. 1). The number
of pregnant patients in Hokkaido peaked in October
and November (Fig. 1a), while the number of pregnant
patients who required hospitalization in the whole of
Japan peaked in January 2010 (Fig. 1c).

4921 (67.2%) and 2482 (32.9%) women in this study
population reported that they had been vaccinated for
pandemic (H1N1) 2009 and seasonal flu, respectively
(Table 2). 89.1% (2212) of 2482 women with vaccination
for seasonal flu were vaccinated for pandemic (H1N1)
2009. Vaccination for pandemic H1N1 virus became
available in mid-November 2009 in Japan. 196 of 268
(73.1%) women had already contracted flu before the
availability of the vaccine for pandemic (H1N1) 2009
(Fig. 1b). After excluding 196 women who had already
been infected before December 2009 and 11 women
with unknown month of infection, 7328 of the 7535
respondents were candidates for vaccination. Of these
women, 4921 (67.2%) were vaccinated (Table 3) and
4652 (63.5%) were vaccinated by the end of 2009
(Fig. 1b). A further 50 of 2407 (2.08%) pregnant women
without vaccination contracted flu, while 11 of 4921
(0.224%) women with vaccination did so after December 2009 in Hokkaido (Table 3).
Women in the second or third trimester were more
likely to contract flu compared to those in the first
trimester; among 247 women with known trimester of
pregnancy when infection occurred, 120 (48.6%) and 99
(40.1%) women contracted flu during the second and

third trimester, respectively, while 28 (11.3%) women
did so during the first trimester (Table 2).
A total of 353 (4.7%) women responded that they
took antiviral drugs, such as oseltamivir and zanamivir
for prophylaxis after coming into close contact with an
infected person, and 140 (39.7%) of these 353 women
finally contracted flu, accounting for 52.2% (140/268) of
all patients (Table 2). Thus, those who took antiviral
drugs for prophylaxis after coming into close contact
with an infected person were apparently likely to contract flu than those who did not take antiviral drugs
(39.7% [140/353] vs 1.8% [128/7182]). Four (66.7%) of
six patients who needed hospitalization and 106
(54.1%) of 196 women who contracted flu before the
availability of vaccination responded that they had
taken antiviral drugs for prophylaxis. 229 (85.4%) of

infants was significantly higher among infected than
non-infected women (Table 2), the incidence rate of
malformed infants among 28 women who contracted
flu during the first trimester was examined (Table 4).
Two (7.1%) of 28 women had malformed infants, while
40 (0.53%) of 7486 women who did not contract flu
during first trimester had malformed infants
(P = 0.0105). Of these 28 women, 24 (85.7%) were treated
with antiviral drugs and one (4.2%) had a malformed
infant.
According to information released by The JMHLW,
no maternal deaths occurred in Japan associated with
pandemic (H1N1) 2009. The total number of pregnant
women who required hospitalization for treatment of
influenza was 74 throughout the whole of Japan
(Fig. 1c), accounting for 0.42% of the total of 17 646
patients who required hospitalization (Fig. 1e) during
pandemic (H1N1) 2009, which lasted until March 2010
in Japan. Seven patients died in Hokkaido, accounting
for 3.5% of all 201 deaths (Fig. 1f) in Japan, suggesting
that the virulence of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 did not
differ between Hokkaido and Japan as a whole.
Discussion
As pandemic H1N1 virus accounted for more than 99%
of viruses isolated from patients with flu during the
period from July to September 2009 in Hokkaido,5 it is
reasonable to speculate that the patients included in
this study were suffering from pandemic (H1N1) 2009.
It is widely believed that pregnant women, particularly those in the latter half of their pregnancy, have a
greatly increased risk of developing severe pneumonitis and of death associated with pandemic (H1N1)
2009.6 For example, in a study in California, 7.8% of 102
obstetric patients who needed hospitalization for pandemic (H1N1) 2009 died;7 in two studies from Australia
and New Zealand, pregnant women accounted for
9.1% of 722 patients who needed treatment at an ICU,8
and 11% of 64 pregnant women who needed an ICU
died;9 according to information released by the
Chinese Ministry of Health on December 9, 2009, pregnant women accounted for 7.5% and 13.7% of all 4328
patients with serious conditions and of all 326 deaths in
China, respectively;10 and pregnant women accounted
for 5%, 7.5% and 8.3% of hospitalized cases in Canada,
the UK and Brazil, respectively.11
However, pregnant women accounted for only
0.42% of all 17 646 patients who required hospitalization and there was no maternal mortality in Japan. As
pregnant women account for approximately 0.9% of
the population of Japan, it is apparent that pregnant
Japanese women were less likely to develop severe
complications compared with non-pregnant Japanese
women and pregnant women in other countries. The
JMHLW estimated that approximately 12% of the Japanese population visited clinics or hospitals seeking
treatment for flu by mid-December 2009.12 However,
our questionnaire study suggested that less than 4.0%
of all pregnant women contracted pandemic (H1N1)
2009 in Japan. The relatively low infection rate of 3.5%
among pregnant women in this study may partially
explain why pregnant women accounted for 0.42% of
patients. As the percentages of pregnant women who
contracted pandemic (H1N1) 2009 are not clear in these
studies from other countries,4,7,9,11,13–16 it is uncertain
whether this figure of 3.5% in Japan was lower than
those of other countries.
The most striking finding of the present study is that
as many as 52.2% of 268 patients indicated that they took
antiviral drugs for prophylaxis after coming into close
contact with an infected person. The relative risk of
admission to an ICU was reported to be 4.3 times higher
for pregnant women who received antiviral drugs later
(administered >2 days after onset of symptoms) as compared to women who received antiviral drugs at an
early stage.7 In another report, pregnant women with
treatment more than 4 days after onset of symptoms
were more likely to be admitted to an ICU (56.9% vs

9.4%; relative risk, 6.0; 95% confidence interval, 3.5–
10.6) than those treated within 2 days after onset of
symptoms.13 In addition, among 25 maternal deaths
after treatment, only one death occurred in a patient
who received antiviral drugs within 2 days after onset
of symptoms.13 These results suggest that prophylactic
use of antiviral drugs may be more effective for preventing both serious complications and onset of disease. The
high infection rate of 39.7% among 353 women who
reported having taken antiviral drugs for prophylaxis
suggested that heavy exposure to pandemic H1N1
viruses actually occurred in these 353 women. Our findings also suggest that a 1.3-fold (353/268) larger
number of pregnant Japanese women than the actual
number of pregnant patients used antiviral drugs for
prophylaxis. Furthermore, 85.4% of patients reported
having taken antiviral drugs for treatment. Based on the
frequent use of prophylactic antiviral drugs in pregnant
Japanese women, it is reasonable to speculate that the
majority of such women who received antiviral drugs
for treatment may have taken antiviral drugs early after
onset of symptom. These findings may also explain why
pregnant Japanese women were unlikely to develop
serious complications compared to women in other
countries, although the general status of antiviral drug
use among pregnant women in other countries is not
known in detail.
More than 60% of pregnant women reported
having been vaccinated within 1.5 months after the
availability of a vaccine for pandemic (H1N1) 2009,
and vaccination effectively reduced infection in this
study; if a vaccine had not been available, the
expected number of pregnant patients would have
been 152 (2.08% of 7328), and if all women were vaccinated, the expected number of pregnant patients
would have been 16 (0.224% of 7328). Thus, vaccination reduced the infection rate by 89%. Although no
data are available in Japan, the vaccination rate for seasonal influenza was considered to be less than 10%
among pregnant Japanese women. However, as many
as 32.9% of women reported having been vaccinated
for seasonal flu, and 89.1% of those vaccinated for seasonal flu were also vaccinated for pandemic (H1N1)
2009 in this study. These findings together with frequent use of antiviral drugs suggest that pregnant
Japanese women paid greater attention to pandemic
(H1N1) 2009, and this behaviour may have aided in
preventing them contracting flu or not developing
severe complications.
A significantly larger number of malformed infants
were born to women who did than did not contract flu
in this study. The teratogenic effect of flu viruses is
currently controversial.17 However, the aim of this
study was not to investigate this issue. The types of
anomaly were not specified, and sample size may be
too small to draw definitive conclusions. Further
studies are clearly needed to determine whether infection with flu contributes to fetal abnormalities.
This study had several limitations due to the nature
of a questionnaire study. First, it is difficult to verify
that respondents answered questions correctly. Women
with poor outcomes, such as miscarriage and stillbirth,
may have been reluctant to participate in this study.
This may explain why no women reported having stillborn infants in this study. The incidence rate of stillbirth in Japan was 3.4 per 1000 births, accounting for
79% of all cases of perinatal mortality at and after
22 weeks of gestation in 2008.18 The expected number
of stillbirths was 25.6 in this study, 24.7 of which (96.5%
of 25.6) may have belonged to non-infected women.
Thus, women with stillbirths may have declined to participate in this study irrespective of the status of infection with pandemic (H1N1) 2009.
In conclusion, our study suggested that pregnant
Japanese women had a high level of concern regarding pandemic (H1N1) 2009, went to some effort to
avoid contracting pandemic (H1N1) 2009 by taking
antiviral drugs and vaccination, and indeed contracted
flu less frequently than the general Japanese population. This behaviour may have contributed to the lack
of maternal mortality associated with this pandemic
in Japan.
