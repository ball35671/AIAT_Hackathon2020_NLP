OBJECTIVE: To identify facilitators of and barriers to
pregnant women being vaccinated against seasonal influenza by identifying factors associated with influenza
vaccination during pregnancy among women who had
recently given birth to a live infant.
METHODS: We analyzed pooled data from Georgia
(n2,692) and Rhode Island (n2,732) participants in the
2006 and 2007 surveys of the Pregnancy Risk Assessment
and Monitoring System, which conducts cross-sectional
surveys of women with live births. SUDAAN software was
used for analysis to account for complex survey design.
We estimated rates of seasonal influenza vaccination
among pregnant women in Georgia and Rhode Island
and identified factors associated with being vaccinated.
RESULTS: The prevalence of immunization for seasonal
influenza in 2006 and 2007 combined was 18.4% (95%
confidence interval [CI]: 15.9 –21.1) in Georgia and 31.9%
(95% CI 29.8 –34.0) in Rhode Island. Multivariable analyses showed that in Georgia, multiparous women were
significantly less likely to have been vaccinated than
primiparous women (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.60; 95%
CI 0.40 – 0.89). In Georgia, among those not vaccinated,
43% indicated that their health care providers did not
mention anything about the seasonal influenza vaccination. In Rhode Island, women whose health care provider
encouraged them to be vaccinated (adjusted OR 56.62;
95% CI 37.43– 85.63) and those who did not smoke
cigarettes (adjusted OR 1.92; 95% CI 1.25–2.94) were
significantly more likely to be vaccinated.
CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate a need for strategies to promote seasonal influenza vaccine use among
pregnant women. Health care providers can play a significant role in increasing influenza vaccination coverage
rates among pregnant women by advising women to be
vaccinated and by addressing their concerns about vaccine safety.

LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III
Seasonal influenza data and data from the 2009
H1N1 and previous influenza pandemics1– 6 show
that pregnant women are at increased risk for morbidity and death from influenza. To reduce the risk
for seasonal influenza among pregnant women, the
Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and
the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommend that all women who are pregnant
or expect to be pregnant during the influenza season
should be vaccinated with the trivalent inactivated
influenza vaccine.7,8 In addition to protecting pregnant women, influenza vaccination during pregnancy
has been shown to decrease the risk for influenza
among infants up to 6 months of age9 Because influenza vaccine is not recommended for use among
infants younger than 6 months of age, maternal
immunization during pregnancy is thus an important
strategy for preventing infection in these infants.7
However, despite these recommendations and evidence of the protective effects of seasonal influenza

vaccines, vaccine coverage among pregnant women
in the United States remains low. Recent data from
the National Health Interview Survey show that, for
the United States, rates of seasonal influenza vaccination coverage among pregnant women ranged from
12.3% during the 2005 to 2006 influenza season to
24.2% during the 2007 to 2008 season.5,7,10,11
Low vaccination coverage rates imply that there
may be barriers to seasonal influenza vaccination
among pregnant women. Previous study results have
shown that factors affecting pregnant women’s decisions about whether to get a seasonal influenza vaccination include their knowledge about the vaccines
and their perceptions of the vaccines’ safety, whether
their health care providers advised them to get vaccinated or offered to vaccinate them, and the extent of
their health care providers’ knowledge about the risks
of influenza during pregnancy.16 –21 Recent estimates
based on data from the Pregnancy Risk Assessment
and Monitoring System and from the National Health
Interview Survey showed that seasonal influenza vaccine coverage varies by state and has increased for
pregnant women since the 2005 influenza season but
still remains low compared with other priority
groups.10,18 Our purpose in conducting this study
among Pregnancy Risk Assessment and Monitoring
System participants in Georgia and Rhode Island was
to identify facilitators of and barriers to pregnant
women being vaccinated against seasonal influenza
by identifying demographic, service use, and lifestyle
factors associated with influenza vaccination during
pregnancy among women who had recently given
birth to a live infant.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
To identify correlates of influenza vaccine coverage
among pregnant women, we analyzed populationbased data from Pregnancy Risk Assessment and
Monitoring System, an ongoing, population-based
surveillance system that collects data on a wide range
of maternal behaviors and experiences before, during, and after pregnancy. In collaboration with the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 37 states
and New York City currently administer Pregnancy
Risk Assessment and Monitoring System surveys.
The primary mode of Pregnancy Risk Assessment
and Monitoring System data collection is a mail
survey, and nonresponders are contacted by telephone. Each month, participating jurisdictions mail
questionnaires to a stratified random sample of 100 –
300 women who, according to birth certificate data,
gave birth to a live neonate in the previous 2– 6
months. All participating jurisdictions use a core
questionnaire, but they can also add questions from a
set of standard modules, one of which includes questions about use of the seasonal influenza vaccine. We
analyzed data from two states, Rhode Island
(n2,732) and Georgia (n2,692), whose Pregnancy
Risk Assessment and Monitoring System questionnaires included the influenza module in 2006 and
2007. To obtain a study sample large enough for us to
perform multivariable analyses and identify correlates
of seasonal influenza vaccine coverage by state, we
pooled data for 2006 and 2007, the 2 most recent
years for which Pregnancy Risk Assessment and
Monitoring System data were available. The Pregnancy Risk Assessment and Monitoring System
project was approved by the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention’s Institutional Review Board.
Variables examined included seasonal influenza
vaccination coverage among women during their
most recent pregnancy, demographic and service use
indicators, and several chronic disease-related risk
factors. Response rates for the survey were 70% or
greater for both years in both states. Both states’
surveys included the question, “Did you get a flu
vaccination during your most recent pregnancy?” The
Rhode Island survey asked about health care provider
offer or encouragement: “At any time during your
pregnancy, did a doctor, nurse, or other health care
worker offer you a flu vaccination or tell you to get
one?” The Georgia survey did not include a question
on health care provider offer or encouragement but
the survey asked the following question: “What were
your reasons for not getting a flu vaccination during
your most recent pregnancy? For each item, circle Y
(yes) if it was a reason for you and circle N (no) if it
was not a reason or did not apply to you.” The
reasons offered as options were: “My doctor didn’t
mention anything about a flu vaccination during my
pregnancy”; “I was worried about the side effects of
the flu vaccination for me”; “I was worried that the flu
vaccination might harm my baby”; “I wasn’t pregnant
during the flu season”; “I was in my first trimester
during the flu season”; “I don’t normally get a flu
vaccination”; and “Other” (followed by a blank space
for women to write in their responses). Demographic
variables considered in the analysis were maternal
race and ethnicity (non-Hispanic African American,
non-Hispanic white, Hispanic, other); maternal age at
delivery (younger than 20, 20 –24, 25–29, 30 –34, 35
years or older), marital status (married, other), maternal education (less than high school, high school,
more than high school), parity at the time of the
survey (primipara, multipara), Medicaid payment for
prenatal care (yes or no), and timing of prenatal care

in (first trimester, later). Other variables we considered were cigarette smoking (yes or no), body mass
index (less than 30 kg/m2
, 30 or greater), and history
of chronic or pregnancy-induced hypertension and
diabetes (yes or no for each). These demographic,
service use, and behavioral variables were available
for both states.
Women who did not answer the question regarding receipt of seasonal influenza vaccination (n156
for Georgia and n94 for Rhode Island) were excluded from our analyses as were those who did not
provide data for other variables; rates of missing data
for specific variables ranged from less than 1% to 6%.
To produce estimates applicable to the total population of women in each state who had recently delivered a liveborn neonate, we used SUDAAN software
to account for the complex sampling design of the
Pregnancy Risk Assessment and Monitoring System
survey. Weighting adjusts for nonresponses of survey
participants and noncoverage weights correct for discrepancy between sampling frame and actual number
of births. To identify correlates of vaccine receipt, we
conducted both bivariable and multivariable logistic
analyses. Variables included in the models were those
that previous study results showed to be associated
with seasonal influenza vaccination among pregnant
women as well as demographic and service use
variables. We also examined the comments from
participants in the Georgia survey about their reasons
for not getting the seasonal influenza vaccine. Of the
244 comments written on the survey, 242 were legible. Examination of these comments indicated that
approximately 70% could be classified into new categories and the rest could either be assigned to
existing categories or were too idiosyncratic to be
categorized.
RESULTS
The results of our analysis indicated that the percentage of women reporting that they received seasonal
influenza vaccination during their most recent pregnancy was 18.4% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 15.9 –
21.1) in Georgia and 31.9% (95% CI 29.8 –34.0) in
Rhode Island. Results of bivariable analyses of Georgia data showed that non-Hispanic African-American
women were less likely to have received the seasonal
influenza vaccine than were non-Hispanic white
women (Table 1). However, in multivariable analyses,
only parity was significantly associated with vaccine
receipt (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.60; 95% CI 0.40 –
0.89) (Table 1).
Results of bivariable analyses of Rhode Island
data showed that Hispanic women as well as those
who did not smoke were more likely than nonHispanic whites or those who smoked to have received the seasonal influenza vaccine and that women
who were not married and those whose prenatal care
was not paid for by Medicaid were less likely to have
received the vaccine than were their counterparts.
Overall, in Rhode Island, 32% (95% CI 29.9 –34.0) of
the women received offer or encouragement from
their health care providers and 68% (95% CI 65.9 –
70.1) did not report receiving offer or encouragement.
Women who reported that their health care providers
encouraged or offered them to be vaccinated were
more likely to have received the vaccine than women
whose health care providers did not (65% compared
with 4%, respectively) (Table 2). Multivariable analyses results, however, showed health care–provider
encouragement (adjusted OR 56.62; 95% CI 37.43–
85.63) and not smoking to be significantly associated
with vaccine receipt (adjusted OR 1.92; 95% CI
1.25–2.94).
Among pregnant women in Georgia who did not
get vaccinated, the most common reasons given for
not doing so were that their physician did not encourage them and that they normally did not get the
seasonal influenza vaccination (Table 3). Approximately 6% of women selected “other” and wrote in
reasons for not being vaccinated other than the
options presented on the survey questionnaire. Approximately one-third of the written-in reasons overlapped with the categories provided in the question
itself and the rest or approximately 70% of these
reasons were different from the options provided in
the survey. Of the women who cited actual “other”
reasons for not being vaccinated, 24% indicated that
no vaccine was available or that there was a vaccine
shortage at the facility where they went to get immunized; 13% cited concerns about the safety of the
influenza vaccine and their belief that not enough was
known about vaccine administration to pregnant
women (eg, “No research about flu shot and pregnancy”); 12% mentioned that their health care providers discouraged them from being vaccinated (eg,
“Dr. said I was healthy,” “didn’t need one,” and “my
MD felt that it was not necessary”); 10% indicated that
they did not like shots; 7% said they had been
vaccinated before their pregnancy; and 5% reported
being allergic to eggs.
DISCUSSION
Our results showed that seasonal influenza vaccination coverage among pregnant women and the correlates of that coverage varied by state, but the two
VOL. 116, NO. 4, OCTOBER 2010 Ahluwalia et al Correlates of Influenza Vaccine Coverage 951
states also asked different questions. In Georgia, the
major correlate of vaccine receipt was parity; primiparas were more likely to have received the vaccine
than were multiparas, perhaps reflecting multiple
demands and commitments experienced by women
with children. In Rhode Island, health care–provider
encouragement to be vaccinated was strongly associated with vaccine receipt among pregnant women;
the magnitude of this association was similar to that
observed in a study by Tong et al.17 This association,
which has also been shown by the results of other
studies,12–16 suggest that health care providers can
play a significant role in increasing influenza vaccination coverage rates among pregnant women both by
advising women to be vaccinated at any time during
their pregnancy and by addressing women’s concerns
about being vaccinated during prenatal care visits.
However, more than 40% of Georgia women who
were not vaccinated during their pregnancy indicated
that their physician did not mention influenza vacciTable 1. Estimated Prevalence of Influenza Vaccination During Pregnancy Among Georgia Women by

nation to them while they were pregnant. This suggests that many health care providers may need to be
educated about the risk for severe influenza complications among pregnant women, the importance of
influenza vaccine to prevent these complications, and
the need for women to be counseled accordingly. The
need for such education has been noted previously.14,21,22 The concern that many of the Georgia
Pregnancy Risk Assessment and Monitoring System
participants reported having about lack of information concerning the safety of the influenza vaccine
highlights the importance of communicating the risks

and benefits of seasonal influenza vaccination, which
has been noted previously.14,21,22
Factors that may prevent health care providers
from recommending or offering influenza vaccinations to pregnant women include lack of facilities for
vaccination storage and the belief that pregnant
women should not be vaccinated,12,13,15 factors that
previous studies have shown need to be addressed to
facilitate optimal interaction between health care providers and their pregnant patients.12–17 Previous researchers have also called for vaccinations of pregnant women to be incorporated into the routine
practices of obstetricians17 and to recommend specific
strategies such as implementation of standing orders
for seasonal influenza vaccination of pregnant women.23
A Rhode Island program, Immunize for Life, has
been working to increase influenza vaccine availability to health care providers and to educate health care
providers about the importance of vaccinating highrisk populations, including pregnant women. As part
of this program, the Rhode Island Health Department
is required to purchase influenza vaccine and distribute it to health care providers enrolled in the program.24 This program appears to have been effective
in increasing rates of seasonal influenza vaccination
among pregnant women.18,24 The results of our analyses may be useful to such programs by helping them
identify women who might benefit from additional
education or outreach strategies focusing on prevention such as those who have previously given birth
and those who smoke.
Each year, more than four million births occur in
the United States.25 Pregnancy Risk Assessment and
Monitoring System data on influenza vaccination
coverage, the effects of health care provider advice,
and women’s perceived barriers to vaccination may
provide insights about ways to educate women concerning the importance of seasonal influenza vaccination and to encourage health care providers to counsel pregnant women to be vaccinated. Many women
and health care providers may not be aware that, in
2004, both the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists changed their recommendations concerning the administration of seasonal
influenza vaccine to pregnant women from administration only during the second or third trimester to
administration at any time during pregnancy.7 Approximately 25% of Georgia Pregnancy Risk Assessment and Monitoring System participants cited being
in their first trimester as a reason for not getting the
influenza vaccine, and others cited concerns about the
safety of the influenza vaccine for pregnant women;
both of these responses indicate a need to better
communicate current vaccination recommendations
to pregnant women and their health care providers.
In short, despite evidence from numerous studies that
seasonal influenza vaccines are safe for use by pregnant women,22 some pregnant women as well as their
health care providers remain concerned about the
safety of these vaccines.15–17
Findings of this study should be interpreted
within the framework of the following limitations.
First, because our analyses were based on Pregnancy
Risk Assessment and Monitoring System data from
only two states, our results are not generalizable to all
pregnant women in the United States. In addition,
only the Rhode Island Pregnancy Risk Assessment
and Monitoring System survey asked participants
whether their health care providers encouraged them
to be vaccinated, and only the Georgia survey asked
women who were not vaccinated about their reasons
for not getting the vaccine. Second, Pregnancy Risk
Assessment and Monitoring System data are based on
self-reports by women 2– 6 months postpartum and
therefore may be affected by inaccurate recollections
of survey participants. Third, the survey information
about health care providers’ recommendations was
not confirmed by reports from health care providers;
however, this was perhaps a rather minor limitation
given that study results have shown a high correlation
between health care providers’ and patients’ recollecTable 3. Percentage of Unvaccinated Georgia

Despite these limitations, our findings provide insights into influenza vaccination coverage among
pregnant women, barriers to their vaccination, and
potential channels for improving coverage.
Data from the Pregnancy Risk Assessment and
Monitoring System are used to provide state-specific
estimates of influenza vaccination coverage of pregnant
women, which are important for developing state-specific prevention and mitigation strategies. Findings from
our analysis of Pregnancy Risk Assessment and Monitoring System survey data from Rhode Island and
Georgia indicate a need for both physicians and pregnant women to be better educated1–8,19,20 regarding
women’s risk for influenza complications during pregnancy and the protective effects of influenza vaccination
for women and their infants. Health care providers need
to more consistently recommend influenza vaccination
to their pregnant patients and to address women’s
concerns about vaccination during pregnancy ensuring
that pregnant women understand the importance of
getting immunized.
