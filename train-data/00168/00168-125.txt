Background: This study evaluated the incidence, nature, and seriousness of adverse drug reactions (ADRs)
occurring after AdimFlu-S® influenza A (H1N1) vaccination in pregnant women was administered.
Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study. Between October 2009 and February 2010, 198 pregnant
women who had received the AdimFlu-S® influenza A (H1N1) vaccine during pregnancy and 198 agematched pregnant women who had not received influenza vaccine were included and recorded. The
pregnancy outcome and maternal adverse effects were extracted from chart reviews. Infant health status
data were followed up until 8 weeks post-partum.
Results: During the observation period of each cohort, four subjects (2.0%) in the exposed group experienced vaccine-related adverse events that were mild in severity. A total of 17 women (8.6%) in the
vaccine exposed group and 40 women (20.2%) in the unexposed group underwent at least one adverse
effect during their pregnancy. A total of 72 infants (35.6%) in the exposed group and 101 infants (49%) in
the unexposed group had at least one adverse event within 8 weeks after they were born (p < 0.05). The
adverse events experienced by the women and their infants were not increased when the vaccine was
administered during the first trimester. There were no significant differences between these two groups
with regard to preterm delivery rate and stillbirth rate.
Conclusion: AdimFlu-S ® influenza A (H1N1) vaccine is safe for pregnant women and their infants.

1. Introduction
Many illnesses are more severe during pregnancy, but pandemic
H1N1 influenza 2009 has had an unexpectedly devastating impact
among pregnant women [1–3]. According to the data reported from
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, USA, which found that
during pandemic H1N1 2009, 75 pregnant women died, and 272
pregnant women were admitted to an intensive-care unit (ICU)
and survived in the United States [4,5]. In Taiwan, pregnant women
infected with 2009 H1N1 were 2.68 times more likely to be hospitalized than non-pregnant women of reproductive age, and 50% of
the hospitalized required intensive care [6].
The control of seasonal influenza has typically relied on the
prophylactic use of vaccine. Inactivated seasonal influenza vaccine without adjuvant has been considered safe when administered

during pregnancy [7–11]. On November 1, 2009, the Taiwan government began a nationwide 2009 H1N1 vaccination program
using two types of 2009 H1N1 vaccines: a newly license inactivated vaccine without adjuvant known as AdimFlu-S® (Adimmune
Corporation, Taichung, Taiwan) [12,13] and an MF59H-adjuvanted
vaccine (Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics, Sovicille, Italy). The
Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices in Taiwan recommended and prioritized pregnant women to receive either
the unadjuvanted or the MF59H-adjuvanted 2009 H1N1 vaccines,
regardless of the stage of pregnancy. These two vaccine types were
finally injected to one third of the total population.
The reports of clinical trials or post-licensure studies on the
safety of 2009 H1N1 vaccines in pregnant women are limited
[14–16]. The safety profile of the AdimFlu-S® influenza A (H1N1)
vaccine was only investigated in pre-marketing clinicaltrials. However, the post-licensure study about immunogenicity and safety of
AdimFlu-S® influenza A (H1N1) vaccine was only proven in one
clinical trial conducted in 183 Taiwanese subjects aged from 1
to 17 years old [17]. There was lack of information regarding the

association between maternal adverse reaction, maternal and fetal
adverse event, and perinatal outcome. As a result, we conducted
a retrospective cohort study and the purpose of this study is to
observe the safety profile of the AdimFlu-S® influenza A (H1N1)
vaccine in pregnant women to understand the risk posed by vaccines and anticipate questions that the public may have about their
safety.
2. Methods
2.1. Exposed and unexposed cohorts
This study was designed as a retrospective cohort study. The target population was derived from three medical centers in Taiwan:
National Taiwan University Hospital, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital – LinKou, and China Medical University Hospital. The pregnant
women who had received the AdimFlu-S® influenza A (H1N1) vaccine injection in their hospital during any gestation period were
classified into the vaccine-exposed group. The pregnant women
who received the vaccine injection outside of these three medical centers were excluded because of a lack of medical records.
The pregnant women during the same flu season who did not
receive any influenza vaccine during their gestation period were
age matched to the exposed group and classified into the unexposed group.
2.2. Vaccine
The vaccine evaluated in this study was produced by Adimmune Corporation (Taichung, Taiwan) using standard techniques
for the production of seasonal inactivated influenza vaccines. The
vaccine is a monovalent, unadjuvanted, inactivated, split-virus vaccine. One shot (0.5 ml) of AdimFlu-S® influenza A (H1N1) vaccine
contains 15 g of New York Medical College X-179A reassortant of
the A/California/7/2009 (H1N1) like strain.
2.3. Adverse effects
We searched all medical records within the three hospital systems, not just obstetrics. Medical history including allergy history,
blood transfusion, concurrent and prior medical condition(s), and
immune disorder(s) were recorded over the period of one year prior
to the vaccine injection in the exposed group and were recorded
over six months prior to pregnancy for the unexposed group. Safety
data from the medical charts were extracted retrospectively from
the date of vaccination and infant health status data were followed until 8 weeks post-partum. All adverse events, including
fever (≥38 ◦C), nasal congestion, cough, sore throat, muscle aches,
headache, vomiting, nausea, abdominal pain, malaise, and the local
reactions of the vaccinated women were recorded. Reports were
categorized as serious adverse events (SAE) if they involved death,
life-threatening illness, prolongation of hospitalization, permanent
disability, or congenital anomaly [18]. All the medical events for
infants since vaccination and until 8 weeks after birth or until abortion were recorded and reviewed closely by investigators.
2.4. Ethics
The protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional
Review Board (IRB) of each of the participating medical center. The
approval letters were granted on June 9, 2010, by the IRB of NTUH,
on August 12, 2010, by the IRB of CGMF-LK, and on September 17,
2010, by the IRB of CMUH.

2.5. Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using SAS. Univariate analysis was conducted using the Chi-Square test for proportions. An
odds ratio with a 95% confidence interval was calculated to assess
the risk of each variable with the occurrence of adverse drug effects.
Multivariate analysis was performed to assess the independent risk
of variables found significant on univariate analysis by performing
a stepwise logistic regression analysis. A p-value < 0.05 was considered significant.
3. Result
From October 2009 to February 2010, 396 pregnant women
were included from three medical centers, with each group containing 198 women. The reasons for the unexposed group not
receiving vaccine injection was not identified because of a lack
of medical records. Four women in the exposed group and eight
women in the unexposed group gave birth to twins (Fig. 1). Table 1
shows the demographics and the baseline characteristics between
the two groups. The mean gestational age of vaccine injection was
26.5 ± 8.0 weeks.Among them, 10 (5.0%) were in their 1sttrimester,
82 (41.4%)in the 2nd trimester, and 106 (53.3%)in the 3rd trimester.
The only significant difference was that the exposed group had a
lower cesarean section rate.
Death or vaccine related serious adverse events, such as optic
neuritis, cranialneuropathy, brachialneuropathy, or Guillain–Barre
syndrome was not reported. Four women (2.0%) in the exposed
group had adverse drug reactions, such as fever, cough, runny nose,
nasal congestion, and skin itching within one week after vaccination. Seventeen women (8.6%) of the exposed group and forty
women (20.2%) of the unexposed group experienced at least one
adverse event during their pregnancy. Table 2 summarizes the
maternal age, time of vaccination and detail descriptions of associated adverse events of 17 subjects in the exposed group.
No pregnant women (0/10) that had received the studied vaccine during first trimester experienced an adverse event. A total of
11% (9/82) and 7.5% (8/106) of pregnant women, respectively, that
had received the studied vaccine during second or third trimester
had an adverse event (Table 5). The adverse events experienced by
the women were not increased when receiving the vaccine during
the first trimester.
Table 3 summarizes the demographic of the infants. Two infants
in the exposed group and seven infants in the unexposed group
were delivered before the 35th gestational week. Twelve infants
in the exposed group and eighteen infants in the unexposed
group were delivered between 35 and 37 weeks gestation, respectively. 16 (7.9%) infants in the exposed group and 28 (13.6%)

infants in the unexposed group had low birth weights (birth body
weight < 2500 g). One (0.5%) infant in the unexposed group was
stillborn (22 gestational weeks) due to unexplained intrauterine
fetal death at nine days after receiving amniocentesis. The karyotype was 46, XY, inv(9)(p12q13), which is not related to stillbirth.
One (0.5%) infant in the exposed group had severe coarctation of
the aorta (CoA). This infant was born from a 33-year-old mother
and CoA was diagnosed at 22 weeks gestational age by a fetal cardiologist. Vaccination was done at 38th gestational week after CoA
was diagnosed.
Statistically significant differences of birth weight and height
were detected (p-value < 0.05). A total of 72 infants (35.6%) of the
exposed group and 101 infants (49%) of the unexposed group had
at least one adverse event within 8 weeks after they were born. The
major difference was neonatal hyperbilirubinemia (p-value < 0.05)
(Table 4). In Table 5, we demonstrated that the occurrence of the
infant adverse events was not related to vaccine injection time.
With regard to pregnancy outcome, including preterm delivery,
stillbirth rates, and infant medical conditions there were no differences between the groups.
4. Discussion
Although many studies have shown that there were no significant adverse reactions, complications on delivery or neonatal
outcome after vaccination during pregnancy [1,9–11,15,19–22],
pregnant women still hesitate to be vaccinated during pregnancy,
especially in during first trimester. From our study, we disclosed
that influenza A vaccination during pregnancy did not lead to a
higher incidence rate of adverse events in both the maternal and
fetal aspects.
Spontaneous abortion (SAB) rates in Taiwan were 12.8 per 100
pregnancies and most of them occurred within 10 weeks of gestation [23]. For our study, the spontaneous abortion rate was zero
in both the exposed and unexposed group. There are two explanations for this. The first is that pregnant women receiving vaccine
in the first trimester constituted only a small part of our cohort
(10/198, 5%). The second is that as we selected the unexposed group
as age-matched to the exposed group and at the same time were
all delivered at the study hospitals. The women who experienced
SAB could not have chance been selected. However, Lacroix et al.

still notified incidences of intra-uterine deaths and spontaneous
abortion considerably lower than the background risk in the French
population [14].
A total of 17 (8.6%) maternal subjects of the exposed group
have at least one adverse event. The mean days from vaccine injection to onset of adverse event was 50.8 days. In the unexposed
group, the adverse event was even higher (20.2%). First, the higher
adverse event may be contributed from normal physiology of pregnancy, because of hormonal changes during pregnancy,the mucosa
was easier congested and women felt malaise easier. The rate for
adverse events was increased. Second, adverse events following
immunization reporting rates in previous studies was subject to
cautious interpretation, because data collected through passive
surveillance is underreported [24,25]. Another interesting finding
from our study was no woman that had received the studied vaccine during firsttrimester experienced adverse event. Although the
sample size was small,this was also evidenced from the given H1N1
vaccine during first trimester and not associated with increasing
adverse events even during longer observational periods.
The finding of notable, but non-significant lower rates of
preterm labor and low birth weight in the vaccine group were
interesting. Lim et al. have shown the data that preterm delivery
rates were lower than the existing data for the general population
(1.2% versus 7.5%) [15]. In addition, Omer et al. have demonstrated
that women vaccinated during pregnancy were less likely to prematurely deliver and infants of vaccinated mothers had 69% lower
odds of being SGA[26].Inour cohort,thepossible confounders, such
as history of prior preterm delivery, history of autoimmune disease,
and the number of primiparous women were not significantly different between the exposed group and unexposed group. The H1N1
vaccine was made to prevent influenza infection. Although, we did
not have serologic tests for all participates, the biological plausibility of protective effect in the exposed group would decrease
the infected rate and may decrease the rate of preterm births and
intrauterine growth restrictions.
Infants of vaccinated women were, on average, 131 g heavier
than infants of the unvaccinated women (3160 g versus 3029 g;
p = 0.008). Omer et al. has shown similar data that newborns of
vaccinated women were 113 g heavier than newborns of unvaccinated women during the putative influenza season (3360 g versus
3247 g; p = 0.004) [26]. These differences might result from more
preterm birth and low birth weights in the unexposed group. The

other reason, the most significant confounder in influenza studies,
might be that there is a higher likelihood of healthier individuals
being vaccinated – a phenomenon often known as the healthy user
effect. They were also provided better antenatal care that resulted
in better perinatal outcomes.
Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia was the main reason for a higher
rate ofinfant adverse events intheunexposedgroup.Weperformed
a logistic regression analysis that showed a higher rate of adverse
events was closely related to low birth weight (odd ratio: 3.9; 95%
CI = 1.52–10.1). This meant that preterm labor or low birth weight
was the independent factor for poor infant outcome, not the vaccination.
The limitations and strengths of our study include (like any
retrospective cohort study) a possibility of residual confounder
and selection bias. Moreover, data on influenza vaccine injection outside these three medical systems were not included in
the cohort. Although the primary explanation for the effects of
influenza immunization in pregnancy on birth outcomes is through
prevention of infection, we do not have influenza infection data to
provide additional support for our findings. Another limitation of
our study is that we do not have the anti-influenza antibody titers
for any of the exposed subjects. Therefore, immunogenicity profiles could not be evaluated. Further prospective study on safety
of vaccination during pregnancy has been started that include the
anti-influenza antibody titers for all exposed subjects.
5. Conclusion
Influenza A vaccination during pregnancy did not lead to a
higher incidence rate of adverse events. The incidence rate was
even lower than that of maternal subjects without influenza vaccination. There were no differences between the groups in terms
of pregnancy outcome, including rates of premature delivery, stillbirth and infant medical condition from birth to 8 weeks of age.
Flu vaccination during pregnancy improves maternal health, prevents hospitalization, and reduces the rate of influenza-like illness
or upper respiratory tractinfection.AdimFlu-S® influenzaA(H1N1)
vaccine was safe in every aspect and well tolerated by pregnant
women and their infants.
