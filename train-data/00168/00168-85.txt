ABSTRACT
Background Abundant, indirect epidemiological
evidence indicates that influenza contributes to all-cause
mortality and cardiovascular hospitalisations with studies
showing increases in acute myocardial infarction (AMI)
and death during the influenza season.
Objective To investigate whether influenza is a
significant and unrecognised underlying precipitant of
AMI.
Design Case-control study.
Setting Tertiary referral hospital in Sydney, Australia,
during 2008 to 2010.
Patients Cases were inpatients with AMI and controls
were outpatients without AMI at a hospital in Sydney,
Australia.
Main outcome measures Primary outcome was
laboratory evidence of influenza. Secondary outcome was
baseline self-reported acute respiratory tract infection.
Results Of 559 participants, 34/275 (12.4%) cases
and 19/284 (6.7%) controls had influenza (OR 1.97,
95% CI 1.09 to 3.54); half were vaccinated. None were
recognised as having influenza during their clinical
encounter. After adjustment, influenza infection was no
longer a significant predictor of recent AMI. However,
influenza vaccination was significantly protective (OR
0.55, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.85), with a vaccine
effectiveness of 45% (95% CI 15% to 65%).
Conclusions Recent influenza infection was an
unrecognised comorbidity in almost 10% of hospital
patients. Influenza did not predict AMI, but vaccination
was significantly protective but underused. The potential
population health impact of influenza vaccination,
particularly in the age group 50–64 years, who are at
risk for AMI but not targeted for vaccination, should be
further explored. Our data should inform vaccination
policy and cardiologists should be aware of missed
opportunities to vaccinate individuals with ischaemic
heart disease against influenza.
BACKGROUND
Influenza is a cause of significant morbidity and
mortality, particularly in the elderly, during the
annual winter epidemics.1 Laboratory-confirmed
influenza, which represents the ‘tip of the iceberg’
of seasonal influenza-like illness (ILI), causes more
morbidity and mortality than any other infectious
disease in Australia, with the highest hospitalisation
rates for influenza at the extremes of age.2 In addition to ILI, influenza virus infection can cause a
primary viral pneumonia and be complicated by
secondary bacterial pneumonia, with severe disease
and mortality higher in persons with underlying
chronic diseases.3
There is abundant but indirect epidemiological
evidence that influenza contributes to all-cause
mortality4 5 and to cardiovascular and respiratory
hospitalisations.6 Studies show an increase in rates
of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and death
during the annual influenza season.6 7 Acute infections in general have been shown to be associated
with an increased risk of AMI in observational epidemiological studies.8 9 One study found the risk
of myocardial infarction or stroke was more than
four times higher after a respiratory tract infection,
with the highest risk in the first 3 days.8
Despite the compelling observational epidemiological data, the role of infection in ischaemic
events is rarely included in the burden of influenza
disease estimates and in economic evaluations of
influenza vaccination, nor weighed heavily in policy
decisions. This is because direct, confirmatory evidence of the role of viruses and respiratory infections in the precipitation of ischaemic events is
lacking. This study aimed to examine whether
influenza is an unrecognised significant underlying
precipitant of acute ischaemic cardiac events.
METHODS
Study design
We conducted a case-control study during consecutive southern hemisphere winter seasons (2008–
2010) at a tertiary referral hospital in Sydney,
Australia. This hospital is also a district hospital for
the surrounding community, serving a population of
1 114 020 people (2006).10 The influenza winter
season was defined as commencing when ≥3 influenza cases were diagnosed within 1 week, as notified
by participating laboratory staff (WHO National
Influenza Centre). A sample size of 88 in each arm
(ratio 1:1) was calculated to detect a difference in
positive influenza test results of 20% versus 5% with
a 95% CI and 80% power. Incidence estimates were
based on Australian-specific excess influenza morbidity modelling.5 We aimed to recruit 300 cases
and 300 controls over 3 years to allow for smaller
differences in overall and seasonal rates. Written
informed consent was obtained from all participants. The study was approved by the Human
Research Ethics Committee of the Sydney West Area
Health Service (Westmead), New South Wales,
Australia – HREC2007/2/4.8 (2533).

Study participants
Cases
Cases were patients aged ≥40 years of age admitted with an
AMI, evolving or recent myocardial infarction to the cardiology
unit during the influenza season. Eligible respondents were
those able to provide samples within 72 h of the AMI event,
resided in Sydney, available for follow-up and provided
informed consent. Cases reporting a previous cardiovascular
event were eligible. A diagnosis of AMI was defined as a typical
rise and gradual fall in troponin or more rapid rise and fall in
creatine kinase MB (CK-MB) biochemical markers of myocardial necrosis, with one or more of the following: ischaemic
symptoms (chest or arm pain, nausea/vomiting, sweating, or
shortness of breath); development of pathological Q waves on
ECG; ECG changes indicative of ischaemia (ST segment elevation or depression); coronary artery intervention; or pathological findings of an AMI. Cases were recruited into the study
period between 27th June and 20th October 2008, 18th May
and 23rd October 2009 and 21st June and 28th October 2010.
Controls
Controls were persons aged ≥40 years of age attending the
orthopaedic or ophthalmic outpatient clinics during the same
time period. Respondents, residing in Sydney, available for
follow-up and able to provide informed consent, were eligible.
Controls were unmatched, except for the same age cut-off and
recruitment period, to ensure similar level of exposure to circulating influenza. Controls were excluded if they reported a
history of AMI, transient ischaemic attack or stroke in the previous 12 months. Stable angina was permissible if there had been
no worsening of angina or AMI episodes or hospital admissions
in the last year. Controls were recruited into the study period
between 30th June and 31st October 2008, 19th May and 26th
October 2009 and 23rd June and 29th October 2010.
Data collection and validation
All eligible participants were identified daily and approached
for consent (figure 1). Recruited subjects provided nasal and pharyngeal viral swabs at baseline and blood samples at baseline and
4–6 weeks postrecruitment and all were included in the final analysis, regardless of the collection of follow-up sera. A baseline
structured interviewer-administered questionnaire collected
detailed medical and vaccination history, socio-demographic data
and current comorbidities. Self-reported respiratory symptoms
were collected at baseline in 2009 and 2010 only. Influenza vaccination status was validated for current and previous influenza
seasons from hospital and general practitioner (GP) records, with
GPs contacted via facsimile or telephone. If discrepancies arose
between GP and self-report, GP-reported vaccination status was
considered correct. Self-reported vaccination status was considered sufficient in those individuals whose GP could not be contacted. Self-reported quality of life attributes of mobility,
self-care, performing usual activities, pain and anxiety were collected using a three point scale: no problems, some problems or
considerable problems.
Sample collection and laboratory testing for influenza
Trained staff collected blood samples at baseline and at 4–
6 weeks. Influenza A- and B-specific antibody titres were determined on paired sera tested in parallel using a complement fixation assay. Trained staff collected nasopharyngeal swabs at
recruitment. Rayon-tipped, plastic-shafted swabs were inserted
separately into each nostril and the pharynx, and placed in
single vial viral transport media. Swabs were transported immediately to the laboratory, or stored at 4°C if transport was
delayed and combined in the laboratory. Nucleic acid testing
(NAT) using inhouse PCRs assay tested for influenza.11 Other
respiratory pathogens tested included parainfluenza viruses,
respiratory syncytial virus, picornavirus (enterovirus, rhinovirus), adenovirus, coronaviruses 229E and OC43 and human
metapneumovirus using a published method.12
Exposure measures
The primary explanatory variable was laboratory evidence of
undiagnosed influenza, defined as a positive NAT or serological
evidence of influenza A or B (defined as either a fourfold rise in
titre between baseline and follow-up in any individual, or a
single titre of ≥64 at baseline in an unvaccinated individual).
Subjects with a positive baseline serology for influenza who had
received influenza vaccine (GP verified) in the study year were
not defined as having influenza as a single high serological titre
cannot reliably differentiate between infection and vaccination.
The additional exposure measure of a baseline acute respiratory
tract infection (ARTI) (2009 and 2010 only) included selfreported ARTI in the past week.
Data analysis
The Pearson χ2 was used to test the association between a recent
AMI and underlying influenza infection, with p≤0.05 considered statistically significant. The association between AMI and
other risk factors including age, sex, smoking status, alcohol
consumption and self-reported presence of hypertension, high
cholesterol and diabetes were explored. The protective effect of
influenza vaccination against both influenza and AMI was also
investigated.
Unconditional logistic regression analysis was used to estimate
the association between AMI and influenza infection and to
adjust for potential confounders. All plausible variables were
included and a forced entry method initially considered all variables in the model. A model of best fit was determined using a
manual iterative process of variable removal. Variables remaining in the model were assessed for significance and those variables resulting in significant model changes were explored for
interaction effects. The final model reports the proportion of
variation explained by the model using the Nagelkerke R
squared statistic. IBM SPSS Statistics V.20 was used for all
analyses.
Vaccine effectiveness (VE) is the risk reduction attributed to
vaccination estimated from observational studies from measurements of the incidence of disease in vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals.13 In a case-control study, the VE for the
prevention of AMI is estimated from the Odds Ratio (OR)
using the formula: (1- OR)×100.14 We used the adjusted OR
of the association between influenza vaccination and AMI,
obtained from the final logistic regression model. We also estimated the VE for the prevention of influenza. As recruitment
into our case-control study was not based on the outcome of
influenza infection, we are able to calculate the attack rate of
influenza infection in our vaccinated and unvaccinated participants. VE was calculated for influenza using the formula:
((ARU−ARV)÷ARU)×100, where ARU is the attack rate in
unvaccinated and ARV is attack rate in vaccinated participants.
To calculate this VE, a stricter definition of influenza infection
defined as either a positive NAT or serological evidence of
influenza A or B defined as a fourfold rise in antibody titre
between baseline and follow-up was used.

RESULTS
A total of 559 participants were recruited across the three study
years, 275 (49.2%) cases and 284 (50.8%) controls (table 1).
The response rates and patient follow-up are shown in figure 1;
67% of eligible cases and controls participated in the study, with
524 (93.7%) completing follow-up.
Demographic characteristics
Cases and controls differed in a number of demographic and
health-related characteristics (table 1). Overall, 285/559 (51.0%)
participants reported receiving an influenza vaccine in the year
of recruitment. GP verification was obtained for 428/559
(76.6%) participants with 276 (49.4%) considered vaccinated,
including 223/311 (71.7%) aged ≥65 years and 53/248 (21.4%)
aged 40–64 years. Significantly more controls (184/284, 64.8%)
than cases (92/275, 33.5%) were vaccinated in the year of
recruitment (OR 3.7 95% CI 2.6 to 5.2, p<0.001), with differences evident for all recruitment years.
Influenza infection and ARTI
Evidence of influenza infection was identified in 53 (9.5%) subjects. Table 2 shows the number of participants with positive
results, by study arm, year and type of evidence. Of cases, 34/
275 (12.4%) were influenza positive compared with 19/284
(6.7%) controls, with cases significantly more likely to have
recent influenza (OR 1.97, 95% CI 1.09 to 3.54, p=0.022). VE
against influenza was 83.6% (95% CI 27.6% to 96.3%), using
the stricter definition of a positive influenza result. Of
participants, 84/339 (24.8%) reported a baseline ARTI, comprising 52 (31.1%) cases and 32 (18.6%) controls. ARTI
reported at baseline (measured in 2009 and 2010) was significantly associated with AMI (OR 1.98 95% CI 1.2 to 3.3,
p=0.008) on univariate analysis. ARTI was reported in 38
(22.2%) of vaccinated and 46 (27.4%, p=0.3) of unvaccinated
participants, and was more likely in current smokers (28,
40.0%) than non-smokers (56, 21.5%, OR 2.42 95% CI 1.4 to
4.3, p=0.002). Other viral pathogens were identified in 32
(5.7%) participants, with no difference between cases (15,
5.5%) and controls (17, 6.0%) (p=0.8).
Logistic regression and VE
In the multivariate analysis recent influenza was no longer a significant predictor of AMI (p=0.8); however, age, gender,
smoking, high cholesterol and influenza vaccination were significantly associated with AMI (table 3). The overall model was
statistically significant (χ2
=148.7, df=6, p<0.001, Nagelkerke
R square=0.316). Influenza vaccination was significantly protective, with a VE for the prevention of AMI of 45% (95% CI
15% to 65%). VE for the prevention of AMI in 40–64-year-olds
was estimated as 45% (95% CI −15% to 73%) and 33% (95%
CI −20% to 63%) for those aged ≥65 years.
DISCUSSION
We identified unrecognised recent influenza in almost 10% of
participants, indicating that a clinical diagnosis of influenza may
be missed in hospital patients with other presentations. A recent

ARTI was more common in AMI cases, and increased the risk
of AMI by twofold, highlighting the need for greater awareness
of infection as an underlying or precipitating condition in hospital patients.
While influenza and ARTI significantly predicted AMI in
unadjusted analysis, after adjustment for other factors, influenza
and ARTI (data not shown) were no longer independent
predictors of AMI. However, influenza vaccination in the study
year was significantly protective against AMI, with unvaccinated
subjects almost twice as likely as vaccinated subjects to have
AMI. Our finding of vaccination being a protective factor is validated by the fact that other significant predictors of AMI in the
model (age, gender, smoking, high cholesterol) are accepted risk
factors for AMI. The estimated VE of influenza vaccine against
AMI was 45% (95% CI 15% to 65%), suggesting potential
population health benefits of vaccination in adults at risk of
ischaemic heart disease. While other studies have looked at the
association of influenza, influenza vaccination and AMI,15–20
none estimate influenza VE against AMI. A previous casecontrol study found influenza vaccination reduced the risk of
recurrent AMI (OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.82).15 This equates
to a VE of 67% (95% CI 18% to 87%) in the prevention of
recurrent AMI, a finding which supports our own study.
While we showed a protective effect of influenza vaccination
against AMI, we were unable to demonstrate a direct effect of
influenza infection on AMI. This could reflect low statistical
power, with laboratory-confirmed influenza being a much rarer
event than vaccination, which showed significant association.
Furthermore, the high vaccination rate in our participants likely
reduced the risk of influenza and our ability to detect a difference
between groups. However, other studies have shown an association among influenza, influenza vaccination and AMI. In a
recent case-control study in China, serological evidence of influenza was found to significantly predict recent AMI.16 Other
observational studies have found influenza vaccination to be protective against AMI, recurrent AMI and cardiac death.15 21 Three
randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which patients with coronary artery disease or admitted with acute coronary syndrome
were randomised to receive the influenza vaccine have shown
reductions in recurrent events at 6 22 and 12 months,17 20 and
cardiovascular death (HR 0.34, 0.17 to 0.71)20 and any coronary
ischaemic event at 12 months19 compared with placebo.
Clinical and animal studies have identified an association
among inflammation and atherosclerotic disease development,
destabilisation of advanced disease and healing delay.23 It is postulated that infection precipitates inflammation by induction of
a prothrombotic state or autoimmune reactions in alreadydiseased coronary vessels, causing critical obstruction. Given the
animal, observational and RCT data suggesting the precipitation
of ischaemic events by infection, the prevention of influenza by
vaccination may have an important role in reducing ischaemic
events. Influenza vaccination is efficacious in preventing severe
influenza, reducing the incidence of pneumonia and death in
the elderly24 and is also a cost-effective intervention25 recommended by national expert committees. Australia funds immunisation for adults aged ≥65 years and those with pre-existing
risk conditions with both influenza and pneumococcal vaccines.26 Although estimated influenza vaccination levels are high
(>70%) for the age group ≥65 years, uptake in younger at-risk
groups is low.27 This was reflected in our study, with controls
who were on average older and eligible to receive free influenza
vaccination had higher rates of vaccination, whereas the AMI
cases, despite being at risk were on average younger and therefore not eligible for free vaccination had much lower vaccination uptake.
Extension of vaccination programmes to include those aged
50–64 years has been suggested. However, cost-effectiveness
studies of a targeted programme for this age group28 do not
include the prevention of AMI. Cardiovascular disease is the
second largest contributor to disease burden in Australia,
accounting for 18% of the total disability-adjusted life years

lost.29 As such, even a small effect of influenza vaccination in
preventing AMI may have significant population health gains.
The influenza VE in protecting against AMI (45%, 95% CI
15% to 65%) in our study and other similar studies indicates a
substantial potential population health impact on ischaemic
heart disease by vaccinating younger adults. Approximately 3.4
million Australians are affected by cardiovascular disease.30
Although two-thirds of the burden is in older adults, 19% of
45–54-year-olds and 5% of those aged under 45 years are
affected.30 Influenza vaccination of people with an index AMI
could also have a significant impact, with high rates of subsequent acute coronary events in patients with AMI. Death or
re-infarction occurred in six of 100 patients within 1 month,
and 27 within 1 year in unvaccinated AMI patients on standard
treatment.20 Clinicians should consider vaccination of AMI
patients before hospital discharge.
Ours is an observational study and is subject to the limitations
of its non-randomised and its unmatched study design. The
sample size, although adequate to detect a difference in influenza positive results, was small considering the number of vaccinated participants, but the study was intensive and difficult to
conduct, and achieving final sample size required 3 years of
recruitment. Australia has a funded influenza vaccination programme for people aged 65 years and older, with uptake rates
>85%. Our controls were older than AMI cases, and therefore
more likely to be vaccinated and more likely to be living alone,
which could affect exposure status. Given the strong relationship
between age and vaccination uptake, and the older age of controls, the study would have benefited from being individually
age-matched. However, we adjusted for age in our model, and
influenza vaccination remained significant. Further, controls
were recruited from outpatient clinics and representative of
community-acquired influenza. While there is the possibility
that controls may have not attended due to severe influenza
infection, the majority of participants found to have laboratory
evidence of influenza did not report acute respiratory symptoms.
The modelling adjusted for the factors which were unequally
distributed between cases and controls. It is reassuring that
known risk factors of age, current smoking and high cholesterol
were found to be significant predictors of AMI in our model,
the last being the two largest predictors of AMI in the
INTERHEART study.31 Our study did not find a self-reported
history of diabetes or hypertension or alcohol consumption to
be predictors of AMI.31 While we did not control for all possible confounders, residual confounding is a concern for all
case-control studies if confounding variables are not measured
or adjusted for. For example, influenza vaccination was excluded
from the INTERHEART study.31 We believe we have included
all major confounders in our model. The low national influenza
season in 2010 limited our statistical power and may explain
why influenza infection did not significantly predict AMI. The
number of vaccinated subjects was far greater than the number
with documented influenza infection, therefore affording
greater statistical power for examining the association of AMI
with vaccination. Our study is strengthened by collection over a
number of influenza seasons and the use of laboratoryconfirmed influenza as a primary variable of interest, rather
than self-reported ARTI, which is subject to biases. With a strict
definition of AMI, it is unlikely that misclassification of AMI
has occurred, which would unduly bias VE calculations. An
overestimation of vaccination status would bias VE estimates;
however, we have classified vaccination status based on GP verified reports, in which more than 75% of participants were able
to be verified.
There has been little international policy debate surrounding
the use of influenza vaccination in the prevention of ischaemic
cardiac disease morbidity in people less than 65 years of age.
The current recommendations are for selective vaccination of
people with known risk factors often at personal expense.
However, this does not achieve adequate vaccination rates.27
Other studies which have looked at influenza and AMI in
people aged <65 years have shown mixed results, but even a
small reduction in AMI by prevention of influenza may have
population health benefit.32 33 The role of an expanded vaccination programme for adults over 50 years of age, which would
capture a significant proportion of people at risk of AMI,
should be explored by further research. At the least, clinicians
