Introduction: A two phases post authorization safety and effectiveness study of individuals vaccinated
with the MF59-adjuvanted A/H1N1 influenza vaccine, Focetria® (Novartis Vaccines & Diagnostics, Siena,
Italy), was conducted in Emilia-Romagna region, Italy during the 2009 A/H1N1 influenza pandemic. The
second phase study aim was to detect short- and long-term adverse events of special interest (AESIs)
following vaccination, and to measure vaccine effectiveness in term of hospital admissions.
Study design and method: A population-based cohort study using record linkage of automated healthcare databases is described. Focetria® was administered to 127,522 subjects between October 2009 and
February 2010. Vaccinated subjects were generally less healthy than unvaccinated ones. Propensity to
be vaccinated was calculated for each subject, and vaccinated and unvaccinated subjects were matched
accordingly (103,642 subjects in each group). AESIs were validated against clinical records.
Results: In the overall (pre-matching) cohort, a total of 504 short-term incident AESIs (28 in 127,522
vaccinated and 476 in 3,967,917 unvaccinated subjects) were registered (unadjusted OR: 1.8; 95% CI:
1.2, 2.7). No fatalities were recorded. In the matched cohort, a total of 26 short-term incident AESIs
(11 in the vaccinated and 15 in the unvaccinated group) were registered, with no differences between
groups (OR: 0.7; 95% CI: 0.3, 1.6). Most frequent short-term incident AESIs were convulsions (4 out of
11), and demyelinating diseases (3 out of 11). In the long-term a total of 121 incident AESIs (60 in the
vaccinated and 61 in the unvaccinated group) were registered, with no differences between groups (OR:
1.0; 95% CI: 0.7, 1.4). Most common long-term incident AESIs were demyelinating diseases (21 out of
60), and vasculitis (13 out of 60). Vaccine effectiveness was not assessed as the majority of subjects were
vaccinated at the end of the pandemic peak and few cases (<0.1%) had laboratory confirmation.
Conclusions: This population-based cohort study using automated databases suggests that Focetria® is
not associated with an increase in AESIs.

thereafter throughout the world causing an influenza pandemic
according to World Health Organization criteria [4,5].
Interpretation of the epidemic data was controversial, with
ECDC defining the pandemic wave as “less severe than any of the
20th century pandemics” [6–11]. Nevertheless there was some
alarm in Europe, and health authorities acted for prompt implementation of an immunization campaign primarily targeting ‘at
risk’ individuals.
Monovalent adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted pandemic
influenza vaccines were developed based on WHO recommendations [12]. In Italy the only vaccine available was the
MF59-adjuvanted, monovalent H1N1 vaccine Focetria® (Novartis
Vaccines and Diagnostics, Siena, Italy).
According to clinical data submitted for registration, and the
clinical experience gathered using the MF59 in elderly, the safety

profile of Focetria® resembled those of the already approved seasonal influenza vaccines although local reactions were reported
to be more frequent [13,14]. The European Medicines Agency
(EMA) recommended monitoring the vaccine in a post authorization safety study [15]. Thus, the Emilia-Romagna Regional
Health Authority set a large population-based cohort study which
objective was to assess the short- (from day 1 to 6 weeks postvaccination) and long-term safety (from day 1 to 7–11 months
post-vaccination) and effectiveness of Focetria® vaccine. This study
followed a first short-term active surveillance study aimed at performing a “real time” safety assessment, conducted in the province
of Reggio Emilia and described in a companion paper [16].
2. Methods and materials
2.1. Setting
The study, based on record linkage, was conducted in the
Emilia-Romagna region (a northern Italian region with 4.4 million
inhabitants), where several comprehensive automated administrative databases are available at regional level [17].
Characteristics of Focetria®, and the recommendations for its
use and administration have been previously described [16]. The
vaccination campaign lasted from October 15, 2009 to February
28, 2010. Swab testing for laboratory confirmation of influenza
was done according to the Regional Guidelines (Table 1 on-line).
All samples were sent to two regional reference laboratories and
results were centrally collected by the Regional Health Authority.
2.2. Study design and population
This was a retrospective cohort study primarily aimed at
assessing safety of Focetria®. Effectiveness was also assessed
according to EMA request. All vaccinated and unvaccinated subjects resident in the region and not pregnant throughout the study
period were included and compared (overall pre-matching cohort).
As vaccination was indicated for at risk population, vaccinated subjects were more likely to present co-morbidities than unvaccinated
ones; thus the two groups were matched 1:1 (matched cohort)
using a propensity score (see below) to be vaccinated (Fig. 1).
2.3. Outcomes
2.3.1. Short- and long-term safety
Vaccinated and unvaccinated subjects with Adverse Events of
Special Interest (AESIs) were identified in the regional hospital
discharge database using ICD9 codes: number of AESIs was the
outcome of interest, i.e. each person could experience more than
one AESI. Short-term AESIs were events requiring hospitalization
within 6 weeks post-vaccination, and according to the EMA list
[15] modified based on the VAESCO report [18], included: Guillain Barré syndrome (GBS), other paralytic syndromes, encephalitis
and encephalomyelitis, acute transverse myelitis, optic neuritis, demyelinating disease, vasculitis, immune thrombocytopenia,
Bell’s palsy, autoimmune hepatitis, convulsion, anaphylaxis, sudden death from unknown cause. AESIs based on a discharge
diagnosis following immunization in absence of a comparable primary discharge diagnosis in the previous 3 years were defined as
“incident cases” and were differentiated from “non-incident cases”
(presence of a comparable primary discharge diagnosis in the previous 3 years).
Long-term incident AESIs (same list as short-term AESIs,
excluding sudden deaths, anaphylaxis and convulsion) were also
assessed, identifying all events occurring from October 15, 2009
to September 30, 2010 (from day 1 to between 7 and 11 months
post-vaccination). Long-term non-incident AESIs were not
recorded. Short- and long-term AESIs in the matched cohort were
validated. Validation was carried out in each hospitals where
the subjects were hospitalized for the AESIs recorded by the
clinician working in the Health Care Management Unit. He/she
was unaware of exposure and compared the primary discharge
diagnosis identified in the SDO database with the clinical information available in the data-warehouses (i.e. hospital discharge letter,
primary discharge diagnosis, and/or results of X-rays/laboratory
tests performed).
Safety outcomes of interest were:
• short-term (incident and non-incident cases) and long-term
(incident) AESIs requiring hospitalization in the overall (prematching) cohort (regardless of validation).
• short-term (incident, non-incident cases) and long-term (incident) AESIs requiring hospitalization in the matched cohort
(validated cases).
2.3.2. Effectiveness
Effectiveness was assessed, as requested by EMA, in the matched
cohort using data on hospitalizations from October 29, 2009 (14
days post-first-vaccination) through March 31, 2010 for any hospital admissions (primary or concomitant ICD-9-CM 480-487,
518.8) for pneumonia, influenza-like-illness (ILI), or respiratory
insufficiency with laboratory-confirmed influenza A/H1N1 2009
(throughout the pandemic). In an exploratory analysis, the same
types of hospitalizations were considered regardless of laboratory
confirmation. Due to the overall low number of swabs performed
according to the Regional policy on swab testing (Table 1 online), data on laboratory-confirmed cases of A/H1N1 2009 infection
regardless of hospitalization were also analyzed.
2.4. Data sources
The following automated databases were used: hospital discharge, ambulatory medical/diagnostic visit and/or therapy, drug
prescription at community level, vaccination database. Even in
absence of a formal validation process regarding the specific outcomes under study, databases are considered to be almost complete
as reporting is obligatory to reimburse costs from the national
health system. Moreover, regional databases have been extensively
used for purpose of surveillance and in record linkage studies
[19–21].
In addition, databases of two reference laboratories for A/H1N1
2009 testing were linked to the vaccinated and unvaccinated
datasets.
2.5. Data analysis
Vaccine safety was assessed starting from October 15, 2009
(day 1 being the day the first dose of vaccine was administered); the same date was used as day 1 for selecting the controls.
Fourteen days post-vaccination was considered as the time
when the vaccine became protective and used to assess vaccine
effectiveness.
2.5.1. Co-morbidity
For each subject, a co-morbidity pattern was defined, based on
hospital discharges, drug prescriptions and clinical visits in the
preceding three years (Table 2 on-line). Co-morbid conditions considered, assessed using the regional databases, were autoimmune
diseases, cardiovascular disorders, diabetes, hepatic disorders,
gastrointestinal disorders, neoplasm, renal disorders, respiratory disorders, transplant recipients, nervous system disorders,
endocrine disorders, immunocompromised, cortisone treatment.

Fig. 1. Study population flow.
The number of co-morbid conditions (0, 1, and 2 or more) and not
the type of co-morbidities was considered in the matching procedure.
2.5.2. Propensity score
Using logistic regression, propensity to be vaccinated was estimated for each subject in the overall (pre-matching) cohort and a
propensity score (ranging from 0 to 1) was assigned. The higher
the score the more complex the case assessed. The propensity
score, rounded to the 4th decimal number, was used as a matching criterion for all safety and effectiveness outcomes, to correct
for case mix [22]. Variables included in the propensity score were
patient’s age and sex, residency, public health expenditure (for hospital admissions, drugs, laboratory tests, and ambulatory visits),
co-morbidities, previous hospitalizations and number of ATC drugs
assumed in the previous year. List of variables included in the
propensity score and their frequency in the overall (pre-matching)
cohort are reported in Table 2 on-line.
2.5.3. Statistical analysis
The SAS System, release 9.1 for Windows, was used for the
statistical analysis. Unadjusted logistic regression (GENMOD
procedure) was performed for assessing effectiveness and safety.
Subject vaccination status was the independent variable, hospitalizations due to AESI were the dependent variable used for safety
assessment while hospitalizations due to ILI, pneumonia, and
respiratory insufficiency were the dependent variables used for
effectiveness assessment. Matched status was considered in the
model. To assess vaccine effectiveness, multivariate logistic regression analysis with double adjustment procedure was planned and
performed [23,24]. The variables used in the multivariate model
were the same as those in the propensity score model, except for
the followings differences: the number of co-morbidities used
in the propensity score model was replaced with the complete
co-morbidity pattern; continuous variables related to previous
hospitalizations, used in the propensity score model, were used
as categorical variables (0, 1, ≥2). For all outcomes in the models
described above, 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) – Wald type –
of the odds ratio (OR) were calculated.
2.6. Study funding and responsibilities
The study, funded by Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics to
the Regional Health Directorate, was subsequently commissioned
to the Reggio Emilia Local Health Authority (LHA) for the active
surveillance phase [16] and to the Emilia-Romagna Regional Health

and drafting of the report were entirely under the responsibility of
the Emilia-Romagna Regional Health Agency.
3. Results
3.1. Characteristics of the overall (pre-matching) and matched
cohort
Of the 4,095,439 residents in Emilia-Romagna region, 127,522
received Focetria® and 3,967,917 were unvaccinated (overall prematching cohort). Vaccinated subjects were mainly adolescents
and non-elderly adults (ages 18–60 years) (67.5%); only 19.3% were
>60 years old. Fifty eightpercent ofthose vaccinatedhadatleast one
co-morbidity, the most frequent being respiratory disorders (8.4%),
cardiovascular disorders (5.4%), diabetes (5.2%), neoplasm (4.1%),
and nervous system disorders (3.5%), thus belonging to one of the
chronic illness classes for which vaccination was recommended.
Table 1 compares vaccinated with unvaccinated subjects in the
region by the presence of co-morbidity (2 or more) and by healthcare expenditure (≥75 percentile) according to age group: 46.8%
of vaccinated subjects were in the higher percentiles of individual
healthcare expenditure, compared with 24.3% in the unvaccinated,
and 18.3% of the vaccinated had 2 or more co-morbidities, compared with 5.6% of the unvaccinated.
After matching on propensity score [22]the two cohorts became
balanced overall for individual health care expenditure and previous history of hospitalizations; however, the distribution of the
vaccinated subjects was more dispersed and skewed at the upper
end for these variables. A control was identified for 81.3% of the
vaccinated subjects; thus the matched cohort included 103,642
vaccinated and 103,642 unvaccinated subjects. The 23,880 vaccinated subjects excluded from the matched analysis were mainly
children and adolescents with more than one co-morbidity that
were in the higher percentiles of the propensity score, and in the
highest quartile of individual health care expenditure.
3.2. Vaccine safety
Overall (pre-matching) cohort: 41 AESIs (28 incident and 13
non-incident) in the vaccinated group (127,522 subjects) and 625
AESIs (476 incident and 149 non-incident) in the unvaccinated
group (3,967,917 subjects), regardless of subsequent validation,
were registered within 6 weeks post-vaccination (Table 2a). Most
common short-term incidentAESIs were convulsions, autoimmune
hepatitis and demyelinating diseases; most common long-term
incident AESIs were other paralytic syndromes, demyelinating diseases, and autoimmune hepatitis (Table 2b). The unadjusted risk of
short- and long-term incident AESIs was higher among vaccinated
subjects (unadjusted OR: 1.8; 95% CI: 1.2, 2.7 and unadjusted OR:
1.4, 95% CI: 1.2, 1.7 respectively). No fatalities were recorded during
the 6-week post-vaccination period in the unmatched cohort.
Matched cohort: 16 AESIs (11 incident and 5 non-incident
cases) in the vaccinated group (103,642 subjects) and 16 AESIs
(15 incident and 1 non-incident cases) in the unvaccinated group
(103,642 subjects) were registered and validated within 6 week
post-vaccination period (Table 3). Given the low number of events,
only unadjusted logistic regression was performed and prevalent
cases (i.e. incident plus non-incident cases) were also compared.
Short-term AESIs among vaccinated and unvaccinated subjects
were comparable both in terms of prevalent (OR: 1.0; 95% CI: 0.5,
2.0) and incident AESIs (OR: 0.7; 95% CI: 0.3, 1.6) (Tables 4 and 5).
Even when considering long-term safety, no significant risk was
found in the vaccinated subjects (OR: 1.0; 95% CI: 0.7, 1.4) (Table 5).

term: from day 1 post-vaccination to 6 weeks post-vaccination.
The following comparisons were conducted to evaluate the
impact of having excluded 23,880 vaccinated subjects during the
matching procedure: incidence of AESIs among vaccinated subjects
included in the matched cohort was 10.6 per 100,000 (11 events in
103,642 subjects) whereas incidence of AESIS among vaccinated
subjects excluded from the matched cohort was 37.7 per 100,000
(9 events – four convulsions, two other paralytic syndromes, one
demyelinating disease, one autoimmune hepatitis, and one anaphylaxis – in 23,880 subjects). The two populations (vaccinated
subjects included and excluded from the matching cohort) were
not comparable for baseline characteristics, since the latter were
more frequently affected by co-morbidities and had the highest
propensity score to be vaccinated. Therefore, incidence of AESIs in
the overall (pre-matching) cohort of vaccinated subjects (15.7 per
100,000; 20 events in 127,522 subjects) was compared with incidence of AESIs in unvaccinated subjects included in the matched
cohort (14.5 per 100,000; 15 events in 103,642 subjects) as these
populations were more comparable in term of co-morbidity and

propensity score to be vaccinated. No statistically significant difference between the two groups was detected.
3.3. Vaccine effectiveness
In the overall (pre-matching) cohort, 2949 swabs were performed: 63 among vaccinated (0.1%) and 2886 among unvaccinated
(0.1%) subjects. Only one vaccinated subject hospitalized with
a diagnosis of ILI, pneumonia or respiratory insufficiency had
laboratory-confirmed A/H1N1 2009 influenza (vaccine failure). In
the matched cohort analysis, no laboratory-confirmed A/H1N1
2009 hospitalizations were identified.
In the matched cohort hospitalizations due to ILI, pneumonia
or respiratory insufficiency regardless of laboratory-confirmation
were more frequent in the vaccinated than in the unvaccinated
subjects: 219 hospitalizations were recorded in the vaccinated
(0.2%) compared to 121 hospitalizations in the unvaccinated (0.1%).
Adjusted OR (double adjustment procedure) was 1.4 (95% CI: 1.1,
1.8). As the matching procedure was not perfectly successful in balancing the two groups of vaccinated and unvaccinated subjects, risk
of being admitted according to vaccination status in the time period
preceding the vaccination campaign was calculated and used as
control:the vaccinated/unvaccinated OR observed for the 5 months
prior to the A/H1N1 vaccination campaign was higher (adjusted
OR with double adjustment: 2.6; 95% CI: 1.9, 3.5) than the vaccinated/unvaccinated OR observed during the vaccination campaign.
4. Discussion
Most illnesses caused by the pandemic virus in the Northern
Hemisphere were mild [26,27]. Nevertheless, given the alarming
reports coming from the Southern Hemisphere [6–9], and the experience with the outbreaks of avian influenza virus [28,29], fear of
severe influenza pandemic was common in Europe and warranted
prompt vaccination. In light of the evolution towards a less severe
influenza pandemic, the assessment of the vaccine safety became
even more relevant.
This regional retrospective cohort study showed that the rate
of short- and long-term AESIs in the overall (pre-matching)
cohort was increased in the vaccinated population (unadjusted
OR: 1.8; 95% CI: 1.2, 2.7 and OR: 1.4; 95% CI: 1.2, 1.7, respectively). This observation was probably due to an imbalance in
baseline characteristics between vaccinated and unvaccinated subjects (Table 1): vaccinated people were at higher risk of hospital
admission and adverse events due to underlying chronic diseases. After matching on propensity score, incidence of short- and
long-term AESIs did not differ between vaccinated and unvaccinated subjects (OR: 0.7; 95% CI: 0.3, 1.6 and OR: 1.0; 95%
CI: 0.7, 1.4, respectively). These results confirm that controlling and checking for underlying co-morbidity is important when
considering safety following vaccination [22,23]. Our findings are
consistent with other studies on pandemic influenza vaccines. In
the Netherlands, the national pharmacovigilance system did not
detect an increased risk of adverse events following immunization
(AEFIs) with Focetria® [30]. In Italy, the Italian Pharmacovigilance Adverse Event Spontaneous Reporting System received 1330
reports of adverse events (AEs) temporally related with the pandemic influenza: 87.4% AEs reports were classified non serious,
6.8% serious, and 0.2% were fatal. Overall, no increased risk was
detected [31]. Analysis of AEs after receipt of the Influenza A/H1N1
2009 monovalent inactivated vaccine reported to the Vaccine
Adverse Event Reporting System in US, showed that the most frequent diagnoses were GBS, convulsions, and cranial neuropathy
[32].
Unlike the above-described studies based solely on a pharmacovigilance system, our conclusions are based on a more robust and
informative record linkage study involving a relatively large number ofpeople.Another study basedonrecordlinkage was conducted
in Sweden on 2 million people to assess the risk of neurological and autoimmune disorders after vaccination with Pandemrix®
(GlaxoSmithKline). The study detected a slight increase among
vaccinees for Bell’s palsy (hazard ratio, HR: 1.2; 95% CI: 1.1, 1.5)
and paraesthesia (HR: 1.1; 95% CI: 1.0, 1.2), while the risk for
GBS, multiple sclerosis, type I diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis
remained unchanged [33]. Unlike the Swedish study, according to
background rates of AESIs in Emilia-Romagna region (Table 3 online), our population was not large enough to detect changes in
the incidence of GBS and Bell’s palsy, whereas it was sufficient to
detect changes in AESIs as frequent as 3–4 per 100,000 [34,35]
like paralytic syndromes other than Guillain Barré, demyelinating disease, convulsions, anaphilaxis, autoimmune hepatitis and
vasculitis. Case control studies can be more appropriate for rare
AESIs such as GBS. A European study, using a database of 50 million individuals, identified 104 subjects with GBS: no association
with the pandemic influenza vaccines used (mainly Pandemrix®
and Focetria®) was detected, even after correction for concurrent
seasonal influenza vaccination [36]. A limitation of our study is
that, unlike the latter, we were not able to correct our data for
concurrent seasonal influenza vaccination. In Italy, general practitioners administer the seasonal influenza vaccination, and no
accurate registration system exists for this type of vaccination in
Emilia-Romagna.

Nevertheless, additional information emerged from our study:
convulsions were the most frequent short-term incident AESI registered in the overall pre-matching cohort (7.8 per 100,000). After
matching, no significant difference in the incidence of convulsions between vaccinated and unvaccinated subjects was detected.
The association between influenza vaccine and convulsions is
debatable [32,37]: a study conducted in UK using the General
Practice Research Database (3 million patient records) identified
2366 children who had convulsions following the administration
of Pandemrix® or Celvapan® [37]. Compared with pre-determined
risk period, there was no increased risk of convulsion after either
seasonal or pandemic influenza vaccine. Nevertheless, the authors
reported an increased risk in the first few days after the second
dose of vaccine, consistent with findings of increased fever after
vaccination.
One strength of our study is the fact that a well-defined list
of outcomes was measured: given the severity of the conditions
assessed, it is unlikely that subjects with the outcome of interest
would be undetected. Moreover, by using a matching procedure
based on propensity score to be vaccinated, the comparability for
known confounding factors among the two observed cohorts has
increased; residual confounding is, however, still a possibility.
However, caution should be used when interpreting our data.
The matching procedure leads to the exclusion, due to lack of
comparable matched unvaccinated subjects, of almost 20% of the
vaccinated population. Those were more likely to be younger, with
more than one co-morbidity, with a higher propensity score, and
in the highest quartile of individual healthcare spending. Thus
it is possible that in this population subset, AESIs could have
been detected more frequently that in the matched population.
However, when controlling for AESI incidence in the unmatched
vaccinated cohort, no significant differences were detected in
comparison to the matched unvaccinated cohort, therefore we
can reasonably exclude the occurrence of selection bias. Moreover, among the vaccinated subjects excluded, the AESIs more
frequently detected were convulsions in young subjects with previous episodes of convulsion (prevalent convulsions); based on
WHO criteria [32] it is unlikely that episodes of convulsions following vaccination in children with previous febrile seizures are
causally related to the vaccine. Another limitation of the study is
that, even if all efforts were made to ensure comparability between
the two groups, subjects in the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups
were not perfectly comparable. Moreover, data were obtained from
regional databases and not using an ad hoc collection procedure. A
retrospective validation process was used to increase the reliability
of the diagnoses, however, some degree of misclassification cannot be excluded. Finally, the pandemic vaccination peak partially
overlapped with the seasonal influenza vaccination, thus we could
not exclude some kind of distortion when assessing the pandemic
vaccine safety and effectiveness.
With respect to vaccine effectiveness, no conclusions can be
drawnbased onthis study. First of all,the vaccinationpeak occurred
after the pandemic peak, thus decreasing the possibility of detecting any effect of the vaccination (Fig. 2). In addition, the majority
of people with more than one co-morbidity received the vaccine,
making it difficultto identify a corresponding unvaccinated subject
presenting the same degree of co-morbidities as the vaccinee. On
the other hand, the limited sample of swabs performed (<0.1% in
vaccinated and unvaccinated subjects) and the fact that the recommended indications changed over time, prevented the assessment
of the real burden of influenza in the observed population. Moreover, only hospital discharge data were used: since the majority
of the influenza cases occurred among young adults who are less
likely to be admitted to hospital, it is possible that our study missed
a large part of influenza cases. In addition, cases admitted were
probably the sicker ones with more frequent co-morbidities, thus
any measure of association would have been biased. The difficulty
of assessing the pandemic influenza vaccine effectiveness, given
the low vaccination coverage in Italy (around 4%) and the lower
than expected incidence and severity of the disease, have also been
discussed in another Italian study [38].
Similarly to our study, a Danish cohort study showed no effect
of the adjuvanted monovalent influenza vaccine Pandemrix® in
reducing hospital admissions [39]. In the Netherlands, a matched
case–control study in individuals at risk of complications showed
that during the 2009 influenza pandemic breakthrough, infections
were frequent and that Focetria® vaccine’s efficacy (VE) in preventing influenza-related hospitalization was modest(VE: 49%; 95% CI:
16, 69) [40]. On the other hand, a recent health technology assessment study on H1N1 pandemic flu vaccine effectiveness, showed
that the majority of hospitalized cases with respiratory symptoms
during the influenza pandemic were unvaccinated [41].
Moro ML et al. / Vaccine 31 (2013) 1438–1446 1445
In conclusion, this study shows that the use of automated
databases is useful to monitor safety signals when introducing a
new vaccine. For rare AEs, however, it is relevant to verify that the
database is large enough, using background rates of AESIs [35]. The
study findings suggest that Focetria® was not associated with an
increased risk of AESIs in the population of Emilia-Romagna.
