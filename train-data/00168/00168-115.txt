Abstract
Objective: To describe the characteristics of pregnant women who accept the influenza vaccine
and evaluate the relationship between vaccination and adverse pregnancy outcomes.
Methods: Retrospective cohort study of women receiving prenatal care during the 2009–2011
influenza seasons. Vaccination status was ascertained through our perinatal record system and
clinic vaccination logs. Pregnancy outcomes included a primary composite of miscarriage, fetal
demise, preterm birth (PTB) 537 weeks and neonatal demise. Stratification and logistic
regression were used to adjust for potential confounders.
Results: Of 3104 eligible pregnant women, 1094 (35%) received the influenza vaccine. Women
vaccinated were more likely to be older, obese, primiparae, and have medical complications
or a prior PTB. In univariable analyses, flu vaccination was associated with increased adverse
composite outcome and PTB. After multivariable adjustments, vaccination was no longer
associated with adverse outcomes in women with medical complications but remained
associated with adverse outcomes among those without known co-morbidity.
Conclusions: Vaccination was associated with an increased adverse composite outcome
in pregnant women without identified co-morbidity but not those with co-morbidities.
This association is likely due to selection bias, which should be considered in planning of
observational studies of the impact of vaccination on pregnancy outcomes.

Introduction
Women with influenza infection during pregnancy are more
likely to have severe illness and are at an increased risk for
adverse pregnancy outcomes [1]. Compared to the general
population, pregnant women with seasonal or pandemic
influenza are at least five times more likely to die or be
hospitalized with severe complications [2–10]. Influenza
infection in pregnancy has been variously associated with
increased risks of miscarriage, stillbirth, neonatal death,
preterm birth (PTB) and low birth weight (LBW) [2,6,7,
11–15]. In one case series of pandemic influenza, ‘‘pregnancy
interruption’’ (i.e. miscarriage, fetal death or premature
delivery) was reported in up to a third of pregnant patients,
and PTB was noted in 50% of patients with cardiopulmonary
complications of influenza [9]. A clinical trial of 340 mothers
who were randomized to either influenza vaccine or control
in the third trimester demonstrated a significant reduction in
influenza-like illness in women and infants as well as
confirmed influenza in vaccinated infants [16]. Assuming
these associations are true, vaccination by preventing
influenza infection may not only be safe from a fetal
perspective, it could potentially prevent adverse fetal
outcomes.
Despite universal recommendation in pregnancy, only a
minority of eligible pregnant US women receive the vaccine
annually [17,18]. Patient, provider, and health system barriers
and safety concerns contribute to the low vaccine uptake
[19–22]. This study was undertaken to identify the characteristics of women who accept the flu vaccine and to screen
the hypothesis that vaccination during pregnancy prevents
adverse fetal outcomes.
Methods
We conducted a retrospective cohort study of women
receiving prenatal care and delivering in our healthcare
system; consultations and referrals or transports were
excluded. Our prenatal care system is comprised of two
high-risk clinics (staffed by resident physicians) and six lowrisk neighborhood clinics (staffed by nurse practitioners).
Women presenting for prenatal care are routinely offered the
influenza vaccine during the influenza season (September to
April) and their vaccination status recorded. During the H1N1
pandemic, we incorporated a reminder system prompting the
provider to address influenza illness and vaccination status.
Thus, patients were encouraged to receive the influenza
vaccine and those who initially refuse were re-offered the
vaccine at return appointments. Women who reported

receiving the vaccination elsewhere were included in the
cohort if they provided the date of vaccination. Women
with singleton pregnancies during the 2009–2010 pandemic
and during the 2010–2011 influenza seasons were analyzed.
We further restricted the study population to women who had a
prenatal visit in the early flu season between 10/1 and 12/31
each year, when the vast majority of vaccines were given in
order to assure that vaccinated and unvaccinated groups had
similar exposure periods and avoid potential bias. Vaccination
status was ascertained through our perinatal record system and
vaccination logs. We also collected information on demographic, medical and obstetric characteristics of these women.
Pregnancy and neonatal outcomes included a primary composite outcome comprising miscarriage, stillbirth, PTB 537
weeks and neonatal demise. Other outcomes included LBW
(52500 g), preeclampsia, small for gestational age (SGA),
NICU admission, length of maternal stay and antiviral
(oseltamivir) therapy. Miscarriage was defined as delivery
prior to 20 weeks, stillbirth as delivery of a non-viable fetus
at or after 20 weeks, and SGA was defined by Brenner’s
standard for fetal growth less than the tenth percentile [23]. The
results for the primary outcome and selected perinatal
outcomes were stratified by the presence or absence of any
maternal medical complication (including diabetes, hypertension, asthma, or other conditions including hepatitis C, HIV,
lupus, sickle cell disease, liver transplant or renal disease).
We compared maternal characteristics and pregnancy
outcomes by vaccination status. Since 99% of all circulating
influenza viruses in the 2009–2010 season (when there were
two vaccines) were 2009 pandemic H1N1, vaccination status
for that year was based on receipt of the 2009 H1N1 vaccine
[24]. Therefore, women who received the H1N1 with or
without the seasonal flu vaccine were ‘‘vaccinated’’, while
those who did not receive the H1N1 vaccine were considered
unvaccinated (those who received only the seasonal flu
vaccine in 2009 were excluded from primary analyses).
Data were analyzed using SAS version 9.1 software (Cary,
NC). Chi square and Student’s t tests were used as appropriate
to compare the characteristics. Strategies including stratification and multivariable logistic regression were used to adjust
for potential confounding characteristics, including maternal
age, weight, ethnicity, parity, medical complications, tobacco
use, prior history of PTB, and gestational age at vaccination
or first visit in the vaccination window. p Value less than
0.05 was considered to represent statistical significance.
The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of
the University of Alabama at Birmingham.
Results
Out of 3694 women receiving prenatal care in our system
between 10/1 and 12/31 in 2009 and 2010, a total of 3104
pregnant women were included for the study. We excluded
108 patients with a multiple gestation and 48 with a fetal
abnormality suspected on ultrasound. Among the studied
women, 1094 (35%) overall received the influenza vaccine;
40% (666/1650) during the 2009/2010 pandemic season and
29% (428/1454) during the 2010–2011 season. Among 666
women in the 2009–2010 season who received a flu vaccine,
131 (19.7%) received both H1N1 and seasonal vaccine, 420
(63.1%) received H1N1 vaccine alone and only 115 (17.3%)
received seasonal vaccine alone. In the 2010–2011 seasons,
all 428 vaccinated women received the seasonal vaccine
(which incorporated the 2009 H1N1 pandemic strain).
Maternal characteristics for the vaccinated and unvaccinated women are presented in Table 1. Adjusted odds ratios
derived from a logistic regression to determine the independent relationship between maternal characteristics and vaccine
uptake are also presented in Table 1. Overall, Black and
Hispanic women were less likely to receive the vaccination
compared to Caucasian women. Women who received flu
vaccination were significantly more likely to be nulliparous,

slightly further in gestation, visit the high-risk complication
clinic, or to have medical complications such as diabetes,
asthma, chronic hypertension or sickle cell disease (Table 1).
The frequency of the various pregnancy outcomes by the
vaccine group are presented in Table 2. The unadjusted risk
of the primary composite adverse outcome (miscarriage,
stillbirth, PTB 537 weeks or neonatal demise) was higher
in the vaccinated group. The higher risk of the composite
outcome in those who were vaccinated was primarily driven
by the increased rate of PTB. Among secondary outcomes,
vaccination was associated with a modestly longer mean
maternal hospital stay. There were no significant differences
in LBW, preeclampsia, SGA or NICU admission.
Odds ratios for the association between study outcomes
including the primary composite and vaccination status after
adjusting for maternal age, weight, race, parity, medical
complications, tobacco use, prior PTB, preeclampsia, year
shot was given and gestational age at vaccination (or nonvaccination) are presented in Table 2. After multivariable
adjustments, vaccination status no longer remained associated
with an increase in the rate of the composite outcome (RR
1.2; [0.9, 1.6]). There was no significant association with
the individual and other adverse pregnancy outcomes. We
adjusted additionally for whether the patient visited our highrisk complications clinic at any time or received their prenatal
care entirely in the low-risk community clinic, which could
have contributed to the patient’s decision to receive the
vaccine. The composite outcome in women who received
the vaccine remained unchanged. Advancing gestational age
(completed weeks) at vaccination revealed a protective
association with the composite outcome: RR 0.95 (0.94,
0.96). A similar result (not shown) was observed for PTB.
To further evaluate whether vaccine uptake may have
differed by the presence or absence of medical co-morbidity
based on whether prenatal care was received in the highversus low-risk clinic, we conducted multivariable adjustments separately for those with and without medical
complications (Table 3). Vaccination was not associated
with any of the adverse outcomes in women with medical
complications. However, in women without medical complications, vaccination was associated with a 40% increase in
the primary composite outcome (RR 1.4; [1.0, 2.0]) driven
by a similar but non-significant increase in PTB.
Discussion
Our study reveals that overall vaccination was not associated
with an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes after
adjusting for confounding factors. Women with medical
co-morbidities or other risk factors for adverse outcomes
were more likely to accept the vaccination. Advancing
gestational age at vaccination revealed a protective association with both the composite outcome and PTB. When
stratified by the presence or absence of medical complications, low- risk women who received the influenza vaccine
had an increase in the composite outcome as compared to
those who did not receive the vaccination even after adjusting
for confounding factors. While there are data to suggest
that influenza is associated with adverse fetal outcomes and
vaccination decreases the incidence of influenza infection
in pregnancy, there are currently few published data
evaluating whether these translate to improved fetal outcomes
[16,25–27]. Recent large cohort studies have shown no
increase in the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes but have
been inconsistent regarding a possible benefit of influenza
vaccination for fetal outcomes including preterm birth or
stillbirths [28–31].

We do not believe that influenza vaccination causes
adverse pregnancy outcomes in low-risk women; instead our
findings likely represent the result of selection bias and
residual confounding. A subgroup of women without obvious
co-morbidities in our population may have other perceived
unmeasured risk factors for adverse outcomes that makes
more likely to accept the vaccination. Such a selection bias
in vaccine uptake will explain, at least in part, the association
between vaccination and adverse pregnancy outcomes; a bias
that is not overcome by considerable adjustments for potential confounding. Our results, therefore, do not refute the
hypothesis that vaccination may improve pregnancy outcomes
considering the data suggesting increased risk of maternal
and fetal adverse outcomes associated with influenza during
pregnancy [1–10]. Inversely, in settings where healthier
women are more likely to accept vaccination, the selection
bias may be manifested by improved outcomes in the vaccine
group. Similarly, if women at higher risk for adverse
outcomes are more likely to accept the vaccine at earlier
gestational ages, this would explain the observed protective
association between vaccination at later gestational ages and
pregnancy outcomes.
At least one prior study in non-pregnant patients has shown
variation in vaccine uptake by factors such as age, sex,
chronic illness, socioeconomic factors and ethnicity. Similar
to our observation, a recent study done in the UK specifically
demonstrated an increased vaccine uptake in patients with
underlying health conditions compared to the general population [32]. Adjustment for confounding is unlikely to correct
problems of self-selection in vaccine uptake. Therefore, this
type of bias is readily manifest in observational studies as
opposed to randomized trials. A prior observational study by
Munoz et al. compared pregnancy outcomes between a cohort
of healthy women who received the influenza vaccine and a
control group of healthy unvaccinated women. We computed
estimates from the data provided in the manuscript which
suggests a non-significant reduction in PTB among vaccinated women: RR 0.67; CI [0.3, 1.3] [25]. If a similar
selection bias existed in this study it is conceivable that the
true findings would suggest a protective effect of vaccination.
Our study is obviously limited by its non-randomized
retrospective design. Furthermore, the sample size may not be
sufficient for some outcomes. Other limitations include a lack
of specific data on potential confounders including prior
vaccination history. In addition, we were not able to directly
observe providers offering the vaccine each visit. However,
staff and physicians were reminded to offer the vaccine during
the flu season at each visit and automated prompts were built
into the perinatal record to document the vaccination status.
Overall, this study demonstrates the methodological limitations of studying the effects of influenza vaccination
through an observational, and particularly, retrospective
design. Selective vaccine uptake as demonstrated by our
results may lead to refractory bias. A randomized controlled
trial is ideal since it prevents or adjusts for the bias. Given
current recommendations, this is not ethical in the US and
many other settings. Therefore, the alternative strategy is to
conduct an observational study in which a relatively low-risk
group of pregnant women are offered the influenza vaccine
and detailed information on vaccination status and an
exhaustive list of potential confounders collected and used
for the analysis. These analyses would include matching on
some covariates and especially propensity scores analysis,
which can be used in observational studies to simulate a
randomized trial [33,34].
