Background:Associations between vaccinations, particularly hepatitis B, and onset of rheumatoid arthritis
(RA) have been reported, but examined in few large-scale studies.
Method: Onset of RA cases and dates of vaccination against hepatitis B, tetanus, and influenza were identified in a retrospective chart review of approximately 1 million Kaiser Permanente Northern California
members ages 15–59 years from 1997 through 1999. In a cohort analysis, rates of new-onset RA were
compared between vaccinated and unvaccinated within 90, 180, and 365 days. In a case-control analysis,
rates of vaccination during exposure intervals (90, 180, 365, and 730 days) were compared between cases
and controls using conditional logistic regression.
Results: 378 RA cases were included in the cohort analysis; 37 additional cases were included in the
case-control analysis. In the cohort analysis the relative risks of RA onset within 90, 180, or 365 days of
hepatitis B vaccination were not significant (R.R. = 1.44, p = 0.53; R.R. = 1.67, p = 0.22; R.R. = 1.23, p = 0.59
respectively). We found a possible association between RA and influenza vaccine in the previous 180
and 365 days in the cohort analysis (R.R = 1.36, p = 0.03; R.R. = 1.34, p = 0.01 respectively), but in the casecontrol analysis, cases were no more likely than controls to have received any of the three vaccines.
Conclusions: In this large retrospective study we found no statistically significant association between
exposure to hepatitis B vaccine and onset of RA. A possible association between RA and influenza vaccination in the cohort study was not borne out in the larger case-control analysis.

1. Introduction
Arthropathies, both acute and chronic, have been reported in
adults following vaccination against diseases such as tetanus [1],
rubella [2,3], and hepatitis B [4–7], but studies of causality have
produced conflicting results [8,9]. The evidence linking tetanus vaccine to arthritis is limited primarily to case reports (for example,
Ref. [10]); few cases have been reported to surveillance agencies
[1], and one large prospective study in Denmark in the 1960s identified no cases of arthritis among 2.5 million doses of monovalent
tetanus vaccine and 3.7 million doses of combined diphtheria and
tetanus vaccine [11], leading the United States Institute of Medicine

to declare in 1994 that the evidence was insufficient to determine
causality between tetanus toxoid and arthritis [1].
There have also been reports of onset of persistent arthritis
after rubella vaccination. One group of investigators in Canada
found an incidence of persistent or recurrent arthritis following
rubella vaccination as high as 5–11% in small studies of adult
women [2,3]. A subsequent randomized, placebo-controlled trial
found a significant association between rubella vaccination and
acute joint pain, and a marginally significant association with an
increased rate of chronic or recurrent arthralgia [9]. However,
this finding was not reproduced in a large retrospective cohort
study of 4300 women conducted by the Vaccine Safety Datalink
(VSD), which found no evidence of an association between rubella
vaccination and chronic arthropathy [8]. A review of influenza
and pneumococcal vaccines found them to be safe and immunogenic in patients with rheumatoid arthritis [12], and researchers
found no increase in autoantibodies after influenza vaccination
[13]. More recently, Swedish researchers did not find evidence of an

association between common vaccines and rheumatoid arthritis
[14] in a large case-control study where vaccination status was
based on questionnaires.
Most of the evidence that hepatitis B vaccination may play a
role in the development of arthritis has come from case reports
or case series [4–7,15]. In some of these patients, revaccination
reproduced symptoms or worsened symptoms that were already
present [15]. In Ontario, Canada [7], a cluster of 5 male firefighters developed arthritis within 2–3 weeks of receiving hepatitis
B vaccination, as did 6 female health care workers; 10 of these
11 cases met American College of Rhematology (ACR) criteria for
rheumatoid arthritis (RA)[16]. Notably, several differentlots of vaccine were used, and despite the overlap in occupation the affected
individuals worked in different locations; a possible contributing
factor is that 9 of the 11 had genetic risk factors for RA. Others
have used the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS)
database to investigate a possible association between hepatitis
B vaccination and RA as well as other autoimmune events and
reported a significantly higher risk of these adverse events following receipt of hepatitis B vaccine than following receipt of
tetanus and tetanus–diphtheria vaccines [17,18]. However, reports
to VAERS may not reflect true rates of event occurrence, may vary
with vaccine and time, and should not be construed as denoting
causality [19].
Here we used data from a large health maintenance organization to investigate the occurrence of RA within defined intervals
after vaccination for hepatitis B in individuals 15–59 years old,
using cohort and case-control designs. The ages of 15–59 were
chosen to maximize both new onset RA and use of the vaccine,
at a time of universal vaccination of infants, but a recommendation for vaccination of adults only with risk factors, determined
by occupation, sexual orientation, drug use and travel. Persons
younger than 15 were less likely to receive the diagnosis of RA,
and those over 59 were less likely to receive the vaccine. We
also analyzed the rates of RA after influenza and tetanus vaccines, the two most common vaccines given to those in this age
range.
2. Methods
2.1. Study population
The study population was drawn from members of the Northern California Kaiser Permanente Health Plan, a large health
maintenance organization with a total membership of approximately 3.2 million. All medical care for members is provided
through the health plan, and clinic visits and treatments are
all documented in comprehensive databases. Vaccinations are
provided to members without charge, and almost all vaccines
are received in the system, and recorded by the Kaiser Immunization Tracking System (KITS). The study was approved by
the Kaiser Foundation Research Institute’s Institutional Review
Board.
We identified a cohort of health plan members continuously
enrolled from January 1, 1995, through December 31, 1999, who
were aged 15 through 59 years during the period from January 1,
1997, through December 31, 1999. Continuous enrollment for 2
yearsprior to the study startdate ofJanuary 1, 1997, was requiredso
that complete medical records for all members would be available
in order to determine pre-existing disease and vaccine exposure
status. Persons with visits for RA and other inflammatory conditions prior to their follow-up start date were excluded. Vaccine
exposure status was determined from KITS and supplemented by
chart reviews. Chart reviews went back as far as 1986 to determine
prior vaccination status.
2.2. Medical record reviews
Inpatient and outpatient records of potential cases were
reviewed by trained medical record analysts (MRAs) to determine
case status, intervals between the first visit with an RA diagnosis in
the chart and actual onset date, and vaccine exposure status. MRAs
were instructedto review all records for eachsubjectthatpresented
for medical care any time between January 1, 1995, and the date
of review and to record any diagnoses of arthritis or joint complaints during the period from January 1, 1997, through the date of
review. Medical records were available for all subjects in the study.
Dates of symptom onset and initial diagnosis were recorded for
any diagnoses of RA, Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis, Still’s disease,
arthritis, arthralgia, or other joint complaints. Related diagnostic
test results, radiologic images, and medications prescribed for the
joint complaints were abstracted, and all immunization records
were searched dating back to January 1, 1986.
Following the medical record abstractions, potential cases were
categorized into three groups based on the ACR criteria for rheumatoid arthritis (included in Appendix A) [16]. Cases with a definite
diagnosis of RA that clearly met the ACR criteria were accepted as
“definite” cases, whereas cases without any evidence of arthritis or
joint complaint during the study period and who were also without a history of any inflammatory joint condition were rejected. All
other potential cases were referred for adjudication by the study
rheumatologist (A.D.). For all cases, the rheumatologist also provided a specific or estimated onset date of related symptoms.
2.3. Analysis
All RA cases classified as definite or probable were included in
the analyses described below. Exposure status (i.e., whether the
case was considered as vaccinated within a specific period before
developing RA) was based on the date that the RA symptoms began
rather than date of first RA diagnosis.
2.3.1. Cohort analysis
To assess whether exposure to vaccine resulted in a higher
incidence of RA, rates of new-onset RA were compared during
vaccine-exposed and vaccine-unexposed intervals within followup periods of 90, 180, and 365 days. The entire study population
contributed follow-up time. Vaccinated individuals contributed
unexposed follow-up time until they were vaccinated, after which
they were considered vaccinated for the remainder of the time
interval analyzed. The follow-up time began on January 1, 1997,
or on the 15th birthday, whichever came later. The follow-up time
ended on December 31, 1999, the 60th birthday, or the RA onset
date, whichever came earlier. Relative risks were adjusted for age,
sex, and race using Poisson regression because they are factors that
may be associated with both RA and vaccine exposure [20–23]. In
addition, because we noticed a marked increase in health care visits by the RA cases in our population during the year prior to the
date identified as the first onset of RA symptoms, the analyses also
adjusted for the number of health care visits within 1 year. We calculated the maximum attributable risk for hepatitis B vaccine using
the incidence of disease in the exposed and the upper limit of the
adjusted relative risk 95% confidence interval.
2.3.2. Case-control analysis
In the cohort analysis described above, the number of cases was
limited. In order to increase the number of cases analyzed and more
finely control for health care utilization, a matched case-control
analysis was undertaken that included as cases the incident cases
from the cohort analysis and additional new onset cases identified
from the study population whose symptoms began during 1996.
These cases were identified in the first phase of the study, but the

onset was found to be prior to 1997, so they had been rejected from
the original study. Accepting them as onset in 1996 meant that we
were only certain of one medical record for at least 1 year prior to
onset, rather than 2 years.
Each incident case was matched with three randomly selected
controls on age within 1 year and a categorical utilization variable
based on the number of clinic visits during the year prior to the
RA symptom onset date of the matched case (0, 1–2, 3–5, 6–9, or
10+ visits). The odds of vaccination with hepatitis B during various
exposure intervals (90, 180, 365, and 730 days) were compared
between cases and controls using conditional logistic regression
and adjusting for sex and race and exact number of utilization
visits. We noted an possible increase in utilization among cases
during the year prior to the electronic onset date of RA, which we
interpreted as possibly indicating earlier onset of symptoms before
diagnosis. Therefore, we added a 730-day exposure interval to the
90, 180, and 365 day intervals used in the cohort analysis. Similar comparisons were done for exposures to tetanus and influenza
vaccines.
3. Results
Approximately 1 million individuals met the criteria for inclusion in the study population (Table 1). They contributed a total of
2,587,111 person–years. Members ofthe study population received
212,268 doses of hepatitis B vaccine; 656,488 doses of influenza
vaccine; and 249,182 doses of tetanus vaccine during the study
period.
Overall, inpatient and outpatientmedical records of 2354 potential RA cases were reviewed (Fig. 1). A total of 628 cases (26.7%)
were accepted, including those classified as probable RA by the
rheumatologist. Of these, 550 cases (535 RA and 15 JRA) met our
case definition for definite RA based on the ACR criteria. All RA
cases were in individuals 16 years of age or older. In total, 378

probable and definite cases had their symptom onset during the
study follow-up period (1997–1999); an additional 37 probable
and definite cases had onset during 1996 and were included in the
case-control analysis.
The cohort analysis encompassed approximately 2.6 million
person–years, with subjects about evenly divided between male
and female (Table 1). The case-control analysis included 415 cases
with definite or probable RA, with a female-to-male ratio of about
3:1, and 1245 controls with a less pronounced female predominance (Table 2).
In the cohort analysis, the numbers of individuals who developed RA within 1 year of vaccination ranged from 7 for hepatitis B
vaccine to 113 for influenza vaccine. After adjustment for sex, race,
and number of utilization visits, the relative risks of RA onset 90,
180, or 365 days after exposure to hepatitis B vaccine were not significant (R.R. = 1.44 (p = 0.53, 95% CI 0.46–4.51); R.R. = 1.67 (p = 0.22,
95% CI 0.74–3.77); R.R. = 1.23 (p = 0.59, 95% CI 0.58–2.63) respectively)(Table 3). The relative risk of exposure to tetanus vaccine was
also not significant for any interval (90 days: R.R. = 1.36 (p = 0.34,
95% CI 0.72–2.54); 180 days: R.R. = 1.31 (p = 0.26, 95% CI 0.82–2.09);
365 days: R.R. = 1.34 (p = 0.01, 95% CI 0.62–1.37)). In contrast, individuals who received influenza vaccine were significantly more
likely to develop RA within 180 or 365 days following immunization (R.R = 1.36 (p = 0.03, 95% CI 1.03–1.80); R.R. = 1.34 (p = 0.01, 95%
CI 1.06–1.69) respectively).
The maximum attributable risk calculations for hepatitis B vaccine are as follows. We divided the number of exposed cases
(n = 6) by the upper limit of the 180-day confidence interval (3.77;
Table 3) to determine the number of cases expected without
vaccination (n = 1.59) and the number attributable to vaccination
(6 − 1.59 = 4.41). The 4.41 excess cases among 212,000 doses yields
a rate of 2.1 per 100,000 doses.
Of the additional cases with RA onset during 1996 that were
included in the case-control analysis, three were exposed to hepatitis B vaccine and two were exposed to tetanus vaccine, for a
total of 10 exposed to hepatitis B vaccine, 29 exposed to tetanus
vaccine, and 113 exposed to influenza vaccine within 1 year before
the onset of their RA (Table 4). Cases were not significantly more
likely than controls to have received any of the three vaccines in
any of the intervals examined (Table 4). For hepatitis B vaccine for
90 days R.R. = 1.5 (p = 0.55, 95% CI 0.4–5.2); for 180 days R.R. = 2.0
(p = 0.14, 95% CI 0.8–5.1); for 365 days R.R. = 1.4 (p = 0.39, 95% CI
0.6–3.1); and for 730 days R.R. = 1.0 (p = 0.91, 95% CI 0.5–2.12). For
tetanus vaccine for 90 days R.R. = 0.8 (p = 0.48, 95% CI 0.4–1.6); for
180 days R.R. = 1.1 (p = 0.84, 95% CI 0.6–1.8); for 365 days R.R. = 0.8
(p = 0.31, 95% CI 0.5–1.2); and for 730 days R.R. = 0.8 (p = 0.20, 95% CI
0.6–1.12). For influenza vaccine for 90 days R.R. = 0.7 (p = 0.14, 95%
CI 0.4–1.2); for 180 days R.R. = 1.1 (p = 0.57, 95% CI 0.8–1.6); for 365
days R.R. = 1.1 (p = 0.43, 95% CI 0.9–1.5); and for 730 days R.R. = 1.1
(p = 0.59, 95% CI 0.8–1.4). Among the subjects included in the casecontrol analysis, blacks and Hispanics had significantly higher risk
of having RA than whites (Table 5).
4. Discussion
Individual cases of RA and other autoimmune disease occurring
after vaccination have been reported for years [3–7,9,24]. In a few
instances, such as the 1976–1977 influenza vaccine and GuillainBarré syndrome [25,26] and the RA 27/3 rubella vaccine and acute
arthritis [1], a close association was found. However, for many

other vaccines and diseases, including hepatitis B vaccine and RA,
the link remains uncertain. RA is thought to develop in genetically
susceptible individuals in response to environmental stimuli, and
activation of the immune system through infection or vaccination
has been postulated as a possible trigger for the onset or worsening of autoimmune diseases [27,28]. Individuals with HLA variants
associated with RA have been among those reported to develop
arthritis after hepatitis B vaccination [7,15]. In some cases, additional doses of the vaccine worsened the symptoms, supporting
a causal link. In contrast, vaccination of patients with active RA
against hepatitis B did not worsen clinical or laboratory measures
of the disease in a small, controlled study [29].
Very few controlled studies have been performed to resolve
these conflicting findings. Although large case-control studies have
found no association between hepatitis B vaccine and multiple sclerosis [30,31],to our knowledge, only one other large scale study has
been reported to look at the association between RA and vaccines
[32].
In our initial cohort analysis, we found a possible association
between RA and influenza vaccine in the previous 180 or 365 days,
but the extended case-control analysis, bringing in more data, did
not demonstrate this increase. We found no statistically significant association between exposure to hepatitis B vaccine and RA
in either the cohort or case-control study, although non-significant
elevations in risk were seen for intervals of 90, 180, and 365 days
after vaccination. The power ofthis study was probably low, and we
therefore cannot entirely rule out an association between hepatitis
B vaccination and RA, but using the upper limit of the confidence
interval we were able to rule out more than 2.1 cases per 100,000
vaccine recipients.
In our case-control study of a large population of health plan
members, the incidence of RA increased with age and occurred
predominantly in females, consistent with previous knowledge
[20,21]. However, the incidence of RA in our population was lower
than that found in other populations, possibly because rates continue to rise into the 7th decade [33], but our age cutoff was 59. This
contributed to the low power in the study. We also found that RA
patients had higher numbers of health care visits than other plan
members in the year before their diagnosis. This increased use of
health care in RA patients may be related to the insidious onset
of many cases of RA [34,35], and the increased exposure to the
clinic may also increase the likelihood of vaccination [23]. However,
further matching on utilization showed that this is a minor influence (data not shown) and may be accounted for by differences in
utilization by sex.
There is a potential for residual confounding in our study, if any
indication or contraindication for vaccination were also a cause
of RA i.e., if hepatitis B disease, occupation, sexual orientation, or
travel were a also a risk for RA. We are not aware of any established
link between RA and Hepatitis B, medical profession, travel, or men
who have sex with men.
The biggest limitation of the study, however, and a lesson
learned, is that observational studies of chronic diseases with
insidious onset, such as RA, are limited by difficulty in determining the date of onset of illness. Electronic records reveal a
visit for a condition, but many people present for medical care
some time after symptoms begin, after exhausting home and overthe-counter remedies. Chart review of cases, though costly and
time-consuming, greatly benefited the veracity of the study, but
even with chart review by a rheumatologist it was sometimes difficult to determine the exact onset of symptoms. In addition, we
were limited by sample size; if a very small risk of RA in association
with vaccines does exist, a larger study would be needed to detect
it.
