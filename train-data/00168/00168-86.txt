Abstract. The aim of the present case-control study
was to ascertain whether, in adults, yearly repeated
anti-in¯uenza vaccinations (AIV) enhance protection
against cutaneous melanoma (CM), as do repeated
febrile infections. Ninety-nine new cases of histologically con®rmed CM and 104 healthy controls (matched to cases for sex, age, and skin colour) selected
from the general population were examined in order
to ascertain their skin type, the number of nevi on
both arms, and the intensity of freckles on the face
and the arms; in these subjects, a structured questionnaire was used to obtain information on age, sex,
education, social class, exposure and susceptibility to
sunlight, history of febrile infectious diseases, and
vaccinations. The odds ratio (OR) and the 95%
con®dence interval (CI) were estimated by commonly
used methods and by ®tting models of logistic
regression. The risk of CM was reduced in subjects
with a history of febrile (temperature above 38.5 °C)
infections in the 5 years prior to CM surgery (cases)
or interview (controls), but was increased in those
with voluntary exposure to sunlight in tropical
countries. By holding the above factors constant at
logistic regression analysis, it was found that a history of repeated AIV (3±5 times in the last 5 years)
halved the risk (OR: 0.43; CI: 0.19±1.00; p < 0.05).
With the variable `nevi on arms' included, the protective in¯uence of repeated AIVs was observed in a
similar magnitude. The inverse relationship found
between melanoma and in¯uenza vaccinations is
unlikely to have depended on a bias, even if based on
replies in a questionnaire, because neither the interviewers nor the interviewers were informed in
advance of the working hypothesis.

Introduction
An increased risk of CM has been reported after
immunosuppressive therapy [1±4], and after exposure
entailing a lower cutaneous immunosurveillance,
through solar or arti®cial UV-A radiation [5, 6], and
photochemotherapy with psoralen [7±9]. On the
other hand, in numerous case-reports collected in a
recent review [10], a spontaneous regression of CM
was found to occur during concomitant infectious
disease. Moreover, in two hospital-based case-control studies, febrile infections in the previous ®ve
years were found to reduce the risk of CM [11, 12].
An increase in body temperature may therefore have
marked eects on the immune defence of the host
[13].
These ®ndings might lead to a reduction in the use
of antibiotics, anti-in¯ammatory drugs and vaccines.
It is known that in¯uenza, among other common
infections, has a protective eect against CM [11, 12]
and dierent types of cancer [14]; so the administration of AIV might increase the risk of CM. However,
the vaccine itself acts as a speci®c (and probably also
aspeci®c) immune stimulator, possibly providing
protection against melanoma. Data collected in a
population-based case-control study are here analysed in order to investigate whether, holding constant the protective (febrile infections in the last ®ve
years) and the risk (skin factors and sun exposure)
factors for CM, the anti-in¯uenza vaccine, among
others, has a role in the aetiology of this immunosensitive type of cancer.

Subjects and methods
The cases were subjects with a ®rst, histopathologically veri®ed, diagnosis of CM made between 1 January 1994 and 31 December 1995, and consecutively
observed at the clinical centres where the researchers
worked. The controls, who were healthy subjects selected from the general population, were matched to
the cases by the method of frequency matching for
the confounding variables age, sex, and skin colour.
All cases and control subjects, residents in the Province of Verona or in the Local Health Authority no.
16 of Padova, were interviewed between 1 January
1994 and 1 April 1997. The search for a suitable case
or control was abandoned after three barren contacts.
Criteria for inclusion were: age above 18 years at
interview (cases and controls); histologic diagnosis of
melanoma, and a time interval between surgical removal of the tumour and interview of less than
1 year; alive at interview status. Criteria for exclusion
were: history of AIDS (cases and controls); history of
cancer (controls only).
A structured questionnaire, administered by trained
interviewers, contained questions on: age; sex; degree
of education; social, marital, and professional status;
sun exposure; skin type; past infectious illnesses; and
vaccine inoculations. In relation to the aetiology and
fever, past infectious illnesses were divided into:
Group I, severe cases (fever not elevated; under
38.5 °C; above 38.5 °C); and Group II, less severe
conditions that occurred in the 5 years before surgery
(cases) or interview (controls), with fever lower or
higher than 38.5 °C. The questionnaire was designed
to obtain information on the following vaccinations:
AIV; BCG; ASV. After the interview, the interviewer
examined the skin of cases and controls in order to
ascertain: skin type; number of nevi on the skin of both
arms measuring more than 2 mm; intensity of freckles
on face and, separately, on arms according to an
analogic scale ranging from 0 (absence) to 100 (max
intensity). Finally, the microscopic and macroscopic
features of the tumour, traced in clinical records, were
transcribed to the patients' questionnaires.
Risk estimates quantifying the in¯uence of exposure factors on the occurrence of melanoma were
calculated as the OR, accompanied by their asymptotic 95% CI, from contingency tables and by using
logistic regression modelling [15]. In the latter case,
we used a dependent variable which was 1 for cases
and 0 for controls, and several explanatory categorical variables; for a variable with several levels, the
reference group was always the ®rst level. All reported p-values were two-sided and the conventional
level of 5% was employed for assessing statistical
signi®cance. The statistical analysis was performed
using a BMDP package [16].
Results
Eight subjects (4 cases and 4 controls) were excluded
from the study because they refused to collaborate
and/or did not meet the eligibility criteria. Among the
remaining 203 subjects available for the statistical
analysis, 99 (45 men, 54 women) were cases and 104
(46 men, 58 women) controls.
Only immunisation against in¯uenza provides
protection against melanoma. Table 1 shows that the
frequencies of melanoma have a signi®cant linear
downward trend (v2
trend  3:888; p < 0.0486) in relation to the number of AIV received during the
5 years prior to the diagnosis (cases) or interview
(controls). In the sub-sample of subjects who received
three or more inoculations of AIV in the last 5 years,
the decrease in the risk of CM was signi®cant
(p < 0.05) and clinically relevant (OR: 0.40; CI:
0.18±0.87). With all other vaccinations, the ®ndings
were not statistically signi®cant (data not shown).
Table 2 shows the distribution of cases and controls (with OR and CI) according to two criteria of
classi®cation: number of Group II illnesses occurring
in the last 5 years with a body temperature above
38.5 °C (column variable, with three levels: no; 1; 2 or
more episodes); and frequency of AIV in the previous
5 years (row variable, with two levels: 0±2 times; 3±5
times). Table 2 also shows the combined distribution
of the two variables in the cells at each row and
column interception. On focusing on the various cells
of row and column interceptions, and using the group
with the lowest levels for both factors as a reference,
the OR was 0.09 in subjects with the highest number
of AIV and febrile infections; this value is close to
0.08, the product of 0.20 ´ 0.40 (column and row
ORs, respectively). This was the case for all the other
