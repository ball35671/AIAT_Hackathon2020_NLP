Abstract
Antigen-speci®c mucosal immunity is thought to be important for protection against in¯uenza virus infection. Currently
licensed parenteral in¯uenza vaccines stimulate the production of serum antibodies, but are poor inducers of mucosal immunity.
The adjuvant MF59 has been shown to enhance the humoral immune response to parenteral in¯uenza vaccine in humans and
the mucosal immune response to intranasally-administered in¯uenza vaccine in mice. We conducted an open-label safety study
followed by an observer-blind, randomized trial comparing the immune response to intranasally-administered subunit in¯uenza
vaccine adjuvanted with MF59, unadjuvanted subunit in¯uenza vaccine, and placebo. Adverse reactions did not occur
signi®cantly more frequently in vaccinees than placebo recipients. Of 31 subjects receiving 2 doses of MF59-adjuvanted in¯uenza
vaccine, 19 (61%), 8 (26%), and 11 (35%) developed a mucosal IgA response to in¯uenza A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and B,
respectively. The percentage of subjects with a serum antibody response was slightly lower. The immune responses to adjuvanted
vaccine were not signi®cantly dierent from those to unadjuvanted vaccine. Both vaccines gave more frequent responses than
seen in placebo recipients, indicating the potential of intranasal inactivated vaccines to stimulate local IgA responses. 7 2000

1. Introduction
Each year, infection with in¯uenza virus results in
approximately 20,000±30,000 deaths in the United
States, primarily in adults more than 65 years old
[1,2]. Currently licensed in¯uenza vaccines consist of
formalin-inactivated whole virus or split virus preparations and demonstrate overall ecacy rates of 60±
90% [3±5]. However, ecacy can be considerably
lower in certain populations, particularly the elderly
[6]. In¯uenza vaccines are administered parenterally
and stimulate primarily a serum antibody response [7].
An in¯uenza vaccine administered intranasally might
allow the development of both serum and local secretory antibody responses, providing additional proVaccine 19 (2001) 217±226

tection by stimulating an immune response at the
mucosal portal of entry, and thereby preventing infection before signi®cant viral replication occurs [7]. The
recent demonstration of protective ecacy following
intranasal administration of live attenuated in¯uenza
vaccines strengthens the argument for the importance
of mucosal immunity to in¯uenza [8,9].
The adjuvant MF59 is a submicron oil-in-water
emulsion composed of 5% squalene, 0.5% Tween 80,
and 0.5% Span 85 that has been shown to be safe
when administered intramuscularly in humans [10].
Clinical trials of human immunode®ciency virus and
herpes simplex virus subunit vaccines adjuvanted with
MF59 and administered parenterally have been completed [11±14]. To date, MF59 has been administered
parenterally to >18,000 subjects in clinical trials; in
addition, >500,000 doses of a licensed parenteral
in¯uenza vaccine adjuvanted with MF59 (FluAd2)
have been distributed in Italy (data on ®le, Chiron
Corp, Emeryville, CA).
The addition of MF59 increased the immunogenicity
and protective ecacy of a parenterally administered
inactivated in¯uenza vaccine given to mice [15]. An
adjuvant eect was also seen when this combination
was administered parenterally to larger animals [16]
and to man [17] Recently, MF59 was demonstrated to
enhance the mucosal and systemic immunogenicity of
subunit in¯uenza vaccine when administered intranasally to mice [18]. However, the addition of MF59 to
an intranasally administered vaccine has not been studied in humans. We sought to compare the safety and
immunogenicity of three intranasally administered products: inactivated subunit in¯uenza vaccine, inactivated subunit in¯uenza vaccine adjuvanted with
MF59, and saline placebo.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Vaccine and placebo
Unadjuvanted vaccine (Agrippal S12) was supplied
by Biocine S.p.A. (Sienna, Italy) and contained highly
puri®ed surface antigens of in¯uenza, propagated in
embryonated chicken eggs, and inactivated with formaldehyde [19]. The vaccine contained 15 mg each of
the three 1997±1998 in¯uenza hemagglutinin antigens,
A/Bayern/7/95-like strain, A/Wuhan/359/95-like strain
(H3N2), and B/Beijing/184/93-like strain per 0.5 ml
dose. Each dose also contained 4 mg sodium chloride,
0.1 mg potassium chloride, 0.1 mg potassium dihydrogen phosphate, 0.66 mg disodium phosphate dihydrate,
0.06 mg calcium chloride, 0.05 mg magnesium chloride, 0.05 mg sodium ethylmercurothiosalicylate, and
sterile water.
Adjuvanted vaccine consisted of the above vaccine
combined with MF59 (Chiron, Emeryville, CA). In addition to Agrippal S12, each 0.5 ml of adjuvanted vaccine contained 9.75 mg squalene, 1.75 mg polysorbate
80 (Tween 80) NF, 1.75 mg sorbitan trioleate, 0.66 mg
sodium citrate, and 0.04 mg citric acid. The placebo
consisted of 0.5 ml of sterile saline. Both study drugs
and placebo were administered intranasally using a
nasal spray device (Pfeier, Princeton, NJ) that delivers a ®ne mist (particle size 40±50 mm) of 100 ml per
actuation (5 actuations per subject).
2.2. Subjects
Healthy adults aged 18±40 years were recruited to
volunteer for the study. Persons with an underlying
medical condition, including diabetes, cancer, autoimmune disease, and asthma or other pulmonary diseases were excluded. In addition, subjects with current
symptoms of allergic rhinitis, those with previous nasal
surgery, and those currently taking intranasal medications were excluded. Persons who had received an
in¯uenza vaccine within the previous 6 months were
excluded. Those who had received in¯uenza vaccine in
previous years were not excluded. All subjects provided informed consent. The Vanderbilt Institutional
Review Board approved the study.
2.3. Study design
The trial was conducted in two parts. An open-label
pilot study was performed ®rst to assess safety of adjuvanted and unadjuvanted vaccine, with 12 subjects per
group. After all 24 subjects tolerated their ®rst dose of
vaccine, the randomized portion of the trial was
begun. Subjects in both the open-label and placebocontrolled portions of the study received 2 intranasal
immunizations 28 (24) days apart. The main portion
of the trial was a randomized, placebo-controlled,
single-center study. Subjects and investigators were
blinded. Nurses administering study drug were not
blinded, as the adjuvanted vaccine has a milky white
appearance; they did not take part in subsequent clinical assessment of the subjects. Fifty subjects were
enrolled in this portion of the trial and were randomized to receive unadjuvanted in¯uenza subunit vaccine
n  18), in¯uenza subunit vaccine adjuvanted with
MF59 n  19), or placebo n  13). One subject in the
unadjuvanted vaccine group withdrew following the
®rst immunization for personal reasons and is excluded
from the analysis. The subject did not contribute any
adverse event data.
2.4. Safety data
All subjects were observed for 30 min following the
immunizations and were required to return 2 days
218 T.G. Boyce et al. / Vaccine 19 (2001) 217±226
later for evaluation of local and systemic reactions.
Subjects completed a diary card for 7 days following
the immunizations to record any local or systemic
reactions. Subjects were also asked if any reaction
caused them to stay home or if they had taken any
analgesic or antipyretic medications. Adverse events
were recorded through 28 days following the ®nal immunization. Severe adverse events requiring a physician visit were recorded through 180 days.
2.5. Immunogenicity
Serum, nasal wick samples, and nasal wash samples
were obtained at day 0 and 28 (24) days after each of
the 2 vaccinations. Serum antibody response was
determined using hemagglutination inhibition (HAI)
and IgA ELISA. All sera for each patient were tested
simultaneously. Subjects were considered HAI seronegative if their specimen before vaccination had an HAI
titer <1:10. A seroresponse to vaccine antigens was
de®ned as a rise in antibody titer r4-fold between
appropriate paired specimens to respective antigens or
a rise from <1:10 to 1:20. The HAI assay was done
with in¯uenza antigens to each of the vaccine strains.
The initial serum dilution for HAI was 1:10 [20,21].
Serum total IgA was determined by capture enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with coating of
the plate with rabbit anti-human IgA, addition of the
unknown sample, and detection of IgA using a phosphatase labeled goat anti-human IgA. Each serum
sample was then diluted to a concentration of 20 mg/
dl of total IgA (or to 2 mg/dl for samples with less
than 20 mg/dl of total IgA). Using the diluted sample,
serum in¯uenza-strain speci®c IgA was determined by
standard endpoint ELISA, with coating of the plate
with puri®ed in¯uenza hemagglutinin and the use of
the same phosphatase labeled goat anti-human IgA
and is reported as the concentration (mg/dl) in 20 mg/
dl of total IgA. (For samples diluted to 2 mg/dl of
total IgA, the result is multiplied by 10 to approximate
the amount of in¯uenza-speci®c IgA per 20 mg/dl of
total IgA.) A response to vaccine was de®ned as a r4-
fold rise between paired specimens.
Nasal wick (Merocel, Mystic, CT) and nasal wash
samples were collected as previously described [22].
Wicks were placed in 2 ml phosphate buered saline,
centrifuged at 2000 x g for 10 min, and the following
protease inhibitors, all from Boehringer Mannheim
(Indianapolis, IN), were added to the supernatant: 2 ml
each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin and 20 ml
of phenylmethylsulfonyl ¯uoride. Three milliliters of
receptor destroying enzyme (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA) and 2 ml of sodium
citrate were added to give a ®nal dilution of 1:4 from
the original wick elution. Because all the concentrated
nasal wash samples had undetectable or very low total
IgA levels, no nasal wash data is presented here.
Total secretory IgA was determined using Nanorid2
radial immunodiusion kits (The Binding Site, Birmingham, UK) with a secretory IgA standard, and
strain-speci®c IgA was determined by kinetic ELISA
[9]. All samples from the same subject were run in the
same assay. The value reported (corrected value) was
calculated by dividing the strain-speci®c IgA by the
total secretory IgA [9]. If the mean of duplicate nasal
wick samples was <5 mOD/min, the corrected value
was taken to be half the corrected value corresponding
to 5 mOD/min for that assay. Similarly, if there was
no detectable total IgA, the value was taken to be half
the value of the minimum value detectable by RID on
ultralow plates (0.43 mg/l). Subjects were considered to
have developed an in¯uenza-speci®c IgA response if
either (a) their prevaccination nasal wick sample was
<5 mOD/min and their postvaccination sample was
r5 mOD/min, or (b) they demonstrated a r4-fold rise
in antigen-speci®c IgA level in nasal wick samples
when corrected for total secretory IgA [9].
2.6. Statistical analysis
Discrete data were analyzed using the chi-square test
(or Fisher's exact test if any expected cell count was
<1 or if >20% of the cells had an expected count
<5). Mean in¯uenza-speci®c IgA and HAI geometric
mean titers (GMT) were analyzed using one way
analysis of variance linear model, with terms for vaccine eect using log 10 titers. Geometric mean ratios
(GMR) were calculated similarly using log 10 ratio of
titers. Comparison of mucosal IgA response with HAI
response was done using Pearson correlation. Analysis
was done using SAS version 7.00 (Cary, NC). Twotailed P values <0.05 were considered signi®cant.
3. Results
3.1. Demographic characteristics
Combining the open label and the placebo-controlled portions of the trial, 31 subjects received adjuvanted vaccine, 30 received unadjuvanted vaccine, and
13 received placebo. Females made up 84%, 67%, and
69% of the 3 respective groups. Caucasians made up
87%, 93%, and 77% of the 3 respective groups. The
proportion in each group that had received in¯uenza
vaccination in previous years was 29% in the adjuvanted vaccine group, 40% in the unadjuvanted vaccine group, and 23% in the placebo group. None of
the above comparisons between groups were statistically signi®cant.

3.2. Safety
The safety data for all subjects is presented in
Table 1. In general, both vaccines were well tolerated, with no reactions occurring signi®cantly more
frequently among vaccinees than controls. A separate analysis of the randomized subjects also demonstrated no signi®cant dierence in adverse reactions
(data not shown).
Three subjects experienced reactions during the 7-
day postimmunization period that required them to
stay home. A 36-year-old woman in the open-label
study developed severe headache and moderate
malaise, nausea, and myalgias 1 day after her second
immunization with adjuvanted vaccine. Symptoms
resolved within 24 h. A 27-year-old woman in the randomized portion of the trial reported moderate nausea
and diarrhea 1 and 2 days after the ®rst immunization
with unadjuvanted vaccine. She had completely recovered by day 3. A 36-year-old woman with a history of
migraine headaches experienced an unpleasant taste 30
min after receiving the adjuvanted vaccine in the randomized trial. The following day she developed severe
headache with mild nausea and chills, lasting for 2
days. She was treated with hydrocodone and prochlorperazine. None of the subjects in the study were hospitalized or withdrew from the study due to adverse
events.
3.3. Mucosal IgA response
Among recipients of both adjuvanted and unadjuvanted vaccine, GMTs to in¯uenza A/H1N1 and B
strains increased signi®cantly in response to vaccination (Table 2). This eect was most pronounced
after 2 doses of adjuvanted vaccine. In contrast, recipients of neither vaccine showed an increased GMT to
in¯uenza A/H3N2. For all 3 antigens, the percentage
of subjects demonstrating a mucosal IgA response to 1
and 2 doses of vaccine was greater among recipients of
both vaccines than among placebo recipients. However, this dierence in response rate was statistically
signi®cant only for the response to in¯uenza A/H1N1
after 2 doses of either adjuvanted or unadjuvanted
vaccine. In addition, for none of the 3 antigens was
there a signi®cant dierence in the percentage of responses between those receiving adjuvanted and unadjuvanted vaccines. For both vaccines, a greater
percentage of recipients responded to 2 doses than to 1
dose of vaccine. However, these dierences were statistically signi®cant only for in¯uenza A/H1N1 p 
0:02 for response to 2 doses vs. 1 dose of adjuvanted
vaccine and p  0:03 for response to 2 doses vs. 1 dose
of unadjuvanted vaccine).
3.4. Serum IgA response
As with mucosal IgA, serum IgA titers (Table 3)
increased among recipients of both vaccines. For A/

H1N1 and B antigens, the GMRs to 1 and 2 doses
were signi®cantly greater in vaccine recipients than in
placebo recipients. However, only a small percentage
of vaccinees, <25% for each antigen, developed a 4-
fold rise in response to 1 or 2 doses of vaccine.
3.5. HAI response
Prior to vaccination, the number of subjects with an
initial HAI titer of >1:10 was 61 (84%) for A/H1N1,
73 (100%) for A/H3N2, and 60 (82%) for B, indicating the anticipated previous widespread exposure to
in¯uenza strains related to the vaccine components.
The number of subjects with preimmunization HAI
titers r1:40 varied with antigen. Among recipients of
adjuvanted vaccine, 68%, 100%, and 58% had preimmunization HAI titers r1:40 to A/H1N1, A/H3N2,
and B antigens, respectively. For recipients of unadjuvanted vaccine, the corresponding percentages were
69%, 100%, and 62%, and for placebo recipients,
92%, 100%, and 62%.
In general, HAI responses (Table 4) paralleled the
mucosal and serum IgA responses, in that titers to
in¯uenza A/H1N1 and B (but not A/H3N2) increased
modestly among vaccine recipients. Similarly, the proportion of subjects experiencing a 4-fold or greater rise
in HAI titers was greater among recipients of either
vaccine compared with placebo recipients, but this
dierence was statistically signi®cant only for the A/
H1N1 response to 2 doses of vaccine. Furthermore,
HAI responses did not dier signi®cantly between recipients of adjuvanted and unadjuvanted vaccines. As
measured by HAI response, 2 doses did not appear to
be more immunogenic than a single dose.
3.6. Correlation and strati®ed analyses
There were moderate correlations between HAI and
mucosal IgA for in¯uenza, A/H1N1 and B, but not
for A/H3N2. The correlation coecients for the GMR
(Day 56/Day 0), comparing HAI to mucosal IgA, were
as follows: A/H1N1, 0.49 p < 0:01); A/H3N2, ÿ0.03
p  0:79); and B, 0.41 p < 0:01). In spite of the correlations, it is important to emphasize that mucosal responses were frequently seen in the absence of a serum
HAI response with all 3 antigens. For the GMR (Day
56/Day 0), comparing HAI to serum IgA, the coe-
cients among the three antigens were 0.73 p < 0:01),
ÿ0.04 p  0:75), and 0.45 p < 0:01), respectively. For
the GMR (Day 56/Day 0) comparing mucosal IgA to
serum IgA the coecients were 0.65 p < 0:01), 0.45
p < 0:01), and 0.44 p < 0:01).

Because an HAI titer of 1:40 is generally considered
protective [23], we analyzed the serum and mucosal
IgA responses strati®ed by whether the preimmunization HAI was R1:40 or >1:40 (Table 5). (There were
insucient numbers of subjects with preimmunization
HAI titers <1:40 to use r1:40 as the cuto level.) As
seen in Table 5, a preimmunization HAI titer >1:40
predicted a lack of HAI response, but did not consistently predict a lack of mucosal response.
4. Discussion
Despite the availability and increasing use of parenteral in¯uenza vaccines, in¯uenza remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide
[1,24]. Use of an intranasal in¯uenza vaccine might
have the eect of stimulating a better local immune
response, with the hope that this would translate
into ecacy rates higher than seen with the currently licensed in¯uenza vaccines [3±5]. Recently, an
intranasally-administered live-attenuated in¯uenza
vaccine has been shown to be safe, immunogenic,
and highly ecacious in healthy children [8]. In a
study of adults and children, the protective ecacy
of this vaccine approximated that of parenteral
in¯uenza vaccine [3]. However, in persons with preexisting antibodies from previous infections, replication of this vaccine may be diminished [25]. In a
study of adults aged 65 years and older, live-attenuated vaccines did not appear to be any more immunogenic than inactivated in¯uenza vaccines [26],
although the combined use of inactivated vaccine
and live attenuated vaccine in the elderly may oer
greater protection [27].
Intranasal administration of inactivated in¯uenza
virus was ®rst reported in 1947 [28]. Work done in the
1960s demonstrated that inactivated in¯uenza vaccines
administered by this route stimulated the production
of nasal IgA antibodies, and to a lesser extent, serum
IgG antibodies [29,30]. In one study, the ecacy of
inactivated in¯uenza vaccine administered via aerosol
was superior to the parenteral route [31]. In an attempt
to increase the immunogenicity of inactivated or subunit vaccines, various adjuvants have been developed
[32]. One of these, MF59, is an oil-in-water emulsion
that has been shown to be safe when administered
intramuscularly to humans [10]. A recent study of subunit in¯uenza vaccines adjuvanted with MF59 and
administered intranasally to naiÈ
ve mice demonstrated
the production of in¯uenza-speci®c IgA in the nasal secretions of 43 (78%) of 55 mice [18]. Our study is the

®rst trial conducted in humans of an intranasal in¯uenza vaccine adjuvanted with MF59.
Overall, both adjuvanted and unadjuvanted vaccines
were easy to administer and well tolerated, with no
reactions occurring signi®cantly more commonly than
with placebo. In general, the rate of adverse reactions
among vaccinees in our study was similar to that seen
in persons receiving inactivated in¯uenza vaccine intramuscularly [3]. One possible exception was headache,
which was a relatively common side eect of both the
adjuvanted and unadjuvanted vaccines in our study,
occurring in 42% and 41% of subjects, respectively.
(Neither of these was signi®cantly dierent from the
23% rate of headache reported by placebo recipients.)
Two (3.2%) of 62 immunizations with adjuvanted vaccine and 1 (1.7%) of 59 immunizations with unadjuvanted vaccine were associated with symptoms severe
enough to require the subject to stay home. Whether
these reactions were causally related to vaccine administration is unknown.
We were able to measure serum and mucosal
immune responses to all 3 antigens. The percentage of
subjects with a 4-fold rise in HAI titer to 2 doses of
adjuvanted vaccine ranged from 10% (A/H3N2) to
35% (A/H1N1). In studies of inactivated in¯uenza
vaccine given intramuscularly, the percentage of subjects with an HAI response has varied depending on
whether the subject had received the vaccine in recent
years. In a study by Edwards et al., 69% to 73% of
children and adults who were receiving their initial
dose of vaccine demonstrated an HAI response [3].
However, in subsequent years, the percentage of vaccinees demonstrating an HAI response was only 17% to
19%. Similar antibody responses were reported by
Couch et al. in a study of adults 30±60 years old
receiving inactivated in¯uenza vaccine. In that study,
among subjects receiving their ®rst in¯uenza vaccination in at least 3 years, responses ranged from 20%
to 74% [33]. However, among those who had received
the vaccine annually for 2 or more years, the percentage of respondents was between 3% and 29%. In our
study, 9 (29%) of the 31 recipients of adjuvanted vaccine had received inactivated in¯uenza vaccine in
recent years. As predicted, an HAI response was much
less common among subjects with preimmunization
HAI titers >1:40 from either prior vaccine or natural
in¯uenza infection than among those with preimmunization HAI titers R1:40 (Table 5). In the most comparable comparison, adults receiving the same
composition in¯uenza vaccine adjuvanted with MF59
by the parenteral route had HAI responses between
50% to 69% to the same H1, H3 and B strains used in

this study [17]. Thus, it is likely that the intranasal
route is not as immunogenic as an intramuscular injection for a humoral antibody response.
While previous immunity and route of administration may explain the relatively low percentage of
vaccinees who developed a serum immune response,
these factors may not predict a mucosal immune response. We have previously demonstrated that among
children receiving a live attenuated intranasal in¯uenza
vaccine, seropositivity predicted a lack of HAI response but not a lack of mucosal IgA response [9].
This is corroborated in the current study: for all 3 vaccine antigens, a higher percentage of vaccinees demonstrated a mucosal immune response than serum
immune response (as measured by HAI or serum IgA).
Furthermore, the presence of preimmunization serum
antibody appeared to have little eect on the mucosal
IgA response (Table 5). This suggests that an intranasally-administered subunit in¯uenza vaccine might be
protective even in the absence of a detectable serum
immune response.
Among recipients of adjuvanted in¯uenza vaccine,
61%, 26%, and 35% demonstrated a mucosal
immune response to in¯uenza A/H1N1, A/H3N2,
and B, respectively. Our study did not include a
group receiving inactivated in¯uenza vaccine parenterally for comparison. Inactivated vaccine given parenterally has been reported to stimulate a mucosal
neutralizing antibody response, particularly when
large doses of vaccine were administered [34,35]. In
a study by Fulk, et al.[36] 2 (18%) of 11 children
developed a 4-fold rise in nasal wash neutralizing
antibody to a monovalent inactivated in¯uenza vaccine administered subcutaneously. In comparison, 5
(56%) of 9 children receiving the same vaccine
intranasally demonstrated a mucosal immune response [36]. In a similar study, Mann et al. [37]
reported a 4-fold rise in nasal wash neutralizing
antibody among 3 of 6 adults receiving inactivated
in¯uenza vaccine subcutaneously [37]. More recently,
Gorse et al. [38] studied the mucosal immune response to trivalent inactivated in¯uenza vaccine
administered intramuscularly to adults r60 years
old [38]. Of 25 vaccine recipients, 13 (52%) demonstrated a 4-fold rise in nasal wash IgA to in¯uenza
A/H1N1; 10 (40%) and 13 (52%) demonstrated a

4-fold rise to 2 dierent in¯uenza A/H3N2 strains.
However, mucosal immune responses were shortlived; by 28 days after vaccination, IgA GMTs were
unchanged from baseline.
Whether measured by serum or mucosal immunity, the response to the A/H3N2 antigen was consistently lower than that to A/H1N1 or B.
In¯uenza A/H3N2 has been the predominant circulating strain over the past 30 years [39]. As with
persons who have previously received in¯uenza vaccination, repeated exposure to A/H3N2 strains over
the years likely boosts antibody production to this
strain such that inducing a 4-fold or greater rise
with vaccination occurs infrequently. Indeed, all 73
subjects in our study had preimmunization HAI
titers to in¯uenza A/H3N2 of r1:40.
Surprisingly, we found no signi®cant dierences in
the immune responses to adjuvanted vaccine as
compared with unadjuvanted vaccine, although the
trends consistently favored the adjuvanted vaccine.
Our study had 80% power to detect a dierence of
approximately 30% in response rate between these
two groups. In studies using in¯uenza-naiÈ
ve mice,
intranasal administration of adjuvanted subunit
in¯uenza vaccine induced nasal IgA titers that were
signi®cantly higher than in mice receiving unadjuvanted vaccine. However, among seropositive mice,
enhancement of the mucosal immune response by
MF59 was seen primarily with the second dose and
serum responses were not boosted [18]. We have
previously shown IgA memory with rapid boosting
of the IgA response in seropositive children after
inactivated intranasal in¯uenza vaccine [40].
Previous immunogenicity studies of 2 doses of inactivated in¯uenza vaccines administered intranasally
have been performed in humans [31,41]. However, few
data exist comparing the immune response to 1 vs. 2
doses of vaccine. Studies in mice of an in¯uenza vaccine adjuvanted with the B subunit of cholera toxin
demonstrated signi®cant boosting of both serum and
mucosal immune responses with the second dose of
vaccine [42]. In our study, there was no evidence of a
booster eect to serum antibody response (Tables 3
and 4). However, a greater percentage of subjects
demonstrated a mucosal IgA response to 2 doses of
vaccine than to 1 dose (Table 2), providing some evidence for a boosting of mucosal immunity. This dierence was statistically signi®cant only for the response
to in¯uenza A/H1N1.
In summary, intranasal administration of a subunit
in¯uenza vaccine adjuvanted with MF59 was generally
safe, but did not result in signi®cantly greater immunogenicity than an unadjuvanted vaccine delivered by the
same route. Other adjuvants, such as LT-K63, a
genetically detoxi®ed mutant of E. coli heat labile
enterotoxin [18,43], may oer more promise in stimulating the immune response to subunit in¯uenza vaccines.
