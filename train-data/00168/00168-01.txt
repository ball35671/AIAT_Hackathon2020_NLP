Summary
Background The use of cell-culture technologies for the manufacture of infl uenza vaccines might contribute to
improved strain selection and robust vaccine supplies. We investigated the safety, immunogenicity, and protective
effi cacy of a Vero-cell-culture-derived infl uenza vaccine, and assessed the correlation between vaccine effi cacy and
haemagglutination inhibition antibody titre.
Methods In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial undertaken in 36 centres in the USA, healthy adults
(aged 18–49 years) were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to one injection of either placebo or Vero-cell-culturederived infl uenza vaccine during the 2008–09 season. Randomisation was done in blocks by use of the random
number generator algorithm, and participants were allocated by use of a centralised telephone system. The primary
objective was the effi cacy of the vaccine in preventing cell-culture-confi rmed infl uenza infection with viruses that
were antigenically matched to one of the vaccine strains. Analysis was by intention to treat. The study is registered
with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00566345.
Findings 7250 participants were randomly assigned to vaccine (n=3626) and placebo (n=3624). 7236 were analysed
for the primary outcome (n=3619 and n=3617, respectively). Overall protective effi cacy for antigenically matched
influenza infection was 78·5% (95% CI 60·8–88·2). The vaccine was well tolerated with no treatment-related
serious adverse events. Adverse events were mainly mild and transient. An HI titre of at least 1:15 provided a
reliable correlate of cell-culture-derived infl uenza vaccine-induced protection; no additional benefi t was noted with
titres greater than 1:30.
Interpretation The data indicate that existing correlates of protection afforded with egg-derived seasonal infl uenza
vaccines also apply to this vaccine.
Funding Federal (US Government) funds from the Office for Preparedness and Response, Biomedical Advanced
Research and Development Authority, under contract to DynPort Vaccine Company.
Introduction
Changes in the prevalence of circulating virus strains
mean that seasonal infl uenza vaccines have to be
manufactured every year.1
 Manufacture of conventional
egg-derived vaccines must be initiated several months
before the infl uenza season, frequently resulting in
mismatches between the vaccine strains and strains
circulating during the season.1
 Additionally, egg-based
production processes are susceptible to microbial
contamination, and diffi culties in manufacture have led
to substantial shortages of vaccines.2,3 The use of robust
cell-culture technologies has the potential to greatly
improve the strain selection process and allow swift
responses to changes in the demand for vaccines.1,4,5 Also,
the absence of egg-derived proteins in the vaccine is safer
for individuals who are sensitive to these proteins.
Several continuous cell-line technologies are being
used in the development of infl uenza vaccines, but so far
the only cell line that has universal regulatory acceptance
is Vero cells.6,7 Pandemic infl uenza vaccines derived by
use of this cell line are well tolerated and immunogenic,8–10 but the immunogenicity and clinical effi cacy of
Vero-cell-derived seasonal infl uenza vaccines have not
been investi gated. However, the immunogenicity and
effi cacy of traditional, egg-derived inactivated, trivalent
infl uenza vaccines have been investigated in several
clinical trials.11,12 The induction of haemagglutininspecifi c antibodies in the assay for haemagglutination
inhib ition (HI) is an established correlate of protection
with egg-derived seasonal infl uenza vaccines.13,14 However,
whether the correlates of immunity provided by eggderived vaccines are equally applicable to cell-culturederived infl uenza vaccines remains to be confi rmed.
We investigated the safety, immunogenicity, and
protective effi cacy of a novel inactivated Vero-cell-derived
infl uenza vaccine. Culture-confi rmed infl uenza infection
and antigenic typing were used for stringent assessment
of this vaccine in preventing seasonal infl uenza infection
in healthy adults, and to enable delineation of the rate of
protection elicited by each of the components of the
trivalent vaccine. Data for effi cacy and immunogenicity
were analysed to investigate whether the HI titre can be
used as a correlate of the protection provided by Vero-cellderived infl uenza vaccine against seasonal infl uenza.

Methods
Participants and study design
A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3
trial was undertaken in healthy adults (aged 18–49 years)
during the 2008–09 infl uenza season at 36 centres
throughout the USA.
The Sterling Institutional Review Board, Atlanta, GA,
USA, approved the protocol and consent form for the
study, which was done in compliance with the Good
Clinical Practice guidelines and the Declaration of Helsinki.
An independent data monitoring committee made up of
four members monitored this study. Individuals who
confi rmed they understood the nature of the study
procedures and provided written consent for participation
in the study were accepted as volunteers.
The investigator obtained the medical history from each
volunteer and did a physical examination, including tests
for urinary β-human chorionic gonadotrophin in women
of childbearing age, and blood was drawn for assessment
of prevaccination HI titres. Individuals were excluded if
they were in a risk category for complications of infl uenza
illness (as defi ned by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention [CDC], Atlanta, GA), had a history of surgical
or functional asplenia, had been treated with any blood
product or immune globulin in the previous 90 days, had
a history of allergy to vaccine components, had received a
live vaccine within 4 weeks or an inactivated vaccine within
2 weeks of study entry, or had dermatological disorders or
tattoos that would obscure the assessment of injection-site
reactions. Individuals were not specifi cally excluded
because of egg allergy. Participants who had already been
immunised against infl uenza for the 2008–09 season were
also excluded, but immunisation in previous seasons was
not judged to be an exclusion criterion.
Randomisation and masking
Individuals were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio
immediately before vaccination with 0·5 mL Vero-cellderived infl uenza vaccine (Baxter, Vienna, Austria) or
placebo, administered into the deltoid muscle. Individuals
were randomly assigned by use of a centralised telephone
system. The allocation sequence was generated by Baxter,
using an interactive voice response system with the
random number generator algorithm of Wichmann and
Hill,15 as modifi ed by Mcleod.16 Randomisation was done
in blocks, with block sizes greater than two. At each study
site, an investigator, subinvestigator, or study nurse who
was masked to treatment allocation was designated to
vaccinate participants, and was then prohibited from
participation in data collection or the study. To ensure
masking, the participants were enrolled by investigators
who were not involved in the randomisation process.
The Vero-cell-derived infl uenza vaccine, a trivalent,
split vaccine, was formulated to contain 15 μg of
haemagglutinin antigen from each of the three virus
strains recommen ded by WHO for the 2008–09
infl uenza season in the northern hemisphere—namely,
A/Brisbane/59/2007 (A/H1N1), A/Uruguay/716/2007
(A/Brisbane/10/2007-like) (A/H3N2), and B/Florida/
4/2006 (B). The three virus strains were egg-derived
wild-type strains provided by the National Institute for
Biological Standards and Control (Potters Bar, UK). The
placebo used in the clinical study was phosphate
buff ered saline.
Procedures
The fi rst volunteer was vaccinated on Dec 1, 2008, and
immunisation of all individuals was completed by
Dec 15, 2008. Participants were given a diary for recording
their temperatures during the fi rst 7 days after
immunisation, and fevers or other adverse experiences
during the fi rst 21 days after immunisation.
Participants returned to the study site at 18–24 days
after vaccination for a second blood draw for measurement
of postvaccination HI titres, and review and collection of
their diaries. At this visit, individuals were instructed to
return to the clinic within 48 h after the onset of
symptoms for an infl uenza-like illness should they have
fever with cough, sore throat, muscle ache, headache,
fatigue, nausea, or bloodshot eyes, or have any two of
these symptoms without fever. At every visit for an
infl uenza-like illness, until May 15, 2009, nasopharyngeal
swabs were obtained for culturing and typing viruses.
Participants returned for a fi nal study visit 166–194 days
after vaccination to have a physical examination and fi nal
assessment of adverse events. Nasopharyngeal swab
specimens were sent to BioAnalytical Research, Lake
Success, NY, USA, for culture by use of Rapid R-Mix
(Diagnostic Hybrids, Athens, OH, USA) and traditional
culture methods, and for virus typing with RT-PCR
analyses. Infl uenza type A/H1N1 or A/H3N2 isolates
were sent to the laboratory of the Infl uenza Division,
National Center for Immunization and Respiratory
Diseases, CDC, Atlanta, GA, USA, for analyses of HI by
use of ferret antiserum to assess the antigenic relatedness
of the isolate to the vaccine strains.
Infl uenza type B isolates were sent to GENEWIZ,
South Plainfi eld, NJ, USA, for genetic sequencing to
assess whether the specimens were of the B/Victoria or
B/Yamagata lineage. Specimens that were of the
B/Yamagata lineage were judged to antigenically match
the B strain in the vaccine. Infl uenza type A specimens
that could not be amplifi ed to suffi cient titre to enable
analysis of HI with ferret antiserum were also sent for
genetic sequencing.
Analyses of HI titres were done by Focus Diagnostics
(Cypress, CA, USA). HI assays were done in triplicate
with egg-derived antigen. Titres of less than 1:10 were
expressed as 1:5 and judged to be negative.
Statistical analysis
The primary study objective was the effi cacy of Vero-cellderived infl uenza vaccine in prevention of cultureconfi rmed infection with infl uenza virus that was

antigenically matched to one of the vaccine strains.
Secondary objectives were quantifi cation of the
haemagglutinin-specifi c antibody response to each
vaccine antigen, comparison of the safety of the vaccine
with placebo, and the establishment of a correlation
between the vaccine-induced HI titres and vaccine
effi cacy against culture-confi rmed infl uenza infection.
For sample size calculation, we assumed a 2·5%
infl uenza infection rate for recipients of the placebo, an
overall vaccine effi cacy of 70%, and a uniform distribution
of infl uenza cases during follow-up. 10 000 simulations
were done on the basis of these assumptions, with equal
group sizes. For 3360 individuals who were immunised
with the vaccine, the estimated power of the Cox
regression was predicted to be about 91% to show vaccine
effi cacy of at least 40% with 95% confi dence. If a dropout
rate of about 6% was assumed, 7200 healthy adults had to
be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to vaccine or placebo.
Vaccine effi cacy was defi ned as 1 minus the hazard ratio
of the risk of infl uenza infections in individuals who were
given infl uenza vaccine compared with the risk in the
placebo group. Vaccine effi cacy was expressed in
percentages. The hazard ratio was estimated within a Cox
regression framework, starting at follow-up day 21 and
accounting for treatment group as an explanatory variable.
The proportional hazards assumption was verifi ed by
addition of the interaction term between vaccine group
and time to the model used for primary analysis.17,18 This
interaction term was planned to be tested at the 10% level.
The p value for the interaction term was 0·925 for all
strains (and p=0·912 for strain A/H1N1). The two-sided
95% CI for the hazard ratio was calculated; thus the null
hypothesis (vaccine effi cacy <40%) against the alternative
hypothesis (≥40%) was implicitly tested at a 2·5% onesided level of signifi cance. For strain B, since the
Cox regression could not be applied because the estimated risk in the group assigned to vaccine was zero, the
95% CI of vaccine effi cacy was computed by use of the
method of Miettinen and Nurminen.19 The eff ect of demographic characteristics on the rate of individuals with

culture-confi rmed infl uenza infections for matching
A/H1N1 strain was analysed by a logistic regression model
with sex as a class variable, and log HI titre at 21 days after
vaccination and age as continuous covariates.
For analysis of immunological endpoints, HI titres, and
means and 95% CIs were calculated for the logtransformed data based on the t distribution. The results
of the analysis were back transformed to the original scale
by exponentiation into geometric mean titre and 95% CI.
To assess the correlation between HI titre and
protective immunity, a two-step analysis was done for
the strains for which vaccine effi cacy was signifi cantly
higher than zero at the 5% level of signifi cance. In the
fi rst step, the binomial outcome of positive or negative
for culture-confi rmed infl uenza infection was analysed
by use of logistic regression. The model included the
logarithm of HI titre at day 21 and age as continuous
covariates, and sex as a class variable. In the second step,
the sensitivity (defi ned as the proportion of participants
having titres below the cutoff value on day 21 for those
with culture-confi rmed infl uenza infection) and
specifi city (defi ned as the proportion of individuals
having titres greater or equal to the cutoff value on day 21
for individuals without culture-confi rmed infl uenza
infection), and the sum of the two corresponding to each
cutoff value were computed. The cutoff titre was the
lowest titre at which the sum of the specifi city and
sensitivity was maximum. The HI titre at which the sum
of the specifi city and sensitivity is maximum is judged to
be the best cutoff value for a correlate of protection.20
Adverse events were summarised by calculation of the
frequency of specifi c queried symptoms, relative risk of
occurrence of these symptoms, and their 95% CIs.

NCT00566345.

Results
Figure 1 shows the trial profi le. 7243 of 7250 participants
who were randomly assigned were vaccinated, and
represented the safety population (ie, all vaccinated
individuals; fi gure 1). 1823 (50%) of 3623 participants
(median age 31 years, range 18–49) in the vaccine group
and 1865 (52%) of 3620 (30 years, 18–49) in the placebo
group were men. Calculation of vaccine effi cacy was done
on the intention-to-treat (ITT) population (ie, all randomly
assigned and immunised participants who stayed in the
study for at least 21 days after vaccination). Seven people
were excluded from the ITT population: two were
withdrawn by the investigator for reasons unrelated to
the study, two were non-compliant to the study
procedures, one was lost to follow-up, one person
voluntarily withdrew, and one died in a motorcycle
accident. The immunogenicity population consisted of
6932 individuals who were immunised and had antibody
titres for HI assessed before and after immunisation for
at least one of the vaccine strains. The per-protocol
population consisted of 6634 participants who were
vaccinated and completed the study without a major
protocol deviation. All populations were evenly balanced
according to sex and age.
A total of 104 specimens taken from 103 diff erent
individuals during the study were positive for infl uenza
when virus was isolated in culture or identifi ed by use of
RT-PCR (table 1). To meet the requirements of the
primary endpoint, the specimen had to be isolated in cell
culture and assessed to be antigenically matched to the
corresponding vaccine strain. After subtraction of
specimens that were identifi ed by use of RT-PCR, but not
those isolated in cell culture, and those assessed to be
antigenically mismatched to the corresponding vaccine
strain, a total of 66 specimens remained. For four
participants with H3N2 virus infection and for three with
H1N1 virus infection, samples could not be sequenced
and the antigenic identity could not be assessed. These
samples were judged to match the strains used in the
vaccine since all other specimens were antigenically
matched. This decision was further supported with data
from weekly CDC surveillance that was issued for the
week after nasopharyngeal specimen collection was
stopped,21 according to which all 877 A/H1N1 and
162 A/H3N2 specimens were antigenically matched to
the 2008–09 infl uenza vaccine strains. Therefore, 73 of
104 infl uenza specimens met the criteria for the primary
endpoint of being isolated in cell culture and antigenically
matching the vaccine strains. The 2008–09 northern
hemisphere infl uenza season was characterised
predominantly as an A/H1N1 season,22 as supported with
63 (86%) of the specimens identifi ed as A/H1N1, six (8%)
as A/H3N2, and four (5%) as B.
The proportion of culture-confi rmed infections
reported in the group assigned to the infl uenza vaccine
was substantially lower than in the placebo group
(table 1). The protective effi cacy against culture-confi rmed
infl uenza for the predominant circulating strain
(A/H1N1) was 79%. The highest effi cacy (100%) was
shown against the B strain and the lowest (50%) against
A/H3N2 (table 1). Protective effi cacy for all infl uenza
viruses, irrespective of the method of detection or
antigenic match, was more than 70% (table 1). The null
hypothesis (vaccine effi cacy <40%) was thus rejected
when the primary endpoint of effi cacy to prevent infection
with culture-isolated, antigenically matching strains was
considered. It was also rejected when all 104 specimens,
irrespective of the method of identifi cation or antigenic
match, were included in the analysis. The low number of
isolates obtained for the H3N2 and B strains resulted in
wide confi dence intervals for vaccine effi cacy. For strain B,

vaccine effi cacy was signifi cant. However, for H3N2 strain,
the low number of isolates and their distribution between
the study groups resulted in a negative lower limit for the
95% CI, which meant we could not draw a conclusion of
a signifi cant risk reduction in infl uenza infections
(table 1). In addition to absolute protection, a substantial
reduction was noted in the duration and severity of
symptoms in infected individuals in the vaccine group
compared with the placebo group (data not shown)—
ie, vaccine eff ects included both prevention and
moderation of illness.
With respect to vaccine immunogenicity, geometric
mean titres increased substantially in the vaccine group
from before to 21 days after immunisation (table 2). On

Food and Drug Administration13,14 were met for all three
vaccine strains. Although an age eff ect was noted with
respect to immunogenicity, no eff ect of sex was noted
(data not shown).
Table 3 shows the calculated sensitivity and specifi city
of possible HI titre cutoff values for strain A/H1N1 (not
calculated for the other strains because of the small
number of isolates). The cutoff titre occurred at a titre
of 1:30. Little variability occurred in the sum of specifi city
and sensitivity for the range of HI titres from 1:15 to 1:160,
indicating that titres as low as 1:15 correlated with
immunity induced by the Vero-cell-derived infl uenza
vaccine. The area under the curve for receiver operating
characteristics for strain A/H1N1 for each cutoff value
shows that titres measured 21 days after immunisation
provided good prediction of infection (fi gure 2).
Furthermore, for the points between the cutoff reciprocal
HI titres of 20 and 128, the distance from the equality
line (0·5—ie, sensitivity equals specifi city) is nearly
constant, suggesting that an HI titre that is as low as 1:20
provides a clear separation between infected and noninfected individuals (fi gure 2).
In a reduced logistic regression model in which the
infl uenza vaccine group was removed to assess the
possible eff ect of demographic factors on the risk of
culture-confi rmed influenza infections with the matching
A/H1N1 strain, the log HI titre at day 22 correlated
signifi cantly with the risk of infl uenza infections
(p<0·0001); age and sex did not aff ect the occurrence of
infl uenza infections (p=0·46 and p=0·64, respectively).
With respect to safety, the infl uenza vaccine was safe and
well tolerated by the participants. Within 7 days of
immunisation a total of 1261 (35%) of 3623 individuals in
the infl uenza vaccine group and 807 (22%) of 3620 in the
placebo group reported immunisation-related systemic
reactions. The severity ratings for these reported events in
the infl uenza and placebo groups were mild (936 [26%]
vs 608 [17%], respectively), moderate (224 [6%] vs 150 [4%],
respectively), severe (48 [1%] vs 16 [<1%], respectively), or
not reported (51 [1%] vs 33 [<1%], respectively). The risk
of all local reactions was higher in the vaccine group than
in the placebo group (table 4). For systemic reactions,
the relative risk was greater than 2 only for arthralgia,
chills, myalgia, and pyrexia, which are among the most
commonly occurring eff ects of cytokine-mediated response
to foreign protein. A total of 59 serious adverse events were
recorded during the study (31 in 29 participants in vaccine
group and 28 in 27 in placebo group). The only serious
adverse event judged to be possibly related to vaccination
was an episode of hypertensive crisis in a 44-year-old white
man 30 min after being given placebo. Two individuals
died after being given the infl uenza vaccine. Both deaths
(gastric haemorrhage at 131 days after immunisation; and
death due to trauma caused by motor vehicle accident at
22 days after immunisation) were judged to be not related
to vaccination.
Discussion
A novel inactivated, trivalent, split Vero-cell-derived
infl uenza vaccine is safe, well tolerated, and aff ords
protection in healthy adults against seasonal infection
with infl uenza virus. The effi cacy of protection against
culture-confi rmed infl uenza infection caused by viruses
antigenically related to A/H1N1, which were predominant
in the 2008–09 infl uenza season in the USA,22 was 79%.
Moreover, protective effi cacy was 78·5% for all
antigenically matched infl uenza strains and 71·5% for all
laboratory-confi rmed infections, irrespective of antigenic
matching (table 1).
Comparison of independent studies of seasonal
infl uenza vaccines is diffi cult because of several
confounding factors, including diff erences in vaccine
strains, circulating viruses, study population, study
design, and clinical endpoints;11,23,24 however, retrospective

comparison with trials of other seasonal infl uenza
vaccines done in healthy adults shows similar safety,
immunogenicity, and effi cacy profi les.12,25–34 In a metaanalysis of trials done in healthy adults from 1977
to 2009,33 inactivated trivalent infl uenza vaccines were
73% effi cacious (95% CI 54–84) when vaccine strains
matched circulating virus strains. Live, attenuated
vaccines were reported to be 62% effi cacious (45–73).
These data suggest that the Vero-cell-derived infl uenza
vaccine is at least as eff ective in preventing cultureconfi rmed infl uenza infection as inactivated and live
attenuated egg-derived vaccines.
In future, higher and broader protection might be
achievable with cell-culture-derived infl uenza vaccines
than at the moment. The current generation of vaccines
contain viruses originally isolated in eggs, possibly
eliminating some of the advantages associated with viruses
isolated and grown exclusively in mammalian cells due to
the potential loss of important protective epitopes during
the egg-adaption process.35 The percentage of seroconverted
and seroprotected individuals, as assessed with HI titres
against all three strains in the trivalent vaccine, was above
the threshold cited in both European and US guidelines
(table 2).13,14 The results of a meta-analysis of the
immunogenicity of trivalent inactivated split and subunit
infl uenza vaccines in 26 European Union relicensing
studies that were undertaken between 1992 and 2002 in
adults aged 18–60 years showed that the median geometric
mean fold increase with these vaccines was 10·7 for H1N1
(range 2·0–82·7), 8·2 (2·4–24·3) for H3N2, and
6·6 (1·8–21·3) for the B strain.30 Median seroprotection
was 91·8% (73·5–100) for H1N1, 93·2% (56·7–100) for
H3N2, and 96·4% (52·2–100) for B; and mean
seroconversion was 67·0% (20·0–93·3) for H1N1, 65·3%
(28·3–85·0) for H3N2, and 57·8% (16·2–87·1) for B.30
Pairwise comparison of immunogenicity data for the Verocell-derived infl uenza vaccine (table 2) with the
immunogenicity data reported in the meta-analysis 30 shows
that the geometric mean fold increase and seroconversion
with the infl uenza vaccine were greater than the median
for all vaccine strains; and seroprotection was greater than
the median for H3N2 and B strains. Moreover,
seroconversion, seroprotection, geometric mean titre, and
geometric mean fold increase with the infl uenza vaccine
were all similar to those reported with a licensed cellculture-derived infl uenza vaccine derived from
Madin–Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells.25–28 Noteworthy
is that HI assays in this study were done with egg-derived
antigen as required by regulatory authorities. Use of
antigen produced in mammalian cells can result in higher
HI titres for human serum samples generated against cellculture-derived infl uenza vaccines.36
Administration of the Vero-cell-derived infl uenza
vaccine was well tolerated with no signifi cant diff erences
in frequency of serious adverse events in the vaccine and
placebo groups. The incidence of minor local and
systemic adverse events (table 4) that could be related to
immunisation was also similar to that reported in a metaanalysis of egg-derived inactivated infl uenza vaccines.33
The only other effi cacy study of a cell-culture-derived
infl uenza vaccine was done with an MDCK-derived
vaccine, but its investigators did not attempt to establish
a serological correlate of protection (panel).37 Hence,
whether the immune correlates established with the eggderived vaccines could be extrapolated to allow the
prediction of protection with cell-culture-derived vaccine
against seasonal infl uenza was not clear. Analyses of data
for effi cacy and immunogenicity showed that the
correlate of protection established with egg-derived
seasonal infl uenza vaccines (reciprocal HI titre ≥40) is
also predictive of the protection provided by the infl uenza
vaccine. Moreover, our results show that a reciprocal titre
of at least 15 provides a reliable correlate of protection
induced by cell-culture-derived vaccine, and that there is
no additional protection at a reciprocal titre greater
than 30 (table 3). Results of previous studies of live-virus
challenge with egg-derived seasonal infl uenza vaccines
showed that a reciprocal HI titre between 15 and 65 is
acceptable as an immunological correlate of protection.14
The results of our study lend support to the previous
results, and further indicate a threshold for seroprotection
that is less than a reciprocal titre of 65. Our data are also
Panel: Research in context
Systematic review
We searched PubMed with the terms “infl uenza”, “vaccines”,
and “adult clinical trials” for details about infl uenza clinical
trials. This search provided the review33 from the Cochrane
library that is a comprehensive review of all studies of
infl uenza-vaccine effi cacy undertaken from 1977 to 2009.
This meta-analysis of clinical trials of seasonal infl uenza
vaccines in healthy adults, undertaken by the Cochrane
Collaboration, was used to compare the safety and effi cacy of
Vero-cell-derived infl uenza vaccine with egg-derived,
inactivated, and live attenuated infl uenza vaccines. Another
meta-analysis30 of 26 European Union relicensing studies was
used to compare the immunogenicity of the Vero-cell-derived
infl uenza vaccine with equivalent egg-derived vaccines.
Further studies with respect to serological data from more
recent studies were also identifi ed and included.25–29,31,32 The
effi cacy of a cell-culture (Madin–Darby canine kidney)-derived
infl uenza vaccine was reported in a study that was not
designed to establish a serological marker of protection.37
Interpretation
This study is the fi rst published report of the clinical effi cacy
of a Vero-cell-culture-derived infl uenza vaccine. Comparison
with previously published meta-analyses shows that the
Vero-cell-derived seasonal infl uenza vaccine is at least as
immunogenic and effi cacious as traditional egg-derived
vaccines. Our data also provide the fi rst evidence that
correlates of protection established for egg-derived infl uenza
vaccines are also appropriate for cell-culture-derived vaccines.

in agreement with data from meta-analyses of infl uenza
vaccine effi cacy and immunogenicity, suggesting that
titres as low as 1:28 or 1:17 are correlates of protection.38,39
Although the effi cacy of the vaccine compared with
placebo was impressive, there were some limitations to
the study. The absence of an egg-derived vaccine does not
allow direct comparison with a vaccine manufactured by
use of the standard technology. A signifi cant effi cacy could
only be shown for the H1N1 strain because of the low
number of H3N2 isolates and the substantial mismatch
between the B strain in the vaccine and the isolated
B strains. Additionally, the study was designed only to
analyse effi cacy during one season. Data for HI from
diff erent laboratories can diff er substantially,40 so the
correlate of protection based on such data might need
further confi rmation.
The results of this study make a substantial contribution
to the sum of knowledge in the specialty of infl uenza
vaccines since it is the fi rst report showing the clinical
effi cacy of a Vero-cell-derived infl uenza vaccine. The
results provide important new information about the use
of the HI titre as a correlate of immunity for cell-culturederived seasonal infl uenza vaccines.
The timeliness of this study is also important: since
completion of the trial protocol, healthy adults have been
included as a recommended population for seasonal
infl uenza vaccine in the USA.41 The demand for
immunisation with seasonal infl uenza vaccines is thus
increasing as health authorities become more aware of
the benefi ts provided by expanding recommended target
populations. The data presented here show that a novel,
inactivated Vero-cell-derived infl uenza vaccine, which is
safe, immunogenic, and effi cacious, will be a valuable
addition to the currently licensed vaccines for the
prevention of seasonal infl uenza.
