For evaluation of heterologous protection by live attenuated influenza virus vaccine, 42 healthy volunteers with low titers of or no antibody to A/Scotland/74
(H3N2) and A/Victoria/3/75 (H3N2) influenza viruses were given live attenuated A/Scotland/74 (H3N2) virus vaccine or placebo by the intranasal route with
no resultant vaccine-related illness. Seventeen of 21 vaccine recipients and none of
21 placebo recipients developed antibody conversion. Thirty-seven days after administration of vaccine or placebo, all subjects were challenged intranasally with
wild-type A/Victoria/3j75 influenza virus. Five placebo recipients and no vaccine
recipients developed moderately severe illness, whereas 10 vaccine recipients and
three placebo recipients developed no illness (P < 0.025). Although 16 of 21 vaccine
recipients fulfilled criteria of infection with the challenge virus, shedding of virus
was significantly less frequent, less prolonged, and of significantly lower magnitude
than that in the placebo recipients. Thus, live attenuated influenza virus vaccine
showed a significant protective effect against illness following challenge with heterologous wild-type virus. The protective effect and the negligible side effects of this vaccine merit consideration of its use in a large-scale field trial.
Among the many questions about influenza vaccination, at least two are of major concern. First,
what is the duration of immunity provided by
vaccines, and second, which of the available vaccines is the most efficacious? For a variety of reasons, the duration of protection by influenza virus vaccines is difficult to assess. On the one hand,
there is the question of persistence of immunity
against the homologous strain of virus included
in the vaccine, and on the other hand, there is
the question of the protective effect against new
strains of virus showing antigenic drift. Observations made by Foy et al. [1] during epidemics of
naturally acquired influenza have suggested that
about 60% of individuals are protected from infection three years after vaccine is administered.

Protection correlates with the presence of HAl
antibody to the infecting strain of virus. In another study, Stiver et al. [2] showed that there
was a similar 60% reduction in illness associated
with influenza virus infection in recipients of a
vaccine containing influenza AjAichij2j68
(H3N2) virus administered three to 10 months
prior to an epidemic caused by AjEngiandj72
(H3N2) influenza virus. In their study, which
confirmed infection by isolation of virus andjor
serologic response, protection was also correlated with development of HAl antibody to the
epidemic strain.
However, these studies, as well as others, have
shown that parental vaccine does not produce
protection in a substantial proportion of individuals. For this reason, as well as for others, new
or improved vaccines, including live attenuated
virus vaccines have been sought [3]. Two types of
live attenuated virus vaccine that have been
studied recently are the "temperature-sensitive"
[4, 5] and the "inhibitior-resistant" [6] vaccines.
Initial studies of influenza A/Hong Kong/68
(H3N2) inhibitor-resistant recombinant virus revealed that it is still infectious and produces antibody responses, but illness is markedly reduced

Heterologous Protection in Influenza
[6]. In these same studies, virus passaged in eggs
in the absence of serum remained virulent in
experimental infection. Subsequent studies of
more recent isolates of influenza virus used to
produce inhibitor-resistant vaccines have shown
similar findings, i.e., the virus causes minimal or
no clinical symptoms but does stimulate immune
response [7-14]. If recipients of vaccine are challenged with homologous strains of wild-type virus, they are protected from infection as compared with recipients of placebo [9, 12, 14]. The
duration of immunity among these vaccine recipients and protection against heterologous
strains of virus have not been studied. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the degree of
protection against challenge with wild-type influenza A/Victoria/3/75 (H3N2) virus in recipients of influenza A/Scotland/74 (H3N2) inhibitor-resistant virus vaccine. The results indicate that vaccine recipients had significantly less
severe illness and that the incidence, quantity,
and duration of viral shedding were significantly
reduced as compared with those in placebo recipients.
Materials and Methods
Volunteers. Subjects were healthy, male and
female university students between the ages of
18 and 25 years who were selected on the basis of
willingness to participate in the study and absent or low titers (:::::1:8) of HAl antibody to both
A/Scotland/74 (H3N2) and A/Victoria/3/75
(H3N2) influenza viruses. Before vaccination,
before challenge, and at the end of the study, a
complete history was obtained, and physical examination and laboratory evaluation of hematological, renal, and hepatic functions were performed for all volunteers. A complete explanation of the nature, hazards, discomforts, and benefits of the study was presented to the volunteers,
and both oral and written consent were obtained
prior to the study.
Vaccine and placebo. Influenza A/Scotlandj
74 (H3N2) virus vaccine was supplied by
Smith, Kline and French Laboratories, Philadelphia, Pa. The vaccine had been prepared by recombination of an isolate of A/Scotland/74
(H3N2) virus with AjPR/8/34 (HONI) virus.
The recombinant was then passaged first in em747
bryonated pathogen-free eggs in the presence of
heated guinea pig serum to render it serum-resistant and then by terminal dilutions to clone
the inhibitor-resistant marker. The final material
corresponded to the 11th egg passage and was
thoroughly tested for adventitious viruses.. and
none were found. Placebo consisted of diluent
in which the vaccine was suspended and was
identical in appearance to the vaccine.
Challenge inoculum. The inoculum of heterologous wild-type virus was prepared from thirdpassage material in embryonated hens' eggs of an
isolate of influenza AjVictoria/3/75 (H3N2)
virus obtained from the World Health Organization Laboratories (London, England). The inoculum was tested for safety by previously published methods [15] and instilled in a volume of
0.25 ml per nostril. The material contained 106.
1
50% egg infectious doses (EI050) of virusjml as
determined by simultaneous titration in embryonated hens' eggs.
Experimental design. A total of 47 volunteers were evaluated. In the initial part of the
study carried out in early April 1976, each volunteer was given 0.25 ml of either placebo or vaccine in each nostril in a randomized, doubleblind fashion. The volunteers were then discharged, and they returned one, four, and 36 days
later. Challenge with wild-type virus was performed on day 37, and volunteers were confined
during the first eight days after challenge.
Clinical evaluations. Temperatures were obtained one day after administration of vaccine,
and a physician who was uninformed of whether
volunteers had been given vaccine or placebo
examined the volunteers one and four days after
administration of vaccine or placebo. After they
were challenged with wild-type virus, volunteers
were examined twice daily for evidence of clinical illness, and the presence and severity (score,
1+ to 3+) of signs and symptoms were recorded.
Temperatures were measured orally every 4 hr;
if a temperature of ~99.5 F was measured, a rectal temperature was taken. A rectal temperature
of ~100 F was considered elevated.
Virologic procedures. Nasal washings for isolation of virus with use of veal infusion broth
containing 0.5% bovine albumin were obtained
on the day of and one day after vaccination and
the day before, the day of, and one to seven days
 at New York University on September 7, 2015 http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from

after challenge with wild-type virus. For isolation
of virus, nasal wash specimens were inoculated
onto the chorioallantoic membrane of embryonated hens' eggs [16, 17]. After challenge with
wild-type virus, nasal wash specimens were tested
in rhesus monkey kidney tissue cultures by standard methods [17]. Prior studies had shown one
day after vaccination to be the optimal time for
isolation of vaccine virus and that embryonated
hens' eggs were superior to tissue culture for isolation of the vaccine strain [14]. Positive specimens that had been stored at -70 C were thawed
and titrated by inoculation of serial 10-fold dilutions of nasal wash into the appropriate isolation
system. Specimens obtained before challenge with
wild-type virus and during illness were tested for
extraneous viruses in WI-38 human embryonic
fibroblast cell cultures and rhesus monkey kidney
cells.
Antibody determinations. Nasal secretions
and serum were obtained before vaccination,
36 days later, and 21 days after challenge with
wild-type virus. Nasal secretions were concentrated lO-fold by air-drying in dialysis tubing, and
titers of neutralizing antibody to influenza Aj
Victoriaj3j75 (H3N2) and AjScotlandj74
(H3N2) influenza viruses were measured by previously described techniques [18]. Titers of antibody to homologous and heterologous antigens
in serum were also measured by the HAl test
[17]. AjScotlandj74 antigen was produced in
embryonated hens' eggs by inoculation with a
seed virus supplied by Ronald Mayner (Food and
Drug Administration, Washington, D.C.). AjVictoriaj3j75 antigen was prepared in embryonated
hens' eggs from an isolate obtained in Rochester,
N.Y., and identified by the Center for Disease Control (Atlanta, Ga.) as AjVictoriaj 3j75 influenza
virus. In this test, two units of antigen measured
by back titration were used instead of four units.
Titers of neuraminidase-inhibiting (NI) antibody
were measured by previously published methods
[19] with use of fetuin obtained from the Colorado Serum Company, Denver, Colo.
Results
Clinical and serologic responses to vaccine or
placebo. Vaccine was administered in early
April 1976. Within the four-day period after administration of either vaccine or placebo, there
Betts et al,
were four individuals in the group given vaccine
and three in the group given placebo who complained of mild sore throat and rhinorrhea. None
had fever. Extraneous viruses were not detected
in any nasal secretions obtained before or after
vaccination. None of the 24 placebo recipients
and two of the 23 vaccine recipients shed influenza virus in their nasal secretions on day 1 after
administration. Thirty-six days later, 43 of the 47
subjects returned. Of the 43, 22 had been given
vaccine. On retesting at that time, it was recognized that one vaccine recipient had a titer of
antibody to AjScotland/74 antigen of 1:128 before vaccination, and he was excluded from further consideration. Seventeen of the 21 vaccine
recipients and none of the 21 placebo recipients
developed a fourfold or greater rise in titer of
HAl antibody to AjScotlandj74 antigen; in addition, eight of 21 vaccinees and none of the placebo recipients developed fourfold rises in titer of
antibody to AjVictoriaj3j75 antigen (table 1).

All 21 patients in the placebo group were infected by challenge (with virus isolated from 20).
In contrast, 12 of the 21 subjects who had been
vaccinated shed virus, and four others developed
fourfold rises in antibody titers after challenge.
Only five of the vaccine reci pients developed fourfold rises in homologous antibody titers after
challenge despite the fact that 12 subjects shed
virus and 12 others had antibody titers to A/Victoria/ 3/75 antigen of ~1:8 before challenge. Furthermore, the placebo recipients developed a

however, when only those respondents with fourfold rises in ti tel' were compared, the reciprocal
GMT of antibody to A/Scotland/74 was nearly
the same as that to AjVictoriaj3/75 (5.3 vs.
5.5). No subjects developed detectable nasal secretory antibody to either antigen after administration of either placebo or vaccine.
Clinical illness following viral challenge.
Thirty-seven days after administration of vaccine
or placebo, the volunteers were confined for challenge with heterologous wild-type virus (see Materials and Methods). One recipient who had received placebo and one who had received vaccine had mild respiratory symptoms at that
time. Nasal secretions were inoculated onto tissue cultures that would support the growth of
parainfluenza virus, rhinovirus, adenovirus, and
herpes simplex virus. The cultures were negative
for these viruses, as were cultures for J3-hemolytic
Streptococcus.
After challenge, 10 vaccinated subjects, but
only three placebo recipients, had no symptoms
during the study period (P < 0.025). In addition
to this difference in frequency of illness, there was
a significant difference in severity of illness. Five
placebo recipients and no vaccine recipients had
total symptom scores that were >25 (P < 0.05),
a level indicating moderately severe systemic illness. Fever occurred in five recipients of placebo,
and in three this fever lasted for 48 hr. In contrast, fever occurred in only one vaccinated individual and was elevated in only one determination (P < 0.05). The combination of symptoms
and signs was used to calculate a daily score, and
the mean of the scores for each group was analyzed. A graphic representation of this analysis is
shown in figure 1. Significantly higher scores for
severity of symptoms and signs occurred in placebo recipients on day 1 and extended through
day 4 after challenge. When the subjects were
asked, "Did you have a cold during the study?",
16 placebo recipients compared with six vaccinated subjects answered affirmatively. Overall, 28%
of the vaccinated subjects developed symptoms
consistent with colds, and all were mild, whereas
760/0 of placebo recipients developed colds after
challenge, and in 31%illnesses were severe.

vaccinated shed virus, the pattern of shedding
was different from that of placebo recipients.
Among vaccinated subjects fewer individuals shed
virus on each day beginning on day 2 and extending through day 7 (figure 2). There were quantitative differences also. The titer of virus shed by
vaccinated virus-positive individuals was not significantly different from that of placebo recipients during the first four days after challenge.
However, on day five, the mean titer of virus shed
by placebo recipients was significantly higher
than that shed by vaccinated subjects. That result, combined with the results obtained on other days, yielded mean titers of virus shed by placebo recipients that were significantly higher than
those of vaccine recipients (1.9 vs. 1.2 10glO

following challenge. As noted previously, not
all vaccine recipients had a serologic response after administration of vaccine and not all vaccine
recipients were infected or became ill after challenge with wild-type virus. Therefore, the relationship between serologic response to vaccine
and illness after challenge was analyzed (table
3). As demonstrated, evidence of viral infection
and/or illness occurred in subjects with any pattern of antibody response. Infection and/or illness occurred in those subjects who had had a
low antibody titer to only one antigen, an intermediate titer to one or both antigens, or a high
titer to both antigens following administration
of vaccine. Two other factors are apparent from
examination of the data in table 3. First, subjects
who had titers of antibody to A/Scotland/74
antigen of ~5 log2 were more likely to have antibody titers to A/Victoria/3/75 antigen than
those subjects with lower antibody titers. Second,
illness occurred as frequently in subjects who did
not shed virus after challenge (three of nine) as
in subjects who did shed virus (three of 12). Of
the five who had no evidence of infection with
wild-type virus, one was ill as compared with
five of 16 who had serologic or virologic evidence
of infection with the challenge virus.
Relationship of titers of NI antibody to vaccine response and to infection and illness after
challenge. Following administration of vaccine,
HAl antibody titers in serum increased significantly in 17 of 21 volunteers. Six subjects also developed a significant rise in titer of NI antibody.
Two of the four subjects who did not develop
HAl antibody seroconversion following administration of vaccine had preexisting NI antibody
compared with only three of 17 who did undergo
HAl antibody seroconversion. Illness and viral
shedding after challenge of the vaccine recipients
were analyzed with respect to presence or absence of NI antibody before challenge. Volunteers whose sera lacked NI antibody before challenge had neither a significantly greater incidence
of illness nor a greater degree of viral shedding
when compared with volunteers whose sera contained NI antibody. However, it was of note that
the one vaccine recipient who on five separate
occasions shed virus after challenge had an unmeasurable NI antibody titer before challenge.
Furthermore, five of the seven subjects with unmeasurable titers before challenge shed virus

compared with only seven of the 14 who had
measurable levels of NI antibody. Thus, although there was no significant difference in the
degree of viral shedding, there was a trend suggesting lower frequency of viral shedding in subjects with NI antibody.
Discussion
We examined the protective effect in volunteers of live attenuated influenza A/Scotland/
74 (H3N2) virus vaccine against experimental
challenge with heterologous influenza A/Victoriaj3j75 (H3N2) virus. This question of heterologous protection had relevance to the influenza vaccination program of 1975-1976 because
the inactivated vaccine that was commercially
available contained influenza A/Scotland/74
(H3N2) virus, and the strain that produced epidemic disease that winter was influenza A/Victoria/3/75 (H3N2) virus. There were markedly
different parameters of illness and viral shedding
in volunteers who had been vaccinated compared
with those in unvaccinated controls. Respiratory
illnesses after challenge were significantly less
frequent in recipients of vaccine than in recipients of placebo. The severity of illness and duration of fever were also reduced. The number of
individuals in the vaccine group who were infected by challenge was only slightly reduced, but
the duration and titer of virus shed were significantly affected. Significant increases in antibody
titer after challenge were much less frequent
among vaccinees than among placebo recipients.
The protection from frequent or severe clinical
illness could not be correlated with the level of
nasal secretory, serum HAl, or serum NI antibody before challenge.
Studies with killed virus vaccine have shown
that the presence of HAl antibody to a heterologous strain of influenza virus correlates with protection against infection by that strain [I2]. Furthermore, nasal secretory antibody, when present, seems to add to the protective effect of serum
antibody against infection caused by challenge
with wild-type virus [20]. Still others have shown
that in those individuals whose serum does not
contain HAl antibodies, the level of NI antibody
correlates inversely with the development of
symptomatic influenza illness and degree of viral shedding [21]. Since the protection we observed could not be totally explained by the levels of serum and nasal antibodies, the results of
our study suggest that live attenuated influenza
virus vaccine may induce an additional mechanism of protection, a fact that is supported by the
observation that this vaccine does protect despite
the relatively low levels of serum antibody that

are produced following administration of vaccine
compared with those that are produced after administration of killed virus vaccine [22].
Since vaccine was administered 36 days prior
to challenge, it is possible that the different results in the two groups were related to a nonspecific resistance to infection imparted by the
live virus in the vaccine, a finding which has
been reported in other studies [23]. Although this
question is difficult to resolve, we have shown
previously that vaccine administered as long as
eight months prior to challenge is protective
against homologous challenge [14]. Furthermore,
Betts et at.
in recent studies Minor et al. [24] failed to show
any degree of nonspecific protection against succeeding episodes of natural rhinovirus infection
that occurred two to 20 days apart. An alternative explanation for the illness that occurred in
our vaccine recipients is that the illness was due
to extraneous virus. However, our volunteers
were isolated from outside contacts, no extraneous virus was detected although evidence of extraneous virus was sought, and all but one of our
subjects who were ill had evidence of infection
with influenza virus.
Regardless of the mechanism of protection, administration of vaccine led to amelioration of
symptoms after challenge in spite of a high rate
of infection (16 of 21 volunteers). Failure of the
vaccine to provide protection against infection
may not be a disadvantage. First, in a naturally
occurring epidemic of influenza, reinfection of
vaccine recipients would be expected to result
in an anamnestic immune response and thus
to maintain protection against succeeding epidemics of influenza. Second, the combination of
the asymptomatic state and the low titer of virus
shed would be expected to reduce transmission
of infection from person to person.
Other important aspects of this study are as
follows. First, vaccine administration itself produced no detectable illness in the recipients. Second, protection was induced by a vaccine prepared from a strain of influenza virus (A/Scotland/74) that was isolated during the epidemic
preceeding the outbreak that was caused by the
influenza virus used in the challenge inoculum
(A/Victoria/3/75). Whether this protection
would result during naturally occurring epidemics can only be tested by a large-scale field triaL
The results of this study certainly support the
undertaking of such a field triaL
