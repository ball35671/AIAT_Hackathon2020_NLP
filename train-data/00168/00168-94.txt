Since the 1970s, seasonal influenza vaccines have
been trivalent, composed of two influenza A
strains (A/H1N1 and A/H3N2) and one type
B strain [1]. The viral strains included in the vaccine are chosen annually by the WHO [101] and
national authorities based on ongoing influenza
epidemiology and surveillance. Since 1985, two
antigenically distinct lineages of influenza B
viruses have circulated globally (Yamagata and
Victoria) [2], but only one B strain from one
lineage is chosen for inclusion in trivalent vaccines. Owing to antigenic divergence, limited
immunologic cross-reactivity exists between
the B lineages such that immunization against
one lineage does not provide optimal protection
against the heterologous lineage [3,102]. Vaccineinduced protection against influenza B has
been suboptimal owing to frequent mismatch
between circulating and immunizing B lineages, with mismatches occurring in five out of
ten influenza seasons in the USA from 2001 to
2011 and four out of eight influenza seasons in
the EU from 2003 to 2011 (Figure 1) [4].
Influenza B is responsible for significant
morbidity in children and adults worldwide.
According to surveillance data from the USA and
Europe, from 2001–2002 through 2010–2011
(excluding the 2009–2010 pandemic), on
average 24 and 23% of influenza samples, respectively, were positive for influenza B [4]. Influenza
B causes disease in all age groups, but older
children and young adults tend to have higher
rates of influenza B illness relative to influenza
A [5,6]. Medically attended illnesses due to influenza A and B are generally similar with regard to
symptoms, severity and rates of influenza-related
complications [7–19]. Studies of severe influenza
disease have demonstrated that influenza B
infections also cause a significant proportion of
influenza-attributable hospitalizations [20,21].
Vaccination is considered the best strategy for
reducing influenza illness [22]. However, reduced
efficacy resulting from mismatch between the
lineage of the B strain included in trivalent
influenza vaccines and that of the predominant
circulating strain has resulted in suboptimal protection in recent years. Including influenza B
viruses of both lineages in an annual formulation
of seasonal influenza vaccines would eliminate
potential lineage-level mismatch between immunizing and circulating B viruses and improve
protection against influenza B. A recent analysis
by the US CDC projected that between 2001
and 2009, the benefit of all trivalent vaccines
being replaced by quadrivalent influenza vaccines would have been 2.74 million fewer cases

Influenza B is responsible for significant morbidity in children and adults worldwide. For more
than 25 years, two antigenically distinct lineages of influenza B viruses, B/Yamagata and
B/Victoria, have cocirculated globally. Current influenza vaccine formulations are trivalent and
contain two influenza subtype A strains (A/H1N1 and A/H3N2) but only one B strain. In a half
of recent influenza seasons, the predominant circulating influenza B lineage was different from
that contained in trivalent influenza vaccines. A quadrivalent live-attenuated influenza vaccine
(Q/LAIV) that contains two B strains, one from each lineage, has been developed to help provide
broad protection against influenza B. Q/LAIV was recently approved for use in the USA in eligible
individuals 2–49 years of age. This review summarizes clinical trial data in support of Q/LAIV.

of influenza illnesses and 21,440 fewer hospitalizations in the
USA [23].
Overview of available influenza vaccines
Influenza vaccines in current use fall into two categories: trivalent
inactivated influenza vaccines (TIVs) and trivalent live-attenuated
influenza vaccines (LAIVs).
Trivalent inactivated vaccines
The majority of currently approved seasonal (nonpandemic) influenza vaccines are TIVs of one of the following two formulations:
split-virion vaccines, which are derived by disrupting whole virus
preparations, and subunit vaccines, which typically enrich for
the surface antigens hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase,
although the only standardized component is HA. Beyond this
difference, TIVs differ by whether or not they include an adjuvant
or a preservative, the substrate in which the antigens are produced,
the dose of antigen included and the route of administration.
Because split-virion and subunit TIVs are generally only modestly
immunogenic, some vaccine preparations incorporate adjuvants
to increase immunogenicity [24]. Most influenza vaccines are produced in chicken eggs; however, several seasonal inactivated influenza vaccines manufactured using cell culture are approved for
use in the EU. A high-dose TIV that uses 60 µg of HA per strain
per dose was recently approved for use in individuals ≥65 years
of age in the USA [1]. The majority of TIVs are administered as

Vaccine Profile
intramuscular injections, but some are administered intradermally. Most TIVs are available in a preservative-free formulation,
yet thimerosal is still a common preservative in multidose formulations. There are as yet no quadrivalent inactivated formulations
approved for use, but several are being developed [103,104].
Trivalent LAIVs
Two trivalent LAIVs are in clinical use, one developed in the
USA and one in Russia. LAIVs are composed of attenuated live
influenza viruses that can replicate efficiently only within a limited range of conditions. Viral stocks used to produce LAIVs
were generated by serial passage in vitro under suboptimal growth
conditions to select for a set of favorable genetic characteristics.
LAIV strains are attenuated in that they do not produce classic
influenza-like illness, cold adapted to allow for efficient replication
at cooler temperatures such as those found in the nasopharynx,
and temperature sensitive such that replication is not supported in
the warmer core temperatures of the lower respiratory tract where
wild-type influenza viruses grow efficiently [25].
The genetic backbones of the current LAIVs are derived from
master donor viruses (MDVs) that supply the cold-adapted, temperature-sensitive and attenuated phenotypes to each seasonal strain.
The LAIV first approved for use in the USA in 2003 was generated from MDVs A/Ann Arbor/6/60 and B/Ann Arbor/1/66 [26].
A Russian LAIV is based on the MDVs A/Leningrad/134/17/57
(H2N2) and B/USSR/60/69 [27]. For each vaccine, the HA and
neuraminidase for each strain selected for inclusion in an upcoming season’s formulation are inserted into the MDV backbone, with
the inserted antigens providing strain-specific immunogenicity and
the MDV conferring the attenuation characteristics. LAIVs are
administered intranasally. Ann Arbor strain LAIV is approved in
several countries, including the USA, for use in eligible individuals
2–49 years of age, in Canada for use in individuals 2–59 years of age
and in the EU for use in individuals 2–17 years of age. The Russian
LAIV is approved for use in children and adults over 3 years of age
in Russia [105].
Ann Arbor strain LAIV
The trivalent formulation of the Ann Arbor strain LAIV
(trivalent LAIV [T/LAIV]) is the foundation for the recently developed quadrivalent LAIV (Q/LAIV). Since the licensure of T/LAIV
in 2003 in the USA, more than 50 million doses have been distributed for use, with the majority of use occurring in children, adult
healthcare workers and US military personnel. Safety and efficacy
have been rigorously assessed in more than 70 clinical studies that
examined more than 50,000 individuals aged 6 weeks to >90 years.
In addition, more than 100,000 doses have been administered in
postmarketing safety studies [28–30]. T/LAIV is safe and effective
against influenza illness in both children and adults 2–49 years of
age who are eligible for the vaccine [31–34]. In the USA, T/LAIV
is not approved for use in individuals 50 years of age and older
because in a study of T/LAIV conducted in adults 18–64 years of
age, effectiveness was not demonstrated in the subgroup of adults
50–64 years of age [35]. In addition, LAIV use is restricted to those
24 months of age and older owing to an increased rate of medically
attended wheezing following vaccination in children 6–23 months
of age [36]. In clinical studies, adverse reactions occurring in ≥10% of
T/LAIV recipients and at a rate at least 5% greater than in placebo
recipients included runny nose/nasal congestion in all ages, sore
throat in adults and fever >100°F in children 2–6 years of age [37].
T/LAIV efficacy has been best characterized in children. In
a meta-analysis of eight studies that evaluated T/LAIV efficacy
against culture-confirmed influenza in children 2–17 years of
age, the efficacy of two doses of T/LAIV in previously unvaccinated children in year 1 was 83% (95% CI: 78–87%) against
antigenically similar strains and 79% (95% CI: 73–83%) against
all strains regardless of antigenic match to the vaccine [33]. The
decreased efficacy against all strains regardless of antigenic match
is in part driven by suboptimal protection against heterologous
lineage influenza B strains not covered by the trivalent formulation [3]. In children of all ages, B strain efficacy has been estimated
at 86% for antigenically similar influenza B strains but falls to
31% against heterologous lineage influenza B strains [3].
To provide broad influenza vaccine coverage and decrease the
potential for B virus lineage mismatch, a quadrivalent formulation
of Ann Arbor LAIV (MedImmune, LLC) has been developed.
Q/LAIV uses the same attenuated vaccine strains at the same doses
(107.0 ± 0.5 fluorescent focus units of each viral strain per 0.2-ml dose)
as T/LAIV. Q/LAIV and T/LAIV are produced using identical processes, share the same refrigerated formulation without adjuvant and
are delivered as a 0.2-ml nasal spray divided between two nostrils.
All excipients are the same. The only difference between Q/LAIV
and T/LAIV is that a fourth strain is incorporated in Q/LAIV: A/
H1N1, A/H3N2 and both B lineages, B/Yamagata and B/Victoria.
Preclinical studies of LAIV containing two influenza B
viruses
Initial studies of Ann Arbor strain LAIV containing two influenza B strains were performed in ferrets, which are the standard
animal model for influenza because they are easily infected, support virus replication in the lungs, manifest illness and produce a
vigorous homologous antibody response [3,38]. Several ferret studies
of bivalent, trivalent and quadrivalent formulations of LAIV that
contained B strains from both lineages were conducted. In studies
where animals were challenged with wild-type influenza viruses
from both B-lineage viruses, animals vaccinated against both B
lineages demonstrated protection against influenza illness caused by
both B lineages, whereas controls vaccinated against a single lineage
demonstrated only lineage-specific protection [3,39]. Cross-reactive
antibodies to the heterologous lineage virus were not detected, which
is consistent with previous studies that found poor cross-protection
between B lineages in naive hosts [3]. These studies also concluded
that the inclusion of a second B lineage virus did not diminish HA
inhibition (HAI) antibody production to the other vaccine strains,
indicating a lack of interference between vaccine strains [39].
Clinical studies of Q/LAIV
Based on the similarities between Q/LAIV and T/LAIV, and
in accordance with the principles outlined in guidance documents from regulatory agencies for the approval or licensure
Quadrivalent Ann Arbor strain live-attenuated influenza vaccine

Vaccine Profile
of influenza vaccines [106–108], a bridging strategy was pursued
for the clinical development of Q/LAIV. Safety and immunogenicity data for Q/LAIV were collected in children and
adults in two large randomized controlled studies that compared Q/LAIV and T/LAIV. Both studies were designed to
confirm that inclusion of a second B strain did not meaningfully
interfere with the immune response against any of the other
three vaccine strains or result in any important changes in the
safety profile of the vaccine. Owing to the fact that Q/LAIV
contains a B strain from the Victoria lineage and a B strain from
the Yamagata lineage, Q/LAIV was compared with two separate
T/LAIV formulations that contained either a B/Victoria lineage strain (T/LAIV-B/Victoria) or a B/Yamagata lineage strain
(T/LAIV-B/Yamagata), along with the same two A strains
included in Q/LAIV [40,41].
Immunogenicity of Q/LAIV
Immune responses in the clinical studies of Q/LAIV were evaluated using the HAI assay to evaluate strain-specific antibody.
Functional serum antibody titers as measured by HAI are generally regarded as a correlate of protection for inactivated influenza
vaccines. However, studies have demonstrated that LAIV can
induce protection from influenza illness in the absence of robust
serum antibody responses, as measured by fourfold rises in HAI
[42–45]. Mucosal [46] and cell-mediated immune responses [47]
are important contributors to LAIV-induced immunity; however, these responses are difficult to measure, and there are no
standard or widely accepted assays. Although HAI responses
are not an absolute correlate of protection for LAIVs, they are
an indicator of a functional immune response to vaccination
[48–50]. In studies of LAIV-induced immune responses, adults
demonstrate limited seroresponse (fourfold rise) by HAI [51],
but young children, particularly those without pre-existing
antibodies to influenza, can exhibit higher seroresponse rates
[47,48,50,52–56]. Postvaccination HAI geometric mean titers and
seroresponse rates have been used previously as biomarkers of
T/LAIV-induced immunogenicity to demonstrate comparability
between the frozen and refrigerated formulations of T/LAIV,
for manufacturing and lot consistency, and for evaluating the
concomitant administration of T/LAIV with other live virus
vaccines [53,55,57–59].
Q/LAIV was first studied in 1800 adults 18–49 years of age
who were healthy or had stable underlying chronic disease.
Subjects were randomized 4:1:1 to receive Q/LAIV or T/LAIV
containing matching A strains and only one of the two matching
B strains (T/LAIV-B/Yamagata and T/LAIV-B/Victoria) [40].
Subsequently, a similar pediatric study enrolled 2312 children
aged 2–17 years who were randomized 3:1:1 as above [41].
The majority of children in this study were 2–8 years of age
(n = 1808) and were to receive two doses of vaccine; a smaller
number of children aged 9–17 years (n = 504) received one dose.
Baseline HAI antibody titers were assessed prior to dosing in
all subjects. Postvaccination titers were assessed at a single time
point for each subject depending on their age and prior vaccination history. For adults, children 9–17 years of age and children
2–8 years of age who had previously been vaccinated against
seasonal influenza, postdose samples were collected for HAI
antibody analysis approximately 1 month after the first dose of
Q/LAIV; for children 2–8 years of age who had never previously
been vaccinated, samples were collected 1 month after the second
dose of Q/LAIV. Vaccine virus strains used in both studies are
listed in Table 1.
The adult and pediatric studies provided evidence that
Q/LAIV was immunologically noninferior to T/LAIV and that
the addition of the second B strain did not result in meaningful
immune interference with other strains included in the vaccine
[37,40,41]. Geometric mean titers (GMTs) of HAI antibody to each
of the strains in the Q/LAIV formulation were compared with
those in the T/LAIV formulations. The ratio of these antibody
responses was determined by dividing the value in the T/LAIV
arm by the value in the Q/LAIV arm. Thus, a ratio of 1 would
indicate that the immunogenicity of Q/LAIV and of the T/LAIV
comparator were identical. The immune response produced by
Q/LAIV was noninferior to T/LAIV because the upper bounds
of the two-sided 95% CI for the strain-specific HAI antibody
GMT ratios were ≤1.5, the prespecified limit for noninferiority
(see Figure 2A). In addition to GMT ratios, the geometric mean
fold rise from baseline in HAI antibodies was evaluated because
it accounts for differences in GMTs at baseline. Results for geometric mean fold rise ratios were similar to those for GMT ratios
(Figure 2B).
Post hoc analyses were performed to determine whether the
immune response to a B lineage strain
contained in Q/LAIV was higher than
the immune response to that strain in the
T/LAIV comparator that did not contain
it. In children and adults, the proportion
of subjects achieving a fourfold rise in
HAI antibody titer from baseline in those
receiving Q/LAIV and the T/LAIV containing the B lineage being assessed was
statistically significantly higher than the
responses observed for those receiving the
T/LAIV formulation that did not include
it (Figure 3). Overall, the data confirmed the
noninferiority of the immune response to

Vaccine Profile
Q/LAIV to that of T/LAIV, justifying the
application of the extensive efficacy data for
T/LAIV to Q/LAIV.
Safety & tolerability of Q/LAIV
Safety and tolerability were assessed similarly in both studies of Q/LAIV. Solicited
symptoms were queried and temperatures
were taken daily during days 0–14 after any
dose. Children who, in the judgment of the
investigator, were too young to voice a complaint of sore throat, headache or muscle
aches were not included in the denominator
for those solicited symptoms. The studies
did not include placebo arms, and since
solicited symptoms are events that occur
commonly even in the absence of vaccination, the rate differences between Q/LAIV
and T/LAIV recipients are more relevant
than the absolute rates of occurrence of
these events. Adverse events (AEs) were
collected during days 0–28 after any dose.
Serious AEs (SAEs) and new onset chronic
diseases were collected from 0–180 days
after the last dose of study vaccine.
Solicited symptoms
In the adult study, solicited symptoms
occurred at similar rates in Q/LAIV and
T/LAIV recipients, and no statistically
significant differences between treatments
were observed (Figure 4A). Runny/stuffy nose
was the most commonly reported solicited
symptom and it accounted for the largest
rate difference: it was reported in 4.1%
more Q/LAIV than T/LAIV recipients.
No other solicited symptom occurred with
a rate difference >1.1%.
In the pediatric study, solicited symptoms also occurred at similar rates in
Q/LAIV and T/LAIV subjects. No significant difference in rates of fever ≥38°C
(100.4°F) were observed between the two
groups (Q/LAIV: 5.7%; T/LAIV: 3.9%; p > 0.05, Figure 4B).
However, a small (2.4%) but statistically significant increase in
fever ≥38°C (100.4°F) after the first dose of Q/LAIV occurred
in the subset of children who were 2–8 years of age (Q/LAIV:
6.6%; T/LAIV: 4.2%; p = 0.04). Rates of fever were not
increased after dose 2 of Q/LAIV compared with T/LAIV.
Overall, high fever in children 2–8 years of age was uncommon
(Table 2), the median duration of fever was 1 day and no febrile
seizures were observed.
In children and adults, the number and types of AEs were
generally similar among Q/LAIV and T/LAIV recipients. The
only events occurring at a statistically increased rate among
Q/LAIV recipients were pyrexia (Q/LAIV: 1.7%; T/LAIV: 0.7%;
p = 0.04), headache (Q/LAIV: 0.9%; T/LAIV: 0.2%; p = 0.04)
and oropharyngeal pain (the term used for sore throat in the
coding dictionary; Q/LAIV: 0.6%; T/LAIV: 0%; p = 0.03) in
children 2–17 years of age after dose 1. No treatment-related SAEs
or new onset chronic diseases were associated with Q/LAIV in
either study. The rates of SAEs were comparable between Q/LAIV
and T/LAIV in both studies. No increase in asthma or wheezing
events was associated with Q/LAIV in either study [109]. In these
two studies, the safety and tolerability of Q/LAIV were similar
to that of T/LAIV, supporting the applicability of the extensive
safety database for T/LAIV to Q/LAIV.

Vaccine Profile
Licensure of Q/LAIV in the USA
In the US approval, Q/LAIV has the same age indication, warnings and precautions as T/LAIV. Q/LAIV will contain the viral
strains recommended annually by the WHO and the US FDA.
In fact, the WHO began identifying candidate vaccine strains
from both influenza B lineages starting with recommendations
for the 2011–2012 northern hemisphere seasonal influenza
vaccine formulation [101]. Q/LAIV is
contraindicated in individuals who have
had a severe allergic reaction to any component of the vaccine including egg proteins,
gentamicin, gelatin and arginine, those who
have had a serious reaction to any previous influenza vaccine, and in children and
adolescents receiving concomitant aspirin
or aspirin-containing therapy. Information
concerning additional warnings and precautions regarding use of Q/LAIV are
available in its package insert. Q/LAIV will
be available commercially in the USA for
the 2013–2014 influenza season.
Conclusion
Influenza B is responsible for significant
morbidity in children and adults worldwide. Current trivalent influenza vaccines
provide limited protection against B viruses
of a different lineage than the one included
in the vaccine. Vaccination with a quadrivalent influenza vaccine containing strains
from both B lineages should provide broad
protection against both influenza A and B.
In two clinical studies conducted in adults
18–49 years and children 2–17 years of age,
the addition of a second B strain did not
result in immune interference with other
strains included in the vaccine, and the
safety and tolerability profiles of Q/LAIV
and T/LAIV were similar. Seasonal vaccination with Q/LAIV has the potential
to augment the protection provided by
T/LAIV by providing protection against
both lineages of influenza B.
Expert commentary
Influenza B accounts for approximately
a quarter of all influenza infections and
affects all age groups. The severity of disease and propensity toward complications
is similar for influenza A and B, but as a
recent CDC publication stated: “the public
health impact of influenza B virus has been
overshadowed by the magnitude of disease
caused by influenza A viruses” [15]. An editorial associated with this article called for
additional studies to increase our understanding of influenza B
and its outcomes [13]. Medical and scientific opinion concerning
influenza B may still be influenced by early studies that concluded
that influenza B resulted in less of a disease burden than influenza

Vaccine Profile
first quadrivalent influenza vaccine may help highlight the importance of influenza B and prompt additional research to further
characterize disease caused by influenza B.
There are many benefits to including both influenza B lineages in
an influenza vaccine. The most obvious is to provide a direct benefit
to vaccine recipients, particularly when a large number of circulating
influenza B viruses do not match the lineage chosen for the trivalent
influenza vaccine. This clinical benefit would occur whenever a
B strain from the incorrect lineage is chosen for the trivalent vaccine
or when both lineages are cocirculating to a significant degree. The
efficacy of the current trivalent LAIV has been shown to decrease
from 86% versus matched B strains to 31% versus heterologous
B strains [3]. Moreover, in seasons in which influenza B circulation
is minimal or B viruses are well matched to the trivalent vaccine
strain, vaccination with a quadrivalent influenza vaccine would still
provide benefit to the individual by priming the immune response
to both lineages of influenza B so that subjects will enter future
influenza seasons with antibodies to strains from both B lineages.
An underappreciated benefit of quadrivalent vaccines is the
potential, from a public health perspective, to improve the public’s
confidence and acceptance of influenza vaccination [23]. Each
influenza season in which the trivalent influenza vaccine does
not match circulating strains allows for the possibility of breakthrough influenza infections, and the resultant widely read news
stories concerning the poor efficacy of the vaccine erode the public
perception of the value of influenza vaccination. Quadrivalent
vaccines may obviate the contribution of an incorrectly chosen
influenza B lineage in this scenario. Increased acceptance of influenza vaccination would help further the trends toward higher
rates of vaccination that have been apparent over the last several

years. This, along with the efficacy and safety profile of Q/LAIV,
is predicted to reduce the morbidity associated with influenza.
Five-year view
Other quadrivalent influenza vaccines in development
The inclusion of a fourth B strain in influenza vaccines has been
discussed by public health authorities for a number of years;
however, manufacturing limitations that could have resulted in
insufficient vaccine supply were a significant concern, given that
the addition of a fourth strain would require additional capacity
and extend manufacturing timelines. Currently, manufacturing
capacity exceeds usage and, because inactivated quadrivalent
influenza vaccines are projected to be available soon from several
manufacturers, it seems probable that the supply of a quadrivalent
vaccine will be sufficient for projected demand [62]. Manufacturers
are also likely to extend their current practice of manufacturing
seasonal strains ‘at risk’ – prior to final selection by the WHO
and local authorities – to meet the timelines needed to have a
quadrivalent vaccine available early, in time to vaccinate a large
number of people prior to widespread circulation of influenza in
the community.
An inactivated quadrivalent inf luenza vaccine by
GlaxoSmithKline has completed Phase III development and has
been submitted for regulatory review in the USA and EU [103].
Similarly, a quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine based on
the approved trivalent Fluzone® is in Phase III development by
Sanofi Pasteur (ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: NCT01218646,
NCT01481454 and NCT01240746 [104]). Similar to Q/LAIV,
these quadrivalent vaccines contain two influenza A strains
(A/H1N1 and A/H3N2) and two B strains (B/Yamagata and
B/Victoria). Limited published study results are available for these
novel quadrivalent vaccines. Other manufacturers also report that
quadrivalent formulations are in development [63].
Trends in influenza vaccination
For many years, influenza vaccination was targeted to older adults
and individuals with high-risk medical conditions. However,
there has been increasing recognition of the burden of influenza
in children and younger adults, and several countries have recommended annual influenza vaccination for healthy children;
some countries, including the USA, have recommended universal
influenza vaccination of all individuals 6 months of age and
older. The benefits of influenza vaccination should be enhanced
by the advent of quadrivalent influenza vaccines that provide
broad protection against influenza A and B. Policymakers will
need to determine whether quadrivalent influenza vaccines
should become the new standard of care for all or for specific
populations, much as was determined when trivalent vaccines
replaced bivalent vaccines containing A/H3N2 and one B strain
in the 1970s.

Key issues
• In a half of recent influenza seasons, the predominant circulating influenza B lineage was different from that contained in trivalent
influenza vaccines. This frequent lineage mismatch between the circulating influenza B virus and the lineage contained in the seasonal
influenza vaccine has reduced overall influenza vaccine effectiveness.
• An intranasally administered Ann Arbor strain quadrivalent live-attenuated influenza vaccine (Q/LAIV) composed of two influenza
A viruses and two influenza B viruses, one each from the Yamagata and Victoria lineages, has been developed for the prevention of
seasonal influenza. It has been approved for use in the USA.
• Q/LAIV shares the same core characteristics of trivalent live-attenuated influenza vaccine (T/LAIV; manufacturing process, excipients,
master donor viruses, strain dosage and delivery system) and builds on the safety and efficacy profile already established for T/LAIV.
• Two studies conducted in adults and children provide evidence that the addition of the second B strain does not result in meaningful
immune interference between strains included in the vaccine. The safety profiles of Q/LAIV and T/LAIV are similar.
• Shifting from trivalent to quadrivalent influenza vaccines is expected to increase protection against influenza by providing coverage
against circulating viruses from both B lineages.
