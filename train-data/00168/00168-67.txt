A cold recombinant live influenza B virus vaccine was tested m man. In comparison to a placebo, reactogenicity attributable to virus infection was slight or moderate. No revertant viruses were shed, and there was no evidence of transmission to
the placebo group who were housed in close contact with the vaccinees. Serological
responses to initial inoculation were moderate; 60% of vaccinees showing twofold
increases in serum hcmagglut inat ion inhibition (HAI) titers gave a geometric mean
titer (GMT) of 1:13
Three weeks after the first vaccination, both the vaccine and the placebo group
were revaccinated with homologous live virus vaccine. Thc group previously given
vaccine was resistant to reinfection as judged from clinical reactions and virus
shedding and the GMT increased only slightly to 1:16.3. In contrast, the former
placebo group responded; mild symptoms were seen, the majority shed viruses and
50% showed twofold increases in serum HA1 titers to a geometric mean titer of
1:17.4.

INTRODUCTION
Infections with influenza B viruses play a small but significant role in epidemic
respiratory disease. In the United States, Davis [I9761 estimated that influenza-like infections comprised 38% of acute infections. An analysis of World Health Organization
(WH0)data [Assaad and Cockburn, 19741 reveals that between 1967and 1973 approximately 5% of influenza-like diseases were caused by influenza B viruses. Although
generally regarded as a mild illness in adults, in children influenza B may be as severe as
influenza A [Stuart-Harris and Schild, 19761 and explosive outbreaks, with attack rates
as high as SO%, have been reported in boarding schools in England. Influenza B virus
infections are considered of sufficient importance to warrant control by immunization,

so that currently the WHO includes recommendations for an influenza B component in
influenza virus vaccines.
There is evidence that immunization with live attenuated influenza B viruses induced substantial immunity persisting at least 6months [Beareet al, 19711. Vaccination
with live virus vaccine, then, offers an attractive alternative to the use of killed virus
vaccines.
We have recently made comparative studies of several influenza B virus strains in
cell cultures, organ cultures, and hamsters [Reeve et al, 19811. One strain, the B/hn
Arbor/1/66 cold adapted virus was of reduced virulence for hamsters and possessed a
stable temperature sensitive (‘7s”) marker.
Previous studies [Davenport et al, 19771 had shown this virus to be also attenuated in man. A recombinant of this attenuated virus and a wild-type virus from a recent
influenza B infection, B/Tecumseh/l0/77, was seen to share properties with the cold
adapted virus but to possess the surface antigens of the wild-type parent [Reeve et al,
19811. This recombinant , I1 RB-77 clone 5c, was considered to have potential as a vaccine strain and, accordingly, we have undertaken a clinical study in adult volunteers.
The results of this study are reported here.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Viruses
The origin and biological properties of the cold-recombinant virus, 11 RB-77
clone 5c, have been described [Reeve et al, 19811.
The experiment a1 vaccine was produced in specific pat hogen free (SPF) 10-dayold fertile hens’eggs and was shown to be free from adventitious agents and to lack abnormal toxicity.
Volunteers
Volunteers were male and female university students between 20 and 24 years of
age who had given informed consent. All volunteers, in addition to physical examinations, were subjected to the following medical and clinical tests to ensure good health
and were excluded if abnormalities were detected: complete blood counts, blood chemistry (BUN, SCOT, SGPT, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin and fasting glucose levels),
urinalysis, chest X ray, and electrocardiogram. Women were admitted to the study
only when pregnancy was excluded by laboratory tests.
Current or recent respiratory tract infections and known sensibility to egg proteins were grounds for exclusion from the study. Volunteer studies conformed to the
guidelines for human experimentation, Declaration of Helsinki, and had received instit ut ional and ethical approval.
Study Plan
In this double-blind placebo-controlled study, volunteers were assigned to vaccine or placebo groups by use of a computer-generated code.
Two studies were made with the same volunteers. In the first part, under sequestered conditions, volunteers were administered either vaccine or placebo. They were
lodged in a sequestered wing of a hotel in the Vienna Woods in double and single rooms
and so separated from the public. Close contact was permitted between the placebo and
vaccinated groups. On the first day of the study, volunteers were treated intranasally 
Live Influenza B Vaccine in Man 3
with 0.25 ml vaccine per nostril (7.2 log 10 EIDso per 0.5 ml) or placebo (physiological
saline). On each of the first five days of the study, volunteers were medically examined
by two physicians and morning and evening temperatures were recorded. The following signs and symptoms were recorded using an arbitrary scoring system in which
severe reactions scored 3, moderate scored 2, light reactions scored 1, and no reactions
scored 0: fatigue, malaise, headache, sweating, shivering myalgia, sneezing, stuffy
nose, running nose, sore throat, and cough. Nasal swabs were taken daily and assayed
for virus titers using Madin-Derby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cell cultures and specific
pathogen-free (SPF) chicken eggs [Moritz et al, 19801. Three weeks after the first inoculations, all volunteers, including those previously given placebo, received a further
inoculation of vaccine (6.2 log 10 IEDso per 0.5 ml) intranasally. Subsequently, nasal
swabs were taken for virus reisolation. At the start of the study and three and six weeks
later, blood samples were taken for serological studies and were assayed for homologous HA1 and neuraminidase inhibiting (NI) antibodies [Moritz et al, 19801.
RESULTS
Clinical Observations
In the first part of the study no major reactions attributable to virus infection
were observed. No volunteers experienced febrile reactions and the overall clinical and
subjective responses were mild, being limited to minor respiratory and subjective symptoms (Table I). The number of volunteers recording stuffy noses in the vaccinated
group (7 of 10) was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than that of the placebo group (1 of
10). Significantly more subjective reactions (P < 0.05) were also seen after the first vaccination with the volunteers who received live vaccine (8 of 10) than the placebo group
(2 of 10) (Table 1).
In the second part of the study, after the booster vaccination, no clinical or subjective symptoms were seen in the previously vaccinated group (Table I). With the
group previously given placebo, following live virus vaccination, 8 of 10 volunteers recorded clinical symptoms such as stuffy or runny noses and 8 of 10 subjective clinical
reactions (Table I). The differences between the placebo group and vaccinated group to
the booster vaccination were statistically significant (P < 0.01).
Virological Observations
In the first part of the study virus was recovered at low titers from 8 of 10 volunteers (80%) of the group given live virus vaccine (Group A). Virus was shed for a mean
duration of 2.0 days: three volunteers shedding virus three days after inoculation
(Table 11). No viruses were recovered from the placebo group (Group B) (Table 11).
After the second inoculation with live vaccine, Group A, previously given vaccine, showed a greatly reduced rate of shedding. Only three volunteers yielded virw isolates, at low titers, on the day following inoculation (Table 111). In contrast, of the
Group B, originally given placebo, 9 of 10 (90%) shed virus after vaccination with the
cold-recombinant virus vaccine. Virus was recovered from this group for a mean duration of 2.8 days and two volunteers still excreted virus on the fourth day after infection.
The viruses isolated were examined for %"properties in MDCK cell cultures and
analyzed antigenically using an HA1 test. All proved to be indistinguishable from the
vaccine virus in being temperature sensitive and possessing an influenza B/Tecumseh/
10/77-like hemagglutinin.

Live Influenza B Vaccine in Man 7
Serological Observations
Before the study, most volunteers (17 of 20 or 85%) possessed serum HA1 titers
of < 1/10. With two volunteers, titers of 1:lO were found (Table 111). After the first
study, six of the 10 volunteers (60%) given the live virus vaccine showed twofold or
greater rises in serum HA1 titers and the group geometric mean titer (GMT) was 1:13.2
(Table 111). With the group given placebo no increases in serum HA1 titers were seen,
further evidence that none were infected by contact with the vaccinated group
(Table 111).
After the second vaccination, slight changes were seen in the serological responses of Group A, previously given live vaccine, the GMT increasing to 1 : 16.3 (Table
111). With Group B, given placebo in the first study, after receiving their first inoculation with the live virus vaccine, five of the ten (50%) showed twofold or greater increases in serum HA1 titers and the geometric mean titer became 1:17.4 (Table 111).
When the responses of all volunteers given one dose of live virus vaccine is considered,
the geometric mean titer is seen to be 1:15.2.
We also measured the changes in NI antibody titers and a similar picture is presented as found with the HA1 titers (Table IV). Before the study, the GMT of group A
(vaccine) and Group B (placebo) were, respectively, 1 :7.9 and 1:9.9. Three volunteers
in Group A were included with serum NI titers of between 1: 11 and 1:30 and in Group
B, there were five volunteers with similar titers and one with a titer of 1:33.
After the first study, six volunteers given live virus vaccine showed rises in serum
Nl titers (GMT after vaccination, 13.9) and the subsequent booster vaccination resulted in a further modest rise in GMT to 1:15.2 (Table IV).
None of the placebo group showed changes in serum Nt titers in the first part of
the study, but after subsequent vaccination with live virus vaccine, seven showed rises
in titer and the GMT rose to 1:17.5 (Table IV).
DISC USSlO N
The cold adapted influenza B virus B/AA/1/66 was previously shown to be attenuated in volunteers [Davenport et al, 19771. The trial reported on here has shown
that a recombinant derived therefrom is also attenuated. Attenuation for man is shared
with other properties such as reduced virulence for hamsters, and in hamster tracheal
organ cultures, and possession of “ts”markers [Reeve et al, 19811, properties not found
in the wild-type parental virus, B/Tecumseh/l0/77, of the recombinant. Although it is
not possible to state conclusively that the property of attenuation for man was transferred in the recombination process, this would not be an unreasonable assumption.
It is clear from this limited trial, that the cold-recombinant influenza B virus,
I1 RB-77 clone 5c, is sufficiently attenuated in man to warrant larger scale clinical trials
to assess its true potential as a vaccine strain. Reactogenicity would not appear to be
high: Mild clinical reactions, seen as stuffy or running noses, were apparent overall in
14 of 20 volunteers (70%) given the recombinant intranasally, but only five of these
recorded “moderate” reactions and none recorded “severe” reactions, Three volunteers
complained of slight systemic reactions such as headache or tiredness and one volunteer
complained of a slight sore throat. There was no evidence from viological or serological
tests for transmission of virus to the placebo group which was housed in close contact
with the vaccinees. From both studies a total of 38 viruses were reisolated from our vol-

unteers. All were similar serologically and in growth properties in MDCK cells to the
vaccine virus; thus no revertant viruses were detected.
The serological responses to the live virus vaccine were only moderate, a high
proportion of vaccinated volunteers shoaing small rises in serum HA1 titers. The geometric mean titers seen were approximately one-half of those usually found after vaccination with a sub-unit influenza B vaccine [Kunz et al, 19771 and are less than those
(1:18) assumed to be the 50% protective antibody level against infection with influenza
B virus [Hobson et al, 19721. Nevertheless, a subsequent booster vaccination failed to
infect our volunteers in Group A three weeks after their first inoculation with the live
recombinant vaccine. This shows the induction of at least 5hort-term resistance to reinfection, which may have been mediated by specific cellular responses or due to the induction of interferon.
