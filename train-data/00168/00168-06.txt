Abstract : These two, papers describe an epidemic of Hong Kong influenza among Bantu employees in a compound at a large chemical factory in South Africa.
i. In April 1969 71 % of the labour force were given one dose of an inactivated monovalent vaccine made from the Hong Kong strain of influenza A2. Most of the remaining employees (23%) were given a placebo injection.
The first case of influenza occurred 7 weeks after vaccination and the outbreak lasted 6 weeks. Influenza occurred in 42 (10%) of the 413 people who received the placebo but in only 25 (2%) of the 1254 vaccinated employees.
