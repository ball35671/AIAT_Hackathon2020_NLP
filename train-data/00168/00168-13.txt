Abstract
Background: Seasonal influenza imposes a substantial personal morbidity and societal cost burden. Vaccination is the
major strategy for influenza prevention; however, because antigenically drifted influenza A and B viruses circulate
annually, influenza vaccines must be updated to provide protection against the predicted prevalent strains for the next
influenza season. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy, safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of a
trivalent inactivated split virion influenza vaccine (TIV) in healthy adults over two influenza seasons in the US.
Methods: The primary endpoint of this double-blind, randomized study was the average efficacy of TIV versus placebo
for the prevention of vaccine-matched, culture-confirmed influenza (VMCCI) across the 2005-2006 and 2006-2007
influenza seasons. Secondary endpoints included the prevention of laboratory-confirmed (defined by culture and/or
serology) influenza, as well as safety, reactogenicity, immunogenicity, and consistency between three consecutive
vaccine lots. Participants were assessed actively during both influenza seasons, and nasopharyngeal swabs were
collected for viral culture from individuals with influenza-like illness. Blood specimens were obtained for serology one
month after vaccination and at the end of each influenza season's surveillance period.
Results: Although the point estimate for efficacy in the prevention of all laboratory-confirmed influenza was 63.2%
(97.5% confidence interval [CI] lower bound of 48.2%), the point estimate for the primary endpoint, efficacy of TIV
against VMCCI across both influenza seasons, was 46.3% with a 97.5% CI lower bound of 9.8%. This did not satisfy the
pre-specified success criterion of a one-sided 97.5% CI lower bound of >35% for vaccine efficacy. The VMCCI attack
rates were very low overall at 0.6% and 1.2% in the TIV and placebo groups, respectively. Apart from a mismatch for
influenza B virus lineage in 2005-2006, there was a good match between TIV and the circulating strains. TIV was highly
immunogenic, and immune responses were consistent between three different TIV lots. The most common
reactogenicity events and spontaneous adverse events were associated with the injection site, and were mild in
severity.
Conclusions: Despite a good immune response, and an average efficacy over two influenza seasons against
laboratory-confirmed influenza of 63.2%, the pre-specified target (lower one-sided 97.5% confidence bound for
efficacy > 35%) for the primary efficacy endpoint, the prevention of VMCCI, was not met. However, the results should
be interpreted with caution in view of the very low attack rates we observed at the study sites in the 2005-2006 and
2006-2007, which corresponded to relatively mild influenza seasons in the US. Overall, the results showed that TIV has
an acceptable safety profile and offered clinical benefit that exceeded risk.

Background
Annual epidemics of influenza due to influenza A and B
viruses remain a substantial cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, particularly among vulnerable groups
such as people aged ≥ 65 years, children aged <2 years,
and people with chronic medical conditions [1-3]. In
addition to these identified risk groups, influenza is
responsible for a substantial burden of illness, absenteeism, and resultant societal costs among otherwise healthy
working adults [4-7]. Trivalent inactivated influenza vaccines (TIV) containing antigens of two influenza A
strains (one A/H1N1 and one A/H3N2), in combination
with antigens of one influenza B strain, provide the current standard for influenza prevention. Because one or
more new antigenically drifted variants circulate annually, the vaccines must be updated to provide optimal
protection against the predicted prevalent strains for the
next influenza season [8-10]. The World Health Organization (WHO), as well as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Center for Biologics Evaluation and
Research, provide annual guidance for strain selection
based on new drift variants detected through a global
influenza surveillance network [8,9].
Clinical trial data have repeatedly shown that TIVs can
be protective against seasonal influenza, including seasons when the surface antigens of the prevalent virus(es)
match the vaccine strains, and some seasons when a
drifted strain circulates, although efficacy can be reduced
as a result of substantial antigenic drift [8,11-14]. However, many TIV studies have been either too small to provide narrow confidence limits about the point estimates
for efficacy, or have used serological criteria to define the
influenza infection endpoint, which unlike virus detection by culture or molecular methods, may bias the
results in favor of the vaccine because detection of infection by seroconversion may be adversely affected by prior
elevation of baseline titers in vaccinated, but not unvaccinated subjects [15,16]. Furthermore, marked variations in
efficacy estimates have been observed from season to
season, even when the same investigators have applied
identical methods to evaluate the same type of vaccine
formulation in consecutive years [12,13].
In this paper, we describe an efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity study of a trivalent inactivated split virus
influenza vaccine (TIV; marketed, depending on the
countries, as Fluviral®
, FluLaval™, or Griplaval™ trademarks of the GlaxoSmithKline group of companies). The
product, first licensed in Canada in 1992, has undergone
several process refinements, including introduction of a
concentration step, homogenization, and sterile filtration.
Following clinical studies of safety and immunogenicity
in adults conducted in Canada and the US in the 2004-
2005 influenza season, the product received accelerated
approval from the FDA in 2006 [17]. The randomized,
placebo-controlled study reported in this paper is part of
the post-approval clinical trial program, conducted to
confirm manufacturing consistency, and to further assess
the clinical benefits of this TIV formulation using culture-confirmed efficacy endpoints[17].
The study included healthy adults aged 18 to 49 years in
the US, and in order that a placebo control could be ethically employed, high-risk patients for whom annual influenza vaccine is recommended by the Advisory
Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) were not
eligible for inclusion [18]. The primary clinical endpoint
was based upon rates of culture-confirmed influenza illness caused by A and/or B virus strains antigenically
matching those in the vaccine. The study was conducted
over the 2005-2006 and 2006-2007 influenza seasons.
Methods
Design and participants
This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
study of the efficacy of TIV in prevention of vaccinematched, culture-confirmed influenza (VMCCI) conducted in the 2005-2006 and 2006-2007 influenza seasons in the US.
The original primary outcome measure defined by the
study protocol was the average vaccine efficacy over two
consecutive seasons in the prevention of culture-confirmed influenza. In correspondence following the 2005-
2006 season, the FDA Center for Biologics Evaluation and
Research noted that the season was marked by a significant frequency of circulation of influenza virus strains
that were antigenically-drifted from those in the vaccine,
and required that the protocol be modified to assess the
average efficacy against VMCCI across both seasons as
the primary measure of vaccine efficacy.
Male and female volunteers aged 18 to 49 years inclusive were eligible to participate if they were clinically
healthy, understood the study procedures, had access to
telephone contact throughout study, and provided
informed written consent. In Season 1, eligible participants were enrolled at 37 centers, and in Season 2, eligible participants were enrolled at 44 centers.
Exclusion criteria included: a significant acute or
chronic, or medical or psychiatric illness requiring institution of new medical or surgical treatment, or a significant dose alteration for uncontrolled symptoms or drug
toxicity within 3 months; diagnosis of cancer, or treatment for cancer, within 3 years; systolic blood pressure ≥
140 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mmHg; a health
condition placing the potential subject in a risk group
recommended for routine influenza immunization by
Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP),

e.g. chronic pulmonary (including asthma), cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, hematological, or metabolic disorders
(including diabetes mellitus); immunosuppressive illness,
recent/ongoing receipt of immunosuppressive therapy, or
human immunodeficiency virus infection [18]; recent
administration of other vaccine or immunoglobulin, contraindication to influenza vaccine, or previous influenza
vaccination within 9 months. A negative pregnancy urine
test at screening was required for women of childbearing
potential before inclusion into the study, and women
were required to use reliable contraception throughout
the study. Individuals employed in professions prone to
influenza transmission to or from high-risk populations,
and individuals living in the same household as an immunocompromised person were not eligible to participate
(also based on ACIP recommendations [18]).
In order to allow an independent assessment of efficacy
in each season, participants who were enrolled in the
study during 2005-2006 (Season 1) were not eligible for
enrollment during 2006-2007 (Season 2).
The study was conducted in accordance with Good
Clinical Practice, US regulatory requirements, and the
Declaration of Helsinki. This protocol and consent for
this multi-centered study were approved by six (6) independent ethics committees/institutional review boards as
required to provide ethical oversight for 44 sites. The
names of these bodies are on file with the corresponding
author.
Vaccine allocation and administration
Treatment allocation was determined by blocked, stratified randomization with a 1:1 distribution to TIV or placebo; randomization was stratified by study center, age
(18-34 and 35-49 years), and the subject's report of previous recent receipt (within ≤ 2 years) of TIV. Each study
center had a pre-determined sequence of randomization
numbers which were allocated sequentially to eligible
subjects. Participants were allocated equally among 3 different vaccine lots. Clinic staff (excluding the nurse giving
the vaccine), were blinded to the treatment group until
the study was complete.
Participants received a single injection of TIV (FluLaval™, a trademark of the GlaxoSmithKline group of companies; manufactured by ID Biomedical Corporation of
Quebec [IBD-Q], Canada), or saline placebo injection.
Each 0.5 mL dose of TIV contained 15 μg of hemagglutinin (HA) antigen of each recommended influenza strain.
Antigens for Season 1 (2005-2006) were A/New Caledonia/20/1999 (H1N1), A/New York/55/2004 (H3N2, A/
California/7/2004-like), and B/Jiangsu/10/2003 (B/
Shanghai/361/2002-like). Antigens for Season 2 (2006-
2007) were A/New Caledonia/20/1999 (H1N1) virus, A/
Wisconsin/67/2005 (H3N2), and B/Malaysia/2506/2004.
Three consecutive vaccine lots were used in each season.
Outcomes
The primary endpoint was the average efficacy over Seasons 1 and 2 for the prevention of culture-confirmed
influenza illness due to influenza A or B virus strains
antigenically matching those in the vaccine (i.e. vaccinematched, culture-confirmed influenza; VMCCI). The
case definition of VMCCI required the presence of influenza-like illness (ILI), defined as symptoms that interfered with normal daily activities and that included
cough, and at least 1 additional symptom from among
fever (oral temperature >37.7°C/99.9°F), headache, myalgia and/or arthralgia, chills, rhinorrhea/nasal congestion,
and sore throat. Participants meeting the definition for
ILI and with concurrent isolation from a nasopharyngeal
swab of an influenza A and/or B virus isolate antigenically
matching a vaccine strain for the relevant year were considered to be cases of VMCCI.
Co-primary safety endpoints were the assessment of
solicited local and general reactogenicity events occurring between 0 and 3 days of vaccination, and unsolicited
spontaneous adverse events (AEs) for a minimum of 135
days post-vaccination.
The average efficacy over Seasons 1 and 2 against culture-confirmed influenza illness (CCI), or laboratoryconfirmed influenza illness (LCI) were secondary endpoints. CCI was defined as ILI with any influenza A or B
virus isolate by culture, and LCI was defined as one or
both of CCI or ILI with a 4-fold increase in hemagglutination-inhibiting (HI) serum antibody titers to a circulating influenza virus strain between Day 21 (± 4 days) postvaccination and Final Visit specimens obtained after the
end of the influenza season. The average efficacy across
both seasons was also assessed according to age, prior
vaccination status, and gender; but no attempt was made
to provide statistical power for hypothesis tests within
these subgroups.
Immunogenicity endpoints were HI assay-based Day 21
seroconversion and seroprotection rates, geometric mean
fold-rises (GMFR) between Day 0 and Day 21, and lot
equivalence according to reciprocal GMTs at Day 21 in
Season 1.
Surveillance
The surveillance period in each season was ~15 weeks.
Surveillance for influenza was conducted between 14
November 2005 through 30 April 2006 (Season 1), and 13
November 2006 through 30 April 2007 (Season 2).
Throughout the influenza season, participants were
instructed to report symptoms meeting the definition of
ILI via a study-specific, toll-free telephone number
within 48 hours of symptom onset, and to record temperatures and symptoms during ILI episodes. This passive
surveillance method was accompanied by active surveillance in which ILI symptoms were solicited during

weekly outbound telephone contact. Local visiting nurses
were dispatched to participants fulfilling the definition of
ILI within 24 hours of reporting, and obtained nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs for viral culture. To
ensure that influenza illnesses were detected, participants
could be swabbed more than once.
Antigenic characterization and serology
Blood samples were taken before vaccination on Day 0,
and at the next study visit on Day 21 (± 4 days), and at the
Final Visit, which was within 4 weeks following the end of
the surveillance period. Following serum separation,
samples were frozen until analysis. Combined nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab samples from participants reporting ILI were refrigerated and transported to a
central laboratory (Covance Central Laboratory Services,
Inc., Indianapolis, US) for influenza virus culture and
assessment of CCI. Samples were cultured using primary
monkey kidney cells, and influenza A and B viruses were
identified using immunofluorescent staining with influenza-specific monoclonal antibodies. Influenza A viruses
were further sub-typed by immunofluorescence using H1
and H3 specific reagents.
Detailed antigenic characterization and vaccine match
analysis (i.e. VMCCI) of the influenza viral isolates was
determined by serologic methods in the laboratory of Dr
John Treanor (University of Rochester Medical Center
[URMC], New York, US), using ferret sera for influenza A
virus strains (kindly provided by Dr Alexander Klimov,
CDC, Atlanta, Georgia, US), or WHO typing sera for B
lineages. Isolates were considered to be 'vaccine matching' if there was a ≤ 4-fold difference in the HI titer of the
subject isolate strain and the vaccine prototype strain
with reference anti-serum [19]. Testing included TIV
virus strains, and drifted influenza A virus strains or
alternate-lineage influenza B virus strains circulating in
each year. The isolate type and subtype were also confirmed using reverse transcription polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR; GSK Biologicals, Rixensart, Belgium).
RT-PCR confirmed the isolate type and subtype determined by immunofluorescence and/or HI testing for
100% of isolates.
To evaluate the endpoint of LCI, Day 21 and Final Visit
sera of all participants who reported ILI, irrespective of
culture-confirmation, were tested for seroconversion.
Immunogenicity of the vaccine was examined by testing
of Day 0 and Day 21 serum samples in a randomly
selected subset of participants. Immunogenicity was
assessed using established HI assay methods performed
at the IBD-Q analytic laboratory (IBD-Q/GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals North America Clinical Immunology
Laboratory, Laval, Quebec, Canada) [20].
Reactogenicity and safety
After the injection, participants were observed for 30
minutes for local and/or systemic reactogenicity, and oral
temperature was taken. Participants received memory
aids to record the severity of injection site reactions, reactogenicity events, and general solicited adverse events
(AEs). Definitions of events and severity grades were provided with the memory aids. Participants reported immediate reactogenicity data (within 30 minutes of dosing)
before leaving the clinic, and solicited reactogenicity
symptoms (occurring on Day 0 from 30 minutes postvaccination to the evening of Day 3) no later than 8 days
post-vaccination via an Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS).
Data on AEs and serious adverse events (SAEs) were
reported throughout the entire study period. AEs were
captured using electronic case report forms and coded by
preferred term and primary system organ class (SOC)
using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities
(MedDRA).
Sample size
Sample size calculations were based on the FarringtonManning method, as implemented in the PASS software
package. We assumed a vaccine efficacy of 70% and a rate
of culture-confirmed influenza (CCI) of 2.0% in placebo
recipients in each season. The originally planned sample
size was selected to provide 80% power in a one-sided test
with type 1 error = 0.025 to reject the null hypothesis that
the average vaccine efficacy was less than 35%. An adjustment of 10% was applied to account for potential dropouts, resulting in a target of 3187 participants per study
arm across both seasons (total 6374). After the end of
Season 1, at the request of the regulatory authority (US
FDA, Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research), the
primary study endpoint was changed from CCI to vaccine-matching, culture-confirmed influenza illness
(VMCCI).
As specified in the protocol, at the end of Season 1 an
unblinded, independent statistician, who was not otherwise involved in the analysis, evaluated the actual rate of
CCI detected during Season 1. This had originally been
planned to ensure that the estimated sample size across
both seasons would confer sufficient power to demonstrate average efficacy against CCI with the requisite
degree of precision and to allow adjustment of the sample
size in Season 2 if needed. Given the change in the primary endpoint, this determination also involved estimation of the proportion of influenza isolates identified
from the placebo group that would be antigenically
matched to the vaccine strains, to ensure that the study
would be adequately powered for the endpoint of
VMCCI. Therefore, the statistician assumed that 66.8% of
influenza isolates identified in the placebo group in Sea-

son 1 (all of which had not yet been sub-typed) were antigenically matched to the vaccine strains, based on 2005-
2006 US surveillance data, and that 80% of influenza isolates identified from the placebo group in Season 2 would
be antigenically matched to the vaccine strains, based on
the mean and median values of US surveillance results for
the preceding 6 years [21]. Based on these estimations
and the actual CCI attack rate identified in Season 1, the
enrollment target for Season 2 was increased from 3187
to 3900 participants.
Statistical analysis
The primary analysis was performed on the Per-Protocol
(PP) set including participants who received the treatment to which they were randomized, responded to ≥ 1
post-vaccination active surveillance telephone call, and
with no major protocol deviations considered to affect
the efficacy or immunogenicity data. Exclusions from the
PP set were determined and documented before unblinding. The possible introduction of biases by use of the PP
set was assessed by repeating efficacy analyses in the ITI
set, which was the PP set plus participants with protocol
deviations and treatment errors, and analyzed as randomized. Immunogenicity was evaluated in a randomly
selected subset of participants (immunogenicity set).
The primary efficacy analysis was based on the average
efficacy over Seasons 1 and 2 and assessed the null
hypothesis that the average efficacy in the actively immunized group was ≤ 35%, against the alternative hypothesis
that average efficacy was >35%. Average efficacy was
defined as 1 - v(R1R2) × 100 where R1 and R2 were the relative risks of a given disease endpoint in Seasons 1 and 2,
respectively. A one-sided 97.5% CI was constructed for
the average efficacy, and the TIV efficacy target was to be
established if the lower bound of the CI was >35%.
The seroconversion rate was defined as the proportion
of participants with a ≥ 4-fold increase in reciprocal HI
titer at Day 21 versus Day 0, or a reciprocal HI titer of ≥
40 from a starting value <10; seroprotection rate was the
proportion of participants with HI titers ≥ 1:40 at Day 21.
The geometric means of reciprocal HI titers (GMTs) were
calculated for Day 0 and Day 21 samples, and the geometric mean fold-rises (GMFR; geometric mean of the
within-subject fold increases from Day 0 to 21) were also
calculated. Lot equivalence was assessed using reciprocal
GMTs at Day 21 in the immunogenicity set in Season 1.
The Zmin method of Wiens and Iglewicz (WI) was used
to assess overall lot equivalence with a two-sided 0.05 significance level and power of ≥90% [22]. One-sided 97.5%
lower confidence bounds (identical to two-sided 95%
lower confidence bounds) on the rate of seroconversion,
seroprotection, and GMT were calculated with each Season.
The safety set included participants who received any
study treatment and had any post-vaccination safety data.
If an incorrect treatment was conclusively documented,
participants in the safety set were analyzed based on the
treatment they actually received. The incidence of immediate complaints, reactogenicity events from Day 0 to Day
3, and unsolicited AEs were compared between the TIV
and placebo groups using Fisher's exact tests. Any reactogenicity event at grade 2 or 3 with an incidence of >10%
was assessed using an extended Mantel-Haenszel test.
Statistical analyses of safety were performed at the twosided significance level of 0.05, with no correction for
multiple comparisons.
Results
Participants
Participant enrollment in Season 1 began 17 September
2005 and follow-up ended 31 May 2006, and enrollment
in Season 2 began 16 October 2006 and follow-up ended
6 June 2007. A total of 7611 participants received treatment; 3783 participants received TIV, and 3828 received
placebo. A total of 7219 (95%) of vaccinated participants
completed the study (Figure 1). The PP set included 3714
participants in the TIV group, and 3768 participants in
the placebo group. No participants with culture-confirmed influenza illness were excluded from the primary
analysis.
There were no significant differences between the
treatment groups for any baseline characteristic (Table 1).
In both groups, 57% of participants were aged 18-34
years, and 43% were aged 35-49 years.
Vaccine efficacy
The average attack rate for VMCCI over Seasons 1 and 2
was low at 23/3714 (0.6%) in the TIV group, and 45/3768
(1.2%) in the placebo group (Table 2). The VMCCI attack
rate in the placebo group in Season 1 (1.7%) was lower
than, but similar to, the assumption used for the original
sample size estimate (2.0%). In Season 2, the attack rate
for VMCCI in the placebo group was extremely low at
0.7% and was much lower than the assumed attack rate of
VMCCI of 1.6% that had been used to determine the
revised sample size for enrollment in Season 2.
The average efficacy of TIV for the prevention of
VMCCI was 46.3%, with a one-sided 97.5% CI lower
bound of 9.8%, thus the null hypothesis of efficacy ≤ 35%
could not be rejected. Attack rates for CCI and LCI over
Seasons 1 and 2 were higher than the attack rates of
VMCCI, but were still relatively low. In the TIV and placebo groups, attack rates for CCI were 0.8% and 1.6%,
respectively, and the average efficacy of TIV against CCI
was 49.3% with a 97.5% CI lower bound of 20.3%. The
attack rates for LCI in the TIV and placebo groups were
1.2% and 3.2%, respectively, and the average efficacy of

TIV against LCI was 63.2% with a 97.5% CI lower bound
of 48.2% (Table 2). The results of the efficacy analyses
conducted using the ITI set were essentially identical to
those using the PP set; differing by only 0.1% for each of
the VMCCI, CCI, and LCI endpoints (data not shown).
The antigenic characteristics of the influenza A and B
viruses isolated from study participants showed good
general concordance with CDC surveillance data in the
same years [23,24]. In both Seasons 1 and 2, there was
limited antigenic drift among A/H3N2 strains, and effiFigure 1 Enrollment and Inclusion in Analysis Sets over Two Seasons.

cacy against disease associated with H3N2 isolates differed minimally for vaccine-matched strains (VMCCI)
and all strains (CCI), or between seasons. No A/H1N1
viruses were isolated in Season 1, and in Season 2, overall
efficacy against A/H1N1 was low at 23.9%, although this
was based on a very small number of cases (6 in the TIV
group, 8 in the placebo group). In Season 1, in which a
Yamagata-lineage B virus was used in the vaccine and all
B virus isolates were found to be of the Victoria lineage,
there was thus by definition no VMCCI, and observed
efficacy against CCI for Victoria lineage viruses was 0. In
Season 2, in which B/Malaysia/2506/04 (a Victoria-lineage virus) was used in the vaccine, the point estimate for
efficacy against VMCCI due to influenza B viruses was
100%, while the point estimate for efficacy against disease
associated with Yamagata-lineage B viruses was 66%
(estimates again based on small case numbers, with broad
95% confidence bounds).
The average efficacy of TIV against VMCCI was
slightly higher in the 18-34 years stratum at 51.6% (97.5%
CI lower bound 44.5%), than in the 35-49 years stratum at
44.5% (97.5% CI lower bound -11.8%), but this difference
was not statistically significant (p = 0.79). Unexpectedly,
the average efficacy against VMCCI was much lower in
women, 19.4% (97.5% CI lower bound -42.8%), than in
men, 89.0% (97.5% CI lower bound 53.0%; p value for the
male:female contrast 0.0123). A similar, although slightly
less marked trend between sexes was observed for the
average efficacy of CCI and LCI (data not shown). Overall, women in this trial were marginally older than men
(mean ± SD: women 33.3 ± 9.14 years; men 31.7 ± 9.12
years) and had a slightly higher rate than men of recent
(within ≤ 2 years) previous influenza vaccine (women,
21%; men, 16%; p < 0.0001); these differences were similar
in the TIV and placebo groups.
In the PP set, ILI symptoms were reported by a total of
362/3714 (10%) participants in the TIV group, and 427/
3768 (11%) participants in the placebo group. An ad hoc
analysis was conducted to assess efficacy when the definition of ILI was restricted to include fever (defined by selfobserved oral temperature ≥ 38°C). With this modification, the average efficacy of TIV against VMCCI was
58.0%, with a 97.5% CI lower bound of -21.5% (due to
fewer cases), and the average efficacy of TIV against CCI
was 66.8%, with a 97.5% CI lower bound of 7.2%.
Immunogenicity
The PP immunogenicity set included 1514 randomly
selected participants, of which 1298 received TIV and
216 received placebo. TIV was highly immunogenic in
Seasons 1 and 2 (Table 3). Immune responses were similar in both seasons for the A/H1N1 and the B virus components. HI GMTs increased 9.94-10.96-fold after
immunization for the A/H1N1 component (A/NewCaledonia/20/99 in both seasons), with 68% seroconversion
rates in each season. GMTs increased 11.45-12.36-fold
for the B virus components, with 82% seroconversion to
B/Jiangsu/10/03 (a Yamagata lineage virus) in Season 1
and 74% seroconversion to B/Malaysia/2506/04 (a Victoria lineage virus) in Season 2. Responses differed between
seasons for the A/H3N2 component, with a stronger
response in Season 1 to the A/New York/55/2004 antigen

15.84 fold-rise in GMT and 85% seroconversion rate)
than in Season 2 to the A/Wisconsin/67/2005 antigen
(10.59 fold-rise in GMT and 72% seroconversion rate).
Despite this difference, the two-sided 95% CI lower
bound for the proportions of active vaccine recipients
attaining post-immunization HI titers ≥ 1:40 were ≥ 90%
for all vaccine strains in both seasons.
Treatment with placebo had a negligible effect on HI
titers in both seasons. In view of the unexplained gender
difference in efficacy noted above, a post-hoc examination of immune response by gender was performed. The
seroconversion rate for the A/New Caledonia H1N1 antigen was lower among women than men in both seasons,
and lower GMTs for this virus were found among women
(318.6) compared with men (414.6) in Season 2; however,
the proportion of men and women with A/New Caledonia/20/99 HI titers ≥ 1:40 was ≥ 96% in both seasons, and
there were no other immunogenicity differences of note
between men and women (Table 4).
In Season 1, immunogenic lot consistency based on
GMT values was demonstrated using the Zmin statistic by
the method of Wiens and Iglewciz [22], and according to
the study protocol, was not retested in Season 2 (data not
shown).
Reactogenicity and safety
One or more solicited events after immunization
occurred in 2487/3783 (66%) participants in the TIV
group and 1675/3828 (44%) participants in the placebo
group (p < 0.0001) (Table 5). Common reactogenicity
complaints (30 minutes post-vaccination through Day 3)
that were significantly more frequent in the TIV versus
the placebo group included pain/soreness at the injection
site (51% and 14%, respectively), tiredness (20% and 18%,
respectively), and myalgia and/or arthralgia (18% and
10%, respectively). Less frequent, but also significantly
associated with active treatment, were malaise and redness and/or swelling at the injection site. Oral temperatures of ≥ 37.5°C/99.9°F were reported by 3% of TIV
recipients and by 1% of placebo recipients (p = 0.0005);
however, the great majority of these reports included
maximal temperatures of ≤ 38.5°C/101.3°F. From Day 0
through Day 3 post-vaccination, there was no significant
association between TIV vaccination and reports of
headache, red eyes, cough, sore throat, and hoarseness or
pain on swallowing.
In both groups, the most frequent unsolicited AEs from
Days 0 through Day 21 with TIV and placebo were pharyngolaryngeal pain (120/3783 and 120/3828, respectively
[both 3%]), headache (118/3783 and 121/3828, respectively [both 3%]), and fatigue (108/3783 and 120/3828
[both 3%]). Overall, the rate of AE reports in the TIV
group was 808/3783 (21%) and in the placebo group was
736/3828 (19%) (p = 0.021).
From Day 0 to Final Visit, the incidence of unsolicited
AEs by SOC reported by ≥ 1% of participants was higher
with TIV than placebo, with injection site pain (95/3785
[3%] and 30/3828 [1%], respectively; p < 0.0001), and
injection site erythema (45/3783 [1%] and 9/3828 [<1%],
respectively; p < 0.0001) accounting for the betweengroup difference. No other significant differences were
seen between groups for incidence rates of AEs by SOC.

Unsolicited SAEs were uncommon, and were reported
by 1% of participants in both treatment groups. Overall,
44/3783 (1%) and 39/3728 (1%) of participants in the TIV
and placebo groups, respectively, experienced at least 1
SAE. All SAE types occurred in ≤ 1% of participants.
None of the SAEs were considered by the investigators to
be vaccine-related. One subject in the placebo group had
a fatal road traffic accident during the study. Severity of
ILI was not systematically assessed; a single subject in the
placebo group was hospitalized with a diagnosis of influenza.
Pregnancies
There were a total of 25 pregnancies in the TIV group,
and 32 in the placebo group, of which 4 (16%: 95% CI; 5%,
36%) and 7 (22%: 95% CI; 9%, 40%), respectively, ended in
spontaneous abortion. Three pregnancies were electively
terminated. One placebo recipient was induced at 34
weeks because of intrauterine growth retardation, and
the infant was reported to have 2 hernias, which were
surgically repaired, and a heart murmur. Two pregnant
participants were lost to follow up, and there were 18
(72%) and 22 (69%) full-term births with healthy infants
in the TIV and placebo groups, respectively.
Discussion
Although inactivated influenza vaccines are recommended for many populations, estimates as to their true
efficacy vary widely. It is commonly held that the efficacy
of TIVs is 60 to 80% in healthy younger adults and similar
in children over the age of 2 years, but less in the elderly
(particularly the chronically-ill or institutionalized) [25-
29]. The degree of antigenic match between the vaccine
and circulating virus strains, the exact illness endpoint
used, and the surveillance methodology in clinical trials
can influence efficacy estimates. Efficacy data concerning
children under 2 years of age are very limited.
This placebo-controlled, randomized study was conducted to assess the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity
of a TIV over the 2005 2006 (Season 1) and 2006 2007
(Season 2) influenza seasons in healthy adults in the US.
The primary endpoint was protection against VMCCI, as

requested by US regulatory authorities, rather than the
frequently cited endpoints of CCI or LCI. Although the
LCI endpoint has been questioned by some authors [15],
it is still widely used, and constitutes the primary endpoint for the majority of the published TIV efficacy experience.
Despite a good degree of 'vaccine-match' among the
influenza isolates in the trial (75.5%), and a strong
immune response to the vaccine in both years, the average efficacy over Seasons 1 and 2 of TIV against VMCCI
was only 46.3%, with a one-sided 97.5% CI lower bound
of 9.8%. While the vaccine was clearly efficacious relative
to placebo (one-sided 97.5% CI lower bound for efficacy
excluded 0), these results did not satisfy the pre-defined
criterion for success, i.e. exclusion of efficacy of ≤ 35% (as
evidenced by a lower 97.5% CI of >35%). The results were
similar for CCI, with an average efficacy of 49.4%, with
one-sided 97.5% CI lower bound of 20.3%, the CI becoming narrower due to the greater number of cases.
Efficacy was higher for the LCI endpoint, at 63.2%, with
one-sided 97.5% CI lower bound of 48.2%; this is generally consistent with previously reported TIV efficacy estimates in studies using this endpoint [12,14,30]. While an
intrinsic bias of the LCI endpoint in favor of the vaccine
has been noted [15,16] and, therefore, limits its utility for
regulatory purposes, it should also be noted that this endpoint may improve sensitivity relative to culture. In addition, the endpoint of LCI has been used in many prior
clinical trials of TIV, yielding estimates of TIV efficacy in
adults of about 70% [14,15]. Thus, the estimated vaccine
efficacy against LCI in this trial is consistent with that
estimated in prior trials of other TIVs.
A key factor influencing efficacy findings in influenza
vaccine studies is the disease attack rate, and the unpredictable nature of epidemic intensity poses a challenge
when planning influenza vaccine efficacy trials
[12,13,25,31]. Our study was powered on the assumptions
that vaccine efficacy would approximate 70%, based on
the prior literature reporting culture-confirmed influenza
endpoints, and that the attack rate for CCI in the placebo
group would be 2.0% across both seasons. The attack rate
assumption was adjusted in Season 2 to 1.6% based on
the regulatory request to adopt VMCCI as the primary
endpoint, and the sample size correspondingly increased.

The actual VMCCI attack rate in placebo recipients in
Season 1 was close to our prediction, but in Season 2 the
attack rate was less than half of that predicted, and this
had a large negative impact on the precision of the average efficacy estimate. Despite this, it was also clear that
the efficacy observed did not differ markedly between the
seasons, and might not have sufficed to exclude the 35%
lower bound of the primary hypothesis even if the
VMCCI attack rates in Season 2 had matched those in
Season 1.
Similar to the findings of our study, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention surveillance data summaries
for the 2005-2006 and 2006-2007 influenza seasons in the
US suggest that these were relatively mild influenza seasons [23,24]. The weekly percentage of outpatient visits to
US sentinel providers for ILI peaked twice in the 2005-
2006 season at 3.3% and 3.2% (baseline 2.2%), and peaked
twice in the 2006-2007 season at 3.0% and 3.5% (baseline
2.1%) [23,24]. In the prior three seasons, the peak percentage of outpatient visits for ILI had ranged from 2.3%
to 7.6% [23,24].
A negative impact of low attack rates in a given season
on point estimates of efficacy has been well documented.
Previous studies of a TIV product, involving the same
investigators, methods, and source populations over successive seasons, have reported dramatic differences in
efficacy estimates between seasons, without obvious
explanation based on circulating strain match to the vaccine [12,13]. In these studies, the low efficacy estimates
were found in seasons with lower overall attack rates
[12,13]; a similar experience has occurred in pediatric trials [31]. While a clear reason for this phenomenon is not
apparent, it can be speculated that low background attack
rates may result from either relatively high pre-existing
population resistance to the circulating strain(s), or modest intrinsic virulence of the circulating strains, such that
only intense exposures lead to disease. In either case, the
attainable impact of a vaccine might be blunted. Primary
detection of influenza virus infections in this study was
by means of viral culture; with the use of molecular methods confined to characterization of isolates. Other
reports have suggested that the use of RT-PCR as a primary detection tool may improve the rate of ascertainment of influenza virus infections by 20 to 30%
[12,13,31,32], but this maneuver does not appear, in and
of itself, to have a major impact on point estimates of efficacy.
As suggested previously, a further factor that may compromise vaccine efficacy is the extent of antigenic drift
and the degree of match between vaccine and circulating
viruses [11,12,33]. In our study, the majority of cases in
both seasons were due to influenza A/H3N2 viruses, and
antigenic drift was modest and had little apparent impact.
However, only 5/17 cases of culture-confirmed influenza
B disease were due to viruses of the same lineage as the
vaccine strain in the relevant season (data not shown),
and average efficacy against non-matching B strains was
low (~16%); this result clearly reduced the estimate of
efficacy against all CCI.
The definition of influenza-like illness (ILI) in our study
required that illness impeded normal daily activities, with
cough plus ≥ 1 other symptom from a panel including
both respiratory and systemic complaints, so this allowed
for a diagnosis without need for a systemic symptom (i.e.
fever, myalgia/arthralgia). Cough has been previously
found to be one of the most sensitive clinical indicators of
influenza, but has little specificity, whereas fever is a classically-cited characteristic of influenza, with substantial
positive predictive value, but lower sensitivity [34]. Fever
was not made a requirement for ILI in our study in order
to maximize sensitivity. However, our ad hoc analyses
showed that narrowing of the case definition to require
fever reduced the case rate but notably improved the
apparent efficacy of TIV. A potential interpretation of
this finding may be that TIV is most effective against
severe manifestations of influenza, and less so against illnesses with predominantly respiratory symptoms.
Although efficacy against severe disease is desirable, the
relatively sensitive but non-specific case definition in our
study may have allowed for the inclusion of respiratory
illness caused by mixed infections in which influenza
viruses may have been minor or coincidental. An additional factor that could have compromised the results is
the highly decentralized source of the specimens, and the
transportation of specimens to a centralized laboratory
may not have been optimal for the recovery of influenza
viruses from nasopharyngeal swabs.
An unexpected finding of the study was the difference
between men and women for the primary endpoint: men,
89.0%; and women, 19.4%. Women were slightly older
than men (33.3 and 31.7 years, respectively), and were
more likely to have had previous recent influenza vaccination (21% and 16%, respectively). These between-gender differences were reflected in both treatment groups,
which were well matched for all baseline characteristics.
In addition, all three viruses were culture-confirmed in
men and women, there was no differential temporal clustering of cases, and serum HI titers did not differ meaningfully between the sexes (data not shown); this is in
contrast to a previous large study of a TIV, which
reported significantly higher GMT responses in women
than men, regardless of age or dose or influenza strain
[35]. The attack rate of VMCCI among placebo-treated
men and women was similar (1.27% and 1.14%, respectively), which suggests that both sexes had a similar level
of exposure. At present, the difference in values between
men and women remains unexplained and must be
viewed with caution because a further subdivision of the

already-small case numbers results in very broad CIs
about the efficacy estimates.
In terms of seroconversion and rates of attainment of
post-vaccinal HI reciprocal titers ≥ 40 ("seroprotection"
rates), the TIV in this study fulfilled the immunogenicity
criteria for the accelerated approval of seasonal influenza
vaccines established by the US FDA Center for Biologics
Evaluation and Research for all strains in both seasons
[36]. In addition, manufacturing consistency was confirmed for three consecutive TIV lots in the 2005-2006
season, based on GMT values. Vaccine immunogenicity
as measured by induction of hemagglutination-inhibiting
antibodies provides a marker of potential vaccine effectiveness in the absence of viral circulation and has therefore been, and continues to be, a useful tool for the
registration of influenza vaccines. Nevertheless, definitive demonstration of a single antibody titer which constitutes an absolute correlate of protection for all virus
strains remains elusive, and the current study was not
designed to demonstrate this.
The reactogenicity events reported in the study were
consistent with those commonly reported with TIVs.
Reactogenicity events that were significant in the TIV
versus placebo group included injection site pain, injection site redness and swelling, myalgias, arthralgias, fever
and fatigue; the majority of events were mild (grade 1) in
severity. There was a slightly higher incidence of spontaneous AEs in the TIV versus placebo group reported up
to 21 days post-vaccination, and this was primarily due to
the persistence of injection site pain and redness. Overall,
the results suggest that the safety profile of TIV was
acceptable, and consistent with the historical performance of similar products.
Conclusions
This randomized, placebo-controlled trial showed that
the average efficacy of TIV for the prevention of VMCCI
over the 2005-2006 and 2006-2007 influenza seasons was
46.3%. Although the differences between the vaccine and
placebo groups in the primary endpoint did not meet the
pre-defined criterion for success, the TIV clearly demonstrated clinical benefit (i.e. it was readily differentiated
from placebo by all culture and/or laboratory-confirmed
influenza endpoints) and the primary endpoint result
must be interpreted with some caution in view of the very
low influenza attack rates in both seasons; a factor which
has previously been associated with low efficacy estimates in influenza vaccine trials. Furthermore, the
immune responses to TIV fulfilled the licensure criteria
for seasonal influenza vaccines [36]. Overall, TIV had a
safety profile that was considered to be acceptable, and
was consistent with other inactivated influenza vaccines.
