Influenza epidemics are associated with an excess of mortality not only from respiratory diseases but also
from other causes, and cardiovascular mortality increases abruptly during influenza epidemics, with little
evidence of a lag period. In a population-based case-control study, the authors examined whether influenza
vaccination was associated with a reduced risk of out-of-hospital primary cardiac arrest (PCA), a major
contributor to cardiovascular mortality in the community. Cases of PCA (n = 342) without prior heart disease or
life-threatening comorbidity that occurred in King County, Washington, were identified from paramedic incident
reports from October 1988 to July 1994. Demographically similar controls (n = 549) were identified from the
community by using random digit dialing. Spouses of subjects were interviewed to assess treatment with
influenza vaccine during the previous year and other risk factors. After adjustment for demographic, clinical, and
behavioral risk factors, influenza vaccination was associated with a reduced risk of PCA (odds ratio = 0.51, 95
percent confidence interval: 0.33, 0.79). The authors suggest that while the association of influenza vaccination
with a reduced risk of PCA is consistent with cohort studies of influenza vaccination and total mortality, further
studies are needed to determine whether the observed association reflects protection or selection. Am J

Influenza epidemics are associated with excess morbidity
and mortality, not only from respiratory diseases but also
from other causes (1–4), and influenza vaccination is recommended to prevent these clinical outcomes (5). The contribution of influenza to clinical events, including clinical
cardiovascular diseases, frequently is not recognized (6, 7).
The number of deaths attributable to influenza but assigned
another cause far exceeds the number of deaths registered as
related to influenza (8). In a meta-analysis of 20 cohort studies among the elderly, the pooled estimate of influenza vaccine efficacy for preventing death was 68 percent (95 percent confidence interval (CI): 56 percent, 76 percent) (9).
Previous studies did not examined whether influenza vaccination is associated with reduced cardiovascular mortality.
Because cardiovascular mortality increases abruptly during
influenza epidemics, with little evidence of a lag period, we
analyzed data from a population-based case-control study to
determine whether influenza vaccination during the previous year was associated with a reduced risk of primary cardiac arrest (PCA), a major contributor to cardiovascular
mortality in the community.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study setting
Details of the study design and data collection are presented elsewhere (10). Briefly, from paramedic incident
reports, cases of out-of-hospital PCA attended by paramedics
in King County, Washington, from October 1988 to July 1994
were identified. PCA cases were defined by the occurrence of
a sudden pulseless condition and the absence of evidence of a
noncardiac condition as the cause of cardiac arrest (11). In
addition to emergency service incidence reports, we reviewed
death certificates, medical examiner reports, and autopsy
reports, when available, to confirm the absence of evidence of
a noncardiac condition, such as pneumonia, asthma, or respiratory failure, as the cause of cardiac arrest. As expected,
medical examiner reports with or without autopsy reports
were available for only 23 percent of the cases.
Selection of cases and controls
We excluded PCA cases if they had had prior clinically
recognized heart disease, such as angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, coronary bypass surgery and graft, angioDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/aje/article-abstract/152/7/674/75235 by guest on 15 October 2019

plasty, congestive heart failure, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy, congenital or valvular disease, or life-threatening
comorbidities, such as cancer or end-stage lung, liver, or
renal disease. Since we relied on information from surrogate
respondents to assess previous exposures, we further
restricted the PCA cases to patients who were married and
were aged 25–74 years. The spouses of 360 (86 percent) of
the 418 eligible cases agreed to participate in an in-person
interview. The mean age of the cases was 59 years, 80 percent were male, 94 percent were White, and 61 percent had
at least a high school education.
For each PCA case, one to two controls, matched for age
(within 7 years) and sex, were selected from the community
by using random digit dialing (12). Potential controls who
had had previous clinically recognized heart disease or lifethreatening comorbidity or who were not married were
excluded from the study. The spouses of 576 (71 percent) of
the 816 eligible controls identified by random digit dialing
participated in the in-person interview.
Data collection
Data on the subjects’ vaccination status were collected
from both case and control spouses by using a standardized
questionnaire. For each subject, information was collected
on whether the subject had received an influenza vaccination during the previous 12 months and, if so, when the vaccination had been given. We did not collect information on
whether the subject had received influenza vaccination during the years prior to that period.
The interview also covered other risk factors for PCA,
including age, sex, race, weight, and height; physiciandiagnosed diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia; cigarette smoking; physical activity; alcohol and
caffeine consumption; dietary intake of saturated fat and n3 fatty acids from seafood; family history of myocardial
infarction or sudden death in a first-degree relative; education; employment; and general health status (10).
To assess the reliability of spouse reports, we interviewed
56 survivors of PCA and their spouses and 531 controls and
their spouses independently (13). There was excellent agreement between the influenza vaccination reports of spouses
and those obtained from subjects themselves (for cases,
kappa  1.0, 95 percent CI: 1.0, 1.0; and for controls,
kappa  0.88, 95 percent CI: 0.85, 0.93). The agreement for
other risk factors was good to excellent (13).
Statistical analysis
We used conditional logistic regression to assess the
association of influenza vaccination during the previous
year with the risk of PCA after adjustment for potential confounding factors. We also explored whether the association
varied according to the presence of other risk factors.
Eighteen cases and 32 controls were excluded from the
analyses due to missing data on influenza vaccination status.
The effect of missing data on covariates was examined
through the approach of multiple imputation (14), and the
missing data had little effect on the findings.
RESULTS
Controls who were vaccinated were older; were more
likely to have had hypertension, diabetes, and a family history of myocardial infarction or sudden death; and were
more likely to be a former smoker, but were less likely to be
male and currently employed than were controls who were
not vaccinated (table 1). Vaccinated controls also expended
more kilocalories in physical activity, weighed less, and
consumed less caffeine than did unvaccinated controls. On
the other hand, the prevalences of current smoking, good-toexcellent reported health status, and higher educational
attainment (for both controls and their spouses) and the
amount of alcohol consumed were similar among vaccinated and unvaccinated controls.
The prevalence of influenza vaccination during the previous year was lower among the cases of PCA than among the
controls (23 vs. 32 percent, respectively) (table 2). After
adjustment for the matching variables (age and gender) and
current smoking, former smoking, hypertension, diabetes,
weight, height, family history, educational attainment,
employment status, habitual physical activity, fat intake, and
general health status, influenza vaccination during the previous year was associated with a reduced risk of primary
cardiac arrest (odds ratio  0.51, 95 percent CI: 0.33, 0.79).
Further adjustment for alcohol and caffeine consumption, n3 polyunsaturated fatty acid intake, and race altered the findings only slightly.
There was little evidence that the association between
influenza vaccination and the risk of PCA varied among

subjects with other risk factors, including older age, male
gender, cigarette smoking, hypertension, diabetes, low educational attainment, unemployed status, and fair or poor
health status (data not shown), although the statistical power
to assess potential interactions between vaccination and
other risk factors was limited.
DISCUSSION
Several limitations need to be considered when interpreting
these findings. Treatment with influenza vaccination during
the previous year was assessed through spouse reports, and
medical records were not available to validate these reports.
However, the reliability of spouse reports was excellent for
both cases and controls. Additionally, we did not assess
influenza vaccination in previous years, and, therefore, we
could not assess the impact of previous vaccinations.
We sought to minimize potential confounding in both the
design and the analysis of the study data, but it remains possible that uncontrolled confounding accounted for our findings. For example, if influenza vaccination was associated
with unmeasured differences in health care or health behaviors that reduce the risk of PCA, these differences might
account for our findings. Nevertheless, given the available
information on potential confounders and the magnitude of
the observed effect, we suggest that it is unlikely that uncontrolled confounding accounted for the finding.
The focus of our study was on persons who experienced
PCA as their incident clinical cardiac event, in part to minimize potential confounding from previous heart disease. For
this reason, we restricted our study population to persons
without previous clinically recognized heart disease and
life-threatening comorbidity. On the other hand, persons at
risk for incident clinical coronary heart disease because of
older age, diabetes mellitus, and other risk factors were
included in the study population. For these reasons, our
findings do not address whether influenza vaccination is
associated with a reduced risk of PCA among patients with
clinically recognized heart disease or major comorbidity.
To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the
association of previous influenza vaccination with the risk
of primary cardiac arrest. However, the magnitude of the
risk reduction observed herein is consistent with a metaanalysis of studies that examined the effect of influenza vaccination on total mortality (9). Additionally, a populationbased study demonstrated an association between recent
acute respiratory tract infection and the risk of acute
myocardial infarction (15).
Finally, there are plausible mechanisms related to both the
respiratory and systemic effects of influenza for a possible
association (16). For example, influenza impairs pulmonary
function and, thus, may reduce myocardial oxygen supply,
and it also results in systemic effects, such as fever and tachycardia, that increase myocardial oxygen demand (17).
Additionally, influenza may influence risk through the
inflammatory response to the infection, either systemically
through an effect on inflammatory markers or locally through
changes in the heart, such as subclinical myocarditis (18).
For now, additional epidemiologic studies, particularly
among older populations and other persons at risk for PCA,
are needed to explore further whether the observed association of influenza vaccination with a reduced risk of PCA
reflects selection or protection. If confirmed in other studies
and other populations, the association is likely to have
important implications for clinical care and public health,
given the magnitude of the effect and the contribution of
PCA to coronary heart disease mortality, particularly among
high-risk populations.
