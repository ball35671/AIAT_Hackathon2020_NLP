The clinical effects, nasal and serum antibody responses, and virus excretion of a
live attenuated serum inhibitor-resistant influenza B virus vaccine, R75, was evaluated
in 43 seronegative healthy adults by a random double-blind study. Symptom responses were minimal and were not significantly different between vaccine and
placebo groups. No fevers, abnormalities in physical examination or laboratory testing
developed during 4 weeks of observation.
Among vaccinees, 10 (48%) developed serum hemagglutination-inhibition (HI)
antibodies, 16 (76%) developed serum neutralization (N) antibodies and 4( 19%)
developed nasal N antibodies, The GMT responses from study day 0 to day 28 were
4.0 to 10.4 for serum HI, 1.8 to 9.8 for serum N, and 1.0 to 1.4 for nasal N. There
were no significant titer changes in the placebo group. No virus excretion was
detected.

INTRODUCTION
Influenza vaccine development continues to be an area of active investigation. Because of the advances of virology and the demonstrated advantages of live attenuated virus
vaccines against other virus illness, interest in live attenuated virus vaccines persists. In
theory, live attenuated influenza vaccines would seem advantageous because they infect
the host at a subclinical level inducing both humoral and cell-mediated immune mechanisms. The attenuated virus infection mimics the virulent infection and results in the

Although the role of local secretory antibody is not completely understood, there is considerable opinion that it may be an important part of the defense mechanisms for
protection against influenza (9).
increasing concentrations of serum inhibitors (2). Recherche et Industrie Therapeutiques
(RIT) developed a live attenuated influenza A serum inhibitor-resistant virus vaccine,
Alice strain, which was safe and immunogenic (6,7,13, 10). It has demonstrated protective efficacy in 2 challenge studies (1 1, 16), and it significantly reduced influenza-like
illness in children under observation during a natural influenza outbreak (4). Alice vaccine
was also shown in an open field trial among University students to significantly reduce
the clinical influenza attack rate. (G. R. Noble et al., abstract 11 1, 15th Interscience
Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, Washington, D. C., 1975). This
product is currently licensed in Europe. A candidate serum inhibitor-resistant influenza B
vaccine virus was then developed by RIT. This vaccine was evaluated at the University of
Maryland for safety, immunogenicity, and virus excretion.
Influenza virus attenuation can be accomplished by serial passage in the presence of
METHODS AND MATERIALS
Healthy adults were recruited into the study. After serologic screening for hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) antibodies against influenza B, seronegatives, those with HI
titers < 1 :8, were selected. The nature of the study and the potential health hazards were
explained and then informed consent was obtained. Prior to vaccination each volunteer
had a medical history review, physical examination, and screening laboratory test profile.
The laboratory profile consisted of a complete blood count, urinalysis, and blood chemistry
analysis of serum bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, sugar, urea nitrogen, creatinine, and
SGOT .
Vaccine
5/72 with the inhibitor-resistant strain of B/Russia/69. The antigenic characteristics of
the vaccine are B/Hong Kong/5/72; the vaccine lot is the 15th passage in specific pathogenfree eggs (14). Virologic testing showed the vaccine virus to be inhibitor-resistant, thermostable, and it possessed the allantois-on-shell (AOS) marker (12), a marker associated
with inhibitor resistance. Safety tests showed the vaccine to be free of adventitious virus,
mycoplasma, bacteria, and fungi (14). The vaccine was provided in single dose vials in the
lyophilized state to be reconstituted with 5% sucrose and administered intranasally, 5
drops per nostril, a total dose of 0.5 ml contained 1 07.' EIDSo of R75 as determined by
Smith, Nine, and French Laboratories.
Immediately prior to vaccination serum for influenza B HI and neutralization (N)
antibodies, and 20 ml nasal washmgs for N antibodies were obtained. By random doubleblind allocation, volunteers received either 2 doses of vaccine or 2 doses of 5% sucrose as
placebo 2 weeks apart. During the 5 consecutive days following each vaccination, volunteers were interviewed with regard to rhinitis, cough, pharyngitis, headache, malaise,
arthralgia, and myalgia. Symptoms were scored 0, 1,2, or 3 corresponding to absent, mild,
moderate, and severe, respectively. Oral temperatures were taken at the time of each
interview. Nasal swabs for virus isolation were taken for 3 consecutive days following
each vaccination, and blood and nasal washes for antibody studies were taken on day 14

Control, Atlanta, Georgia. Sera were treated overnight with receptor-destroying enzyme
(Vibrio cholerae) to remove nonspecific inhibitors. Four hemagglutinin units of B/Hong
Kong/5/72 (BX-l), seed virus supplied by CDC, were used in the test. HI tests were carried out by a standard microtitration method. The same seed virus was passed in our laboratory in rhesus monkey kidney cell culture and a dose of 100 TCIDS0 was used for
serum N antibody titration. The reaction mixture consisting of an equal volume of virus
fluid and serum was incubated at room temperature for 40 min before it was added to
tube monolayer cultures of rhesus monkey kidney cells. Inoculated cultures were incubated at 37°C for 2 hr; the medium of each tube was discharged and replaced wirh
fresh maintenance medium. Cultures were then incubated at 34°C in a stationary position
for 3 days. Results were read by the hemadsorption technique with guinea pig erythrocytes. N antibody titer of serum specimens without homologous antibody was designated
as <I :2. The maintenance medium for rhesus monkey kidney cell cultures consisted of
basal medium Eagle with Earl's balanced salt solution, penicillin (200 units/ml) and
streptomycin (200 pg/ml). For the calculation of the geometric mean titers (GMT), HI
titers <1:8 were assigned a value of 4, and N titers <1:2 were assigned a value of 1. The
method for the titration of nasal antibody has been described previously (I 5). In brief,
nasal washing samples were concentrated 10 times and neutralizing antibody titers were
determined against approximately 32 TCIDSO of B/Hong Kong/5/72 by standard hemadsorption-inhibition techniques in rhesus monkey cell monolayer cultures. IgA concentrations of these samples were determined in agar plates by the radial diffusion technique.
N antibody titers were expressed as the titers of 10 mg/100 ml of IgA immunoglobulin.
Virus isolation attempts were made in embryonated hen's eggs with nasal mucous fluids.
Nasal mucous was collected with a cotton swab which was then dipped in the medium
(basal medium Eagle with Hanks' balanced salt solution, gentamycin 50 pg/ml, penicillin
200 units/ml, and streptomycin 200 pglml). The medium containing the nasal mucous
was inoculated in a volume of 0.25 ml into each of 2 10-day-old hen's eggs via the
amniotic route. Eggs were incubated at 35°C for 48 hr and then harvested. Amniotic and
allantoic fluid mixtures were checked for hemagglutinating agents using a 0.5% suspension of rooster erythrocytes. Negative fluids were passed twice in hen's eggs (1 3).
The HI tests were performed by the method recommended by the Center for Disease
RESULTS
A total of 43 seronegative adults (HI titer < 1 :8) participated in the study. Vaccine
was given to 21, ranging in age from 22 to 50, mean 32.5. There were 15 ,males and 6
females, all Caucasian. Placebo was given to 22, ranging in age from 22 to&l, mean 27.0.
There were 11 males and 1 1 females, 3 black and 19 Caucasian. These minor differences
in demographic variables were not statistically significant.
There were no significant differences between v2c"cin.e and placebo recipients in
regards to clinical side effects during the study. Immediately following the nasal drops,
26% of vaccinees and 18% of placebo recipients had complaints. These were typically bad
taste or burning and lasted only a few moments (Table I). During the 5 days of surveillance
following dose 1,43% of vaccinees and 64% of the placebo group experienced 1 or more

5.1 in the placebo group (Table 11). These differences were not statistically significant.
The majority of symptoms were mild, short in duration, and consisted primarily of headache and rhinorrhea. No temperature elevations were recorded during the entire study.
Of the 21 vaccinees, 10 (47.6%) seroconverted by HI testing. Five had HI titer increases to 1 : 16,3 to 1 : 32, and 2 1 : 64. Serum N antibodies developed in 16,76.2%, but
only 4 (19%) developed nasal N antibodies (Table 111). The geometric mean titer for HI
antibodies among vaccinees rose from 4.0 on day 0 to 10.4 on day 28. The GMT for serum
N antibodies rose from 1.8 to 9.8 and the GMT for nasal N antibodies rose from 1 .O to
1.4 (Table IV). Evaluation of the symptoms indices (proportion reporting symptoms and
mean symptoms score) among vaccine recipients revealed no significant difference between
those demonstrating serum HI or N antibody response and those without antibody responses (Table v). Placebo recipients demonstrated no significant antibody responses
(Tables 111, IV).
No influenza virus was detected during the study. At the conclusion of the study,
no significant changes were noted in history, physical examinations, and laboratory profiles.
The mean symptom score for both doses combined was 7.3 in the vaccine group and

DISCUSSION
R75, a serum inhibitor-resistant live attenuated influenza B virus vaccine, was shown
to be safe. No fevers, significant morbidity, or virus excretion were seen among vaccine
recipients. Although 2 out of 3 of vaccinees complained of 1 or more symptoms during
the course of the study, a similar proportion of placebo recipients registered complaints.
This somewhat high symptom rate could not be attributed to vaccine virus but rather
some factor or combination of factors common to both groups. We believe that the
reported symptom rates are related to both irritation of mucous membranes from nasal
instillation, and increased awareness of minor symptoms by virtue of being part of a study
with active surveillance of cold symptoms. Additional evidence for attenuation of the
virus is the fact that the specific symptoms were generally very mild, short in duration, and
similar in character among the 2 groups. Furthermore, a comparison of symptom indices
between vaccinees with evidence of seroconversion and vaccinees without titer change
showed no significant differences. This indicates that infection with vaccine virus is not
associated with symptom development.
These early reports showed HI seroconversion in 7 of 10 antibody negative volunteers and
a 4-fold increase in nasal N antibody in 3 of 4 (14). HI antibody developed in less than
half of the HI negative vaccine recipients in this study, and nasal antibody developed in
only 4 of 21. Although serum N antibody responses occurred in 76%, the GMT was only
9.8 by day 28. Previous studies of serum inhibitor-resistant influenza A vaccine, Alice
strain, reported greater antibody responses in both seronegative and low titer volunteers
than the responses to B vaccine in seronegative subjects in this study (4,6,7, 10, 11,13,
16).
investigators have reported studies showing little correlation between antibody levels and
protection. Beare et al. (1) compared a live attenuated influenza B vaccine to a killed
parenteral B vaccine and showed better protection among live vaccine recipients even
though they had fewer and lower antibody responses. Freestone et al. (3) have reported
equivalent protection between live and inactivated influenza vaccine, despite much higher
antibody responses in the inactivated vaccine group. In an evaluation of HI antibody levels
and protection to live influenza virus challenge, Hobson et al. (5) found that an HI titer
of approximately 1 : 18 was associated with 50% protection. However, they also reported
a poor correlation of infection rates with antibody levels at very low and undetectable
levels. They suggest that protective factors other than HI antibody may be important but
that HI antibody still is a good indirect indicator of protection.
the antibody levels induced by R75 still appear inadequate. They were considerably less
than the relatively low levels induced by other attenuated influenza B vaccines found to
be protective by Beare et al. and Freeston et al. (1, 3). The GMT for influenza B HI antibody induced by R75 was only 10.4, considerably less than the 1 : 18 titer Hobson et al.
found to be 50% protective (5). These comparisons indicate that R75 was not sufficiently
immunogenic at the dosage used. Additional studies, possibly at higher doses, might prove
of value. However, definitive evidence for efficacy or lack of efficacy will require challenge
studies and epidemiological studies of the occurence of influenza in vaccinated and unvaccinated groups.
Antibody responses to R75 were lower than those reported in preliminary studies.
Although antibody levels have been an integral part of vaccine evaluations, several
