Background. Influenza infection during pregnancy is associated with adverse fetal outcomes such as preterm
birth and small for gestational age (SGA). Maternal influenza immunization may prevent these adverse infant
outcomes during periods of influenza circulation.
Methods. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of live births within Kaiser Permanente (KP) Georgia and
Mid-Atlantic States (n = 3327) during the period of 2009 influenza A (H1N1) virus circulation. Primary outcomes
were third-trimester preterm birth (27–36 weeks), birth weight, low birth weight (LBW, <2500 g), and SGA.
Results. There were 327 (9.8%) preterm, 236 (7.4%) LBW, and 267 (8.4%) SGA births. Among H1N1-vaccinated
mothers (n = 1125), there were 86 (7.6%) preterm, 68 (6.4%) LBW, and 99 (9.3%) SGA births, and the mean birth
weight was 3308.5 g (95% confidence interval [CI], 3276.6–3340.4). Among unvaccinated mothers (n = 1581), there
were 191 (12.1%) preterm, 132 (8.8%) LBW, and 123 (8.2%) SGA births, and the mean birth weight was 3245.3 g
(95% CI, 3216.5–3274.2). Infants of H1N1-vaccinated mothers had 37% lower odds of being born preterm than
infants of unvaccinated mothers (adjusted odds ratio, 0.63 [95% CI, .47–.84]). The mean birth weight difference
between infants of H1N1-vaccinated mothers and infants of unvaccinated mothers was 45.1 g (95% CI, 1.8–88.3).
There was no significant association between maternal H1N1 influenza immunization and LBW or SGA.
Conclusions. Pregnant women who received H1N1 influenza vaccine were less likely to give birth preterm, and
gave birth to heavier infants. The findings support US vaccine policy choices to prioritize pregnant women during
the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic.

Influenza infection results in higher morbidity in pregnant women compared to nonpregnant women of
similar age [1–3]. Influenza infection during pregnancy
is associated with adverse fetal outcomes such as
preterm birth and small for gestational age (SGA)
birth [4–9]. During the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic, pregnant women in the United States experienced higher influenza-associated morbidity and
mortality relative to the general population [10–13].
A recent population-based study in Ontario, Canada,
reported that antenatal H1N1 influenza vaccination
during the 2009 pandemic prevented SGA birth, preterm birth at <32 weeks, and fetal death among
infants [14]. Furthermore, maternal influenza immunization may prevent adverse infant outcomes among
births during periods of seasonal influenza circulation
[15–17]. In a randomized controlled trial in Bangladesh,

maternal influenza immunization was associated with higher
mean birth weight and reduced risk of being born SGA [16, 17].
In a population-based study in the state of Georgia, women
vaccinated against seasonal influenza gave birth to heavier
infants and were less likely to have a preterm birth. Additionally, during periods of widespread influenza activity, vaccinated women were less likely to have infants born SGA [15].
This is the first study of the association of maternal influenza immunization and adverse infant outcomes during the
2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic in the United States. Our
study assessed associations between maternal H1N1 influenza
immunization and third-trimester preterm birth, low birth
weight (LBW), and SGA within a managed care organization
population.
METHODS
We conducted a retrospective cohort study based on electronic
medical records (EMRs) from Kaiser Permanente (KP)
managed care organization sites in Georgia and Mid-Atlantic
States (including Maryland, Virginia, and the District of Columbia). The study cohort has been described elsewhere [18, 19].
We identified all live births during the study period in KP
Georgia and Mid-Atlantic States, to mothers who were continuously enrolled in KP for their entire pregnancies (with permitted enrollment gaps of up to 45 days). Then, we restricted
to live births to mothers who started their third trimester of
pregnancy on or after the start of the study period, including
only mothers who had the opportunity for third-trimester exposure to 2009 influenza A (H1N1) virus and who were not
diagnosed with 2009 influenza A (H1N1) influenza prior to
receiving H1N1 vaccine. We restricted our study population in
this way to evaluate the impact of influenza exposure proximate to birth on infant outcomes. Earlier preterm births (eg,
second-trimester preterm births) may have different causative
factors than those occurring during the third trimester (eg,
fetal chromosomal abnormalities, fetal and maternal anatomic
factors) [20, 21]. For vaccine effectiveness (VE) calculations,
we included 40 mothers who were excluded from the primary
analyses because they were diagnosed with 2009 influenza A
(H1N1) prior to receiving H1N1 vaccine.
The study period was defined by the timing of 2009 influenza A (H1N1) virus circulation: from the collection date in
each region of the first positive laboratory test for 2009 influenza A (H1N1), up to the first week when the percentage of
influenza specimens that tested positive for 2009 influenza A
(H1N1) was <5%, using data previously obtained from the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [18]. The
eligible study period was 26 April 2009 to 17 April 2010 (including births before and after the start of availability of 2009
H1N1 influenza vaccine).
The primary exposure was receipt of 2009 H1N1 influenza
vaccine during any trimester of pregnancy. We used KP EMRs
to identify influenza vaccines administered to mothers in our
cohort during pregnancy. We identified the type of influenza
vaccine administered (ie, 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccine, seasonal trivalent inactivated vaccine [TIV]) based on HL7 code
and administration date. For the main analyses, we defined
pregnancy as between last menstrual period (LMP) and
infant’s birth date. We performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate the impact of defining vaccination during pregnancy as
between LMP and 7 or 14 days prior to infant’s birth date
(Supplementary Data 1). In the main analyses, we compared 2
vaccine exposure groups: (1) 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccine
with or without 2009–2010 seasonal TIV (H1N1 vaccine) and
(2) no influenza vaccine (no vaccine). The no vaccine group
was used as the reference group. We performed sensitivity
analyses comparing subjects who received H1N1 vaccine to
subjects who did not receive H1N1 vaccine (but who may
have received 2009–2010 seasonal TIV during the study
period; Supplementary Data 2).
Primary outcomes were preterm birth during the third trimester of pregnancy (27–36 weeks gestation), LBW (<2500 g),
and SGA. Using national birth weight percentiles defined by
gestational age and gender by Oken et al, we defined SGA as
birth weight <10th percentile for gestational age and sex [22].
There are several methods for adjusting for confounding in
nonrandomized observational studies of influenza VE, primarily to account for differences between vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals (eg, healthy vaccinee bias) [23, 24]. We
evaluated the use of a difference-in-differences approach and
the approach used by Nelson et al, but concluded that we
could use neither approach because there was no valid preinfluenza comparison period, given the timing of virus circulation and vaccine availability [25, 26]. In our primary analyses,
we adjusted for a priori covariates of interest: maternal age,
asthma, gestational diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hypertension during pregnancy, multiple birth, any pregnancy/birth
complication, and KP site. In sensitivity analyses, we used a
propensity score approach to efficiently control for the same
set of covariates (which may have influenced influenza vaccination status) in order to obtain an unbiased estimate of the
effect of exposure [27]. We used propensity score regression
and matching methods to assess the impact on results of using
these approaches for addressing confounding instead of adjusting for individual covariates (Supplementary Data 3).
We identified covariate data using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) diagnosis code data
from KP EMRs. Data on maternal underlying conditions (eg,
asthma, cardiovascular disease), pregnancy and birth complications, and demographics were identified by ICD-9 diagnosis
codes from 90 days prior to 90 days after LMP. Gestational

diabetes was identified by ICD-9 diagnosis codes between
LMP and birth. We were unable to control for confounding by
mother’s race, maternal smoking, and alcohol use during pregnancy due to missing or poor quality data; however, we performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate the potential effect of
these confounders using available data (Supplementary Data 4
and 5). Use of antiviral medications (eg, amantadine, oseltamivir, zanamivir) was identified from outpatient dispensing
records using KP electronic pharmacy files, as previously described [18]. Diagnosed influenza A (H1N1) infection was
defined as having a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction test positive for influenza, or having a medical visit during
pregnancy with influenza-related ICD-9 diagnosis code during
the period of 2009 influenza A (H1N1) virus circulation [18].
We used logistic regression to evaluate the association of
maternal influenza vaccine and each of the primary outcomes.
We performed a subanalysis using polytomous logistic regression to model early (27–33 weeks) and late preterm birth
(34–36 weeks). We used linear regression to evaluate the differences in mean birth weight among births by exposure
group. We did not stratify our analyses by trimester of vaccination due to limited study power.
We used the following equation to calculate the adjusted
number needed to be vaccinated (aNNV) to prevent 1
preterm birth:
aNNV ¼  1
ðOR  1Þ  UER þ
OR
ðOR  1Þð1  UERÞ
 ;
where UER = event rate in the unexposed [28]. We used the
following expression to calculate the population prevented
fraction of preterm birth:
pcð1  ORÞ
pcð1  ORÞ þ OR ;
where pc = proportion of cases vaccinated [29]. For these calculations, we used the adjusted odds ratio (AOR) for the association of maternal H1N1 vaccination with preterm birth. We
calculated VE against 2009 influenza A (H1N1) infection with
the equation [VE = 1 – AOR], where the OR is computed as
the association between H1N1 immunization and H1N1 influenza infection adjusted for a priori covariates.
Based on an expected sample of 3000 and vaccine coverage
of 30%–50%, our sample size had ≥80% or higher power to
detect ORs <0.66 for associations of antenatal influenza immunization and birth outcomes. We used SAS software,
version 9.2 (Cary, North Carolina) for all statistical analyses.
Results were considered significant at α = .05 using 2-tailed
tests. The study was reviewed and approved by the KP institutional review boards in both Georgia and Mid-Atlantic States.
RESULTS
There were a total of 4555 eligible births to 4446 mothers in KP
Georgia and Mid-Atlantic States during the period of 2009 influenza A (H1N1) circulation. Of these, we excluded 27 secondtrimester births, 1160 births to mothers who were already in
their third trimester of pregnancy at the start of 2009 influenza
A (H1N1) circulation, 1 birth to a mother who was exposed to
≤14 days of 2009 influenza A (H1N1) influenza circulation at
the start of the study period, and 40 births to mothers who
were diagnosed with 2009 influenza A (H1N1) before receiving
2009 H1N1 influenza vaccine. Therefore, our study population
included a total of 3327 third-trimester live births to 3236
mothers between 25 May 2009 and 17 April 2010 (Figure 1).
The H1N1 vaccine group included 1125 (33.8%) infants
and the no vaccine group included 1581 (47.5%) infants
(Figure 2). Additionally, 621 (18.7%) of infants were born to
mothers who received only 2009–2010 seasonal TIV. Overall
H1N1 influenza vaccine coverage in our cohort was 33.8%
(1125/3327), and 2009–2010 seasonal TIV coverage was 41.5%
(1380/3327). Among births on or after 1 October 2009 (the
approximate start date of 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccine availability), H1N1 vaccine coverage was 50.1% (1125/2247), and
2009–2010 seasonal TIV coverage was 58.0% (1304/2247).
The odds of having received 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccine
were lower for mothers who had pregnancy/birth complications (P < .01) and mothers who gave birth within KP Georgia
(P < .01) (Table 1). VE of 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccine
against diagnosed 2009 influenza A (H1N1) infection during
the study period among all mothers in our study cohort was
61.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 15.5%–82.5%).
There were a total of 327 (9.8%) preterm births, including
85 (2.5%) at 27–33 weeks and 242 (7.3%) at 34–36 weeks.
After adjustment for a priori covariates, infants whose
mothers received H1N1 vaccine had 37% lower odds of being
born preterm than infants in the no vaccine group (AOR, 0.63
[95% CI, .47–.84]; Table 2). Infants whose mothers received
H1N1 vaccine had 47% lower odds of 27–33 weeks preterm
birth compared to infants in the no vaccine group (AOR, 0.53
[95% CI, .30–.95]), and 34% lower odds of 34–36 weeks
preterm birth (AOR, 0.66 [95% CI .48–.92]). Unadjusted and
propensity score adjusted analyses gave similar results (Supplementary Data 3). The adjusted number needed to vaccinate
with H1N1 vaccine was 24 (95% CI, 17–58) to prevent 1
preterm birth. The population-prevented fraction, or fraction
of preterm birth cases that could be prevented if the population were vaccinated against H1N1, of preterm birth by H1N1
vaccine was 15.4%.
In the primary adjusted model, infants whose mothers received H1N1 vaccine were 45.1 g (95% CI, 1.8–88.3 g) heavier
than infants in the no vaccine group (Table 2). The mean

birth weight among infants whose mothers received H1N1
vaccine was 3308.5 g (95% CI, 3276.6–3340.4 g) vs 3245.3 g
(95% CI, 3216.5–3274.2 g) among infants in the no vaccine
group. There was no significant association between maternal
receipt of 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccine and being born LBW
during the period of 2009 H1N1 influenza circulation (AOR,
0.79 [95% CI, .56–1.10]; Table 2). Propensity score adjusted
analyses gave similar results (Supplementary Data 3); however,
the unadjusted OR was within 10% of the primary AOR but
was statistically significant. There was also no significant
association between maternal receipt of 2009 H1N1 influenza
vaccine and being born SGA during the period of 2009 H1N1
influenza circulation (AOR, 1.26 [95% CI, .94–1.69]; Table 2).
Unadjusted and propensity score adjusted analyses gave
similar results (Supplementary Data 3).
We performed a series of sensitivity analyses to assess our
primary results, and found similar results in each analysis. We
restricted our definition of vaccine exposure to between estimated LMP and 7 or 14 days prior to infant’s birth date (Supplementary Data 1). We evaluated the impact of defining the

(including mothers who only received 2009–2010 seasonal
TIV; Supplement 2). We assessed the potential impact of
confounding by maternal race within a subcohort of births for
which race data were available, and by maternal smoking and
alcohol use during pregnancy, and found no significant
change in point estimates (Supplementary Data 4 and 5).
DISCUSSION
During the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic, maternal
H1N1 influenza immunization was associated with reduced
odds of third-trimester preterm birth. Also, infants of mothers
who received 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccine weighed more at
birth, on average, than infants born to unvaccinated mothers.
Our VE finding of 61.5% is similar to reports from other
studies showing high effectiveness of 2009 H1N1 influenza
vaccine against 2009 influenza A (H1N1) infection during the
pandemic (ie, 62%–84%) [30–33].
Our findings should be put into the context of recent findings describing the association between 2009 influenza A
(H1N1) infection and risk of adverse infant outcomes. Several
studies have shown higher risk among pregnant women infected with 2009 influenza A (H1N1) of having infants born
preterm, at lower birth weight, or SGA [6, 8, 9]. However,
recent findings in our study population showed no significant
effect of 2009 influenza A (H1N1) infection on these birth
outcomes [18], which may have been due to high use of antiviral medications within this population. Among H1N1-
infected pregnant women who experienced adverse outcomes,
the risk of infection and severe outcomes (eg, hospitalization,
admission to intensive care, death) was higher during the
second and third trimesters [7]. Our analysis of third-trimester
preterm birth suggests that influenza viral infection is part
of a biological pathway leading to preterm birth, putatively

through infection-associated inflammation at the maternalfetal interface [34]. Our analysis of a known vaccine effect in
prevention of influenza infection is a tool for understanding
the effect of influenza virus infection in pregnancy, but further
studies are needed to determine the mechanism of influenza
infection in birth outcomes.
Our findings that mothers vaccinated against 2009 influenza
A (H1N1) had lower odds of preterm birth and gave birth to
heavier infants are in line with recent findings in a Canadian
population describing the preventive effect of maternal H1N1
influenza immunization during pregnancy against adverse
infant outcomes. In Ontario, Canada, infants born to vaccinated mothers from November 2009 to April 2010 had lower risk
of SGA birth, very preterm birth (<32 weeks), and fetal death.
There was no significant effect of maternal H1N1 influenza
immunization on preterm birth (<37 weeks). In our study, we
found a significant reduction in the odds of preterm birth
(<37 weeks) among mothers who received 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccine, consistent with a similar recent finding during
seasonal influenza epidemics in the state of Georgia [15]. Also,
we found no association between maternal H1N1 influenza
immunization and infants being SGA, in contrast with findings in Ontario of reduced risk of SGA birth among infants of
H1N1-vaccinated mothers. It has also been reported that maternal seasonal influenza immunization was protective against
SGA birth during periods of widespread influenza activity
[15]. Potential explanations for these differences in observations between our study and the Ontario study may include:
different H1N1 vaccine products used in the United States
and Canada; absolute risk of adverse outcomes (eg, 12.1%
preterm birth prevalence among unvaccinated mothers in our
study vs 6.4% in the Ontario study); study period (ie, our
study period extended for the duration of 2009 influenza A
[H1N1] virus circulation, whereas the Ontario study was conducted only during the period of vaccine availability, postOctober 2009); and restriction to third-trimester live births.
We additionally found that infants of mothers vaccinated
against 2009 influenza A (H1N1) weighed more than infants
of unvaccinated mothers. This finding is supported by results
from earlier studies in Bangladesh, the United States, and
Canada showing that maternal influenza immunization is associated with increased birth weight, and maternal influenza
infection is associated with decreased birth weight [15–17].
Although we found no significant association between maternal influenza immunization and being born LBW, the statistically significant difference in mean birth weight between
vaccinated and unvaccinated mothers is important biologically
and for informing immunization policy prioritizing pregnant
women.
Our study has several strengths and limitations. We used
vaccine records directly from mothers’ KP EMRs, and
therefore did not rely on maternal self-report of vaccination
status. Mothers may have been misclassified if vaccinated at
alternative locations (eg, pharmacies, workplaces), but we
believe it likely that any exposure misclassification was nondifferential. Recent CDC data on 2009–2010 influenza season
vaccine uptake among pregnant women showed that they
were significantly more likely to be vaccinated at the recommendation of their medical provider. Further, vaccine coverage
in our study population was higher than 2009–2010 state
vaccine coverage estimates for Georgia and Maryland [35].
Moreover, underestimation of coverage was likely to result in
conservative OR estimates due to nondifferential misclassification of vaccine exposure.
We conducted sensitivity analyses to evaluate the effect of defining vaccination during pregnancy as between LMP and
infant’s date of birth. Our reported findings are more conservative than we would have obtained if this assumption had not
been made. Additionally, we were unable to control for important potential confounders related to risk of preterm birth, such
as previous preterm birth, medically indicated vs spontaneous
preterm birth, and mother’s race. In sensitivity analyses, we assessed the potential impact of confounding by maternal race,
smoking, and alcohol use during pregnancy. We found qualitatively similar results, demonstrating robustness of our primary
results without controlling for these potential confounders.
Our findings demonstrate the importance of vaccinating
pregnant women during influenza pandemics. In this study,
mothers who received 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccine were less
likely to give birth preterm, and gave birth to heavier infants.
Notably, our data suggest that every 24 maternal H1N1 influenza immunizations prevented 1 preterm birth—a figure that has
important implications for cost-effectiveness estimates of maternal influenza immunization during pandemics, given the substantial medical and societal costs of preterm birth. This study
not only reinforces previous findings about maternal influenza
immunization, but supports vaccine policy choices made
during the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic when pregnant
women were a priority group for receiving pandemic vaccine.
