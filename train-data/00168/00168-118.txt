One hundred eighty-nine women who were immunized with Influenza A/New Jersey/8176 virus
vaccine (InfA/NJ) just prior to or during their pregnancy were compared with a control group of 517
pregnant women who did not receive the vaccine. This longitudinal, pruspectke study demonstreted
no association between immunization with MA/NJ and maternal, perinatai, or infant Compitcations.
No teratogenicity was demonstrated, and the two groups of infants did not diffar in physical Or
neurological assessments at birth and at 8 we&s of life. (AM. J. OBSTET. GY~~ECOL. 140:240,1~1.)
IN 1976, the Federal Government undertook a program to immunize the entire adult population of the
United States against Influenza A/New Jersey/8/76
(InfA/NJ), the strain of influenza which may have
caused the pandemic of 19 17- 1918, which killed
500,006 Americans.’ All persons who were less than 43
years old were presumed to be susceptible to the virus
and were urged to be immunized. Because pregnant
women seem to have an increased risk during influenza
pandemics, they, too, as a group, were urged to be
immunized.‘, * Because there was a paucity of data relative to the effects of InfA/NJ vaccine on mother and

fetus, and because the mass immunization program involved a strain of virus that was new to the young
human population, a prospective investigation was initiated to learn whether exposure to the vaccine during
pregnancy would have a measurable, deIeterious effect
on the mother’s health, on the outcome of her pregnancy, or on the health of her infant through the first 6
to 8 weeks of life. This prospective investigation included cohorts of women who either were or were not
immunized prior to or during pregnancy.

tion was sought relative to whether the individual experienced any reaction (malaise, headache, sore throat,
joint pain, cough, nasal discharge, chills, fever) within
4X hours of immunization or thereafter. Both the
ether-split virus vaccine (Parke, Davis and Company or
Wyeth Laboratories) and the purified, concentrated
whole virus vaccine (Merck Sharp and Dohme or
Merrell-National Laboratories) were used in the immunization program. The recommendations of the
Government were followed: less than 18 years of age,
split virus; 18 to 24 years of age, whole virus; over 24
years of age, whole or split virus.
Throughout pregnancy, surveillance was maintained
on every woman to learn of any intrapartum immunization with InfA/NJ antigen and to record the nature
and date of any complications. Whenever it was discovered that a woman had left her obstetric program prior
to her expected date of confinement, an effort was
made to locate her and learn whether her pregnancy
had been terminated prematurely (elective or spontaneous abortion or stillbirth). If she had transferred
her maternity care to a private physician, an effort was
made to keep her in the study by arranging with that
physician to obtain the requisite historical data.
Information was collected on the outcome of each
pregnancy relative to whether there was an elective or
spontaneous abortion (~20 weeks) or stillbirth (~20
weeks) and, if either one occurred, the date and gestational age at which it did occur; birth weight for live
births; presence or absence of congenital malformations and, if present, specific information thereof; occurrence of neonatal mortality, including cause and
any known autopsy findings; extent of maternal postpartum complications that arose during the first 27
days after delivery.
Information was also obtained on every infant born
to every woman enrolled in the study to learn about the
infant’s health as assessed at the end of the first 6 to 8
weeks of life. This assessment covered both physical
abnormalities and neurological development.
The control sample included those enrolled patients
who were not vaccinated with InfA/NJ antigen. The
reasons that these patients were not immunized included medical contraindications (e.g., egg allergy) and
patient preference. Ethically, vaccination could not be
withheld fr;m those who desired it or forced on those
who opposed it. Thus, there was no placebo-blinded
control group.
Results
Eight hundred fifteen pregnant women were ultimately enrolled in the study, 37% in the first trimester,
34% in the second trimester, and 29% in the third
trimester. One hundred nine (13.4%) were lost to

follow-up because of an unreported abortion, an unreported change of health care source, an untrackable
move from the area, or a request to be dropped from
the study. This report, then, summarizes the information on the remaining 706 women and their offspring.
The outcomes of the 706 pregnancies are listed in
Table IV. The outcomes of 18 pregnancies (2.5%) are
unknown; all were in the nonimmunized group. Of the
675 liveborn infants, 89.6% were delivered vaginally.
and 10.4% were delivered by cesarean section. Two sets
of twins and one set of triplets were delivered. No
statistically significant association was found by chisquare analysis between outcome of pregnancy (as
defined above) or infant mortality (10 infant deaths,
1.4%) and immunization history. The cause of infant
death was on a cardiorespiratory basis in seven cases,
on a central nervous system basis in one case, and on
the basis of sepsis in two cases (Table IV). Apgar scores
for the infants born of immunized and unimmunized
women are shown in Table V.
The women ranged in age from 14 to 45 years, with
a mean age (? 1 SD) of 21.97 (54.60) years. The remainder of the demographic information is shown in
Table I.
Five hundred seventeen (73.2%) of the 706 enrollees
followed in this study were never immunized during
the course of the study (Table II), whereas 5.8% were
immunized during the first trimester, 8.2% during the
second trimester, and 10.9% during the third trimester. A total of 1.9% were immunized prior to conception. Of those lost to follow-up, 100 were not immunized and nine were.
No major or life-threatening reactions occurred subsequent to immunization. Table Ill shows the reactions
that were reported. The complications of sore throat
and nasal discharge were not reported by any of our
study group.
The newborn nursery discharge summaries on 675
neonates were reviewed for information relative to
congenital anomalies. Any abnormality detected in the
neonatal period and documented on the discharge
summary was included in the tabulation. Hence, many
of the abnormalities were of the minor variety. Overall,
in 83.7% of the cases, no abnormality was recorded,
whereas in 86 (12.7%) of the cases, involvement of one
or more organ systems was described. In 3.6% of the
cases, no information was available. Specifically, the
more serious abnormalities, with the mother’s immunization history, are listed in Table VI. The association
between presence or absence of congenital malformations and the immunization history was found to be
statistically significant (p < 0.005) by chi-square analysis. Specifically, the absence of congenital malformations was linked with the presence of immunization.
The kind and severity of the complications of pregnancy observed in the study group did not differ from
those routinely seen. Several woman (< 10) had symptoms suggestive of influenza, but all attempts to isolate
lnfA/NJ virus were unsuccessful. No increase in antibody titer was demonstrated when acute and convalesSix hundred twenty-five (88.5%) of the infants born
to the 706 women were examined by a physician or a

to be normal. All of the systolic murmurs detected
prior to discharge of the infants from the newborn
nursery were no longer audible at the time of the
examination. Similarly, in all instances in which jaun-

Gross neurological assessment of the 625 infants examined by the eighth week of life showed that 612
(97.9%) of them were normal; no information was
available on four of the infants, and nine (1.4%) were
adjudged to be abnormal. For seven of these nine infants, there was no history of maternal immunization.
One infant whose mother was immunized in the second
trimester and one infant whose mother was immunized
in the third trimester were observed to be ,jitter)-. Of
those infants whose mothers had not been immunized,
three were hypotonic and questionably mentally retarded, one had anencephaly, and three had occasional
tremors of all extremities. No statistical significance
could be demonstrated by chi-square analysis between
a positive immunization history and the infant’s gross
neurological assessment.
Postpartum complications (hemorrhage, fever, vaginal discharge, infection) were not observed to be different in frequency or severity between those who had
been immunized and those who were unimmunized.
Comment
Influenza A may be a significant threat to maternal
health.’ The outbreak in 1918, which may have been
caused by a virus similar to the A/New Jersey/W76
virus, was dangerous to the general population and to
pregnant women in particular. Harris’ reported a mortality of 30% in pregnant women with influenza complicated by pneumonia, and an overall mortality ot
27% in 1,350 pregnant patients who had influenza.
hlore recently, Freeman and Barno:’ reported 11
deaths from Asian influenza among pregnant r\omen
in 1957- 1958 in Minnesota. This accounted for more
maternal deaths than an>. other cause during that year,
making up almost 20% of the total. In 1!)7.3, there Tvere
two maternal deaths in Minnesota due to influen;la
pneumonia.
The effects of the InHuen/a A virus are not limited
to the mother. Certainly, if rhe mother dies ofinfiuen~.a
pneumonia before delivery of the infant. the infant is
lost as well. Transplacental transfer of influenza virus
has been reported.’ Some studies have implicated
InHuenra A infections during pregnant) as causing an
increase in congenital malformations. abortions. and
stillbirths.-
At the time that plans were being formulated t’or the
mass immunization program of 1976 1977. there was
considerable debate as to how to deal with the pregnant
woman. Some argued that the risk of immunization to
her or her fetus was no greater than to any other
healthy individual, so that she should be immunized.
Others, although supporting a mass immuni/at ion
program which would include women, emphasized
that the possibility that pregnancj. should increase the
risk of serious reactions to the antiger could not and
should not be denied.’ That risk, howc\er. had to he
weighed against the increased risk of maternal and
fetal death which had been observed in 19 I8 (during
the last great inHuen/a pandemic), as well as in
epidemics of the disease that occurred in later 1eat.s.
That the pregnant woman should be immunized became, ultimately, the official governmental stance. The
use of. a killed virus t-accine against lnlluen~a A ~\XS
presumed to be safe for pregnant patients according to
the United States Department of Health, Education
and Welfare. Nevertheless. concern ~\er this position
was refected in this prospective study authorized and
supported by the Center for Disease (:ontrol.
Sumaya and Gibbs8 have reported on .X5 women who
received InfA/NJ/8/76 vaccine during the second and
third trimesters of pregnancy, and no significant reactions or f’etal complications could be related to the immunizations.
Overall, this longitudinal, prospective study failed to
demonstrate any statistically significant association between immunization with A/NJ/W76 antigen and a deleterious effect on pregnancy (maternal health), the
outcome of pregnancy (live birth versus stillbirth or
abortion), the infant‘s physical or neurological development as assessed through 8 weeks of rhe infant’s life.
or the postpartum status of the mother-. The stillbirth
and spontaneous abortion rates (2.W 1,000 cases and
11.311,OOO cases, respectively) were well below the 197.5
figures for the four participating maternity projects 
Volume 140

( 11.8/1,000 cases and 60.5/1,000 cases, respectively).
Although follow-up on only 706 of the 815 women
originally in the study was completed, it is unlikely that
data on those 109 cases not tabulated would have
changed the results significantly in view of the abbreviated nature of the immunization program, especially since only nine immunized patients were lost to
follow-up.
Had the immunization program as originally conceived not been prematurely halted by the occurrence
of cases of Guillain-Barre disease, questions about the
effects of immunization on maternal health, the outcome of the pregnancy, the infant’s physical or neurological development, or the postpartum status of the
mother might have been better answered. In view of
the modification of the immunization program, however, this is only conjecture.
In spite of the lack of blinded controls, we gain some
reassurance from the fact that patients (and fetuses)
who were immunized during pregnancy did as well as
controls, and both groups improved over the previous
year in the categories of stillbirth and spontaneous
abortion rates.
The initiation of this study was aided greatly by
