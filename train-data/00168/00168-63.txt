Abstract
We studied the safety and immunogenicity of a nasally administered vaccine comprising three monovalent inactivated influenza antigens
(A/New Caledonia/20/99 (H1N1), A/Panama/2007/99 (H3N2), and B/Guangdong/120/2000) non-covalently associated with outer membrane
proteins of Neisseria meningitidis (ProteosomeTM) in normal, healthy adults. In a randomized, double-blind trial participants (n = 78) were
allocated to placebo or a single nasal dose of vaccine containing 15, 30, or 45g of each of the three HA antigens, or two nasal doses
containing 30g of each HA, separated by 2 weeks. The vaccine was generally well tolerated in all doses tested, and in a one or two-dose
schedule. A shallow vaccine reactogenicity dose-response was seen. The most common local reaction was nasal congestion, which occurred
in up to 48.3% of vaccine recipients in days 0–6 after vaccine but was mild and self-limiting; this reaction was not significantly more common
among active vaccine recipients than placebo recipients. Mild to moderate headache was the most commonly reported systemic reactogenicity
complaint in all treatment groups, and was the only solicited complaint to increase significantly in frequency after a second active dose. No
severe systemic reactions occurred. A positive and statistically significant antibody response was observed, in serum and in nasal secretions,
to increasing dose for all three antigens. Serum HAI titre responses and nasal secretory IgA immune responses were elicited against all three
antigens. Further testing of this nasal influenza vaccine is warranted to determine its safety and immunogenicity in these populations and its
efficacy in the prevention of clinical illness.

1. Introduction
Influenza infection is a leading cause of morbidity and
mortality worldwide, affecting up to 20% of the population
each winter in non-pandemic years. Annual immunization
is recommended for persons at high risk of complications,
including the elderly, those with certain chronic illnesses,

children 6–23 months of age and to household contacts and
care providers of these populations [1,2].
Inactivated injectable influenza vaccines provide substantial but incomplete protection against infection [3,4]. Vaccines delivered to the nasal mucosae have the advantage
of being less invasive than injectable vaccines, and may
stimulate both systemic and mucosal immune responses,
thus enhancing personal protection and potentially reducing
transmission to others [5]. A live, attenuated, cold-adapted
influenza vaccine for nasal administration that is safe, well

tolerated and effective was licensed for persons 5–49 years
in the United States in 2003 [6].
The ProteosomeTM adjuvant/delivery system consists
of hydrophobic, proteinaceous, nanoparticles comprised
of purified Neisseria meningitidis outer membrane proteins. These nanoparticles can non-covalently associate with
amphiphilic antigens by virtue of an antigen’s hydrophobic
anchor sequence; typical of such transmembrane antigens
are the glycoproteins which constitute the key antigens of
inactivated influenza vaccines including influenza hemagglutinin [7,8]. The Proteosome nasal delivery technology was
shown to be immunogenic, safe, and well tolerated when
a Proteosome-Shigella flexneri 2a lipopolysaccharide vaccine was given intranasally to healthy adults, resulting in
immune responses comparable to live vaccine candidates[9].
A prototype monovalent, influenza A/H1N1 Proteosome vaccine was safe and immunogenic when given nasally to 154
healthy adults in two phase 1 clinical trials[10]. In this report,
we describe the results of a phase 1, randomized, doubleblind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging clinical trial to assess
the safety and immunogenicity of a ProteosomeTM-trivalent
influenza vaccine delivered intranasally to healthy adults.
2. Material and methods
2.1. Vaccine
The FluINsureTM ProteosomeTM-trivalent Influenza vaccine (ID Biomedical Corporation of Quebec) contains ´
an equal parts mixture of three monovalent egg-grown,
formalin-inactivated influenza antigens non-covalently associated with outer membrane proteins (OMPs) of N. meningitidis serogroup B strain 8047. The OMPs are extracted
from bacterial paste by a series of detergent solubilizations
and chemical partitioning/precipitation steps, and include a
predominant population of class 2 OMP, or porB, in association with lesser amounts of class 1 porA and 4 OMPs,
1–2% meningococcal lipopolysaccharide, and <1% residual
nucleic acids. Monovalent vaccines were produced by formulating OMPs with egg-derived, inactivated, detergent-split
influenza virus bulk antigens (standard monovalent intermediates used in the production of trivalent injectable vaccines
by Solvay Pharmaceuticals, Weesp, Netherlands) at a ratio of
4:1 OMP protein to influenza hemagglutinin in the presence
of a non-denaturing non-ionic detergent mixture. The detergent was then removed by diafiltration to allow association of
the hydrophobic OMPs and amphiphilic influenza glycoproteins to form a stable colloid. Three monovalent vaccines
were then blended to yield a trivalent product. Immunoprecipitation methods confirm that a majority of influenza
hemagglutinin in this stable colloid exists in physical association with OMP complexes of approximately 100 nm diameter.
Analytical development is underway to more precisely quantitate this association and to assess the distribution of other
viral proteins in the vaccine preparations.
The trivalent vaccine stock for this study contained
180 ± 35g/mL of hemagglutinin (HA) from each of A/New
Caledonia/20/99 (H1N1), A/Panama/2007/99 (H3N2), and
B/Guangdong/120/2000. The vaccine was formulated in
Na/K phosphate-buffered isotonic saline, pH 7.4 with 0.01%
thimerosal, and contained non-hemagglutinin viral proteins
typical of inactivated, detergent-split influenza vaccines and
trace amounts of egg proteins. The product was a slightly
yellowish, opalescent liquid, which was diluted in the investigational site’s pharmacy as needed to administer the target
dosage. The placebo control and diluent was phosphatebuffered isotonic saline, which is clear and colorless. In order
to maintain blinding the vaccine was prepared by an investigational pharmacist who did not participate in either the
safety or immunogenicity evaluation and delivered to the
nurse administering vaccine in a dark brown glass vial (5 mL
U-Save; Saint-Gobain Desjonqueres Pharma, New York, NY)
which effectively obscured any visible difference in the test
articles.
2.2. Population
Adults aged 18–50 years inclusive, in good general health
as determined by a screening evaluation (history, physical examination, selected clinical laboratory tests) and who
gave informed consent, were eligible to participate. Subjects were not screened for pre-existing immunity to the
virus strains included in the vaccine. Exclusionary criteria
included employment in professions prone to influenza transmission or membership in other groups for which annual
influenza vaccination is recommended, presence of significant acute or chronic, uncontrolled medical or psychiatric
illness, positive serologic test for Human Immunodeficiency
Virus, Hepatitis C virus or Hepatitis B surface antigen, pregnancy as determined by positive urine test for human chorionic gonadotrophin within 48 h prior to each dose of the
investigational vaccine, chronic use of any medication or
product for symptoms of rhinitis or nasal congestion or any
chronic nasopharyngeal complaint or use of such product
within 7 days prior to immunization, asthma, symptoms or
diagnosis suggesting gag reflex impairment or predisposition to aspiration, use of systemic glucocorticosteroids or
immunosuppressive medications, receipt of investigational
drugs in the prior month, presence of febrile or upper respiratory tract illness on the day of immunization, and known
hypersensitivity to mercurials or chicken eggs.
2.3. Study design and procedures
The protocol was reviewed and approved by the IWK
Research Ethics Board. Written informed consent was
obtained from all participants.
The study was blinded, randomized, and placebocontrolled. There were four successive treatment cohorts
enrolled in a dose-escalating fashion. Regimens evaluated
included single nasal doses of vaccine containing 15, 30,
J.M. Langley et al. / Vaccine 24 (2006) 1601–1608 1603
or 45g of each of the three HA antigens and two nasal
doses containing 30g of each HA, separated by 2 weeks.
Dose escalation was unblinded, but neither placebo recipients
or study personnel were aware of vaccine/placebo allocation within each escalation period. Treatment assignment was
designed so that each treatment cohort (A, B, C, D) included
20–30% placebo recipients and 67–80% active vaccine recipients. Dose escalation proceeded after review of safety data
from each preceding dose level by an unblinded independent physician whose recommendation was then reviewed
and accepted by the by the IWK Research Ethics Board. The
allocation in each treatment cohort was as follows: Cohort A8 active (15g) and 4 placebo; Cohort B-16 active (30g)
and 6 placebo; Cohort C-18 active (45 g) and 4 placebo; and
Cohort D-18 active (30g × 2) and 4 placebo.
Vaccine and placebo were delivered to the nasal mucosae
using a VP3/140 metered dose pump (Valois of America,
Greenwich, CN) with the participant in a sitting position.
In order to deliver the spray, the nose piece of the pump
was placed in one nostril while the participant occluded the
other. As the participant gently inhaled through the nose, the
actuator was fully depressed. This delivers 140 L of liquid as
a spray with a median droplet size of 40–50 m. The process
was then repeated for the other nostril.
All participants had a physical examination performed by
a physician, including a neurologic exam, at baseline and at
140 days following the first dose. Physical exams focused on
the nasopharynx, cervical lymph nodes and ears were performed by registered professional nurses on the day of the
vaccine dose and 2 days after the dose. Special standardized training in these examinations were provided and documented prior to study initiation. Participants were monitored
for 30 min. after the immunization for any immediate adverse
events and completed an immediate complaints questionnaire
half an hour after the dose which evaluated selected complaints (burning or stinging in the nose or throat, itching in
the nose, throat or eyes, shortness of breath, light-headedness
or dizziness, fever or presence of skin eruption) and their
severity (none, mild, moderate, severe). Participants were
provided with a digital thermometer and instructed to measure and record their temperature, the occurrence and severity
of specific vaccine reactogenicity adverse events (fatigue,
appetite, headache, muscle or joint ache, rhinorrhea, nasal
irritation or inflammation, bleeding from the nose, erythema
or swelling of the eyes, sore throat, cough, shortness of breath
or wheezing) and any medication use on a symptom diary
beginning the evening after the dose and for each of 6 days
post-immunization. The symptom diary was reviewed with
the participant on the day 2 visit and by scripted telephone
call on the 7th day after immunization. Data on spontaneous
adverse event reports and concomitant medication usage were
collected on days 0, 7, 14, 28, 42, 84 and 140.
Solicited reactogenicity events were categorized as grade
0 (none), grade 1: mild (awareness of symptom but easily
tolerated), grade 2: moderate (discomfort enough to cause
interference with usual activity), or grade 3: severe (incapacitating with inability to work or do usual activity or requiring a
medical visit). Serious events were defined as those that were
fatal or life-threatening; caused or prolonged hospitalization;
resulted in a significant, persistent, or permanent disability;
produced a congenital abnormality; or required intervention
to prevent permanent impairment or damage. Venous blood
for hematology (hemoglobin, hematocrit, white blood cell
count and differential, platelet count) and for clinical chemistry (ALT, AST, blood urea nitrogen and creatinine) was
collected at the screening visit and on day 28. Urine specimens were collected at the screening visit and on day 28 for
glucose, protein and hemoglobin. Serologies for antibodies
to Hepatitis C, HIV 1 and 2 and HBsAg were done during
the screening visit. Nasal wash specimens for specific secretory IgA (sIgA) and sera for specific antibody detection were
collected at baseline and on days 14, 28, 42, 84 and 140 after
vaccine administration. These were obtained by instilling
5 mL of sterile phosphate-buffered saline through the nostril with the participant tilting his or her head back to a 45◦
angle and waiting 10 s. The participant then leaned forward
to allow the saline to pour into a sterile sample container.
This procedure was completed for each nostril. Systemic
immune responses were assessed by serum hemagglutinininhibition (HAI) antibody titres specific for the three viruses
included in the vaccine, prior to vaccination, and at days
14, 28 and 42 days post-dose. Sera were tested by standard
microtitre hemagglutination-inhibition methods after treatment with receptor-destroying enzyme. Nasal washes were
concentrated approximately 4-fold using Centricon® centrifugal filter devices (50,000 molecular weight cut-off) as
described by the manufacturer (Millipore Corporation, Billerica, MA). Strain-specific sIgA responses were measured
by kinetic enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (KELISA)
as previously described [10]. with the following modification: optical density at 650 nm was recorded every 12 s
for a total run time of 5 min at 25 ± 3 ◦C using a Benchmark PlusTM Microplate Spectrophotometer and Microplate
Manager® version 5.2 build 103 Software (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Mississauga, Ont., Canada) to generate a KELISA
rate. A mean rate was calculated from the triplicate for each
sample. Repeated assays on standard samples yielded a dayto-day coefficient of variation of ≤20%. A small number
of samples required assay at additional dilutions to obtain
KELISA rates in the linear response range of the assay; results
were corrected for the dilution factor. Total sIgA levels in
nasal wash were quantified by radial immunodiffusion using
BIND ARIDTM kits as described by the manufacturer (The
Binding Site Ltd., Birmingham, UK). Virus-specific sIgA
KELISA rates in each sample were then normalized to the
arithmetic mean of total sIgA determinations for all specimens from the entire study population.
2.4. Data analysis and statistical considerations
Proportions of subjects having each reactogenicity complaint were estimated each day using binomial point esti-
1604 J.M. Langley et al. / Vaccine 24 (2006) 1601–1608
mators and exact 95% confidence intervals. Tests of pairwise group differences, the test of placebo versus any vaccine as well as an overall test and test of trend were made
at each time point. The probability of a result occurring
less than 5 percent of the time was considered statistically significant (p < 0.05). Reactogenicity severity was compared across treatment groups using the Jonchheere–Terpstra
test for bivariate ordinal association. The data for placebo
recipients was compared with that for all vaccine recipients using the exact Cochrane–Mantel–Haenszel one degree
of freedom test. Mean values of vital signs and clinical and laboratory measurements were compared across
treatment groups by analysis of variance or t-tests where
appropriate.
For each treatment group the median and geometric mean
and the 95% CI for the latter of specific antibody titres
were calculated at each time point for serum HAI antibody titres and nasal wash specific secretory IgA KELISA
rates. Antibody measures for the three influenza viruses
in serum and nasal wash samples were log transformed
prior to analysis in order that they more closely followed
a normal distribution. The proportion of serum HAI antibody “responders” was calculated based on 4-fold rises in
reciprocal titre and separately on attainment of presumptive protective titres of ≥40. The intrinsic variability in
nasal wash titres in the absence of known antigen exposure
was described by comparing the first and second baseline
specimens. This information was used to generate a standard for vaccine response by calculating a mean and standard deviation (S.D.) for the distribution of log-tranformed
ratios between the two screening values. Nasal “responders”
were individuals whose KELISA rate ratio (KELISA rate
on day 28 divided by the second screening KELISA rate)
exceeded the upper 97.5th percentile of the screening value
ratios.
Comparison of proportions between and among dose
groups was made using Fisher’s exact tests without adjustment for multiple comparisons. Linear trend across doses was
assessed using logistic regression. For continuous variates
comparisons between and among dose groups were made
using analysis of variance and/or Kruskal–Wallis tests and
linear trend was assessed using linear regression. All analyses were done on the intent-to-treat cohort. Analyses were
conducted using SAS version 8.02 software (SAS Institute
Inc., Cary, NC, USA).
3. Results
3.1. Demographics
A total of 78 adults entered the study and all completed
follow-up. The mean age was 28 (±S.D. 8.5) years with a
range of 18.2–50.6 years. Male participants comprised 44.9%
(n = 35) of the sample and 96.2% of participants were Caucasian.

vaccine or saline placebo.
3.2. Safety
The vaccine was well tolerated. The majority of solicited
reactogenicity reports over the first 7 days (days 0–6) after
dosing were of grades 0 (none) or 1 (easily tolerated; no
impact on daily activities), and grade 3 responses were rare.
Rates of the seven solicited local complaints, cumulatively
over days 0–6 after the first exposure to vaccine are shown
in Fig. 1. Both clear rhinorrhea and mild nasal congestion
did occur approximately 20% more frequently among active
vaccine recipients. Rhinorrhea was not significantly more frequent among all vaccinees than among placebo recipients, but
linear trend across doses using logistic regression was significant (p = 0.04). Significant (grade 2 or 3) local reactions were
reported by 5.6% of placebo recipients and 8.3% of all active
vaccinees (p = ns).
Solicited systemic symptoms reactions reported on days
0–6 after the first vaccine are summarized in Table 1. There
were no severe general or systemic reactions. Temperature
elevations were infrequent, low grade, and occurred as often
after placebo as active doses. The most common systemic
reaction was headache, which occurred more frequently
15g group compared to the placebo group (7/8, 87.5% versus 6/18, 33%; p = 0.03) and among subjects who received
two doses at the 30g level compared to the one dose 30g
group (10/18; 55.6% versus 3/16; 18.8%; p = 0.04). Significant systemic complaints were reported by 27.8% of placebo
recipients and only 10% of active vaccinees (p = ns).
Most participants had normal physical findings on examination of the nose, throat and neck 48 h after vaccine administration (Table 2). Only one participant had a physical finding
that was rated grade 2; this subject had mild tenderness of
the sinuses on palpation, which resolved spontaneously. No
clinically significant changes in vitals signs or in biochemical or hematologic laboratory tests were observed. Neither
prevalence of concomitant medication usage or changes, nor
the incidence of spontaneously reported adverse events in

any organ system, differed significantly among the vaccine
groups throughout the study.
3.3. Immunogenicity
The serum hemagglutination inhibiting (HAI) antibody
response to all three viral antigens at 28 days post first exposure is summarized in Table 3. Serum antibody response was
apparent by day 14, with 50–65% of subjects in active treatment groups manifesting a 4-fold increase in titer from baseline. Statistically significant increases in HAI titre occurred in
all active vaccine groups for the two influenza A components,
and at the two highest doses for the B component. A doserelationship in both magnitude and frequency of response
was also apparent for the two influenza A components, but
did not reach significance for the B component, for which
the analysis may have been confounded by the substantial
pre-existing antibody titres against this antigen.
Nasal wash secretory IgA (sIgA) responses specific for
the vaccine viruses were also apparent in the vaccine-treated
groups as shown in Table 4. Mean fold-increases in specific nasal sIgA exceeded placebo values for all active treatment groups, and this difference was significant for the three
higher dose groups for the A/H1N1 virus and the 30 g × 2
group for both A/H3N2 and the B virus. Lending credence
to this finding, a statistically significant dose response in
mucosal immunogenicity was apparent for all three antigens. The group receiving two doses showed the strongest
sIgA immunogenicity for all three antigens. Fig. 2 exemplifies the kinetics of nasal wash sIgA responses using the
data for A/New Caledonia (since no A/H1N1 viruses circulated in the influenza season during which this trial occurred,
and hence these data should most closely reflect the magnitude and duration of response attributable to vaccine). Nasal
wash sIgA responses rose quickly and were apparent in all
active treatment groups by day 14; moreover, in all except the
group which received 15g only once, the 95% confidence
lower limits of fold-rise in the active vaccine groups persistently exceeded the placebo group values—which were flat
throughout the study.
Considering those subjects who entered the trial without “protective” serum HAI antibody reciprocal titres of
40, Fig. 3 illustrates the overall frequency of potentially
protective serum HAI responses (4-fold rise or attainFig. 2. Time course of nasal immune responses to A/New Caledonia/20/99

ment of a reciprocal titre of ≥40), significant nasal sIgA
responses, or both. The data concerning B/Guangdong virus
must be treated with caution because so few subjects enter
the trial as “susceptibles.” However, it is apparent that a
majority of previously susceptible vaccinees had a potentially protective immune response in either the systemic or
mucosal compartment for all three viruses represented in the
vaccine.
4. Discussion
In this study we have documented that a novel intranasally
administered trivalent influenza vaccine using a Proteosomeadjuvanted delivery vehicle was well tolerated and induced
both mucosal and systemic immune responses in healthy
adults. This confirms and extends similar findings from a
phase I trial using a prototype monovalent influenza vaccine,
wherein we demonstrated that nasal delivery in association
with OMPs conferred enhanced immunogenicity on inactivated influenza antigens [10,11].
The ProteosomeTM-trivalent subunit influenza vaccine
was well tolerated at all doses tested and in both a one or
two dose regimen, and there were no severe reactions. In
the 7 days after intranasal doses rhinorrhea was significantly
associated with active vaccine versus placebo but this was
response was mild and self-limited. Headache was reported
more commonly in some but not all groups that received the
active vaccine. Larger trials are needed to accurately estimate the frequency of these events; but there is no evidence
of unacceptable short-term reactogenicity among the current
data.
A serum and mucosal immune response was elicited
against all three-vaccine virus types included in this vaccine.
At day 28, serum HAI antibody reciprocal titres of ≥40-
or a ≥4-fold rise in HAI titre, and/or significant nasal antibody increase were observed for all three antigens in over
60% of subjects “susceptible” to the various viruses at baseline. This suggests that the immunogenicity demonstrated
in this phase I/II trial may correlate with clinical protection
against influenza, based on the commonly-accepted notion
that reciprocal HAI titres ≥40- or a 4-fold rise in HAI titre
[4], and the observation, made in the context of live, coldadapted influenza vaccine trials, that any detectable increase
in virus-specific local sIgA may suppress both disease and
viral shedding [12]. While the strongest mucosal responses
clearly occurred in persons who received two vaccine doses,
single doses containing 30 or more g of hemagglutinin
antigen were also clearly capable of eliciting mucosal sIgA
increases, and these increases persisted through 140 days at
levels above those attained by placebo recipients.
Intranasal vaccines have numerous advantages including ease of administration, immune responses at the site
of pathogen-entry and at other mucosal sites, the development of mucosal and systemic immune responses and the
potential functional advantage of secretory IgA over stan-

a All three virus strains show a significant result in overall one-way analysis of variance and a significant rising trend with dose.
b Responders are subjects with day 28/screen ratios for antigen-specific nasal sIgA that exceed the mean + 2 standard deviations of “spontaneous variation”
between the two screening samples. This criterion was virus-specific (2.26 for A/New Caledonia, 1.69 for A/Panama, and 1.52 for B/Guangdong), but using a
generalized standard of 2.0, derived by pooling spontaneous variation data for all three viruses, has little impact of the proportion of responders.

dard IgA and IgG [5,13]. Two other intranasal influenza
vaccines have been licensed in recent years. A live attenuated intranasal vaccine is now licensed for persons 5–49
years in the US [6], and trials are ongoing to determine its efficacy in other populations. An inactivated vaccine comprising
influenzavirus surface antigens incorporated into liposomes
with Escherichia coli heat-labile toxin as a mucosal adjuvant, was introduced in Europe in 2000 but withdrawn from
the market the following year when an increased incidence of
Bell’s Palsy was observed [13–15]. Although the pathogenesis of this phenomenon is not clear, it is thought that the potent
heat-labile toxin that binds to GM1 ganglioside and was
used as a mucosal adjuvant may induce a neurotoxic inflammatory response in local nerves [13]. By way of contrast,
the Proteosome adjuvanted-delivery system lacks any known
neurotropic components and does not bind to GM1 ganglioside. Indeed, at least one component of the Proteosomes, i.e.,
the PorB, is known to interact with TLR2 [16], an interaction
decidedly different from heat-labile toxin. Intranasal immunization with this Proteosome-adjuvanted delivery complex
for trivalent influenza is practical, well tolerated in all subjects
tested to date, and induces both local mucosal and systemic
immune responses.
Further study of this nasal influenza vaccine, in both oneand two-dose regimens, is warranted to determine if it is
safe and immunogenic in high-risk and/or pediatric populations, and to demonstrate efficacy in the prevention of clinical
influenza infection. These studies are underway.
