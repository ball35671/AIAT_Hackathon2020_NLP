Background: Development of influenza vaccines that do not use embryonated eggs as the substrate for
vaccine production is a high priority. We conducted this study to determine the protective efficacy a
recombinant, baculovirus-expressed seasonal trivalent influenza virus hemagglutinin (rHA0) vaccine
(FluBlok®).
Methods: Healthy adult subjects at 24 centers across the US were randomly assigned to receive a single
injectionof salineplacebo (2304 subjects), or trivalent FluBlok containing 45mcg of eachrHA0 component
(2344 subjects). Serum samples for assessment of immune responses by hemagglutination-inhibition
(HAI) were taken from a subset of subjects before and 28 days after immunization. Subjects were followed
during the 2007–2008 influenza season and combined nasal and throat swabs for virus isolation were
obtained from subjects reporting influenza-like illness.
Results: Rates of local and systemic side effects were low, and the rates of systemic side effects were
similar in the vaccine and placebo groups. HAI antibody responses were seen in 78%, 81%, and 52% of
FluBlok recipients to the H1, H3, and B components, respectively. FluBlok was 44.6% (95% CI, 18.8%,
62.6%) effective in preventing culture-confirmed influenza meeting the CDC influenza-like illness case
definition despite significant antigenic mismatch between the vaccine antigens and circulating viruses.
Conclusions: Trivalent rHA0 vaccine was safe, immunogenic and effective in the prevention of culture
confirmed influenza illness, including protection against drift variants.

1. Introduction
Although embryonated hen’s eggs have been used to generate
effective influenza vaccines for many years, this system does have
several important drawbacks. Vaccine manufacturing using eggs
requires specialized facilities, and the ability to scale up egg production rapidly in response to an emergency is limited. In addition,
poultry are potentially vulnerable to the same subtypes ofinfluenza

viruses that might also be responsible for pandemic influenza. It is
usually necessary to adapt candidate vaccine viruses for high yield
growth in eggs, a process that can be time consuming, is not always
successful, and which can select receptor variants that may not be
optimally representative of circulating influenza strains [1,2].
Expression of proteins in insect cells using recombinant baculovirus has emerged as a promising technology for vaccine
production. New recombinant baculoviruses can be generated
quickly from sequence data, protein expression is very efficient
under the control of the baculovirus polyhedrin promoter, and post
translational modifications of the protein are generally similar to
other eukaryotic systems. In previous studies, we have evaluated
baculovirus-expressed recombinant influenza virus hemagglutinins (rHA0s) as influenza vaccines in humans. Monovalent and
bivalent rHA0s have been well tolerated and immunogenic in

young adults and adults 65 and older [3–5]. More recent studies have evaluated rHA0 vaccine formulations in healthy adults,
subjects aged 50–64 years of age [6] and subjects 65 and older
[7,8]. These studies have consistently shown excellent tolerability and antibody responses similar to those seen with egg-derived
influenza vaccines. Finally, in a preliminary field efficacy evaluation, recipients of the rHA0 vaccine had reduced rates of
culture-positive CDC-defined influenza-like illness compared with
placebo recipients, although the study was small [9].
In the present study, we performed a much larger assessment
of the immunogenicity, safety, and protective efficacy of the final
formulation of trivalent rHA0 vaccine in a population of healthy
young adults.
2. Methods
2.1. Vaccine
The vaccine (FluBlok) used in this study consisted of purified hemagglutinin (HA) proteins produced in insect cells using
a baculovirus expression system as previously described [9]. The
recombinant HA protein is not cleaved in insect cells and is
referred to as rHA0. The trivalent vaccine contained 45 mcg
(as measured by the single radial immunodiffusion assay) of
each purified rHA0 derived from the A/Solomon Islands/3/2006
(H1N1), A/Wisconsin/67/2005 (H3N2), and B/Malaysia/2506/2004
influenza viruses recommended for the 2007–2008 influenza
season formulated with 0.005% Tween®-20 in 10 mM sodium
phosphate buffer pH 7.0 ± 0.4 without a preservative. Genes
were cloned into baculovirus using RT-PCR from the same CDCderived vaccine seed viruses used for the production of licensed
inactivated influenza vaccine for that year. Sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the purified monovalent
materials indicated that hemagglutinin constitutes at least 90% of
the total protein. Placebo consisted of normal saline for injection,
USP.
2.2. Clinical study design
The study was conducted at 24 centers located across the United
States (Appendix) during the 2007–2008 influenza season. Subjects
were healthy adults aged 18–49 years inclusive, who did not belong
to high priority target groups for influenza vaccination as defined
by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practice [10]. Women
of child-bearing potential had a negative urine pregnancy test at
the time of randomization and were instructed to use contraception during the course of the study. After screening medical history
and physical exam to determine eligibility, subjects were randomly
assigned to receive either a single dose of FluBlok, or saline placebo
using a permuted block randomization scheme stratified for each
study site. Vaccine was administered as a single intramuscular
injection in the upper deltoid.
Subjects measured their oral temperature daily and maintained
a memory aid for 7 days after vaccination on which they recorded
local and systemic reactions graded as “mild” (noticeable but not
interfering with normal activities), “moderate” (some interference
with normal activities), and “severe” (symptom prevented normal daily activities). Subjects received a phone call at day 7 for
review of the memory aid, concomitant medications and medical
history.
In addition, subjects from five sites (total, N = 870) participated in a serological substudy. At these sites, subjects had serum
obtained prior to vaccination, and returned approximately 28 days
after vaccination for assessment of serum antibody to influenza
virus. All other subjects received a phone call from their medical
center for review of interim safety data at day 28. A final phone call
occurred at the end of the influenza season.
2.3. Surveillance for influenza
During the influenza season, subjects completed a weekly diary
to record influenza symptoms, and after influenza was recognized
in the community, subjects received weekly phone calls to review
the diary and ascertain the presence or absence of respiratory illness symptoms. Subjects were instructed to return to the clinic for
illness evaluations if they observed any acute respiratory symptoms or fever. During these illness visits, symptoms were reviewed,
a brief physical exam was conducted, and combined nasal and
throat swabs for virus culture were obtained.
2.4. Laboratory assays
Sera from the immunogenicity subset were assessed for
antibody to each of the three components of the vaccine by
hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) at the Cincinnati Children’s
Hospital using a validated assay based on standard methods. All
available sera from vaccine recipients, and a randomly selected
subset of approximately 33% of placebo specimens were selected
for testing. The antigens used in the assays were baculovirus
derived rHAs representing the A/Solomon Islands/03/2006 (H1N1),
A/Wisconsin/67/2005 (H3N2), and B/Malaysia/2506/2004 viruses,
provided by Protein Sciences Corporation. Sera were treated with
neuraminidase (RDE, Denka-Seiken, Japan) to remove non-specific
inhibitors of hemagglutination prior to testing, and were tested in
serial two-fold dilutions at an initial dilution of 1:10. Sera with
no reactivity at 1:10 were assigned a value of 1:5. Assays were
performed using turkey red blood cells (Viromed Laboratories,Minnetonka, MN).
Swabs for virus culture were stored at −70 ◦C and shipped on
dry ice to a central laboratory (Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH) where virus isolation was performed in
primary rhesus monkey kidney (RhMK) cells (Diagnostic Hybrids
Inc (DHI), Athens, Ohio). The presence of influenza A or B viruses
in the culture was determined by immunofluorescence using typespecific monoclonal antibodies (DHI). All influenza isolates were
subsequently subtyped and antigenically characterized based on
reactivity to ferret antiserum raised against WHO reference strains.
2.5. Statistical analyses
The primary safety endpoints for this study were the rates
and severity of solicited and unsolicited adverse events. The primary immunogenicity endpoints were the rates of 4-fold or greater
increases in serum HAI antibody to each of the three vaccine
strains comparing pre- and 28-day post-vaccination samples. The
primary efficacy endpoint was culture-documented influenza illness, defined as development of a CDC-defined influenza-like
illness (CDC-ILI) associated with recovery of influenza virus from
a nasopharyngeal swab. CDC-ILI was defined as the presence of
documented fever ≥100 F plus either sore throat or cough.
Safety of the rHA0 vaccine was evaluated via the frequencies
and percentages of subjects experiencing adverse events, and a
chi-squared test at a nominal 0.05 level was performed to find
any differences in incidence rates between groups. Differences
between groups in the proportions of subjects with at least a fourfold increase in HAI antibody were also tested using a Chi-Square
test. Protective efficacy (PE) was calculated as (1-RR), where RR is
the relative risk of having an event compared to the placebo group.
Upper and lower confidence limits for the RR were calculated using
the exact conditional binomial procedure.

The sample size for this study was chosen based on the assumption that FluBlok would be at least 70% efficacious in prevention of
symptomatic, culture-proven influenza, and thatthe placebo attack
rate would be 3% or greater. The sample size was then chosen to
have 80% power to determine that the lower bound of the 95%
confidence interval for protective efficacy was greater than 40%,
assuming a 5% attrition rate.
2.6. Informed consent
Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects in
the study, and the study was approved by the institutional review
boards at each study site prior to initiation of the study and enrollment of subjects.
3. Results
A total of 4648 eligible subjects were randomized 1:1 to receive
either FluBlok or Placebo, and 4071 (87.5%) completed all study
procedures. The disposition of the study subjects is shown in

receive FluBlok and 2304 were randomized to placebo. The majority of subjects were white (66%) and female (59%). The mean age
was 32.5 years. Three subjects were over the enrollment criteria of
49 years or less, so that the age range enrolled was 18–55 years;
these three subjects are included in both the safety and efficacy
analyses. There were no differences with respect to age, sex or race
between the groups.
There were 577 subjects who did not complete the study, the
majority of whom were lost to follow-up (260 (11%) in the FluBlok
and 251 (11%) in the placebo group). In addition, 36 subjects
withdrew consent (22 (1%) and 14 (0.6%) in FluBlok and placebo,
respectively), 3 in each group withdrew due to an adverse event
(AE), there was 1 death in each group, and 9 and 13 subjects in
the FluBlok and placebo groups, respectively were discontinued for
other reasons.
3.1. Assessment of vaccine safety
The rates and severities of local and systemic symptoms
reported by subjects in the 7 days following administration of
FluBlok or placebo are shown in Table 1. FluBlok was associated
with local injection site pain and muscle aches that were significantly more frequent than after saline placebo (P < .03 for pain).
However, 94% of all complaints of pain after FluBlok were rated
as mild. Systemic symptoms following vaccination did not occur
at significantly different rates in vaccine and placebo recipients
(P > .05 for all comparisons). The most frequently reported systemic symptoms following vaccination were headache (15% in both
groups) and fatigue or lack of energy (14.5% in both groups). The
majority (76%) of complaints of headache were also mild. There
were 17 reports of fever (oraltemperature >100.4 F) among FluBlok
recipients and 12 among placebo recipients following vaccination.
There were 85 severe adverse events (SAEs) reported during the
study in 64 subjects. Of these, 41 SAEs were reported in 30 subjects
(1.28%) in the FluBlok group, and 44 SAEs in 34 subjects (1.48%)
in the placebo group. Two subjects died during the study; one in
each group. A subjectin the FluBlok-treatment group experienced a
fatal pulmonary embolism approximately three months post vaccination, and a subject in the placebo group had a fatal motor vehicle
accident. Both deaths were considered to be unrelated to the study
by the site investigator. All buttwo SAEs (a liposarcoma in a FluBlok
recipient and breast cancer in a placebo recipient) had resolved
by the end of the study period. None of the 85 SAEs in the study
were considered to be definitely or probably related to vaccine. One
event, a pericardial effusion in a FluBlok recipient was judged to be
possibly related to vaccine. This event occurred in a 47 year-old
male with a prior history of hypertension, who began experiencing

fever and cough 7 days after vaccination and was hospitalized 11
days after vaccination with a diagnosis of pericardial effusion and
cardiac tamponade. Pericardiocentesis showed one colony of Propionibacterium spp.; and culture of pleural fluid grew Staphylococcus
epidermidis only. Viral cultures and a panel of serum antibody tests
for viruses causing pericarditis were negative. The subject was discharged home on Day 24 following vaccination and the event was
considered resolved by the end of the study period.
There were a total of 37 pregnancies reported during the study;
20 in the FluBlok group and 17 in the placebo group. Complete
follow-up information was available for 30 for them (15 in FluBlok
and 15 in placebo). Ten of the pregnancies among FluBlok and 8
among placebo recipients were uneventful and resulted in the birth
of a normal infant at 36 weeks gestation or later. Two women in the
FluBlok and three in the placebo group had associated AEs during
their pregnancy which all resolved. Elective or spontaneous abortion occurred in three and four subjects in the FluBlok and placebo
groups, respectively.
3.2. Immunogenicity
Serum HAI antibody titers before and after immunization in
FluBlok and placebo recipients are shown in Table 2. FluBlok
induced serum antibody responses to all three components of the
vaccine in the majority of recipients, although lower response rates
were seen for the influenza B component. As expected, post vaccination geometric mean titers were substantially higher for all
three components in FluBlok than in placebo recipients (P < .001
for all comparisons). The proportion of FluBlok recipients with
a post-vaccination HAI titer of 1:40 or greater was 99% for the
H1 component (95% CI, 97.1%, 99.5%), 97% for the H3 component
(94.8%, 98.3%), and 96% for the B component (94.0%, 97.8%).
Among FluBlok recipients, subjects with a self-reported history
of seasonal influenza vaccine in the year prior to the study had
higher baseline titers of antibody against allthree components, and
had significantly lower frequencies of HAI response than did those
who reported that they had not received vaccine in the previous
year. Subjects who reported prior vaccine receipt also had lower
post vaccination GMTs for all three components than did those
withoutthis history, and this difference was statistically significant
for both influenza A components.
3.3. Protective efficacy
Subjects in this study were followed throughoutthe subsequent
influenza season (mid December 2007 to end April 2008) with
weekly phone calls and instructed to return to the study clinics
for any acute respiratory illness, at which time a combined nasal
and throat swab for viral culture was obtained. The primary efficacy
endpoint for this study was the development of culture-confirmed
CDC-ILI, and we also assessed the effect of vaccination on rates of
any influenza culture positive illness.
A total of 582 subjects were cultured for respiratory illness, and
influenza virus was isolated from 178 subjects. There were a total
of 120 subjects from whom influenza A was isolated, the majority
of whom (82/120, 68%) met the CDC-ILI case definition. There were
a total of 59 subjects with positive cultures for influenza B, and the
majority of these subjects (41/59, 69%) also met the CDC-ILI case
definition.
Only 8 isolates in the study (<5% of the total) were antigenically identical to the strains contained in the vaccine. All of these
viruses were A/Wisconsin/67/2005-like H3N2 viruses. Two ofthese
occurred in FluBlok recipients and 6 occurred in placebo recipients, and among these subjects one FluBlok recipient and 5 placebo
recipients met the CDC-ILI definition. Therefore, we were unable
to obtain a meaningful estimate of the efficacy of FluBlok against
CDC-ILI due to strains represented in the vaccine.
The remaining 111 influenza A viruses were characterized as
antigenic variants, i.e., they exhibited a 4-fold or greater decrease
in reactivity with post infection ferret antisera in reciprocal HAI
testing. These viruses included 12 H1N1 viruses antigenically
resembling H1 drift variant A/Brisbane/59/2007, 41 H3N2 viruses
antigenically resembling the H3 drift variant A/Brisbane/10/2007,
42 H3N2 viruses that could not be identified as either A/Wisconsinlike or A/Brisbane-like, and 16 influenza viruses for which the
subtype was not determined. Fifty-eight of the 59 influenza B
viruses (98%) were antigenically similar to B/Florida/04/2006,
representing a different clade from the vaccine strain, and one
influenza B virus could not be antigenically characterized.
The cumulative rates of culture confirmed influenza illness
occurring in the study population over time are shown in Fig. 2,
which shows that the relative difference between the two study
groups remained constant throughout the influenza season. The
incidence of this and of other related endpoints in the study by
group are shown in Table 3. The overall protective efficacy of
FluBlok against culture positive CDC-ILI regardless of strain was
44.6% (95% CI 18.8%, 62.6%). As expected given the more extreme
degree of antigenic mismatch for the influenza B component, the
efficacy of FluBlok was greater against CDC-ILI due to influenza A
viruses (54.4%)than influenza B viruses (23.1%), although the difference was not statistically significant (P = .20 by logistic regression).
However, we were not able to demonstrate a statistically significant
effect for influenza B. As shown in Table 3, there were no substantial differences between the point estimates of efficacy against
culture positive CDC-ILI or against any culture positive illness. Culture positive CDC-ILI associated with isolation of H1N1 viruses
occurred in 9/2304 placebo recipients and 3/2344 FluBlok recipients (PE = 67%), while culture positive CDC-ILI due to H3N2 viruses

occurred in 58/2304 placebo and in 33/2344 FluBlok recipients
(PE = 44%). Overall CDC-ILI regardless of culture results occurred in
162 (7.0%) of placebo recipients and 127 (5.4%) of FluBlok recipients
for an efficacy of 22.9% (95% CI, 2.2%, 39.4%) against this outcome.
4. Discussion
In this prospective, randomized clinical trial, we evaluated the
safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of FluBlok, a trivalent recombinant hemagglutinin (rHA0) vaccine. The vaccine was well tolerated
in healthy adults, immunogenic, and protective against culture confirmed influenza illness. The safety data generated in this study
are consistent with the safety profile observed in other studies of

rHA0 vaccine produced using the baculovirus expression system
in healthy adults [9]. These vaccines have been well tolerated at all
doses administered, and are associated with low rates of local reactions. One case of pericarditis was detected in a FluBlok recipient.
Pericarditis has also been reported previously following vaccination with licensed, egg-derived influenza vaccine with a similar
time course [11]. The mechanism and clinical significance of such
an association is unclear.
FluBlok induced serum HAI antibody responses to all three vaccine components in the majority of recipients, and the lower limit
of the 95% confidence interval for response rate exceeded the US
FDA criteria for licensure for all three components (lower limit of
the 95% confidence interval for response rate >40% and lower limit
of the 95% confidence interval for HAI titer of 1:40 or greater >70%)
[12].
Although we did not attempt to verify vaccine histories by
review of medical records, significant differences in both the frequency and the magnitude of the HAI response were shown when
comparing the immune response between subjects with selfreported previous vaccination. Reduced antibody response rates,
decreased post vaccination titers, and decreased antibody secreting cell responses have all been observed previously in adults with
prior influenza vaccine compared to those without [13–16]. The
exact mechanism of this effect remains uncertain, although it may
represent interference with antigen presentation by pre-existing
antibody [16].
Consistent with the results of national surveillance in the US
during the 2007–2008 season [17], the majority of influenza A
viruses detected in this study were H3N2 viruses that represented
a substantial antigenic mismatch with the vaccine. However, even
under these circumstances, FluBlok had significant protective efficacy against culture-confirmed influenza illness, including those
meeting the CDC-ILI case definition. Influenza B viruses isolated in
this study and elsewhere in North America during the 2007–2008
season belonged to the Yamagata lineage of influenza B viruses,
against which vaccines representing the Victoria lineage would be
expected to have little or no efficacy. We also found that the efficacy of FluBlok against CDC-ILI associated with influenza B was
substantially lower than that against influenza A.
Comparisons of these results with the results of other
assessments of the protective efficacy of influenza vaccines are
complicated by differences in methodologies, populations, and
antigenic match between vaccine and circulating strains in the
specific year that studies are carried out. Two recently published
studies have evaluated egg-grown inactivated vaccines in healthy
adults using a placebo-controlled design during the 2007–2008
influenza season. In one study, conducted primarily in Europe, the
overall efficacy of egg-grown inactivated vaccine against culture
confirmed illness was 63%, and the lower 95% CI was 46.7% [18]. The
predominant influenza A isolates in that study were H1N1 viruses,
which were mostly vaccine-like. In another smaller study done on
college campuses in Michigan [19], the protective efficacy of TIV
against culture confirmed illness was 73% (95% CI, 51%, 85%). In
that study, 90% of influenza isolates were influenza A (H3N2), but
the antigenic characterization of isolates was not reported. In other
recent randomized trials, the protective efficacy of TIV was 22.3%
in the 2005–2006 influenza season predominated by influenza B
viruses and with overall low attack rates [20], and 49.3% over two
seasons, 2005–2007 with most cases due to antigenically variant
viruses [21].
Because of the difficulty in conducting placebo-controlled
studies of influenza vaccine especially as the target groups for vaccination have expanded, several recent assessments of influenza
vaccine effectiveness have utilized a test-negative, case–control
design. Estimates of overall inactivated vaccine protective effectiveness in these studies have ranged from 10% to 70% [22–25] and
7738 J.J. Treanor et al. / Vaccine 29 (2011) 7733–7739
are clearly impacted by antigenic differences between vaccine and
circulating viruses, with highest levels of effectiveness reported for
H1 viruses [25] and lowest levels for influenza B.
The current study provides evidence of protective efficacy of
a baculovirus-derived HA vaccine in adults for prevention of seasonal influenza and supports that significant protection in a primed
population can be obtained against influenza with a pure hemagglutinin vaccine. The efficacy results also demonstrate that in
adults,the minor differences in HA glycosylation seen in insect cells
compared to mammalian cells and the synthesis of the HA as an
uncleaved precursor do not preclude the generation of an effective
immune response in adults.
The use of recombinant DNA techniques to express proteins
in cell culture has been a successful approach for generation of
highly effective vaccines for the prevention of hepatitis B (HBV)
and human papillomavirus (HPV), and baculovirus expression technology is currently used for a licensed HPV vaccine [26]. Among
the available expression technologies, recombinant baculovirus is
especially well suited for production of influenza vaccine because
the rapidity with which genes can be cloned and inserted into this
vector facilitates updating the vaccine at regular intervals. Expression ofthe HA protein in insect cells using recombinant baculovirus
also avoids the need to work with potentially pathogenic, live
influenza viruses, and the attendant biocontainment issues that
would be a particular concern for production of pandemic vaccines
[27]. The results of the current study support the utility of insect
cells for the production of well tolerated and effective vaccines for
seasonal influenza.
