An attenuated influenza virus vaccine (not sensitive to equine serum) was administered intranasally by nose drops and was effective in stimulating significant rises
in both serum and nasal antibody and in protecting against subsequent challenge
with virulent influenza virus. Vaccine virus was not transmitted from immunized
volunteers to a control group. Clinical symptoms after immunization were very
mild but were significantly more frequent in vaccinees than in members of the
control group.
In 1940 Francis first suggested that local mechanisms in the respiratory tract might play a role
in protection against influenza [1]. Fazekas de
St. Groth and Donnelly showed in mice that local
antibody levels correlated better than serum antibody levels with protection against influenza [2].
More recent studies have demonstrated that local
administration of killed influenza vaccine stimulates higher levels of local antibody than does sc
administration [3-5].
An increase in local and serum antibody and
protection against challenge with virulent influenza virus have also been demonstrated with
attenuated virus vaccines [6-14]. Live influenza
virus vaccines might be superior to inactivated
vaccines because virus multiplies in the respiratory
mucosa, thereby possibly stimulating greater local
immunity [3]. Unfortunately, clinical reactions,

although usually mild, have been reported frequently with attenuated vaccines [6, 10, 12, 14].
To evaluate the usefulness of an attenuated
influenza virus vaccine, we examined the following
parameters: (1) reactogenicity, measured by
clinical symptoms and signs observed following
immunization; (2) immunogenicity, measured by
increase in serum and local antibody; (3) transmissibility, measured by isolation of virus and
rise in titer of antibody in matched controls
placed in isolation with vaccinees following immunization; and (4) protective efficacy, measured
by resistance to challenge with virulent influenza
virus.
The attenuated vaccine strain we tested has as
its primary laboratory characteristic the loss of
sensitivity to equine serum [6]. Beare and Bynoe
have shown that influenza strains that are resistant
to serum inhibitors are generally attenuated for
the human host [15]. Moreover, this characteristic appears to be stable on passage in eggs, tissue
culture, laboratory animals, and humans, and is
a convenient virologic marker for clinical studies
and for production of vaccine [6].
Materials and Methods
Volunteers. Thirty-seven volunteers with titers of serum neutralizing antibody to A/Hong
Kong/8/68 (H3N2) of 1: 16 were selected.
Volunteers were of both sexes and aged 18-24
years.
Vaccine. The vaccine consisted of 104 TCID50/
0.5 ml of A/England/8/68 (H3N2) influenza
Attenuated Influenza Virus Vaccine
virus that was resistant to equine serum and was
obtained from Smith, Kline & French Laboratories (Philadelphia, Pa.). The vaccine was
produced by Recherche et Industrie Therapeutiques, Brussels, Belgium, from the strain
A2/England/878/69, and grown in embryonated
specific pathogen-free hen's eggs in increasing
concentrations of heated equine serum.
Specimens. We attempted to isolate virus
from throat gargle material twice daily for five
days after immunization and challenge; the procedure for isolation involved inoculation in duplicate of Rhesus monkey kidney tissue cultures.
After 72 hr, 0.2 ml of the tissue culture fluid was
passed into fresh culture tubes. Presence of virus
was indicated by hemadsorption with guinea pig
red blood cells at the time of passage and after
72 hr in the "blind passage" tubes.
Nasal washings and specimens of serum were
obtained before each immunization, before challenge, and 14 days after challenge. Activity
of hemadsorption-inhibition-neutralizing antibody
was determined [16].
Immunization. After a medical history had
been obtained, physical examination performed,
and informed consent given, volunteers were
paired according to age and sex and immunized
with nose drops in a double-blind fashion. One
individual in each pair received the vaccine, and
the other received 0.85% NaC!. Each pair was
admitted to a room in the Clinical Research
Center, Shands Teaching Hospital, University of
Florida, for four days, beginning 24 hr after
immunization. During hospitalization the pair was
observed for clinical symptoms and signs of influenza infection and isolation of virus. Two to three
weeks later the booster dose of vaccine was given,
and the entire procedure was repeated.
Challenge. Two to four months after immunization, volunteers were challenged with a virulent strain of A/Hong Kong/l/68 (H3N2) influenza virus kindly supplied by Dr. Y. Togo
(University of Maryland School of Medicine,
Baltimore, Md.) [17]. Pairs of volunteers were
placed in isolation in the Clinical Research Center
and given 105 TCID50 of the virulent strain by
nose drops.
Clinical evaluation. Twice daily (after immunization and challenge), each volunteer was given
an appropriate physical examination and was
381
questioned about presence of fever, myalgia,
rhinitis, pharyngitis, and cough. The examiner
was not aware of which volunteer had received
vaccine and which had received NaCl. Volunteers
were considered ill if they had a febrile respiratory infection or if they had obvious signs and
symptoms of a respiratory infection.
Results
There was no significant difference between the
mean age (22.6 and 21.5 years), titer of antibody before immunization, (1: 12 and 1: 10) and
distribution by sex (eight males of 19 and eight
males of 18) of those who had received vaccine
and these variables in those who had received
NaC!, respectively.
The clinical reactions after each immunization
were mild (table 1). There was no significant difference between groups in the number of volunteers with symptoms (P> 0.05, X2 test); however,
the total number of symptoms observed in the
vaccine group after the first immunization was
significantly greater than that in the placebo
group (P < 0.05).
Influenza virus was isolated from throat gargle
material only once in the placebo group after the
first immunization. The isolated virus was not of
the vaccine strain and thus probably represented
chance infection, since it would not grow in the
presence of 10% equine serum and was best neutralized by antiserum against recent isolates of A/
England/73 (H3N2) influenza virus. There was
also a rise in titer of nasal and serum antibody in
this individual. Virus was not isolated and titers
of antibody did not rise after the second immuniTable 1. Side effects of immunization with A/England/8/68 (H3N2) influenza virus vaccine.

zation in any subject who received placebo. Vaccine virus was isolated from throat gargle material
of four volunteers in the vaccine group after the
first immunization. All exhibited the characteristic
resistance to equine serum.
Thirteen of the 19 vaccinees showed at least a
fourfold rise in serum antibody, and 15 had at
least a fourfold rise in nasal antibody (table 2).
All 13 volunteers with a rise in serum antibody
also had a rise in nasal antibody. Of the group
that received a placebo, only one of 18 had a
significant rise in serum and/or nasal antibody
(significantly different from the vaccine group,
P < 0.05). Levels of nasal antibody in general
were low, but the mean rise in nasal antibody in
the vaccine group was eightfold.
After challenge with virulent influenza virus,
one of 19 vaccinees had symptoms and signs of
illness, as compared with seven of 18 in the placebo group. Only one vaccinee had a significant
rise in nasal and/or serum antibody after challenge, while 16 in the placebo group had a significant rise in serum antibody, and 10 had a significant rise in nasal antibody (P < 0.05). Influenza
virus was isolated from throat gargle material of
four individuals in the placebo group and in none
of the vaccinees (0.10> P > 0.05).
Discussion
This candidate attenuated influenza vaccine appears to result in a low rate of clinical reaction.
While 30% of those who received vaccine had
some symptoms after the first immunization, so
did 16% of the controls, and the difference is not
statistically significant. The total number of symptoms among vaccinees after the first immunization
was, however, significantly different from the
number of symptoms among controls. Although
frequent, symptoms were very mild, corresponding to previous findings reported with other attenuated vaccines [6, 10, 12-14]. The incidence of
Lauteria et al,
symptoms was lower than is generally reported
with killed vaccines administered sc (when pain
at the site of injection is included) but probably
higher than that reported with inactivated intranasal vaccines when compared with values for
controls [4, 12, 18, 19]. Coryza was reported
more frequently than any other symptom; this has
also been the case with other attenuated vaccines
[6, 10, 13].
The vaccine virus was isolated relatively infrequently from the vaccinees, i.e., in about 25% of
them. This low level of viral shedding might be
considered in two ways: as a bad feature, representing a low level of viral replication in the vaccinees, or as a good feature, since there would be
less chance of transmission to those not vaccinated. Low transmissibility is desirable, since studies of attenuated influenza infection in groups at
high risk (the very old or the very young, patients
with cardiopulmonary disease, etc.) have not yet
been done, and it is therefore necessary that these
groups be protected from accidental infection until the vaccine is demonstrated to be safe. In addition, and perhaps more importantly, wide dissemination among a large number of unselected hosts
could increase the chance of reversion to virulence
of an attenuated virus. In our study there was no
evidence for transmission of vaccine virus when
volunteers who had received the vaccine and placebo were isolated together in a hospital room for
four days. However, conditions for transmission
were not optimal since none of the volunteers was
antibody-free, conditions were not crowded, hygiene was good, and both individuals in each pair
were of the same sex.
After immunization 68% of the vaccinees had
a significant rise in serum antibody, and 80% had
a rise in nasal antibody; this compares favorably
with other attenuated influenza vaccines [10, 12,
13, 20]. The titers of nasal antibody were low, as
has been reported with other attenuated vaccines
[12, 20]. After infection with virulent virus, howTable 2. Antibody response after immunizationwith A/England/8/68 (H3N2) influenza virus vaccine.

ever, the mean titer of neutralizing antibody was
only slightly higher (not statistically significant);
thus, the low titers of nasal antibody probably do
not reflect low immunogenicity, but reflect instead
the methodology of obtaining and assaying the
specimens.
The final arbiter of the usefulness of any vaccine is its ability to protect against virulent infection. In the present study, the protective efficacy
was 86% as measured by clinical symptoms. The
protection rate was even greater if it is considered
with respect to bath clinical and subclinical infection. In the placebo group, 89% were infected
(as ascertained by rise in serum antibody after
challenge), while only 5% of the vaccine group
were infected. This represents a protection rate of
94%. Thus, an attenuated vaccine proved to be
very effective in protection against infection and
illness.
