An increased incidence of narcolepsy in children was detected in Scandinavian countries where pandemic H1N1 influenza ASO3-
adjuvanted vaccine was used. A campaign of vaccination against pandemic H1N1 influenza was implemented in France using
both ASO3-adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted vaccines. As part of a study considering all-type narcolepsy, we investigated the
association between H1N1 vaccination and narcolepsy with cataplexy in children and adults compared with matched controls;
and compared the phenotype of narcolepsy with cataplexy according to exposure to the H1N1 vaccination. Patients with
narcolepsy-cataplexy were included from 14 expert centres in France. Date of diagnosis constituted the index date.
Validation of cases was performed by independent experts using the Brighton collaboration criteria. Up to four controls were
individually matched to cases according to age, gender and geographic location. A structured telephone interview was

performed to collect information on medical history, past infections and vaccinations. Eighty-five cases with narcolepsy-cataplexy were included; 23 being further excluded regarding eligibility criteria. Of the 62 eligible cases, 59 (64% males, 57.6%
children) could be matched with 135 control subjects. H1N1 vaccination was associated with narcolepsy-cataplexy with an odds
ratio of 6.5 (2.1–19.9) in subjects aged 518 years, and 4.7 (1.6–13.9) in those aged 18 and over. Sensitivity analyses considering date of referral for diagnosis or the date of onset of symptoms as the index date gave similar results, as did analyses
focusing only on exposure to ASO3-adjuvanted vaccine. Slight differences were found when comparing cases with narcolepsycataplexy exposed to H1N1 vaccination (n = 32; mostly AS03-adjuvanted vaccine, n = 28) to non-exposed cases (n = 30), including shorter delay of diagnosis and a higher number of sleep onset rapid eye movement periods for exposed cases. No difference
was found regarding history of infections. In this sub-analysis, H1N1 vaccination was strongly associated with an increased risk
of narcolepsy-cataplexy in both children and adults in France. Even if, as in every observational study, the possibility that some
biases participated in the association cannot be completely ruled out, the associations appeared robust to sensitivity analyses,
and a specific analysis focusing on ASO3-adjuvanted vaccine found similar increase.

Introduction
Narcolepsy with cataplexy is a disabling orphan disorder caused by
a loss of hypothalamic hypocretin/orexin-producing neurons with
the main peak of disease onset at 16 years of age (Dauvilliers
et al., 2001, 2007). An autoimmune basis for narcolepsy-cataplexy
has long been suspected based on the tight association with HLADRB1*15:01-DQB1*06:02 haplotype, T cell receptor alpha and
purinergic receptor P2RY11 polymorphisms (Mignot et al., 2001;
Hallmayer et al., 2009; Hor et al., 2010; Kornum et al., 2011a),
the presence of elevated Tribbles homolog 2 and anti-streptolysin
O antibodies (Aran et al., 2009; Cvetkovic-Lopes et al., 2010), the
low vitamin D levels (Carlander et al., 2011), and the positive
effect of intravenous IgG to normalize CSF hypocretin-1 level in
a single patient (Dauvilliers et al., 2009). However, the precise
aetiology of narcolepsy-cataplexy remains unknown with both
genetic and environmental factors playing a major role
(Dauvilliers et al., 2007; Kornum et al., 2011b).
In early 2010, an increased incidence of narcolepsy was detected in children in Finland and Sweden where pandemic H1N1
influenza vaccine (Pandemrix containing adjuvant ASO3, squalene and alphatocopherol) was used (THL, 2010; MPA Sweden,
2011; Nohynek et al., 2012; Partinen et al., 2012). We reported
some cases with narcolepsy-cataplexy from France, Canada and
the USA using the ASO3-adjuvanted H1N1 vaccine, some cases
using non-adjuvanted vaccine and some cases who developed
narcolepsy-cataplexy after H1N1 infection (Dauvilliers et al.,
2010). Recent studies confirmed the increased childhood/adolescent incidence rate of narcolepsy in western Sweden, England and
Ireland after the H1N1 Pandemrix vaccination campaign
(National Narcolepsy Study Steering Committee, 2012; Miller
et al., 2013; Szaka´ cs et al., 2013). The majority of these did not
consider the adult population.
A large increase of childhood cases with narcolepsy-cataplexy
was reported after the winter of 2009–2010 in China, independent of vaccination (Han et al., 2011). In South Korea no increase
was seen in the incidence rate of narcolepsy after the H1N1
vaccination campaign using non-adjuvanted and MF59-
adjuvanted H1N1 vaccines (Choe et al., 2012).
Differences exist in the rates of pandemic H1N1 vaccination in
the general population across the different countries and according
to the age group (children versus adults), the presence of adjuvanted versus non-adjuvanted vaccine, and the adjuvant ASO3 or
not, that preclude any definitive conclusion on the real risk of narcolepsy after H1N1 vaccine exposure. In 2010, the European Centre
for Disease Controls (ECDC) funded a multinational case-control
study in eight European countries coordinated by the Vaccine
Adverse Event Surveillance and Communication (VAESCO) consortium (ECDC, 2012) to study the association between all-type narcolepsy and H1N1 vaccination. In this context, the French drug
agency (Agence Nationale de Se´curite´ du Me´dicament et des
produits de sante´, ANSM) co-funded a study in France, NarcofluVF, to contribute both to the VAESCO study and to pursue specific
objectives. These specificities in design and objective consisted of a
longer period of recruitment (up to April 2011), and in a sub-analysis focusing on the risk of narcolepsy-cataplexy.
From October 2009 to February 2010, a campaign of vaccination against H1N1 influenza targeting all subjects was implemented in France, with swine flu vaccine administered to 5.7
million individuals. Of these, 4.1 million were vaccinated with
Pandemrix and 1.6 million with Panenza (non-adjuvanted vaccine). Panenza was indicated for the vaccination of children aged
524 months (then extended to children 59 years), pregnant females and immunocompromised patients. The final population
coverage was estimated at 8.8% at the end of the vaccination
campaign. Panenza was used in 90% of the vaccinated aged
59 years and Pandemrix in 89% of the vaccinated aged 59
years (data obtained from ANSM).
The aim of the sub-analysis of the Narcoflu-VF study presented
here was (i) to investigate the association between pandemic
H1N1 vaccination and narcolepsy-cataplexy in both children and
adults compared with gender-, age- and geographic locationmatched controls in France; and (ii) to compare the phenotype
of cases with narcolepsy-cataplexy according to exposure to
H1N1 vaccination.

Materials and methods
The Narcoflu-VF study is a multicentre case-control study performed in
the institutions of 14 French expert orphan disease narcolepsy centres
being easily identifiable by professionals and patients, which has
allowed a specialized homogeneous care for both diagnosis and management of patients with narcolepsy in France. The information provided when the study was proposed to patients specified that the
study aimed to investigate narcolepsy risk factors and potential associations with infections, medical drug use, and vaccinations. No specific emphasis was put on H1N1 vaccination, to limit the possibility of
a participation bias related to this specific exposure. The protocol was
approved by the research scientific committee of the ANSM and the
Bordeaux hospital ethics committee. All subjects gave written informed
consent to participate.
Recruitment of cases with
narcolepsy-cataplexy
Patients with narcolepsy-cataplexy were referred to one of the participating sleep centres to confirm the diagnosis by polysomnography as
well as the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) between 1 October
2009 and 30 April 2011. Diagnosis of narcolepsy-cataplexy was established using the revised International Classification of Sleep Disorders
(ICSD, 2005). All patients presented excessive daytime sleepiness, typical cataplexy, at least two sleep-onset REM periods and a mean sleep
latency 58 min during the MSLT. The date retained as the main index
date for the analysis was the date of polysomnography-MSLT confirmed diagnosis. Participating centres identified retrospectively from
lists of medical records completed by reference centres for orphan
diseases as required by the French government and from hospital statistic databases all their patients with narcolepsy-cataplexy potentially
matching the eligibility criteria. All potentially eligible cases were asked
to participate.
All cases agreeing to participate were validated using the Brighton
collaboration criteria by an expert committee to fully confirm the diagnosis of typical narcolepsy-cataplexy (Poli et al., 2012). Two experts
from the committee were assigned to assess each case, and a third one
solicited in case of discrepancy. The investigator who included the case
could not be an expert for the validation of the case to maintain
blinding and objective assessment. Brighton case definition level 1
included the presence of excessive daytime sleepiness and/or unambiguous cataplexy, and CSF hypocretin-1 deficiency; and level 2
included the presence of excessive daytime sleepiness, unambiguous
cataplexy, and abnormal MSLT including either mean sleep latency
58 min (or 12 min for children) or at least two sleep-onset REM periods. Subjects classified with levels 3 and 4 (less degree of reliability of
narcolepsy-cataplexy) were excluded from the study.
Only confirmed cases of narcolepsy-cataplexy for whom the
date of onset of symptoms—either excessive daytime sleepiness
or cataplexy—was after 1 January 2005, and after the date of
H1N1 vaccination for exposed cases, were included in the main
analysis.
Recruitment of control subjects
Up to four control subjects were individually matched to each case
according to sex, age (year of birth  2 years) and geographic location
during the same recruitment period. Control subjects were recruited
from: (i) patients from the hospitals to which the participating sleep
centres belonged; and (ii) healthy volunteers from a national database
(Narcobank).
For hospital controls, the reason for healthcare requirement had to
be unrelated to narcolepsy or pandemic H1N1 vaccination. The reason
for this eligibility criterion was to obtain a population of hospital controls that would not exclusively represent patients with specific indication to H1N1 vaccination or contraindication to it. It was specified not
to recruit controls from departments that specialized in the treatment
of patients for which H1N1-vaccination was especially recommended
(e.g. departments specialized in the management of AIDS, and immunocompromised patients). However, if a control subject admitted
for surgery had a history of asthma, she/he was considered eligible.
No patient was eliminated on the basis of the presence of a specific
historical condition; the recruitment procedure was only thought to
avoid constituting a population of controls in which vaccination rate
would have been specifically affected by a recommendation targeting
a condition that would have been over-represented in the recruitment
department (e.g. recruitment of controls in a Chronic Obstructive
Pulmonary Disease management department).
Narcobank is a study financed by a national research programme
from the French Health Ministry in 2007 with aims to study biomarkers and genetic risk factors of narcolepsy and other rare central
hypersomnias. All subjects (patients and healthy controls matched for
age and gender) were recruited between 2008 and 2010 from five
sleep centres, all participating to the Narcoflu-VF study. The population of Narcobank was recruited without considering exposure to
H1N1 vaccination. Some cases with narcolepsy-cataplexy may have
participated in both Narcoflu-VF and Narcobank. The recruitment of
control subjects from Narcobank mainly concerns these cases.
Data collection
All subjects were recruited by investigators before information on
H1N1 vaccination status was collected. They were contacted for a
standardized telephone interview to collect data on body mass
index, smoking, medical history, history of viral or bacterial infections,
and history of vaccinations. Date and type of all vaccines performed
between January 2005 and index date were collected including seasonal flu, pandemic H1N1 vaccinations (Pandemrix or Panenza),
and no-flu vaccinations. Excessive daytime sleepiness was assessed
using the Epworth scale for adults (Johns, 1991), and the Paediatric
Daytime Sleepiness Scale for children (Drake et al., 2003). Patients had
to have their medical booklet and vaccination certificate (a further
interview was scheduled if the patient did not have them). This
ensured complete information for most patients concerning type of
vaccine and date of vaccination. However, this could not be ascertained for some participants. For these, the type of vaccine was considered ‘undocumented’, and the date of vaccination was the reported
month and year of vaccination, day being set at the first of the month.
A procedure of exception was retained for the H1N1 vaccination campaign in France; purpose vaccination centres were opened, in limited
number, to which patients were called-up by mail; being vaccinated
implicated an individual voluntary step and prolonged wait. For these
reasons, patient knowledge on this specific vaccination appear reliable
at least for the fact of being vaccinated and the period of vaccination,
even if vaccination type and exact date were considered only when
they could be certified according to information from the medical
booklet or the additional H1N1 vaccination certificate.
Information on the characteristics of narcolepsy-cataplexy was collected from medical records. It included index date, date of referral for
MSLT, symptoms severity and date of onset, polysomnography and

MSLT results, HLA typing, and CSF hypocretin-1 concentration when
available.
Date of onset of symptoms was obtained from patients. As it can be
difficult to assess, patients were asked to report the period of onset of
their first symptoms (month and year of beginning and ending of this
period). Cases reporting vaccination were thus classified as follows for
the main and sensitivity analysis: (i) first symptoms after vaccination
(i.e. left margin of the first symptoms onset period after vaccination
date, at least in the following month if day unknown, most cases):
cases considered exposed for all analyses; and (ii) first symptoms
before vaccination or potentially concomitant (i.e. right margin of
the first symptoms onset period before vaccination date, at least in
the following month if day unknown, most cases or insufficient precision to exclude anteriority of first symptoms to vaccination): cases
excluded from the analyses on date of diagnosis and date of referral
for MSLT, and considered as non-exposed for analyses on date of first
symptom onset.
Statistical analysis
Characteristics of cases and controls were compared in univariate analyses using Mc-Nemar Chi2 test for qualitative variables and Student ttest for paired series for quantitative variables (or non-parametric
Wilcoxon test when Student t-test could not be used). The association
between H1N1 vaccination and narcolepsy-cataplexy was estimated
using conditional logistic regression models; it was expressed using
odds ratios and their 95% confidence intervals (CI). Variables were
included in the multivariate models if they were associated with narcolepsy-cataplexy with P50.25 after univariate analyses. They were
considered in the final model if they were associated with narcolepsycataplexy with P50.2 or found responsible for confounding or H1N1
vaccination effect modification. Association was estimated for the
whole population, by age category (518 or 518 years at index
date), and by time period of the date of diagnosis. Sensitivity analyses
were performed that considered as index date (i) the date of referral
for polysomnography-MSLT; and (ii) the date of first symptom onset.
Characteristics of exposed and non-exposed cases contributing to any
of these analyses were compared using Chi2 test or exact Fisher test
for qualitative variables and Student t-test or non-parametric MannWhitney Wilcoxon test for quantitative variables.
Additional analyses were performed: (i) an analysis including cases
with narcolepsy-cataplexy that were excluded from the main analysis
because their date of onset of symptoms was before the date of H1N1
vaccination. In this additional analysis, these were considered as nonexposed; and (ii) an analysis considering only exposure to AS03-adjuvanted vaccine. All cases exposed to other H1N1 vaccines and their
matched controls, as well as controls exposed to other or undocumented H1N1 vaccines were excluded from this analysis.
We used SAS 9.3 for Windows (SAS Institute Inc). All reported
P-values are two-tailed, with a significance level set at 0.05.
Results
Of the 177 cases with narcolepsy (all types considered) initially
contacted to participate to the full Narcoflu-VF study, 127 responded and agreed to participate. Of these, 85 were confirmed
cases with narcolepsy-cataplexy and were initially included, with
23 patients later excluded from the main analysis based on index
date ineligibility or onset of symptoms starting before H1N1 vaccination (Fig. 1). Among the 62 remaining eligible cases, 66.1%
were males, median age was 15.3 years (range 5–51 years), and
35 (56.5%) were 518 years of age. CSF hypocretin-1 was available in 24 patients, all with levels 5110 pg/ml. All cases were
validated using the Brighton classification showing level 1 in
37.1% and level 2 in 62.9%.
Of the 62 eligible cases with narcolepsy-cataplexy, 59 could be
matched to 135 control subjects, with regards to sex, year of birth
and geographic area (Fig. 1 and Table 1). If body mass index was
higher in cases, no significant difference was found between cases
and controls for smoking (either personal or in relatives), age at
puberty onset, medical history of diabetes, asthma, migraine, head
trauma, cancer or familial history of autoimmune diseases.
We studied the history of infections and vaccinations between 1
January 2005 and the index date (Table 2). No between-group
differences were found regarding the frequency of history of infectious episodes (Epstein-Barr virus streptococcal, upper respiratory or gastrointestinal tract infections or flu-like episodes),
seasonal influenza or non-flu vaccinations. Conversely, pandemic
H1N1 vaccination was found in 31 cases (27 Pandemrix and four
Panenza) and 24 controls (17 Pandemrix, one Panenza, and
six unknown) (52.5% versus 17.8%, P5104
).
H1N1 vaccination was associated with narcolepsy-cataplexy
with an odds ratio of 5.5 (95% CI 2.5–12.0) when considering
the whole population over the complete study period. When considering patients 518 years of age and their matched controls, the
odds ratio was estimated at 6.5 (95% CI 2.1–19.9), and 4.7 (95%
CI 1.6–13.9) in those aged 18 and over. For cases with a diagnosis
date before July 2010 and matched controls, the odds ratio was
estimated at 2.8 (95% CI 0.8–10.5); it was estimated at odds ratio
7.6 (95% CI 2.8–20.8) for those with a later index date. In this
analysis, after running multivariate models, H1N1 vaccination was
the only study variable associated with narcolepsy-cataplexy with
P 50.2 or found responsible for confounding or H1N1 vaccination
effect modification (Table 3). Sensitivity analyses using different
index dates found similar results (Table 3), as well as additional
analyses considering cases with narcolepsy-cataplexy with date of
first symptoms onset before the date of H1N1 vaccination as nonexposed, and considering only exposition to AS03-adjuvanted vaccine (Table 4).
As some healthcare professionals were included in the volunteer
controls (n = 36), with theoretically increased risk of being vaccinated, we differentiated the rate of vaccination between healthcare control subjects and other control subjects (35.5% versus
8.7% of corresponding cases, P 5103
). Excluding healthcare
professional controls from the analysis did not change the estimates in children but led to the model not converging in adults.
We further compared among the 62 cases with narcolepsy-cataplexy, those exposed to H1N1 vaccination (n = 32 including 28
with Pandemrix) to those unexposed (Table 5). Median delay
between vaccination and onset of excessive daytime sleepiness
was 2.5 months [interquartile range (IQR) 1.2–4.5], with cataplexy
onset 4.5 months (IQR: 1.6–8.1), and with diagnosis of narcolepsy-cataplexy 10.6 months (IQR: 8.5–13.4). The mean delay
between narcolepsy-cataplexy onset (either excessive daytime
sleepiness or cataplexy) and its diagnosis was shorter in exposed
versus non-exposed cases, together with shorter delay between
onset of excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy. However,

these differences did not remain significant when considering only
cases with a similar period of onset of first symptoms (i.e. 51
October 2009) (Table 5). No significant difference was found between exposed and non-exposed cases regarding gender, age at
time of diagnosis, positive familial history of narcolepsy-cataplexy,
and period of recruitment (before or after 1 July 2010). Severity of
narcolepsy-cataplexy assessed clinically through Epworth scale or
Paediatric Daytime Sleepiness Scale for excessive daytime sleepiness, frequency of cataplexy at baseline, presence of generalized
cataplexy with fall, hypnagogic hallucination or sleep paralysis,

nocturnal agitation or body mass index did not differ between
groups. Polysomnography recordings revealed similar total sleep
time, REM sleep latency and percentage of patients with apnea/
hypopnea index 415/h between groups. We reported a slightly
higher number of sleep onset REM periods in exposed patients
without any change for the mean sleep latency (Table 5). No
between group differences were found for HLA DQB1*06:02 reported in 92% of vaccinated versus 85.2% in non-vaccinated
cases. CSF hypocretin-1 levels were assessed more frequently in
exposed (n = 19) compared to non-exposed (n = 5) cases; but all
values were 5110 pg/ml.
Discussion
We report the first study showing an association between pandemic H1N1 vaccination and narcolepsy-cataplexy by an odds
ratio up to 6-fold in children (518 years) and 5-fold in adults
(518 years). Sensitivity analyses taking into account either date
of referral for MSLT or date of onset of first symptoms did
not change the results. Furthermore, we found almost no
difference when comparing the characteristics of cases with narcolepsy-cataplexy exposed to H1N1 vaccination (mostly
Pandemrix) with non-exposed cases, except for a shorter delay
of diagnosis and higher number of sleep onset REM periods in
exposed cases. No differences were found regarding the frequency
of history of infections.
After the 2009–2010 H1N1 flu pandemic and related vaccination campaigns, an increased risk of narcolepsy after vaccination
was reported, particularly in Scandinavian children—especially in
Finland and Sweden—characterized by a high coverage of
Pandemrix vaccination (THL, 2010; MPA Sweden, 2011); the
results from Finland, but also more recently those from western
Sweden, England and Ireland, showed a particular increase of narcolepsy-cataplexy in children (National Narcolepsy Study Steering
Committee, 2012; Nohynek et al., 2012; Partinen et al., 2012;
Miller et al., 2013; Szaka´ cs et al., 2013). We previously reported
the first cases with narcolepsy-cataplexy from France and Canada
using the similar adjuvanted H1N1 vaccine (Dauvilliers et al.,
2010). This study confirms the initial signs from France showing
an association between narcolepsy-cataplexy and H1N1 vaccine,
mostly represented by Pandemrix, and shows a similar increased
risk in vaccinated children and adults; the increased risk for adults
being previously unreported. Our findings also show that narcolepsy-cataplexy post-H1N1 exposure is almost similar to genuine
narcolepsy-cataplexy.
Monozygotic twin narcolepsy-cataplexy studies have suggested
that environmental factors play a major role in narcolepsy-cataplexy pathophysiology (Dauvilliers et al., 2004). Recent data reported a large increase in onset of childhood cases with
narcolepsy-cataplexy after the winter of 2009–2010 in China, together with a seasonality of disease onset (Han et al., 2011).
These findings suggested a role of the influenza pandemic
H1N1-infection independently of any vaccination, with data showing a decreased incidence the following year (Han et al., 2012).

Associations between streptococcus infections and recent onset
cases of narcolepsy-cataplexy were also reported with large frequency of high levels of serum antibodies against streptolysin O
(65%) within 1 year of onset compared with age-matched controls (26%) (Aran et al., 2009). We did not find such associations
with flu infection symptoms, streptococcal, upper respiratory or
gastrointestinal tract infections, but also not with non-H1N1 flu
vaccines in our study.
This study has several strengths. First, each case was validated
independently by two experts blind to the vaccination status and
who had not been involved in the case recruitment. This validation
used the Brighton classification criteria (Poli et al., 2012), thus
misclassification of cases is unlikely to have occurred. Second, to
allow for consideration of cases who, after the exposure period,
would have had a longer time to develop symptoms and be diagnosed with narcolepsy-cataplexy, we decided to consider a longer
period of recruitment after the vaccination campaign than that
retained in the VAESCO protocol (ECDC, 2012). Indeed, the
delay between onset of first symptoms and diagnosis can be
very long in narcolepsy, usually 8–10 years (Morrish et al.,
2004; Dauvilliers et al., 2007). However, it is possible that only
the abrupt onset and the most severely exposed cases were
identified, as indicated by the larger proportion of subjects 518
years of age in the vaccinated cases (65.6% versus 46.7%). In
contrast, we could not detect major differences in disease severity
between exposed and non-exposed cases with either clinical or
polysomnography evaluations but we did detect a higher
number of sleep onset REM periods in exposed cases, as reported
in early-onset cases with narcolepsy-cataplexy in China (Han
et al., 2012). To prevent the impact of professional/media attention on the rate of narcolepsy-cataplexy recognition, we analysed
the results taking into account the recruitment period of date of
diagnosis, date of referral for MSLT and date of onset of symptoms before and after 1 July 2010. Results did not vary significantly between analyses, but were not significant for the period
before July 2010 when considering diagnosis date as the index
date. Although this could indicate a potential media effect, it
may also reflect the fact that time to diagnosis is, by essence,
longer than time to first symptoms or to MSLT referral, for
which the association remained significant for the same period.
Another strength of this study was the recruitment of patients
from expert narcolepsy sleep centres specifically created by the
national government plan for orphan diseases, to which patients
suspected of having narcolepsy are usually referred. In those centres, all eligible patients were identified from medical files and
hospital statistic databases, and contacted to participate; thus limiting the possibility of a selection bias. After the initial diagnosis
was made using ISCD criteria (2005), all cases were validated by
an expert committee using the Brighton collaboration criteria (Poli
et al., 2012). As narcolepsy-cataplexy and narcolepsy without
cataplexy are two individualized diseases with different pathophysiology in 80% of cases (normal CSF hypocretin-1 levels
and no association with HLA DQB1*06:02 in the latter condition)
(ICSD, 2005; Andlauer et al., 2012), we decided to focus in this
analysis on patients with typical cataplexy to constitute a more
specific and homogeneous group. However, during the same recruitment period 22 patients with narcolepsy without cataplexy
were diagnosed in France and included in the French participation
of the VAESCO analysis, three of whom had been vaccinated
against H1N1 (all with Pandemrix) before the first onset of
symptoms.
The study has several limitations. First, we had a limited number
of cases even with regards the rarity of narcolepsy-cataplexy. This
resulted in limiting the power for analyses adjustments and prohibited evaluating the effect of adjuvanted versus non-adjuvanted
vaccines. We were unable to compare the population of exposed
and non-exposed cases according to the different age groups.
Considering only exposure to AS03-adjuvanted vaccine, we
found a strong association with narcolepsy-cataplexy in both children and adults. Despite the fact that the apparent relative excess
of vaccination with Panenza in cases compared with control subjects could indicate that the increased risk of narcolepsy-cataplexy
also associated with this vaccine, we were unable to investigate
this point. To date, no evidence supports this hypothesis; however
the possibility that other H1N1 vaccines, adjuvanted or not, could
be associated with an increased risk of narcolepsy-cataplexy
cannot be ruled out. Second, our population was affected by a
selection bias, with an over-representation of healthcare professionals characterized by a higher H1N1 vaccination rate. Even if

this is unlikely to have modified the estimates in children, this
could have lowered the estimation of the association in adults.
Third, the reliability of the information on vaccination obtained
from patients’ interview can be questioned, and was incomplete
in some cases. The previously detailed procedure of exception retained for the French H1N1 vaccination campaign showed that
subjects’ knowledge on this specific vaccination is reliable, at
least for the fact of being vaccinated and the period of vaccination. However, this cannot be fully certified and the occurrence
of misclassification for exposure cannot be eliminated. The consistency of the results obtained in including cases with date of
onset before vaccination, considering them as non-exposed, or
restricting the study to exposure to Pandemrix suggests that, if
such misclassification occurred, they are unlikely to have been responsible for the associations found. Other potential recall biases
may exist within this study, including the reliance on patient history for critical narcolepsy onset dates, and the non-responders
bias as 28% of eligible patient refused to take part of the study.

The results from this analysis are similar to that of the corresponding one performed in the sensitivity analysis as the index date considered is the date of onset of first
symptoms. Thus, in the sensitivity analysis, cases vaccinated after first onset of symptoms were already considered as non-exposed.

Although we developed specific procedures to lower the importance of these potential biases (e.g. no emphasis on H1N1 vaccination in information documents), as for all observational studies,
the possibility that some biases participated in the reported association cannot be fully ruled out. However, even if it does not
eliminate the possibility of such bias, the results are consistent
with previously published studies and the consistency of the performed sensitivity analyses is reassuring.
Our results indicate that H1N1 vaccination, mostly represented by
Pandemrix in our study, could have contributed to narcolepsycataplexy in both children and adults. The mechanisms underlying
such an association remain unclear but may involve either a specific
immune response to H1N1 with potential molecular mimicry or a
large non-specific stimulation of the immune system through the
adjuvanted ASO3 vaccine with increasing brain inflammation/
blood–brain permeability, allowing the autoimmune process to
reach hypocretin neurons resulting in narcolepsy-cataplexy
(Dauvilliers et al., 2010; Kornum et al., 2011b). We may also speculate that patients with narcolepsy-cataplexy after exposure to H1N1
vaccine would have developed the disease later on, as suggested by
a decreased narcolepsy incidence in 2011–2012 in Finland (unpublished data). H1N1 vaccination could have precipitated an ongoing
disease process through the activation of pre-existing autoreactive T
cell clones rather than causing narcolepsy-cataplexy. Taken together, the majority of the results from the H1N1 vaccine story
reinforce the underlying autoimmune hypothesis of narcolepsy-cataplexy. A biobank was constituted for the present study and further
analyses will be performed to elucidate the biological mechanism
underlying this association.
In conclusion, in this case-control study, we found a strong association between H1N1 vaccination, mostly represented by
Pandemrix, and narcolepsy-cataplexy in both children and
