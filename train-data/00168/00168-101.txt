110:105-123, 1979.
Because of an increase in the number of reports of Guillain-Barre syndrome
(GBS) following A/New Jersey influenza vaccination, the National Influenza
Immunization Program was suspended December 16,1976 and nationwide surveillance for GBS was begun. This surveillance uncovered a total of 1098
patients with onset of GBS from October 1,1976, to January 31,1977, from all
50 states, District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. A total of 532 patients had
recently received an A/New Jersey Influenza vaccination prior to their onset
of GBS (vaccinated cases), and 15 patients received a vaccination after their
onset of GBS. Five hundred forty-three patients had not been recently vaccinated with A/New Jersey Influenza vaccine and the vaccination status for 8 was
unknown. Epldemlologlc evidence Indicated that many cases of GBS were
related to vaccination. When compared to the unvaccinated population, the
vaccinated population had a significantly elevated attack rate in every adult
age group. The estimated attributable risk of vaccine-related GBS in the adult
population was just under one case per 100,000 vaccinations. The period of
Increased risk was concentrated primarily within the 5-week period after vaccination, although It lasted for approximately 9 or 10 weeks.

lance system to evaluate possible adverse
vaccine reactions, began. By December 2,
when over 35 million doses of vaccine had
been administered, two clusters of
Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) in recent
recipients of the vaccine were reported to
the Center for Disease Control (CDC)
from two states: Minnesota (four cases)
and Alabama (three cases). As a result
of identification of these two clusters,
CDC, with the cooperation of several
state health departments, initiated an
epidemiologic investigation to evaluate
the possibility of a relationship between
GBS and vaccination with the A/New
Jersey influenza vaccine. By December
15, preliminary data from Alabama,
New Jersey, Minnesota, and Colorado
suggested that the incidence of GBS
among vaccinees was approximately
seven-fold greater than the incidence
among those who had not received vaccine (1). In addition, case reports from
these four states, and from seven other
states in which active surveillance for
GBS was begun, suggested an association
between vaccination and onset of GBS
two to three weeks later. These apparent
associations led to the suspension of NIIP
on December 16 and to the expansion of
GBS surveillance nationally in order to
determine as quickly as possible whether
the influenza vaccinations were, in fact,
related to GBS and, if so, to determine the

risk. This paper presents an analysis of
the national surveillance data received by
CDC through March 1978 on cases of GBS
with onset between October 1, 1976 and
January 31, 1977.
METHODS
Case ascertainment and definition
An active surveillance system for reporting of GBS cases with onset during
the study period, October 1, 1976-
January 31, 1977, was established in cooperation with state and local health authorities. This surveillance system was
initiated in 11 arbitrarily selected states
during the period December 3-16, 1976,
and subsequently expanded to include the
39 remaining states, Puerto Rico, and
District of Columbia on December 17. The
surveillance information on the 1098
patients in this report was gathered primarily through investigators' direct telephone and/or letter contact with practicing neurologists and their review of
physician and hospital records.
Initially, state health departments
were requested to contact as many practicing neurologists as possible in their
respective states and to telephone a designated person at CDC with basic information on newly identified cases of GBS
each work day. By early January, CDC requested that an individual GBS-caseinvestigation form be completed on all
reported cases. This GBS form was developed at CDC to help insure more uniform collection of epidemiologic data; included were questions about clinical and
laboratory findings, antecedent events,
and the patient's medical history, as well
as space for the more basic information
initially reported to CDC by telephone;
the patient's name, age, race, sex, county
of residence, date of onset of neurologic
symptoms, history of A/New Jersey influenza vaccination, the attending physician's name and telephone number, and
whether the patient was hospitalized, required ventilatory assistance and/or died.

GBS FOLLOWING INFLUENZA VACCINATION, 1976-1977 107
For those patients who indicated they had
received an A/New Jersey influenza vaccine, a copy of a vaccination consent form
was generally sought; it included the vaccine type and manufacturer's lot number.
Additional case-finding techniques that
were utilized by some states included
sending letters to non-neurologist practitioners; surveying hospitals through
contacting hospital-based physicians,
administrators, and/or infection control
officers; and conducting a repeat survey of
neurologists after mid-January 1977.
Persons who had originally been working
on the influenza immunization program
in each state, regular state and local
health department personnel, CDC medical epidemiologists based in Atlanta and
CDC officers assigned to state and city
health departments assisted in the GBS
surveillance effort.
By definition GBS cases had (a) to have
been diagnosed by a physician (Illinois,
Montana, and Ohio reported requiring a
neurologist's diagnosis) and (b) to have
objective evidence of muscle involvement
(New York State and City and Texas required slightly stricter clinical criteria).
Suspected cases reported to CDC directly
by patients or medical personnel were included in this report only if they were accepted as a case by a state health department. Two reported cases in patients with
>160 white blood cells per cubic millimeter in their cerebrospinal fluid were
excluded from analysis at CDC.
Largely because there was a relatively
sharp decrease nationally in reported
cases with onset after the week ending
December 18 (the week in which NIIP
was suspended), state epidemiologists
were sent a brief questionnaire in late
April 1977 to help assess possible differences in case ascertainment before and
after December 18. As indicated in some
analyses in this report, data were omitted
from nine states that reported more than
a slight decrease in case ascertainment in
the latter period.
Size of vaccinated and unvaccinated
populations—weekly and monthly
assessments
To evaluate the possible association of
cases of GBS to receipt of A/New Jersey
vaccine, we attempted to develop rates of
GBS in the civilian population of the
United States who had received vaccine
and for those who had not received vaccine prior to onset of GBS. We obtained
estimates of the civilian population, by
state and age, as of July 1, 1976, from the
Bureau of the Census (2). We obtained the
number of A/New Jersey vaccinations
administered in the United States from
the CDC-NUP Surveillance and Assessment Center. This Center had sent
guidelines for gathering and reporting
this information to all state and local
health departments prior to the national
immunization campaign (3). For each
state, two sets of data on vaccine administration were available, weekly reports of
total vaccinations administered and
monthly reports of vaccinations administered, by age group and type of vaccine
(monovalent A/New Jersey/76 or bivalent
A/New Jersey/76 and A/Victoria/75). The
weekly reports were collected only during
the national immunization campaign, October-December 1976; the monthly reports were collected October 1976 through
June 1977. The vaccinations reported
January-June 1977 (about 4 per cent of
the total) were, in fact, administered almost entirely in 1976. In this paper, the
age-specific monthly reports of vaccinations, by state, in 1976 were adjusted
proportionally to include the late reports.
Also, the weekly reports of vaccinations
were similarly adjusted to reflect the total
numbers of reported vaccinations administered to the adult target population—
those over 17 years of age; about 98 per
cent of the officially reported civilian total
of 45.65 million vaccinations were administered to this target population.
Because both the size of the populations
and the period in which they were obDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/aje/article-abstract/110/2/105/57614 by guest on 15 October 2019
108 SCHONBERGER ET AL
served influenced the likelihood of detecting cases, attack rates in this paper are
expressed in terms of cases per size of
population per period of observation. For
some analyses, where indicated, data are
omitted from three states which had unusually large discrepancies between reported overall totals of vaccinations administered in their weekly and monthly
reports and from four other states for
which the monthly data were combined in
a single overall report that could not be
separated into its monthly components.
National survey and sex- and
race-specific ratios
In order to determine whether the occurrence of GBS was related to sex or
race, we compared the estimated number
of vaccinated and unvaccinated persons in
the population over 17 years of age in the
continental United States in January
1977, by sex and race, with the number of
comparable GBS cases reported in the
study period. The estimates of the population sizes were derived from a national
survey conducted by the Opinion Research Corporation, January 1977 (4). It
was assumed that the sex- and racespecific ratios of reported GBS cases to
size of population in January 1977 reflected the relative size of the sex- or
race-specific attack rates within a vaccinated or within an unvaccinated population. At the time of onset of GBS for most
of the reported cases, the size of the vaccinated population was smaller and the
size of the unvaccinated population was
larger than in January 1977; thus the
sex- and race-specific ratios were not used
to estimate relative risks of GBS for a
vaccinated population compared with an
unvaccinated population.
Vaccine inventories and manufacturerand lot-specific attack rates
As part of NILP, civilian health departments received over 100 million doses
of influenza vaccine produced by four
manufacturers; approximately 66 million
doses (0.5 ml each) of monovalent vaccine
containing 200 chick cell agglutinating
(CCA) units of A/New Jersey/76 antigen
and 35.5 million doses (0.5 ml each) of
bivalent vaccine containing 200 CCA
units each of A/New Jersey/76 and
A/Victoria/75 antigens. All four manufacturers produced inactivated vaccine. Two
manufacturers (A and B), whose final
products contained whole virus antigen,
produced about 93 per cent of the monovalent and 14 per cent of the bivalent vaccine. The remaining doses were produced
by the other two manufacturers (C and D)
whose final products contained split virus
or subvirion antigens. Civilian health departments used vaccine from a total 141
different bulk lots: 60, 27, 34, and 20 bulk
lots from manufacturers A, B, C, and D,
respectively. In order to evaluate the possibility that the number of cases of GBS
that occurred in vaccinated persons might
be related to the vaccine from a single
manufacturer or to a specific lot of vaccine, we attempted to develop crude attack rates of GBS, by manufacturer and
lot number. Based on the difference between the amount of each manufacturer's
vaccine distributed and an inventory in
1977 of the monovalent and bivalent vaccine on hand in each state, by manufacturer, we estimated the proportion of each
type of vaccine administered in each
state. These proportions and the monthly
reports of vaccine administered enabled
estimation of manufacturer-specific denominators. Based on a lot-specific inventory completed in 1978 after vaccine was
placed in centralized storage facilities,
the net national distribution of vaccine
was calculated by subtracting inventory
data for each lot from the total doses of
each lot distributed. Although these net
distributions included numbers of doses
lost in shipment, wasted, or otherwise
unaccounted for, they provided rough, but
the best available, estimates of the
number of doses of each lot of vaccine administered.

GBS FOLLOWING INFLUKNZA VACCINATION, 1976-1977 109
The numerators for the lot-specific attack rates were derived from the 80.6 per
cent of cases with known onset of GBS in
the six-week period after vaccination for
which the vaccine lot numbers were reported. The six-week period was chosen in
this and other analyses to equalize the period of observation of all vaccinees; a
longer period was not selected because intensified surveillance for GBS ended
about 6% weeks after suspension of NUP.
RESULTS
Distribution of cases by vaccination
status and week of onset
A total of 1098 patients with onset of
GBS from October 1, 1976, through
January 31, 1977, were reported to CDC
from all 50 states, District of Columbia,
and Puerto Rico. Five hundred thirty-two
received an A/New Jersey/76 influenza
vaccine from NETP prior to their onset of
GBS (vaccinated cases) and 15 patients
received the vaccine after their onset.
Five hundred forty-three did not receive
an A/New Jersey/76 influenza vaccine,
and the vaccination status of eight was
unknown. Unless otherwise indicated, the
15 patients vaccinated after their onset of
GBS were included in analyses of nonrecipients (unvaccinated cases).
The first case of GBS in a person who
had been vaccinated occurred in the first
week of October. The number of cases rose
sharply between mid-October and midDecember, peaking in the week ending
December 18, when 73 cases were reported. A precipitous drop-off in cases was
observed thereafter, which in part may be
attributed to a decreased case ascertainment in many states following their initial surveillance efforts (figure 1).
In contrast to the sharply rising incidence of GBS observed among vaccinees,
the number of unvaccinated cases each
week from October 1 through December
18 was relatively stable. Even among the
unvaccinated population, there was a
drop-off in reported cases after December
18 (figure 1).

The attack rates, by week, in the vaccinated and unvaccinated adult target
populations revealed significantly higher
attack rates among vaccinees throughout
October, November, and December. In
early December, the weekly attack rates
in the vaccinated population began to fall
sharply. By late January, it had decreased to approximately the level of the

of the vaccinated persons with GBS were
under 20 years of age. In contrast, GBS
occurred in unvaccinated persons ranging
in age from one to 93 years (median 34.5
years), and the plurality of these cases,
67, occurred in the 15-19-year age group.
Approximately 26.1 per cent of the unvaccinated persons with GBS were under 20
years of age (figure 3). Males comprised
about 46.5 per cent of those with GBS who
had been vaccinated and 55.2 per cent of
those who had not been vaccinated.
Sex- and race-specific ratios
Though the sex and race of vaccine recipients were not routinely recorded, a
survey of the population over 17 years of
age in the continental United States estimated that in January 1977, 29 per cent
of males, 32 per cent of females, 33 per
cent of whites, and 14 per cent of blacks
had received an A/New Jersey influenza
vaccination (4). These percentages enabled estimation of sex- and race-specific
ratios of the number of reported GBS
cases in adults to size of population in
January 1977; these ratios were expressed in terms of cases to one million
population (table 1). For the unvaccinated
population, the sex-specific ratio for
males (4.9 cases to one million population) was 38 per cent higher than for
females (3.6). For the vaccinated population, this ratio for males (12.0) was only 9
per cent higher than for females (11.0).
For the unvaccinated population, the
ratio for whites (4.1) was 54 per cent
higher than for blacks (2.6) and for the
vaccinated population, over 140 per cent
Higher than for blacks (10.4 compared to
4.3); the ratios for blacks were based on
much smaller populations than for whites
and many fewer cases.
Distribution of cases by interval between
onset of GBS and vaccination
There was a striking nonrandom distribution of intervals between influenza
vaccination and onset of GBS. Seventyone per cent of the vaccinated cases with
known intervals became ill within the
first four weeks after vaccination and 52
per cent in the second and third weeks
after vaccination (figure 4). By two-day
intervals between vaccination and onset,
the largest percentage of cases (10 per

cent) occurred on the 16th and 17th days
after vaccination (figure 5).
Attack rates by week interval between
onset of GBS and vaccination
Using the reports of vaccinations administered by week, attack rates were determined for the population over 17 years
of age, by week of onset after their influenza vaccination (figure 6). Several
states were analyzed only for the period
October 3 through December 18, 1976,
when their reported case ascertainment
was maximal. The expected GBS attack
rate based on the average attack rate for
those over 17 years of age who did not
receive an A/New Jersey influenza vaccination prior to onset was 0.22 cases per
million persons per week (figure 6). The
weekly attack rates for the vaccinees
were considerably above this level, especially in weeks 2 and 3 after vaccination.
The area of the curve above the expected
level provided an estimate of the risk each
week attributable to vaccination. For the
first 10 weeks, the attributable risk for
the population over 17 years of age was
approximately 9.5 cases per million vaccinees or just under one case per 100,000
vaccinations. Based on figure 6, one could

visualize that the attributable risk would
not change very markedly even if the
height of the expected attack rate were
doubled.
Based on the attack rates, by week after
vaccination, in figure 6, the relative risks
of GBS (the ratios of attack rates in the
vaccinated and unvaccinated populations)
were determined (figure 7). The peak relative risks, which exceeded 12, occurred
in weeks 2 and 3 after vaccination, and
prior to the 10th week after vaccination
all relative risks were significantly greater
than 1, p < .05 (5). From the 10th week
on, the relative risks no longer remained
significantly different from 1.
Age- and vaccine-specific attack rates
Using the monthly data of vaccinations
administered, the age-specific attack
rates, by type of A/New Jersey influenza
vaccine received (monovalent versus bivalent vaccine), the relative risks and the
attributable risks (the difference in attack rates between the vaccinated and
unvaccinated populations) were determined (table 2). The attack rates for all
vaccinees were based on the six-week period following vaccination. Within each
age group the attack rates for recipients
of monovalent and bivalent vaccines were
not significantly different. Among vaccinees, the overall attack rate in each of
the three oldest age groups varied from
7.3 to 9.1 cases per million persons per
month. Though these rates were not significantly different from each other, each
was significantly greater than the attack
rates in the two youngest age groups, at
least at the p < .05 level. The data for
children were less definitive because of
the relatively small number of cases and
vaccinations in children.
Among nonrecipients of A/New Jersey
influenza vaccine, the age-specific attack
rates ranged from 0.46 cases per million
persons per month in those under 18
years of age to 1.40 cases per million persons per month in those 65 years of age

and older. Statistically, the attack rates
in the 45- to 64-year-olds and in the oldest
age group were not significantly different
from each other, but both of these older
groups had significantly higher attack
rates than observed in the 25- to 44-yearold age group, p < .01. When the agespecific attack rates for the vaccinated
and unvaccinated populations were compared, the vaccinated population had a
significantly elevated attack rate in every
adult age group. The relative risks in the

year-old age group to 11.4 cases per million vaccinations in the 25- to 44-year-old
age group. These attributable risks could
be derived from data in table 2 by multiplying the difference in average monthly
attack rates for the vaccinated and unvaccinated persons by 1.37 (rounded
number), the ratio of six weeks to the
length of the average month in the study
period. Overall the attributable risk in
the six-week period after vaccination was
8.8 cases per million vaccinations (table 2).
Occurrence of GBS by region of the
United States and period of vaccination
The data in table 2 were analyzed by
the four major geographic regions of the
United States, Northeast, North Central,
South and West (6). For either vaccine recipients or nonrecipients, the distribution
of the reported number of GBS cases
among these regions was not significantly
different from what was expected based
on both the national attack rate in any
age category and the number of people, by
region, in that category and their period
of risk. Thus, the relative risk of GBS for
vaccine recipients during the six-week
period after vaccination compared to nonrecipients was similar in the four geographic regions of the United States. For
those over 17 years of age, this relative
risk was 7.1 in the South, 7.7 in the Northeast, 7.8 in the North Central and 8.1 in
the West. Further analysis of the data
used in table 2 also revealed no significant difference in attack rate during the
six-week period after vaccination in the
three cohorts of adult vaccinees defined
by the October, November, and December
reports of vaccinations. The ratio of the
attack rate of each of these three cohorts
to the overall attack rate in adult vaccinees was 0.92, 1.09, and 0.88, respectively.
Comparison of the GBS illness and
clinical background for the vaccinated
and unvaccinated patients
The comparability of the GBS illness
and clinical background reported in the
vaccinated and unvaccinated patients enabled evaluation of possible biases in case
ascertainment. Case-fatality ratios were
one measure of the comparability of the
GBS illnesses; these ratios were not significantly different for the vaccinated and
unvaccinated patients and were almost
identical for those over 17 years of age,
6.0 per cent among the vaccinated and 5.7
per cent among the unvaccinated (table
3). In total, 58 fatalities were reported, for
an overall case fatality ratio of 5.3 per
cent. Among all reported GBS patients,
the case-fatality ratios ranged from 0.8
per cent in those under 18 years of age to

12.7 per cent among those 65 years of age
and older.
Information on the cerebrospinal fluid
(CSF) protein concentration was reported
for 423 (80.0 per cent) of the vaccinated
and 364 (83.5 per cent) of the unvaccinated GBS cases over 17 years of age. Of
these, a significantly higher proportion of
the vaccinated cases (82.3 per cent) than
unvaccinated cases (74.7 per cent) had a
documented CSF protein elevation (>50
mg/dl or reported as elevated).
The comparability of the reported vaccinated and unvaccinated patients with
GBS over 17 years of age was further evaluated based on parameters shown in table
4. It is noteworthy that information was
available on the same average proportion
(83 per cent) of the patients in each group.
Of these, approximately 84 per cent of the
vaccinated and 89 per cent of unvaccinated patients with GBS were diagnosed
by neurologists, a small but statistically
significant difference. There were remarkable similarities between vaccinated
and unvaccinated patients in the high
frequency of reported progressive weakness and/or paralysis, bilateral neurologic
signs, and lower motor neuron signs.
Though sensory symptoms were reported
in the vast majority of cases, these were
reported significantly more often in those
who had received vaccine, 89.5 per cent
versus 79.9 per cent. A total of 36.2 per
cent of the vaccinated and 38.7 per cent of
the unvaccinated patients had respiratory
impairment, and 20.3 per cent of the vaccinated and 24.7 per cent of the unvaccinated patients required mechanical respiratory assistance. The vaccinated group
had a significantly higher percentage of
cranial nerve involvement, 53.3 per cent
compared to 45.1 per cent.
Though there were no reported differences in recent toxin exposure, history of
allergy in the patient or in his family, or
in the history of an acute illness among
household contacts, a total of 45.1 per cent
of the vaccinated patients had a chronic
illness as compared to 35.6 per cent of the
unvaccinated patients. This difference
was expected because vaccinations were
particularly encouraged for people with
chronic disease. The unvaccinated patients had a significantly greater frequency of reported acute illness in the
four weeks prior to onset, 61.8 per cent as
compared to 32.8 per cent for the vaccinated patients.
VACCINE EVALUATION
Manufacturer-specific attack rates
Based on an inventory of vaccine conducted by each state, in early 1977, including Washington, DC, the proportions
of monovalent and bivalent vaccine, by
manufacturer, that were received but not
on hand for inventory were determined.
For the states included in table 2, manufacturers A, B, C, and D accounted for
34.2, 63.1, 1.4, and 1.3 per cent, respectively, of the monovalent vaccine that was
received but not on hand and 6.7, 9.0,
66.5, and 17.8 per cent, respectively, of
the bivalent vaccine. In order to estimate
rates of GBS, by manufacturer, the proportions derived above were applied to the
denominator for the "all ages" category of
table 2. This assumed that for each type of
vaccine the amount received, but not in
the 1977 inventory, reflected equally well
the amount of each manufacturer's vaccine that was administered. As illustrated
in table 5, the vaccine of all four manufacturers was similarly associated with cases
of GBS. No single manufacturer's vaccine
had a significantly different rate of GBS
than the other manufacturers combined.
However, manufacturer C did approach
having a statistically significant lower
rate and the rates associated with the bivalent vaccines of manufacturer C and D
differed significantly, p < .05. The monovalent split-product vaccines combined,
vaccines which were recommended primarily for children, had a significantly
lower attack rate than the monovalent
whole-product vaccines combined, but

Lot-specific data
Based on the lot-specific inventory
completed in June 1978, the net distributions of each of the total 141 lots, that is,
the difference between the quantity of
each lot originally distributed and the
amount counted in the inventory, varied
from 2640 to 1,094,000 doses, median
365,300 (figure 8). For all lots combined,
the net distribution based on this inventory was 55.85 million doses, 10.2 million
doses more than was reported to have
been administered. The 10.2 million doses
constituted the best estimate of the
amount of vaccine lost, spoiled, broken,
discarded, or just not returned for inventory. On the average, net distribution
overestimated the reported doses of bivalent vaccine administered by more than it
overestimated the reported doses of
monovalent vaccine administered, 27.6

six-week period after vaccination. Of
these, 91 per cent were associated with
between one and six cases. The maximal
number of cases associated with any
single lot within the period was 11. It is
noteworthy that the distribution of the
observed number of cases associated with
lots grouped by 100,000 dose sizes was not
significantly different from what would
be expected based on the number of doses
in each group and the rate of cases for all
lots combined, .10 > p > .05. Nevertheless, the pattern of the individual lotspecific attack rates for the six-week period after vaccination indicated some
nonrandom variation; the lot-specific attack rates greater than zero closely fit a
negative binomial distribution. The rates
ranged from 0 to 23.7 cases per million
doses net distribution, mean 6.2 cases per
million doses (figure 9).
When the rate of each of the 141 lots
was compared statistically to the rate of
the remaining lots combined, each of
three lots among those with the highest
attack rate differed from all the remaining lots with a relatively high degree of
statistical significance (x2

and finding this degree of statistical significance in three of the pairs by chance
alone would be unlikely, p < .0006.
On the other hand, no lot had a statistically significant lower attack rate than
the other 140 lots combined. Based on
their net distributions and the attack rate
for all lots combined, the highest expected
number of cases in any of the 34 lots associated with no cases was 3.07. For 26 of
these lots the expected number of cases
was less than two and for 15 lots less than
one case.
Review of the lot that statistically had
the most significantly elevated attack
rate (x2
 9.52) revealed that all nine of the
associated cases within the six-week period after vaccination were reported from
Ohio; only a total of 3.1 associated cases
would have been expected based on the
lot's net distribution and the attack rate

for all lots combined. Since 197,850 doses
of the total 496,750 doses net distribution
of this lot were reported from outside
Ohio, there was an unexplained statistically significant lower attack rate associated with this lot's distribution outside Ohio when compared to the attack
rate inside Ohio (p < .05). It is noteworthy
that 99 per cent of the net distribution of
this lot was from four geographic areas
where only one reported case with an unknown lot number could possibly have
been associated with the lot.
When information provided by the
Bureau of Biologies was used, the lotspecific attack rates were found not to
correlate significantly with the results of
the following laboratory tests on each lot:
thimerosal concentration, protein concentration, formaldehyde concentration, potency, and endotoiin levels.
DISCUSSION
The epidemiologic data presented here
are the results of a large cooperative surveillance effort in which health personnel
from CDC and state and local health departments actively Bought from collaborating neurologists and other practicing physicians all their diagnosed cases of
GBS within a several-month period. The
markedly increased attack rates observed
among recipients of A/New Jersey vaccine
provided strong support for the hypothesis that vaccination was etiologically
linked to GBS. Though undoubtedly some
cases of GBS with onset in the study period were not diagnosed, or if diagnosed
not reported, the large numbers of reported cases provided relatively stable estimates of GBS attack rates in the vaccinated and unvaccinated populations. The
order of magnitude of these GBS attack
rates based on the final surveillance data
in this report was remarkably similar to
that estimated from preliminary data collected prior to the initial publicity about
GBS after influenza vaccination (1).
Previously reported incidence rates of
GBS were limited and based on relatively
few cases identified over many years. The
previously reported average annual incidence rates ranged between 6 and 19
cases per million population per year for
an average of between 0.5 and 1.6 cases
per million people per month (7-12). The
40 cases in the largest of these population
based studies showed, by date of onset, an
even distribution throughout all seasons
(12). The average incidence rate among
unvaccinated persons in the present
study, 0.79 cases per million people per
month, fell within the previously reported
range. In contrast, the average GBS attack rate among vaccine recipients based
on the six-week period after vaccination
was many fold greater than the upper
limit of this range.
Although the comparability of the GBS
attack rates in unvaccinated persons in
this study to previously reported rates
suggested reasonably good ascertainment
of unvaccinated persons with GBS, strong
evidence existed, independent of the
lower attack rate in unvaccinated persons, that A/New Jersey influenza vaccination incited the onset of GBS in many
adult vaccinees. This evidence was the
strikingly nonrandom distribution of
intervals between vaccination and the
onset of GBS, specifically the clustering of
cases in the first four weeks after vaccination and particularly in the second and
third weeks after vaccination. This nonrandom distribution was noted early in
the investigation and was an important ,
factor in the decision to suspend NIIP, *
December 16, 1976.
Another type of evidence for the
etiologic relationship of influenza vaccination and GBS included the markedly
lower proportion of vaccinated compared
to unvaccinated cases with a history of a
recent acute illness within four weeks before onset, 32.8 per cent versus 61.8 per
cent, respectively. This evidence derived
its strength chiefly from the only two
studies in the literature comparing the
Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/aje/article-abstract/110/2/105/57614 by guest on 15 October 2019
GBS FOLLOWING INFLUENZA VACCINATION, 1976-1977 121
incidence of a disorder among patients
with GBS with the incidence among a
control group (12, 13). Relative to controls, GBS patients in these studies had a
higher incidence of either a respiratory or
a gastrointestinal illness within four
weeks of onset; both studies demonstrated
that the overall proportion of GBS patients with an acute illness within four
weeks of onset was >60 per cent (28 of 40
patients and 31 of 52 patients, excluding
one with a smallpox vaccination). The
significantly lower incidence of acute illness among vaccinated cases in the present series might be attributed, at least in
part, to recommendations that acutely ill
persons avoid vaccination. Nevertheless,
the fact that there was an increased
number of GBS cases among vaccinees
without the high incidence of antecedent
acute illness suggested that vaccine replaced acute illness as a trigger of GBS.
The comparability of the cases reported
in the vaccinated and unvaccinated populations was particularly important because the exact clinical boundaries of
GBS were not precisely defined and there
were no known diagnostic laboratory
tests or pathognomonic clinical findings.
Clearly, if only the most classical or most
severe cases in the unvaccinated population were reported in contrast to much
more atypical and mild cases in the vaccinated population, comparison of attack
rates based on the number of cases in
these two groups could be misleading.
GBS, however, was a well-recognized entity, particularly among neurologists, and
neurologists diagnosed an estimated 80
per cent or more of the cases in this series.
Furthermore, most of the differences observed between vaccinated and unvaccinated cases in this study were relatively
small in comparison to the observed differences in attack rates. Evidence that
the severity of the disease in both groups
was comparable included the similar total
and age-specific case-fatality ratios, the
similar proportion of each group with respiratory impairment, and the similar
proportions who required treatment with
a respirator. It is also noteworthy that the
reported overall case-fatality ratio, 5.3
per cent, and the overall proportion of
cases placed on a respirator, 22.2 per cent,
were consistent with figures reported in
the literature (14, 15).
The higher incidence of chronic disease
in vaccinated persons than unvaccinated
persons was expected because bivalent
vaccine was directed towards persons
with chronic diseases who were at increased risk of serious illness if infected
with influenza A/Victoria/75 (16). However, the similar GBS attack rate in recipients of the monovalent and bivalent vaccines suggested that a history of chronic
disease in general was not a very important risk factor in developing GBS.
The age distribution of the unvaccinated patients in the present series was
strikingly similar to the age distribution
of the 176 patients with GBS in the New
York-New Jersey metropolitan area
1967-1976 (14). In both series, increased
numbers of cases were seen in young
adults and a second lesser peak between
ages 45 and 64. Age-specific attack rates
in the present series, however, demonstrated that rather than a marked predilection for GBS to occur in young adults,
the risk of GBS in the unvaccinated populations was significantly higher in those
over 45 years of age. In the vaccinated
population, the attack rates in the three
oldest age groups over 24 years were not
significantly different from each other,
but each group had a significantly greater
attack rate than did those between 18 and
24 years of age. Thus, the present study
confirmed the importance of age as a risk
factor for GBS and suggested that the influence of this risk factor might vary for
GBS cases associated with different
agents, i.e., A/New Jersey influenza vaccine and different viral infections.
The present series also strongly suggested that unvaccinated males were at

greater risk of GBS than unvaccinated
females and that the risk for both sexes
rose to relatively similar levels after vaccination. It also suggested that there was
a lesser risk of GBS for the black population than for the white population, which
was more evident among the vaccinated
than among the unvaccinated. A probable
increased susceptibility of males to GBS
was reported previously (11, 15).
Though some nonrandom variation in
lot-specific attack rates was detected in
the present study, there was little evidence that this was due to factors intrinsic to the lots themselves. The comparable
attack rates, by geographic region of the
United States, period of vaccination, type
of vaccine and manufacturer, and the
minimum of 76 per cent of lots that were
associated with at least one case of GBS
within a six-week period after vaccination, indicated that the increased occurrence of GBS after receipt of A/New Jersey influenza vaccine was more a generic
than a lot-specific problem.
The epidemiologic data suggesting that
A/New Jersey influenza vaccine caused
GBS raise the question of biologic feasibility. Though historically some investigators have proposed that GBS is due to
a primary viral infection, the more recent
prevailing hypothesis is that GBS represents an immunopathologic reaction,
triggered by recent exposure to an exogenous agent (17, 18). This immunopathologic reaction leads to certain cellular changes eventuating in attack on
nerve rootlets and peripheral nerves (17,
18). Though heretofore the only potential
etiologic agents shown to be associated
significantly with GBS cases compared to
controls were those causing nonspecific
acute infections, the possibility that many
different antecedent events, including
vaccination, might trigger GBS has been
suggested (19). In addition, experimental
allergic neuritis, which has many features in common with GBS, is elicited by
intradermal injections of peripheral nerve
and complete Freund's adjuvant, „and
there is a clear association in humans between allergic encephalomyelitis and
polyneuritis and inoculation with killed
rabies vaccine produced in nervous tissue
(20, 21). It is also noteworthy that the latent period for both experimental allergic
neuritis and allergic encephalomyelitis is
similar to the latent period between
A/New Jersey influenza vaccination and
GBS in the present series (20, 21).
The number of articles linking either
GBS or a similar neurologic disorder specifically to influenza vaccination was
sparse prior to NIIP; only two were found
(19, 22). In the first, only one case associated with influenza vaccination was
reported among 1100 cases of GBS collected from reports from the French,
English, and American literature,
1949-1966. In the second, two cases of
polyneuropathy, two cases of transverse
myelopathy, and one case of radiculopathy were noted in patients from
the United Kingdom and West Germany
who had received influenza vaccine with
an oil adjuvant.
The present study demonstrated the
value of both a passive and active surveillance system for detecting an unanticipated serious vaccine reaction. Though
the association of GBS with A/New Jersey
influenza vaccination was rare, its discovery and analysis were greatly facilitated by the unusually massive administration of vaccine over a short period
of time and the unusual availability of
information quantitating these vaccinations. Equally important were the commitments of health authorities to investigate a potentially serious vaccine reaction
and the willingness of private physicians
and others in the private medical community to actively cooperate in a national
surveillance effort.
