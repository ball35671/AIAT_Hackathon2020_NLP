deoxycholate subunit influenza
vaccine in a primed population

R.S. Gillett and W. Scott Kennedy*
A trial with a trivalent influenza subunit vaccineprepared with sodium deoxycholate was carried
out in 88 volunteers between May and November 1981. Each haemagglutinin antigen was present
at 7 pg per dos~ Fourfold or greater haemagglutination inhibition antibody (HI) responses to the
HI NI virus A/Brazil/l 1/78 occurred in 70% of volunteers following a single dose. For the H3 N2
virus A/Bangkok/l/79 and B/Singapore/222/79 these figures were 52 and 1196, respectively. No
increase in the antibody titre was noted to any of the antigens following a second vaccination dose.
Antibody levels remained relatively constant six months after vaccination. A response to
B/Singapore/222/79, comparable with the HI response for the influenza A antigens, was noted
when serum titres were estimated by a plaque reduction procedure No neuraminidase inhibition
antibody could be detected in response to either A/Brazil/l 1/78 or A/Bangkok/I~79. No reactions
specifically attributable to the vaccine occurred after either injection A lower HI response to
A/Brazii/l 1/78 was noted in volunteers 52 years of age and older, who also showed less evidence of
earlier priming to this virus. Levels of nasal wash neutralizing antibodies to A/Brazil/l 1/78 were
proportional to those detected in sera by HI tests, but were present in smaller amounts.

Introduction
Influenza subunit vaccines contain haemagglutinin and
neuraminidase viral surface antigens which are released
from purified viruses by disruption with ether or surfaceactive reagents'. Vaccines prepared using sodium deoxycholate as the disruptive agent have been shown to induce
satisfactory levels of serum antibodies and to produce few
side effects 2-'. Several studies with both deoxycholate and
non-deoxycholate subunit vaccines have indicated that
two doses are necesary in an unprimed population in
order to induce an adequate response, whereas in a
primed population only a single dose is necessary 4-6.
However, Mackenzie ~ showed that two doses of a deoxycholate vaccine were required for seroconversion in an
elderly population. In the following study, we seek to
extend these findings for a trivalent deoxycholate vaccine
containing the HINI antigens of A/Brazil/l 1/78, the
H3N2 antigens of A/Bangkok/t/79 and the B antigens
of B/Singapore/222/79 and to determine the duration of
the serum responses to each antigen over six months.
The nasal antibody response to HINI antigens in the
vaccine is also determined.

stituted the test population and their ages ranged from 16
to 64 years; only 20 (23%) had received influenza vaccine
previously and 12 (14%) within the past five years.
Pregnant females and other individuals with known allergies to eggs or to egg proteins were excluded from the
trial.
Vaccine
A trivalent subunit vaccine (Batch No. 436- l) prepared
by the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, Parkville,
Victoria, Australia, was used. Surface antigens to the
influenza A viruses, A/Brazil/11/78 and A/Bangkok/I/79,
and the influenza B virus, B/Singapore/222/79 were
present. Each haemagglutinin antigen was present at a
concentration of 7 Atg per dose. A sterile saline solution
was used as the placebo.
Vaccination
Vaccine or placebo was administered to three groups of
volunteers by the subcutaneous route. One group received
one dose of vaccine followed by one dose of placebo
('Schedule V/P), another received two doses of vaccine
(V/V) and a third two doses of placebo (P/P). Each dose
was administered four weeks apart. Volunteers were
alternately allocated into groups in a double-blind
manner.
Bleeds and nasal washes
Serum was obtained from samples of 10 ml blood
which was collected at the time of each inoculation (zero
and four weeks) and then at six weeks and six months.
Nasal washes were also collected at these times by
irrigation of the nares of each volunteer with 5 ml of
phosphate buffered saline, which was administered bv
means ol a syringe attached to a glass bulb which fitted
into each nostril. During adminstration, the volunteer

were collected over a 20-30 min interval in an attempt to
maximize mucus yields. The washes were pooled and
~7-12 ml of a total administered volume of 20 ml was
usually recovered.
response to subunit influenza vaccine: G.A Tannock et al.
Detection of neutralizing antibody to influenza B
The same plaque-reduction procedure for nasal wash
antibody was used. Virus-serum mixtures were inoculated to monolayers for 30 min and washed with PBS to
remove serum proteins before applying the nutrient
agarose overlay.
Reactions to vaccination
Each volunteer was given a sheet listing possible
reactions at the time of each inoculation and asked to
record symptoms over the next seven days. Symptoms
were grouped into local reactions (redness, swelling.
warmth or irritation), local pain (pain on contact, pain
with pressure, continuous pain, or restriction of arm
movement) and systemic reactions (fever, chills, sweating.
drowsiness or insomnia), according to the criteria of
Jennings et al. s The number of individuals showing 0--4
symptoms for local pain and local reactions of 0, 1 and
>2 symptoms for systemic reactions was recorded as a
percentage of the number of individuals in the group.
After six weeks volunteers were interviewed for evidence
of the presence of the Guillain-Barr~ Syndrome, but none
was noted.
Haemagglutination inhibition (HI) and neuraminidase inhibition (NI) antibody determinations
Both were determined according to standard
procedures '°. HI levels were estimated using four haemagglutinating units of virus per serum-virus mixture,
using high-yielding recombinants containing the surface
antigens of A/Brazil/l 1/78 (HI NI) and A/Bangkok/l/79
(H3N2) and the influenza B strain B/Singapore/222/79.
All sera were incubated with receptor destroying enzyme
for 16 h at 37°C to remove inhibitors. NI titrations were
carried out using recombinant viruses containing the
A/Shearwater (Hav6) haemagglutinin and either the NIT~
or the N273 neuraminidase, using paired sera from natural
infection to A/Brazil/ll/78 or A/Bangkok/l/79 as the
controls.
Nasal wash antibody determinations
Nasal wash fluids were centrifuged to remove particulate material and concentrated 10-fold using a
Minicon B-15 concentrator (Amicon Corp., Lexington, MA,
USA). Antibody present in the concentrate to the highyielding recombinant of A/Brazil/l 1/78 was determined
by a plaque-reduction test. Mixtures consisting of 100-140
p.f.u./ml of virus and an equal volume of a dilution of
nasal wash concentrate were incubated at 37°C for 1 h.
Monolayers of the Madin-Darby canine kidney cell line
which had been washed with phosphate buffered saline
(PBS) were then incubated with 0.1 ml of each mixture.
Adsorption was allowed to take place for 45 min at 20°C
and the monolayers then rinsed with PBS to remove
inoculum proteins. The washing step was instigated to
remove potential trypsin inhibitors in the virus-serum
mixture and an overlay consisting of Leibovitz L-15
medium with ! ~tg ml -~ trypsin and 0.9°,6 agarose was then
added. The plates were incubated at 34°C in a 5% Co2
atmosphere for 4-5 days and plaques counted. Antibody
present was determined according to the dilution of
concentrate required to produce a reduction of 50% in
plaque numbers of a control mixture containing PBS in
place of the nasal wash. as determined by the SpearmanK~irber method.
Statistical analyses
For most comparisons contingency tables were
constructed and significances determined by the
X 2 method. Where expected cell sizes were too small the
Fisher's exact test was used As repeated measures were
taken on the same individuals, comparisons between HI
levels at various times were made using the StuartMaxwell test, a X 2 test based upon a 3 x 3 table of matched
pairs]L A standard two-way analysis of variance was
performed on the logarithmically-transformed plaque
reduction data (Table 5) to achieve approximate
normality ~2.
Results
Withdrawal rates for schedules during the trial
Initially 46 volunteers were assigned to each treatment
schedule, but only individuals who received two injections were considered as part of the study. These comprised 32 for the placebo/placebo, 29 for the vaccine/
placebo and 27 for the vaccine/vaccine schedules, a total
of 88. At six weeks 75 remained comprising 27 for the
placebo/placebo schedule (57% of the original group), 25
for the vaccine/placebo (54%) and 23 for the vaccine/
vaccine schedules (50%). After six months, 57 volunteers
remained and the corresponding figures for the respective
groups are 20 (43%), 18 (39%) and 19 (41%).
Composition of different vaccination groups
The mean age + one standard deviation was 33.7 =l= 11.4
years for the placebo/placebo group, 37.3 + 14.5 years for
the vaccine/placebo group and 34.8 ± 13.9 years for the
vaccine/vaccine group. In the placebo/placebo group 6%
of subjects were >_ 52 years of age while for the vaccine/
placebo and vaccine/vaccine groups these figures are 19%
and 20%, respectively. Differences in the proportion of
individuals who had previously received influenza
vaccine were also noted between groups. The vaccine/
vaccine group included 10 (38%) individuals who had
received vaccine previously, whereas the vaccine/placebo
group included 5 (17%) and the placebo/placebo group 5
(18%). Despite these differences, pre-existing antibody
levels to the three antigens of the vaccine between groups
were similar (see Table 3).
Age prevalence of ill antibodies within the trial
population before vaccination
Table I suggests that HI antibodies to the H 1N 1 and the
H3N2 surface antigens of the vaccine were uniformly
distributed between all age groups except for the > 52
years cohort, where lower titres to A/Brazil/11/78 were
present The statistical significance of this observation
was tested by dividing the population into individuals
aged < 52 years and > 52 years and those with HI titres of
< 10 and >__ 10. Significantly fewer in the --> 52 year group
had measureable antibody levels to A/Brazil/l 1/78
(Fisher's exact test;p < 0.05). Members of this group also
showed a diminished capacity to induce an HI response to
H1N1 vaccine antigens (see Table 4). Table 1 reveals that

Reactions of volunteers to vaccine and placebo
Table 2 shows the percentages of volunteers showing
reactions or pain in the various schedules. No significant
differences occurred between schedules 1'or the number of
individuals showing none as compared with one or more
reactions for local pain, local reactions and systemic
reactions. When all symptoms were grouped into categories of 0, 1 and > 2 reactions, significantly fewer local
reactions were noted for the second compared with the
first injection for all schedules (Stuart-Maxwcll test:
p < 0.05). Furthermore, there is no evidence to suggest that
reported local pain or local reactions after the first
injection resulted in withdrawal. Hence, it appears
unlikely that withdrawal based upon local pain or local
reactions greatly biases the results.
HI response to vaccine
Levels of HI antibody to influenza surface antigens
present in the vaccine for the first three bleeds (0, 4 and 6
weeks) are shown in Table 3. All sera were treated for
removal ofinhibitors and titrated in parallel. It was shown
using the Stuarl-Maxwell test for matched pairs that
antibody levels ['or all three surface antigens increased
significantly after a single dose of vaccine (p < 0.001). The
response to B/Singapore/222/79 was much poorer than
that ofthe A antigens. However, no statistically significant
increase in antibody was noted to any of the antigens in
the group given a second dose of vaccine. These trends are
summarized in Figure l a.
Fourfold or greater rises in antibody to A/Brazii/I 1/78
(HINI) was noted in 70% of the combined V/P and V/V
groups after a single dose of vaccine. Similar rises to A/
Bangkok/I/79 (H3N2) and B/Singapore/222/i 79 occurred
in 52 and 11%, respectively.
Only one member of the placebo group showed a
fourfold or greater rise to A/Brazil/l 1/78 and another to

HI response to HIN1 and H3N2 antigens by age
following a single dose of vaccine
Data for the two vaccine groups were pooled and
expressed as a percentage of individuals in a particular
age cohort showing HI titres of < 10. 10 to 20 and > 40
(Table4). Because age cohorts between 16 and 51 showed
similar responses, their data were pooled and compared
with the > 52 years cohort according to whether HI levels
of_> 40 or < 40 were present. Significantly fewer vaccinees
in the >_ 52 years cohort had HI titres of > 40 to
A/Brazil/i 1/78 (Fisher's exact test: p < 0.02). Lower
responses were also noted for A/Bangkok/l/79, but these
differences were not significant.
NI responses to vaccination
Because the NI test is less sensitive than the HI
procedure, NI responses were determined only in those
sera showing a fourfold or greater HI response to
vaccination, However, no increase in titre to either the Ni
or the N2 antigens could be detected. The relative
insensitivity of the test is shown by the absence of a
detectable NI response in two placebo sera, one showing a
greater than fourfold HI rise to A/Brazil/11/78 (final titre
160) and the other a fourfold rise to A/Bangkok/l/79 (final
titre 40) following presumed natural infection.

Duration of the HI responses to vaccination
Sera from volunteers were collected after six months
and titrated for HI antibody in parallel with sera collected
two weeks after the last injection, i.e. six weeks after the
commencement of the trial. The results in Figure lb
suggest that a drop in geometric mean titrcs occurred lot
antibodies to HINI and H3N2 componcnls of the
vaccine. However. when the Stuart-Maxwell test was
applied to individual data, using titre categories of'( 20.
40-80 and _> 80. a statistically significant (p < 0.05)
reduction in antibody titrc to A/Bangkok/l/79 only was
noted for the vaccine/placebo schedule.
Comparative plaque reduction and HI responses
to the B/Singapore/222/79 component of the
vaccine
Because the HI response to B/Singapore/222/79 was
poor, a number of sera from each group were retitratcd in
parallel by both the plaque-reduction (PR) and HI
techniques. The results in Table 5 indicate that the PR test
is appreciably more sensitive and that fourfold or greater
increases in titre occurred in proportions approximating
those observed for A/Bangkok/I/79, but less than that for
A/Brazil/11/78 by HI tests, for both vaccination
schedules. The plaque reduction data werc transformed
logarithmically to achieve approximate normalit3'. An
analysis of variance was carried out on the transformed
data and. as expected, thc vaccine groups were found to be
significantly higher than the placebo (p < 0.05). No
statistically significant difference was noted due to a
second dose of vaccine: the higher GMT for the group
given two doses ofvaccine in Tabh,5 was largely due to a
single serum with a very high titre.
Association between seroconversion and the
reported presence of respiratory illness among
volunteers
At the conclusion of the trial each volunteer was
questioned as to his or her experience of respiratory
illness during the preceding six months, which included
the winter season (June-August). Despite the reported
presence of illness in 30-50% of each of the three
groups, fourfold or greater serological rises over the six
week levels to A/Bangkok/l/79 occurred over the
period in only two of 19 in one of the vaccine groups
and in three of 20 in the placebo group; only one
individual from each of these groups had actually
experienced respiratory illness. These findings indicate
that very little influenza activity was present within the
trial population during the period.

Comparison of nasal wash plaque reduction and

The serum responses to vaccination against
A/Brazil/l 1/78 in a proportion of volunteers was
compared with the response in concentrated nasal
secretions, as determined by a plaque reduction test. A
summary of the individual results is given in Table 6. It is
apparent that, although there is a broad general agreement between the two antibody levels, the serum response
tends to be much higher. The overall results for each
group are summarized in Table 7. Although the numbers
are small, no increase in nasal antibody was evident from
the administration of a second dose of vaccine.
Discussion
The present study confirms and extends the findings of
others for influenza A subunit vaccines, that an adequate
serological response was produced from a single dose in a
population previously exposed to viruses of similar
serotype 4-5. The haemagglutinin from the H INI virus
A/Brazil/11/78 produced the greatest response (Figure/a),
possibly because H 1N 1 viruses had been circulating in the
test population longer than those antigenically similar to

A/Bangkok/l/79. More extensive priming is also suggested because higher levels of pre-existing HI antibody to
A/Brazil/l 1/78 than to A/Bangkok/l/79 were observed.
Antibody levels to the three haemagglutinin antigens of
the vaccine remained relatively stable during the six
months following vaccination by all schedules (Figure lb).
Similar findings have been reported for adults, but not
children, administered a single dose of influenza A swine
subunit vaccine t'.
Studies with subunit influenza A swine vaccines have
suggested that, in unprimed individuals, two doses must
be administered to achieve a significant antibody response,
whereas with whole virus vaccines only a single does is
required 5. In the present study, there was little evidence of
earlier priming by B/Singapore/222/79 from HI tests
(Table 1). Despite this, no increase in antibody titre to this
antigen is apparent following the administration of a second
dose (Figure la: Table 3). Possibly the subunits produced by
sodium deoxycholate are larger than those produced by
other disruptive agents and their antigenic properties may, in
consequence, approximate that of whole viruses.
Alternatively, because of the low sensitivity of influenza B HI
tests (Table 3: Ref. 15) the pre-bleed antibody titres in
Table 1 may not be a true indication of earlier priming by
similar viruses.
Feery et aL 4 have shown that individuals with high
levels of pre-existing antibodies did not respond
efficiently to deoxycholate vaccine which could explain
the failure to produce a further response from a second
injection in the present study. In the present study, nonresponders with pre-existing antibody levels of< 10. 10.20
and _> 40 to the first dose of A/Brazil/11/78
haemagglutinin comprised 19% (3/16), 15% (3/20), 46%
(6/13) and 71% (5/7) respectively, ofvaccinees. However, a
similar proportional increase for the A/Bangkok/l/79
haemagglutinin was not apparent and the corresponding
figures were 26%. 42%, 40% and 33%.
No reactions specifically attributable to the vaccine
could be detected (Tabh, 2). which may reflect the
relatively low concentration of haemagglutinin antigen
present compared with that reported in studies with other
"split" virus vaccines, where a low incidence of reactions
was reported 6-8-t6-'.
The failure to induce a significant response to the
influenza A neuraminidase antigens could have been due
to their inactivation during vaccine preparation. This
seems unlikely to be due to action of sodium deoxycholate
as no responses were observed in a subsequent trial using
whole virus vaccines containing the same surface antigens
(unpublished observations) and is probably due to the
lability of the particular viral neuraminidases. Good
responses to the neuraminidase antigens present were
obtained following natural infection provided that the
final HI titre was 320 (unpublished observations).
Evidence from antibody levels in all groups
immediately after vaccination and six months later
suggests that influenza A or B viruses were not circulating
within the trial population. Despite this, a substantial
number of participants reported the presence of respiratory symptoms over the period, which included the
Australian winter of 1981. These findings suggest that
the reported presence of respiratory symptoms alone,
without concurrent seroconversion and/or virus isolation
data, should not be used as criteria of vaccine efficacy.
Of interest was the finding that a relatively poor
response occurred in members of the 52 years and older
cohort to the Hl and to the lesser extent the H3 antigens
following the administration of a single dose of vaccine
(Table 4). The poor responses of members of the group
appeared to correlate with lower detectable priming by
these viruses (Table 1), which may be due to a general
decline in their immunologic competence. Similar
findings were made by Marine and Thomas ~s, who
showed that younger subjects responded better than older
ones to a whole virus vaccine prepared from A/Aichi/2/68
(H3N2). However, depressed responses were not apparent
in the elderly in much larger trials using influenza A swine
vaccines ~.
Individuals with high serum H1 titres to A/Brazil/11/78
tended to have higher neutralizing antibody levels in their
nasal secretions, although the latter response to vaccination was lower (Tables 6 and 7). The low nasal response
may be an indication that parenterally administered
vaccines are relatively inefficient at inducing effective
immunity at respiratory membranes. Lower responses in
nasal secretions have also been noted by others n9,2°.
We conclude that trivalent sodium deoxycbolate
vaccines containing 7 p,g haemagglutinin antigen
produced a satisfactory response to a single dose in a
primed population and are reaction-free. Antibody levels
remained stable for at least six months after
vaccination.
