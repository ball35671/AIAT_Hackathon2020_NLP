The reactogenicity, immunogenicity and protection efficacy of a serum
inhibitor-resistant live attenuated influenza AIB ("Alice"/R-75) vaccine was
determined in a group of healthy young volunteers. The influenza A component was derived from A/England/42/72 (H3N2) strain, and the B component
from BIHong Kong/5/72 strain. Sixty-eight subjects had hemagglutination
inhibition (HAI) antibody titers to influenza A hemagglutinin (HA) antigen of 5
1 :8 ("low A" group) and 75 had similarly low antibody titers to B HA antigen
("low B" group). Two inocula given 14 days apart consisted of vaccine in two
doses (VV); one dose of vaccine followed by placebo (VP); or two doses of
placebo (PP). The reactogenicity of the vaccine was low, with approximately
25% of subjects in both the immunized and placebo categories having symptoms mainly of respiratory nature. The A component of the vaccine was
immunogenic with 90.9% of the subjects in the low A group VV category
showing seroconversion. By contrast, only 20% of VV subjects in the low B
group seroconverted to B antigen. The vaccine afforde-d significant protection
against natural challenge of influenza A/Port Chalmers/l/73 (H3N2), a strain
which has undergone a slight antigenic drift. There was no difference in
protection afforded either by one or two doses of the vaccine. Thus the overall
protection efficacy following at least one dose of the vaccine was 80.8% Cp =

The purpose of the present study was to
determine the immunogenic response to
an attenuated live intranasal influenza A/
B ("Alice"/R-75) vaccine in young adults
18-35 years of age, and to assess protection
from subsequent natural infection with influenza viruses.
The vaccine was well tolerated. The A
component of the vaccine was found to be
immunogenic. The overall protection efficacy against natural challenge of influenza AIPort Chalmers/l/73 (H3N2) in subjeds who received at least one dose of the
vaccine was 80.8 per cent (p = .01). The
immunogenicity of the B component was
unsatisfactory, however. 
50 MICHAEL W. RYTEL ET AL.
The vaccine. The principle of attenuation employed in the preparation of the
bivalent influenza A/B vaccine is based on
the observations of Beare et a1 (2), who
saw that the passage of influenza viruses
in eggs, in the presence of increasing concentrations of inactivated horse serum, results in the development of strains which
are inhibitor resistant and whose virulence is attenuated.
The influenza A component of the combined influenza A/B vaccine is identical to
the one which was employed (and. described) by us previously (1). ~efeked to as
"Alice" strain, it has been developed by the
Recherche et Industrie Therapeutiques
(RIT), Belgium, from a recombinant made
by Dr. G. C. Schild, WHO Influenza Center, Mill Hill, London, England.
The B component of the vaccine (developed by the RIT) is comprised of the socalled R-75 recombinant of one of the most
recent strains of influenza B, B/Hong
Kong/5/72 with the serum inhibitor resistant strain of B/Russia/69. The R-75 strain
has the antigenic characteristics of B/
Hong Kong/5/72. Inhibitor resistance was
determined by incubating 4 HA units of R75 and of the parental strains with serial
two-fold dilutions of heat inactivated serum for 1 hr at room temperature, and
then adding chick red blood cells. R-75, as
well as its parent strain, B/Russia/69,
were found to be inhibitor resistant,
whereas B/Hong Kong/5/72 was not. The
R-75 vaccine strain has been prepared in
leucosis-free eggs and no extraneous infectious agents have been found in numerous
safety tests in eggs and animals (Huygelen C, Recherche et Industrie Therapeutiques, B-1330, Rixensart, Belgium; personal communication).
The bivalent A/B vaccine was distributed for clinical trials in the United States
by the Smith, Kline and French Co. (SK &
F), Philadelphia, PA.
Study subjects. Young adult female student nurse volunteers, after signing an
informed consent form, were prescreened
for influenza A and B HA1 antibody titers.
Sixty-eight subjects with HA1 antibody titers to influenza A/England/42/72 (H3N2)
of 5 1:8 (referred to as "low A group), and
75 with similarly low titers to influenza B/
Hong Kong/8/73 ("low B") were entered
into the study. They were then randomly
assigned into three subgroups to receive
either two doses of the vaccine (category
"VV"), one dose of the vaccine and one of
the placebo WP), or two doses of placebo
("PP") at 14 days apart. In the "low A
group the distribution of subjects was as
follows: VV = 22, VP = 23, PP = 23 subjects; in the "low B": VV = 25, VP = 25, PP
= 25 subjects.
Study plan. The first dose of the vaccine
was given on November 18 and 19,1974. A
short medical history was obtained from
each subject before vaccination. Vaccine
and placebo were reconstituted immediately prior to administration in the vehicle
(five per cent sucrose).provided by SK & F.
Reconstituted material was instilled intranasally as a coarse wet spray. The subjects were supine with head extended, and
remained so for 1 min following immunization. The individual dose of the vaccine
was comprised of 107.2 EIDSo of influenza
type A, and EIDso of type B. Immediate reactions to dosing, such as sneezing,
stinging and bad taste, were recorded.
After administration of the vaccine, participants returned to their normal activities. Participants recorded daily, for six
days, signs and symptoms they experienced after vaccination. Occurrence of
symptoms was recorded in the case report
form using the following scale: 0 = no
symptoms, 1+ = mild, 2+ = moderate,
and 3+ = severe. Subjects also took their
oral temperatures daily during the sixday
observation period. The study was "single
blind".
Epidemiologic surveillance. Vaccinated
and control groups were followed longitudinally during the winter and spring of 
FIELD TRIAL OF INFLUENZA A/B VACCINE 5 1
1974-1975 for occurrence of acute. respiratory disease (ARD). Clinical information
was obtained from two sources: 1) records
of visits to the student health clinic for
ARD ("reported .illness"), and 2) survey
cards compiled weekly by each participant
which contained a tally of respiratory and
systemic symptoms, and a record of their
temperatui-es. Thirty-five subjects reported to the clinic with an ARD. At the
time of clinic visit, acute (and subsequently convalescent) serum was obtained
and nasal washes collected for viral isolation. At the end of the study, the survey
cards were reviewed. Subjects were considered to have had a "flu-like" illness if they
had three or more .symptoms of an ARD
and a temperature of r 37.22 C (99 F). In
addition, . symptom. scores were compiled
on a weekly basis. These were derived
from the number and severity. of,symptoms
graded ac2ording to the scale listed above.
Six month sera were collected on all study
subjects to determine persistence of antibody titers and the incidence of unreported
infections.
Antibody determinations. Serum HA1
antibody titers were determined on days 0
and 30 after vaccination against A/England/42/72 (H3N2) and B/Hong Kong/8/73
antigens using a standard HAI technique
(1) and starting with the initial serum dilution at 1:8.
Nasal washes were taken in 10 ml lactate Ringer's solution on day 0 and 30 from
16 subjects and concentrated 10-fold. Local
antibodies were determined by neutralization test as previously described (1). Fifty
TCID,, unitsl0.l ml of influenza A/England/42/72 (H3N2) were employed in the
test.
Viral isolation. Viral isolation was done
in primary rhesus monkey kidney ce1ls.a~
described previously (1). Isolates were
typed by HA1 tests employing antisera.to
influenza AIHong Kong/8/66, A/England/
42/72, and &Port Chalmers/l/73.
Reactogenicity. The vaccine was well
tolerated. The incidence of symptoms following the first dose of the vaccine' is presented in table 1. Since both categories VV
and VP were given the vaccine. at this
time, the.results for both are combined. A
total of approximately 25 per cent of the
subjectsin the immunizedand placebo categories in both low A and low B groups
were symptomatic. There was no difference, therefore, in the total incidence of
symptoms or in the types of symptoms
(i.e., upper respiratory tract infection
(URI), systemic symptoms, etc.) between
individuals who received the vaccine or
the placebo vehicle. The incidence of
symptoms after the second dose was similar (i.e., about 20 per cent), with no significant difference between various 'groups receiving either the vaccine or the placebo.
Zmmunogenicity. The initial HAI antibody responses to influenza A and B antigens were analyzed separately for low A
and low B groups, as subjects were preselected to these groups on the basis of the

pre-immunization HAI antibody titers of
5 1:8 to the A and B HA antigens respectively. Thus, four-fold antibody rises in
these groups represent true seroconversions to the respective HA antigens. In the
low A group, the seroconversion to type A
HA antigen in the VV category was 90.9
per cent (20122) and in the VP, 78.3 per
cent (18123); in the PP category, none of
the subjects had a four-fold rise (0123). The
seroconversion rate to A antigen in the low
B group subjects (all with preexistent antibodies) was much lower: 32 per cent (8125)
in the VV, 8 per cent (2125) in the VP, and
nil in the PP category. Thus, the overall
seroconversion rate in subjects receiving
two doses of the vaccine was 59.6 per cent
(28147), and those getting one dose, 41.7
per cent (20148).
Geometric mean HAI antibody titers
(GMT) are listed in table 2. It is apparent
from these data that in subjects with
preexistent antibodies, two doses of the
vaccine were required for seroconversion
and significant elevation of the GMTs.
Antibody titers persisted for six months
following immunization.
The seroconversion was much lower for
the type B HA antigen in the low B as well
as the low A group. The combined response in VV and VP categories of the low
B group was 30 per cent (15150) if both twoand four-fold rises are included, or 20 per
cent (5125) in the VV category considering
only four-fold rises. There was no true seroconversion in any VP or PP subject (0150).
Similarly, in the low A group, the seroconversion to B was 9.1 per cent (2122) in the
W, 4.3 per cent (1123) in the VP and nil (01
23) in the PP category.
Considering only the local neutralizing
antibody response to influenza A in nasal
secretions in the low A group subjects, the
seroconversion ratio in the vaccines (W
and VP) was 68.8 per cent. None of the PP
subjects showed rises in local neutralizing
antibodies.
Attack rates and protection efficacy. Influenza attack rates were established by
viral isolation and serology obtained when
the volunteers presented themselves to the
student health clinic with symptoms of an
ARD. In addition, evidence for infection
was provided by the HAI antibody screening of the sera obtained at 30 days and six
months following initial immunization.
Data on unreported illness experienced
during this interval was provided by survey cards.
Considering the low A group alone,
there were seven influenza infections in
the PP category. Four were documented by
viral isolation accompanied by a four-fold
rise in HAI antibodies during an ARD for
which they reported to the clinic, and
three had serologic evidence of intercurrent infection at six months. The latter
subjects had an illness episode compatible
with influenza, as determined from their
survey cards according to the criteria
listed under Epidemiologic surveillance in
Materials and Methods. Specifically, subject A03 had one week of respiratory and
systemic symptoms, with a score of 16 and
maximum temperature of 38.33 C (100 F).
Convalescence lasted two additional
weeks. Subject A21 had a week-long flulike illness with a symptom score of seven
and maximum temperature of 38.67 C
(101.6 F). The symptom score in subject
A63 was 15, and maximum temperature
was 37.22 C (99 F). All of these illnesses
occurred during January and February, at

which time influenza infection was documented by viral isolatio;:? and serology in
patients seen in the clinic. Thus, on the
basis of both clinical criteria and epidemiologic grounds, we conclude that these patients had influenza. The influenza attack
rate, therefore, in the low A group subjects
who were given placebo was 30.4 per cent
(7123).
By contrast, the attack rate in the VV
category was 4.5 per cent (1122) and in the
VP group, 4.3 per cent (1123); the combined
rate in the immunized subjects was 4.4 per
cent (2145). Both of the ill subjects were
diagnosed as having influenza by viral isolation at the time of an acute ARD seen in
the clinic. Interestingly, both subjects had
low HAI antibody titers at 30 days following immunization: 1:16 (VV) and 1:8 (VP).
The HAI titer in the VP subject, but not in
the VV subject, did undergo a four-fold rise
at the time of acute illness. No additional
cases were identified in the VV and VP
categories of the low A group by the six
month serologic survey. The viral isolates
were identified by HAI as being similar to
influenza AIPort Chalmers/l/73 (H3N2)
strain. These data are displayed in table 3.
In the low B group, two additional influenza A infections were identified: One (in
category VP) by four-fold rise in HA1 antibodies between acute and convalescent
specimens (1:16-1:64) obtained during a
clinic visit for an ARD, and one in the PP
category picked up during the &-month
serologic screening (1:16-154). The latter
subject also had evidence (from survey
cards) of an intercurrent flu-like illness
with ARD symptom score of three and
maximum temperature of 37.33 C (99.2 F).
This illness occurred in January. There
was no evidence of infection with influenza
B in any of the study subjects.
Since all the episodes of infection were
accompanied by illness, efficacy of the vaccine (table 3) is expressed in terms of protection against illness associated with infection. For purposes of statistical analysis, the results are pooled for reported and
unreported illnesses, as the small number
of cases of reported illness preclude meaningful analysis. Data are provided separately for subjects in the low A group because they were preselected on the basis of
low initial HA1 antibody titers to influenza
A. Thus, any protection obtained would be
ascribable to the effect of the vaccine. The
protection efficacy for subjects in the low A

group who received at least one dose of the
vaccine was 85.5 per cent h2 = 6.83, p <
.01; Fisher's Exact Test,p = .01). The overall protection rate was 80.8 per cent (p <
.025 and p = .01, respectively) with a
slightly higher rate noted in subjects who
received two doses of the vaccine (87.4 per
cent versus 74.6 per cent). This latter finding represented a difference of only one
subject, however.
DISCUSSION
The reported experience with the influenza A component of the bivalent live attenuated serum inhibitor resistant (AIB)
vaccine has been uniformly favorable to
date. In our studies and those of others
summarized in our previous report (I), the
vaccine containing the "Alice" strain of
influenza AlEnglandl42172 (H3N2) was
found to be immunogenic, relatively nonreactogenic and to give a high degree of
protection on experimental viral challenge. The seroconversion ratio in our
monovalent influenza A vaccine study in
individuals with initial HA1 antibody titers of < 1:8 was 87.2 per cent, and in those
with 1:8 it was 88.9 per cent. This is quite
comparable to the conversion ratio of 90.9
per cent obtained in the present study in
the preselected population whose preimmunization antibody titers were 5 13, and
who received two doses of the vaccine. The
geometric mean titers were also comparable. Thus, no "interference" of the B component could be discerned. In both studies,
subjects with pre-existent antibody levels
had lower seroconversion ratios than those
without.
During the monitored "Respiratory Disease Season" (Winter 1974-Spring 19751,
Milwaukee and other "North-Central"
states experienced an outbreak of influenza A/Port Chalmers infection in January and February 1975 (3). This allowed us
to assess the protection efficacy afforded by
the present bivalent vaccine containing inwhich had undergone a slight antigenic
drift in HA antigens. The protection efficacy against illness associated with influenza A infection in subjects in the low A
group who received at least one dose of the
vaccine was 85.5 per cent and in those who
received at least one dose in the combined
A and B groups, 80.8 per cent. At least one
other laboratory group, Noble et a1 (41,
have reported good protection in a population which had been immunized with the
"Alice" strain of influenza A vaccine before
an outbreak of influenza AIPort Chalmers.
These findings are important for two
reasons. First, they provide additional evidence that a live attenuated inhibitor resistant influenza A vaccine affords significant protection against natural challenge.
Second, and more importantly, protection
was shown against a strain of influenza
which, although still H3N2, had undergone an antigenic drift (i.e., &England
versus AIPort Chalmers). It should be
noted that, because we did not employ in
this study a killed vaccine containing the
England strain of influenza A, it is impossible to make direct comparison of the efficacy of the two types of vaccines. Even so,
previous reports in the literature present
conflicting results on the efficacy of killed
vaccines against influenza strains with an
analogous minor antigenic variation. For
example, even though Stiver et al (5)
showed relatively good protection (60 per
cent) afforded by the AIHong Kong vaccine
in preventing &England variant of influenza A in 1972, others have found no protection on the basis of attack and virus
isolation rates (6), nor on the basis of attack and death rates (7). Ruben et a1 (7)
saw some modification in the duration of
febrile illness in the vaccinees. The resolution of the question as to the "breadth of
protection of live vs. killed influenza vaccines (as well as of the duration of irnrnunity), must await additional studies.
There are only limited data in the literafluenza A/England/42/72 (H3N2) strain , ture on the live-attenuated influenza B
against natural challenge with a strain vaccine strain "R-75" either alone or in 
FIELD TRIAL OF INFLUENZA A/B VACCINE 55
combination with the "Alice" strain. In the
present study, only 20 per cent of the subjects in the low B group who received two
doses of the vaccine (VV) had four-fold
HA1 antibody rises following immunization. None in the low B VP category had
such rises. If we include subjects with twofold antibody rises, then the seroconversion ratios become 36 per cent in the W
category and 24 per cent in the VP category. Using the same intluenza A/B vaccine, Miller et a1 (8) found that 41.7 per
cent of the VV recipients and 24.6 per cent
of the VP recipients with initial B titers 5
1:16 had four-fold or greater HAI antibody
titer rises. The seroconversion in subjects
given two doses of the monovalent B vaccine (VV) was 50 per cent (9). Spencer et a1
(10) found that only 14 per cent of subjects
given the AIB vaccine had r four-fold HAI
antibody rises to the B HA antigen, although, unlike in the present study, the
response to the A antigen that they observed was almost equally poor. Subjects
given the monovalent B vaccine alone had
a 38 per cent seroconversion rate, which,
although higher, is still far short of the
responses to the A component reported in
most studies. It appears, therefore, that
the "R-75" strain of influenza BIHong
Kong vaccine is of a relatively low degree
of immunogenicity, presumably because it
is poorly infective. In view of the absence
of influenza B outbreaks during the 1974-
1975 winter season, it was impossible to
assess the protection efficacy afforded by
this vaccine strain.
