The "R-75" strain live, attenuated, serum inhibitor-resistant influenza B
vaccine was administered intranasally by drops in two doses 14 days apart to 21
volunteers. Each vaccinee was paired with a close associate (roommate or
workmate) who similarly received two doses of a placebo solution. Although
about 50% of both vaccine and placebo recipients complained of symptoms after
dosage, the severity of symptoms was greater in vaccine recipients. Fourfold
serum hemagglutination-inhibiting antibody titer rises occurred in 38% of vaccine recipients, and four vaccinees had fourfold titer rises of nasal hemagglutination-inhibiting antibody. Vaccine virus was isolated from three asymptomatic
vaccine recipients. There was no virological or serological evidence of the
vaccine virus spreading to placebo recipients.
Although influenza A viruses are responsible
for most major influenza epidemics and all pandemics, considerable morbidity and mortality
can be attributed to influenza B viral infections
(8). In recent years, inactivated influenza A
vaccines have proven successful in the prevention of disease caused by influenza A viral
strains (7). Modern influenza B vaccines are
probably also useful in influenza B prophylaxis,
but only vague evidence of efficacy is available.
A major drawback of all inactivated viral vaccines is the requirement for frequent booster
doses.
In the past decade, new methods of attenuating influenza viruses have been developed that
have facilitated production of candidate live
viral vaccines (6). We have recently observed
promising results in trials with a live, attenuated, candidate influenza A vaccine (10). Encouraged by these findings, we undertook the
presently described study with "R-75" strain
influenza B vaccine.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Vaccine and placebo. R-75 strain vaccine is a
recombinant of influenza B/Hong Kong/5/72 and the
serum inhibitor-resistant influenza strain B/Russia/
69. The recombinant is not inhibited by horse and
guinea pig sera and has the antigenic characteristics of B/Hong Kong/5/72. It was produced by Recherche et Industrie Therapeutiques, Brussels, Belgium, and supplied by Smith, Kline and French
Laboratories, Philadelphia, Pa., in multiple-dose
vials of lyophilized material (10/7.5 mean egg infective doses/dose). The vaccine was reconstituted immediately prior to use with 2.5 ml of a 5% sucrose
solution and administered by dropper (5 drops/nostril) to a supine subject with the head extended for 1
min.
The placebo, supplied in single-dose vials, was
allantoic fluid reconstituted just prior to use with 0.5
ml of a 5% sucrose solution and administered by
dropper (5 drops/nostril) in a manner identical to
that for R-75 strain vaccine.
Study population. Twenty-one pairs of UCLA students and employees who either lived together or
worked in close proximity to each other were selected for participation in the study. Informed consent was obtained from all participants. Volunteers
were of both sexes, and their ages ranged from 24 to
50 years old.
Procedure of study. After a medical history was
compiled and a physical examination performed,
blood was obtained for a complete blood count and
glucose, creatinine, urea nitrogen, glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, and
bilirubin values; a urine sample was also procured
for routine studies and microscopic examination.
By single blind control, one of each volunteer pair
received two doses 14 days apart of R-75 strain vaccine intranasally. In a similar manner, the other
participant in the pair received the placebo solution.
Blood for serological study was obtained on days 0,
14, and 30. Nasal swabs for attempted viral isolation were collected on days 0, 1, 2, and 7 after each
dosage and placed in 2 ml of Hanks balanced salt
solution containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin and
standard antibiotics. Specimens for viral isolation
were inoculated into tissue culture immediately
after collection. Specimens for nasal antibody
studies were obtained on days 0, 14, and 30 by a
nasal wash with 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline
solution followed by blowing.
At the time of immunization, volunteers were
asked to report immediate taste sensations. In addi584

tion, study participants were asked to record and
grade, on a scale of 0 to 3 (0, none; 1, mild; 2,
moderate; 3, severe), their specific clinical symptoms for each of 7 days after every immunization.
Virus isolation techniques. Each day 0 specimen
was inoculated into two tubes each (0.1 ml/tube) of
rhesus monkey kidney (MK) and WI38 tissue cultures. Subsequent specimens (0.1 ml) were inoculated into MK tissue cultures and frequently also
into chicken embryo trachea organ cultures. Maintenance fluid was Eagle basal medium with standard antibiotics. Cultures were incubated at 35°C on
roller drums (15 revolutions per hour) and examined
three times weekly; the medium was changed every
3 to 4 days. Hemadsorption with 0.4% guinea pig
erythrocytes was performed on all MK tissue cultures without cytopathic effect on day 14. All MK
tissue cultures and chicken embryo trachea organ
cultures were blind-passed once in MK tissue cultures and examined for hemadsorption on day 14, if
a cytopathic effect had not been observed.
Serological techniques. Influenza B hemagglutination-inhibiting (HAI) antibody studies were performed by standard microtiter methods (9). All
sera were initially treated with receptor-destroying
enzyme, and all assays were done on paired specimens.
Nasal washings were homogenized, concentrated
with Sephadex G-200, and examined for immunoglobulin A, total protein, and influenza B HAI and
neutralizing antibody. Samples for the study of nasal HAI antibody were treated with receptor-destroying enzyme. Total nasal protein was measured
by optical density at 280 nm against a standard
curve obtained with crystalline bovine serum albumin. Immunoglobulins were determined by radial
immunodiffusion with a 7S immunoglobulin A serum standard. Resultant values were adjusted to
11S secretory immunoglobulin A levels by multiplying times a factor of three (10).
To determine nasal neutralizing antibody titers,
the Sephadex G-200 concentrates were diluted 1:1
with Eagle basal medium containing 0.5% gelatin
and antibiotics, heat-inactivated at 56°C for 30 min,
serially diluted and mixed with an equal volume of a
virus mixture containing 32 mean tissue culture
infective doses (TCID.,o) of virus per 0.1 ml, and
incubated at room temperature for 1 h. A portion
(0.2 ml) of each serum-virus mixture was added to
each of two MK tissue cultures. Cultures were observed daily for cytopathic effect and examined for
hemadsorption on day 6.
RESULTS
Clinical findings. Immediately after the first
and second intranasal administrations 62% and
57%, respectively, of vaccine recipients and 48%
of placebo recipients noted an unusual taste
sensation. Since there was little difference between the taste reported by vaccine or placebo
recipients, it is most likely that the taste sensation was due to the allantoic fluid, which was in
the placebo as well as the vaccine, rather than
the vaccine virus itself.
Frequency and severity of clinical symptoms
during the two 7-day observation periods after
vaccine or placebo administration are presented in Table 1. Fifty-seven percent of vaccine recipients and 52% of placebo recipients
had one or more symptoms after the initial
dose; an equal number of vaccine and placebo
recipients had one or more symptoms after the
second dose.
Whereas the overall frequency as noted
above did not differ to any degree between vaccine recipients and those receiving the placebo,
the symptom index was considerably greater in
vaccine recipients; this difference was largely
due to severe and multiple influenza-like complaints in three vaccinees. Rhinitis, cough,
pharyngitis, headache, malaise, and myalgia
were all more prominent in vaccine recipients
than in placebo recipients.
A physical examination and routine laboratory studies were perforned on each individual
at the initial visit and on day 30. No study
participant had any physical or laboratory abnormality that could be associated with vaccination.
Vaccine virus isolation studies. To determine the sensitivity of our viral isolation systems, R-75 strain vaccine was titrated in MK
tissue cultures and chicken trachea organ cultures. Reconstituted vaccine with an initial titer of 107-2 mean egg infective doses 0.1 ml had a
titer of 107 TCID;J0.1 ml and lOff 3 TCID/0.1
ml in MK tissue cultures and chicken trachea
organ cultures, respectively. Vaccine virus was
isolated from three vaccine recipients (Table 2).
From one subject, virus was recovered on day 1
after both the initial and second immunizations. Ofthe other two isolates, one occurred on
day 2 after the first immunization and the other
resulted from a day 2 specimen after the second
dose. All isolates were in MK tissue cultures
and were only noted after blind passage. Participants from whom virus was isolated had no

associated clinical findings. Vaccine virus was
not isolated from any placebo recipients.
Serology. The serum geometric mean influenza B antibody titer of R-75 strain vaccinees
rose from initial values of 9 to 14 on day 14 and
18 on day 30. No change in the influenza B HAI
antibody titer in placebo recipients occurred.
Thirty-eight percent of R-75 vaccinees had fourfold serum influenza B HAI antibody titer rises;
no placebo recipient had a similar fourfold titer
rise. Three of the five vaccinees with initial
HAI titers 55 had fourfold antibody titer rises,
whereas only 25% of those vaccinees with initial titers .10 had similar titer rises.
Nasal-wash specimens from days 0, 14, and
30 were available from 13 vaccine and 15 placebo recipients. Three vaccinees (23%) had fourfold titer rises in nasal HAI antibody, and two
of these three also had a fourfold neutralizing
antibody titer response. In two instances, the
nasal antibody response was apparently transitory, since it was noted in day 14 but not in day
30 specimens.
Only one subject with a nasal antibody response had a concomitant fourfold serum antibody titer rise, and none of the three vaccinees
from whom virus was isolated had a nasal antibody response, although one of these three volunteers did have a fourfold rise in serum HAI
antibody titer.
When viral isolation results and serum and
nasal antibody studies are considered together,
13 of the 21 (62%) vaccinees had evidence of
infection with the vaccine virus (Table 2).
There was no serological or virological evidence
of a spread of vaccine viral infection to placebo
recipients. It is also to be noted that clinical
symptomatology could not be correlated with
either virological or serological evidence of vaccine viral infection. In fact, the symptom index
(symptom index = total symptom grade for
both 7-day observation periods/number of vaccinees with or without infection) in vaccinees
with serological or virological evidence of infection was less (index, 6.8) than that in vaccinees
without evidence of infection (index, 24.5).
DISCUSSION
The availability of an effective, live, attenuated influenza B vaccine would be a welcome
addition to influenza immunoprophylaxis.
Since a major antigenic shift apparently does
not occur with influenza B viruses and since
minor antigenic changes are less frequent than
with influenza A viruses, it would appear that
successful immunoprophylaxis could be obtained with attenuated influenza B viruses. An
obvious advantage of a live intranasally administered vaccine would be the elimination of
yearly intramuscular booster doses. Presumably, booster doses with a live vaccine would be
unnecessary. At times of significant antigenic
change, a new attenuated virus would need to
be developed and utilized.

CLINICAL TRIAL WITH R-75 STRAIN VACCINE 587
Although the majority of R-75 strain vaccine
recipients noted a distinct taste immediately
after immunization, this effect was not considered objectionable. Most volunteers stated they
preferred intranasal to parenteral vaccine administration. The limited size of the present
study makes a comparative statistical evaluation of symptomatology difficult. Approximately 50% of both vaccine and placebo recipients had one or more complaints during the 7-
day observation periods after dosages; this finding would suggest that complaints were not
vaccine related. However, by the symptom index, it would appear that the vaccine was indeed responsible for some illness. Previous
trials by other investigators with candidate,
attenuated, influenza B vaccines have also revealed some reactogenicity (1-5). This contrasts
with our findings from an inhibitor-resistant,
live, attenuated influenza A vaccine (10). Beare
et al. (2, 4) found that symptomatology in vaccine recipients correlated directly with antibody response. In contrast, the three vaccinees
in this study with the most marked symptomatology had neither virological nor serological
evidence of infection.
Vaccine virus was recovered from three vaccine recipients, indicating an isolation rate
similar to that noted by others (2, 4, 5). Since
the vaccine is prepared in eggs, it is probable
that egg inoculation would have been a more
sensitive indicator of infection. Interestingly,
chicken embryo trachea organ cultures were
less sensitive than MK tissue cultures. Although viral multiplication is an obvious necessity for successful immunization with a live
virus, the amount of virus shed is so small that
any spread from vaccinees to others appears
unlikely. Even during the close contact between vaccine and placebo recipients in this
study, no transmission occurred. This lack of
human spread could be important, as Beare et
al. (1) noted increased virulence after human
passage of an attenuated influenza B strain.
Serum antibody responses after immunization with R-75 strain vaccine were modest.
However, three of five vaccinees with initial
HAI antibody titers 56 had fourfold HAI antibody titer rises after immunization. It would
appear that pre-immunization antibody protected against vaccine viral infection. In a
study comparing live and killed influenza B
virus vaccines, Beare et al. (2) noted that 71% of
those given killed vaccine developed a serum
antibody response, whereas only 51% of live
virus vaccinees had a similar antibody response. However, when challenged intranasally with live virulent influenza B virus, 15% of
those initially receiving inactivated vaccine
were infected, whereas only 2% of the live virus
vaccine recipients were infected.
When compared with the results of our similar trials with "Alice" strain live, attenuated
influenza A vaccine, it would appear that the
R-75 strain is not a very promising vaccine
candidate (10). However, the most important
test of vaccine efficacy is the demonstration of
protection from natural challenge. It is quite
possible that the relatively poor serum and nasal antibody responses after R-75 strain immunization were not due to factors of the vaccine
per se, but to the fact that the volunteer population was relatively immune to influenza B
strains with the B/Hong Kong/72 antigenic
makeup. A more meaningful evaluation could
perhaps have been performed if vaccination
had been restricted to subjects known to be
seronegative for B/Hong Kong/72 antibody.
