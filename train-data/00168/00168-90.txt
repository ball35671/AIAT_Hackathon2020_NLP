Introduction: In Quebec, Canada, receipt of the 2009 AS03-adjuvanted pandemic H1N1 vaccine was associated with increased risk of anaphylaxis and other allergic-like events (ALE), especially among women
of childbearing age. In response to this safety signal, a case–control study was conducted to identify
potential risk factors.
Methods: A total of 435 ALE (50 anaphylaxis) occurring <24 h following pandemic vaccination were compared to 849 age-gender matched controls randomly selected from the provincial Pandemic Influenza
Vaccination Registry. More than 60 potential risk factors were evaluated through phone interviews and
included demographic information, medical history, medication use or acute respiratory illnesses (ARI)
concurrent with vaccination and other risk factors associated with general allergy. Odds ratios (ORs) with
95% confidence intervals were estimated with unconditional logistic regression.
Results: Factors associated with increased risk of anaphylaxis included concurrent ARI (18% cases vs.
4% controls, ORadj 7.67, 95%CI: 3.04–13.37), food allergy (26% cases vs. 4% controls, ORadj 3.84, 95%CI:
1.51–9.74) and vaccination during the first four weeks of the campaign (66% cases vs. 50% controls, ORadj
2.16, 95%CI: 1.10–4.25) whereas alcohol exposure (≥1 drink/week) was associated with reduced risk (29%
cases vs. 42% controls, ORadj 0.26, 95%CI: 0.13–0.57). These factors were also significantly associated with
any ALE but the strength of association was weaker. Allergy to components found in the vaccine (e.g.,
egg, thimerosal) was infrequent and did not significantly differ between cases and controls.
Conclusion: Increased anaphylaxis and other allergic-like events observed in association with AS03-
adjuvanted pandemic H1N1 vaccine remain mostly unexplained despite extensive risk factor review.
However, prior to mass vaccination with similar formulations this safety signal warrants further consideration and better understanding. In particular, the predominance among women of childbearing age
may be a clue to underlying biological or hormonal influences on adverse immunological responses to
vaccine.

1. Introduction
In 2009 in Quebec, Canada, the population was vaccinated in
public health clinics mostly with an AS03-adjuvanted monovalent

pandemic influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine (Arepanrix®, GlaxoSmithKline) By the end of the campaign, ∼4.4 million doses of
AS03-adjuvanted vaccine had been administered and overall AEFI
reporting rates for pandemic vaccines were 2–3 times greater than
usually seen with non-adjuvanted seasonal trivalent inactivated
vaccines (TIV) (51 vs. 19 cases per 100,000 doses) [1]. While general reporting was probably stimulated by the mass campaign and
the use of a new adjuvanted product, there was a disproportionate
reporting of allergic-like events (ALE). The rate of anaphylaxis alone
reached 8 cases per million doses a 20-fold increase compared to

the rate of 0.4 per million TIV doses reported during the previous
6 seasons [1]. This differential increase in reporting suggested that
anaphylaxis and other allergic-like events could not be explained
by stimulated reporting alone. Since 2010–2011,the reporting rates
for anaphylaxis and other allergic-like events observed with seasonal vaccine have returned to baseline levels (0.1–0.2 and 1.7–2.7
per 100,000 doses, respectively), although seasonal trivalent vaccines used since 2010 contain no adjuvant but the same pandemic
influenza strain and a greater amount of hemagluttinin (15 vs.
3.75 g).
Approximately 75% of ALE reports came from women (60% of
which were of childbearing age) and dose-adjusted rates of anaphylaxis were four times higher in women than in men (11.5 vs.
3.0 per million doses, respectively). Reports also came disproportionately from healthcare workers, who were twice as likely than
other vaccinees to report an allergic-like event following pandemic
vaccination. While 41% of cases reported a history of allergy to
either food, drugs or respiratory allergens, clinical investigations
conducted among nearly 100 reported cases showed that few, if
any, were IgE-mediated [2,3].
Research related to post-vaccination ALE has generally focused
on vaccine constituents that may be associated with anaphylaxis
(e.g., gelatin, egg proteins, latex, antibiotics) whereas host and
environmental factors have rarely been studied [4,5]. Immunological mechanisms involved in anaphylaxis may be IgE-dependent
(e.g., foods, venoms, medications, latex) or independent (e.g.,
radiocontrast media (RCM), NSAIDs, Dextran) [6–8]. Direct, nonimmunologic, mast cell activation has also been demonstrated
with alcohol, opiates, and RCM. Risk of anaphylaxis is affected
by age, gender, concomitant diseases (e.g., pulmonary and cardiovascular disease, atopy), concurrent medication, or alcohol use
[4–8]. Several other factors can amplify the severity of anaphylactic episodes (e.g., physical activity, acute infection, premenstrual
status, ß-adrenergic blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme
(ACE)inhibitors) and can interact synergistically [9].Whether these
risk factors influence the risk of postvaccination ALE is unknown.
The high reporting rate of anaphylaxis and other ALE following
A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccination in Quebec led to concern for subsequent seasonal TIV containing the same pandemic viral antigen. An
epidemiological investigation was mandated to better understand
and quantify factors possibly contributing to vaccine-associated
ALE. This matched case–control study assessed medical conditions, medications or other factors potentially associated with
anaphylaxis and other ALE following monovalent AS03-adjuvanted
influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine receipt.
2. Methods
2.1. Setting and study design
This age–sex frequency matched case–control study was conducted between May 20 and July 20, 2010, approximately 5–8
months after the pandemic vaccination campaign. The investigation was implemented through provisions of the Public Health Act
and without requirement for ethics review [10].
We identified allergic-like events following pandemic H1N1
vaccination reported to the QuebecAdverse Event Surveillance System database (known as ESPRI) under diagnoses of “anaphylaxis”,
oculorespiratory syndrome (ORS) or “allergy” (e.g., bronchospasm,
oedema of the mouth/throat, facial/generalized oedema, urticaria
or pruritic rashes). Details pertaining to the passive AEFI surveillance in Quebec have been previously described [2]. Deceased
patients, those with symptom onset >24 h after vaccination, and
the elderly aged ≥65 years (who were not prioritized for pandemic
vaccination owing to impressions of lower risk and pre-existing
antibody protection) were excluded.
For each case, two controls were randomly selected from
the Pandemic Influenza Vaccination Registry (PIVR) established
to record every dose of pandemic vaccine administered in the
province along with relevant patient identifiers and demographics, and additional key vaccine-related characteristics (lot number,
etc.) [1]. As the female-to-male ratio among cases was 1:1 before
14 years of age and 3:1 between 14 and 64 years, controls were
frequency-matched by gender respecting the female-to-male ratio
observed in the two age groups (<14 years or 14–64). We excluded
controls who, upon recruitment, reported AS ≤24 h after vaccination or anaesthesia/paresthesia ≤72 h (due to another ongoing
case–control study) [12]. Cases or controls unable to speak French
or English were also excluded.
2.2. Data collection and study variables
Trained nurses conducted standardized phone questionnaires
with all study participants or, for minors <14 years old, the child’s
parents or legal guardians. Each sign and symptom required to
apply the Brighton case definition of anaphylaxis and the ORS case
definition of Canada’s National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) were systematically queried. For cases and controls, we
also collected demographics, personal and family medical conditions, obstetrical history (para, gravida, aborta), use of medication
within 48 h of vaccination, the presence of an acute respiratory
illness (ARI) at the time of vaccination (e.g., fever, respiratory
infection, or influenza-like illness), reported allergy to potential
allergenic components of the vaccine (i.e. eggs, fish, shellfish,
thimerosal, latex), regular alcohol use and physical activity. Medications were classified according to first and second levels of the
Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system [13].
Alcohol exposure and obstetrical history were not assessed in children <14 years old.
2.3. Case definitions
Because of the overlap in clinical criteria required to meet the
BCCD of anaphylaxis and the NACI definition of ORS, clinical case
definitions were applied sequentially. Cases were first classified for
anaphylaxis then were assessed for ORS. Cases that did not meet
either definitions were left categorized as ALE.
The Brighton Collaboration Case Definition (BCCD) was only
applied to all reported ALE cases with symptom onset <1 h after
vaccination [14], as anaphylaxis caused by an injectable antigen is
expected to occur rapidly after administration. To classify remaining cases, we applied the NACI case definition of ORS defined
as bilateral red eyes, and/or facial swelling, and/or respiratory
symptoms (cough, wheeze, chest tightness, difficulty breathing,
difficulty swallowing/throat tightness, hoarseness or sore throat)
with onset ≤24 h after influenza vaccination [11]. To improve
specificity, patients who experienced pruritic rashes, a symptom
typically absent with ORS, were not eligible as ORS cases [15]. All
remaining allergic-like events (ALE) were sub-classified either as
“immediate” (i-ALE) if symptom onset was <4 h, or as “delayed”
(d-ALE) if symptom onset was ≥4 h after vaccination [16].
2.4. Statistical analyses
Separate unconditional regression models were built for BCCDAnaphylaxis, NACI-ORS, i-ALE, d-ALE, and all allergic-like events.
Respective odds ratios and 95%CI (OR [95%CI]) adjusted for sex
and age group used for frequency-matching (<14 years/14–64
years) were estimated for potential risk factors. Variables associated with the outcome at a significance threshold of p = 0.20 were

considered for forward inclusion in multivariate models. The final
models retainedfactors which were statistically associated withthe
outcome (p < 0.05), and variables which induced >15% confounding
in any of the previously included risk factors. The marginal contribution of each variable to the model was estimated with a logistic
pseudo-partial correlation [17].
3. Results
3.1. Participation
Among 753 reported allergic-like events (33 anaphylaxis, 263
ORS, and 457 “allergy”), 144 (21%) were excluded due to age ≥65
years (n = 58), symptom onset >24 h after vaccination (n = 95), or
both (n = 9). Among the 591 eligible cases, 471 were reached (80%)
and 36 declined participation (6%) including 22 cases reported as
ORS (8%) and 14 of those reported as allergy (3%). Successful interviews were available for analysis in 435 (74%) cases reported with
pandemic vaccines.
Among the 1014 potential controls selected from the vaccination registry, 849 (84%) were reached: 136 (16%) declined
participation, 12 (2%) were excluded for anaesthesia/paresthesia,
and 12 (2%) were excluded because they reported an allergic-like
event following pandemic vaccination (2% of women vs. 0.5% of
men; p = 0.20). Participation rate among controls was 70% overall and 83% among those reached. Cases overall were similar to
controls with respect to mean age (31 years, p = 0.40), but there
were more women than men among anaphylaxis cases (94% vs.
72%, p < .001), and cases of d-ALE were younger than controls (26
vs. 31 years, p < .001).
3.2. Standardized clinical presentation
Among the 20 cases initially reported to public health as anaphylaxis, only 10 (50%) met the BCCD for anaphylaxis, but 40 other
cases (4 initially reported as ORS and 36 as allergy) actually met
the BCCD for a total of 50 BCCD-anaphylaxis cases (Table 1). Among
them, 45 (90%) were classified at BCCD certainty Level 1 with ≥1
major dermatologic/mucosal (urticaria 33%, angioedema 40% or
both 27%) and ≥1 major respiratory manifestation (bronchospasm
40%, airway oedema 67%, or evidence of tachypnea and cyanosis
16%). The remaining 5 cases (10%) met BCCD certainty Level 2: all
had major dermatologic/mucosal signs (urticaria 60%, angioedema
20% or both 20%) but minor respiratory symptoms. Epinephrine
was administered to 20 (40%) anaphylaxis cases, all of which met
certainty Level 1, and 4 (9%) were hospitalized.
The standardized NACI ORS definition was met by 177 cases
including 116 of the 156 patients initially reported as ORS
cases (74%), 8/20 reported as anaphylaxis (40%) and 53/259 of
those reported as allergy (20%). Among the 177 NACI-ORS cases,
12% (22) had all three components of ORS (bilateral conjunctivitis, facial oedema and respiratory symptoms), 23% had 2
components of the definition (11% respiratory/oedema, 8% respiratory/conjunctivitis, and 5% oedema/conjunctivitis). The majority
of cases (65%) reported only one component (47% respiratory, 13%
oedema, 5% conjunctivitis).
The remaining 208 cases were classified as i-ALE (n = 97) or dALE (n = 111) according on the delay to onset of symptoms. This
includes 170 of the 259 (66%) cases initially reported as allergy,
36/156 (23%) as ORS, and 2/20 (10%) as anaphylaxis. Both i-ALE and
d-ALE frequently included urticaria (54% and 68%, respectively) and
i-ALE more frequently involved respiratory symptoms (47%) and
use of epinephrine (34%) than did d-ALE (24% and 2%). Many i-ALE
cases reported symptoms in ≥2 organ systems (45%), but only 7%
fulfilled the BCCD. Mean delay to onset for i-ALE cases 46 min after
vaccination, d-ALE cases was 20 h.
Anaphylaxis and ORS cases more often included respiratory
symptoms (98% and 78%, respectively), than cases of i-ALE (47%),
and d-ALE (24%). The majority of AS cases reported skin/mucosal
symptoms (67%), although angioedema was more frequent among
anaphylaxis cases (64% vs. 15–32% for other categories.)
3.3. Risk factor assessment
Univariate analyses included 63 potential risk factors, of which
42 met the statistical threshold (p < 0.20) for inclusion in multivariate analyses (Table 2). After multivariate logistic regression,
12 risk factors and 3 protective factors were retained in various
models (Table 3). Cases classified as anaphylaxis, ORS, and i-ALE
shared common risk factors, while d-ALE cases exhibited a slightly
different subset of risks.
Alcohol consumption (drinking ≥1 alcoholic beverage/week)
comprised the largest proportion of explained deviance (12%),
decreasing the risk of anaphylaxis (0.26 [0.13–0.57]), ORS (0.48
[0.31–0.74]), i-ALE (0.45 [0.26–0.81]) or any event (OR = 0.46
[0.33–.64]) (Table 3). There was no indication of a dose–response
relationship and alcohol exposure on the day of immunization
was not associated with AS (Table 2). Patients who were physically active (i.e. 5 h/week for 5–18 years, 3 h/week in adults)
also had a reduced risk of ORS (0.49 [0.32–0.76]) and d-ALE
(0.35 [0.21–0.59]).
An ARI at the time of vaccination or in the previous week was
the second most important variable, representing 11% of explained
deviance. It was significantly associated with an increased risk
of anaphylaxis (7.67 [3.04–13.37]), ORS (3.24 [1.65–6.38]), i-ALE
(2.66 [1.19–5.94]), d-ALE (3.39 [1.69–6.83]) and any event (3.14
[1.90–5.18]. Use of asthma inhalers (e.g., short-acting ß-adrenergic
agonists, glucocorticoids) was also associated with an increased
risk of any event (2.71 [1.37–5.38]), ORS (3.38 [1.50–762]) and iALE (4.33 [1.72–10.9]) but was not significant for anaphylaxis or
d-ALE.
Overall, 208 participants reported drug allergies and 57 (27%)
reported this to >1 drug (34% of cases and 19% of controls, p = 0.02).
Reported drug allergy was not associated with anaphylaxis but
significantly increased the risk of ORS (2.02 [1.26–3.24]), i-ALE
(1.91 [1.06–3.44]) and any event (1.58 [1.10–2.30]). Drug allergy
had been diagnosed by an allergist in 28% of cases and 15%
of controls (p = 0.03) who reported a drug allergy, and mostly
implicated the following ATC classes: J01-antibiotics (6% vs. 2%),
N02-Opiates and acetylsalicylic acid derivative analgesics (5%
vs. 1%), or R05D-Opiate-based cough and cold preparations (4%
vs. 0.1%). Allergy to sulfonamides was also frequently reported
(5% vs. 3%).
Patients reporting food allergies had a significantly increased
risk of anaphylaxis (3.84 [1.51–9.74]), i-ALE (4.01 [1.89–8.51]) and
any event (2.26 [1.31–3.91]). The most frequently implicated food
was shellfish (6% of AS cases and 1% of controls). Egg allergy
was reported by 13 (3%) all cases and 4 (<1%) controls and was
only significant for i-ALE, although with wide confidence interval
(10.87 [2.60–45.54]). Fish and latex allergy were reported by 2% of
cases and <1% of controls, and 3% of cases reported an allergy to
thimerosal.
Vaccination in the first 4 weeks of the campaign increased the
likelihood of anaphylaxis (2.16 [1.10–4.25]), ORS (2.71 [1.80–4.08])
and any event (1.58 [1.17–2.14]), but not i-ALE or d-ALE. A significant(16%) proportion of participants vaccinated in weeks 1–4 were
healthcare workers, a status independently associated with risk of
any event (1.77 [1.08–2.89]).

4. Discussion
In Canada, passive AEFI surveillance during the 2009 monovalent AS03-adjuvanted pandemic A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccination
campaign provided a signal of concern related to greater anaphylaxis and other allergic-like events reporting, disproportionately
affecting women of childbearing age [2]. In this study, we followedup on that passive signal through active case–control investigation
in order to elucidate possible risk factors. Despite an extensive
list of factors explored, most of the reported anaphylaxis or ALE
remains unexplained. Apart from female gender, already identified by passive surveillance, the only risk factors identified in the
current study were prior ARI, reported drug or food (excl. egg)
allergy, early vaccination during the first 4 weeks of the campaign,
and use of asthma inhalers (e.g., short-acting ß-adrenergic agonists,
glucocorticoids), whereas alcohol exposure and being physically
active appeared protective. IgE-mediated allergies to vaccine components did not appear as a leading factor in the occurrence ofthese
events, as cases were not more likely than controls to report allergy
to trace amounts of allergenic components of the vaccine, such as
eggs or fish, and few patients reported an allergy to thimerosal, also
included in the vaccine.

sometimes attributed to differences in health-seeking and reporting behaviours [2,18]. Data from passive surveillance showed that
rates remained statistically higher in women even after adjusting
for doses administered to each gender, and could not be attributed
to differences in vaccine uptake [2]. In our study, ALE were also
more frequent in women than men randomly selected from the
vaccination registry and contacted to be controls for this study
(2% of women vs. 0.5% of men), suggesting that the predominance
of women among ALE cases was not due to surveillance artefact.
Biological sex differences may explain this risk difference. While
speculative, the prevailing hypothesis is that sex hormones influence both innate and adaptative immune responses which results
in both higher antibody response to influenza vaccination and a
greater incidence of AEFI in postpubertal women [19–26]. Other
hormonally-related conditions, such as being of reproductive age
(post-menarchal and premenopausal), obstetrical history (gravida,
para, aborta), hormonal contraception or hormone-replacement
therapy or parity were associated with ALE in univariate analyses
but none remained significantly associated in final adjusted models. However, the effect of cyclic changes of endogenous hormone
levels on anaphylaxis or ALE risk could not be evaluated in this
study, and may account for some of the increased risk observed
among women.
Anaphylaxis and other allergic-like events were reported by
healthcare workers at higher rates compared to the general population. Despite representing only 7% of all vaccinated individuals,
15% of cases were healthcare workers of which 13% were woman
[1]. Healthcare workers were mostly (>90%) immunized during the
first three weeks of the campaign with a limited number of vaccine
lots, including lot 9A which was associated with a higher rate of
anaphylaxis. Health care workers remained at higher risk despite
adjustment for gender (matching), week of vaccination and vaccine lot. While there may be residual confounding, it is likely that
healthcare workers report more adverse events than the general
populationgiventheir greater awareness andbetter reportingpractices.
An ARI preceding or concurrent with vaccination was the most
important risk factor we identified. During a moderate-to-severe
illness, vaccination is usually deferred to avoid superimposing or
reporting an AEFI attributable to the underlying illness. In Quebec
as elsewhere in Canada, 2009 pandemic vaccination commenced
just before or concurrent with the peak of the pandemic, when the
risk of contracting influenza was relatively high [1]. Patients with
ARI may have therefore decided to be immunized despite illness
and thereafter separating infection-from vaccine-induced symptomatology (onset or exacerbation) would be challenging. ORS in
particular shares features with allergy but also with viral infection, and ARI reporting was highest in association with that entity.
Conversely, influenza and other viral or bacterial infections may
induce urticaria and infections have been shown to potentiate anaphylaxis, although their impact in the initiation or amplification of
AEFI is unknown [27–29].
Alcohol exposure most explained the variability in all regression models but the direction of effect was protective rather than
increasing the risk as expected. Alcohol is typically considered to
increase anaphylaxis risk in food allergy as it increases the absorptionoffood allergens, butmay also affect recognitionof anaphylaxis
triggers or directly activate mast cells [7,27]. For other allergens,
the impact of alcohol intake on risk has not been established.
In this study, alcohol was associated with reduced rather than
increased ALE risk, which may be explained by the immunosuppressive effects of alcohol, and the impairment it causes to the
migration of neutrophils to the site of injury, as well as the altered
function of lymphocytes and cytokine production [30,31]. Excess
alcohol consumption, which was uncommon in our population, has
been associated with feminizing effects in men [32]. The relationship between alcohol intake, female reproductive hormone cycles,
and other potential risk factors has not been established but may

interplay to mediate this association. Because of social desirability biases, alcohol exposure is difficult to assess, especially through
interviews [33]. However, social desirability mostly affects heavy
drinkers (>7 drinks/week in women and >14/week in men) who
represented only 4% of cases, a proportion similar to that observed
in controls (3.5%), and in the Quebec population [34].
Identifying risk factors for anaphylaxis or allergic-like events
is difficult. These events may be caused by several mechanisms
that may be triggered by the vaccine, or may be coincidental and
unrelated to vaccination. Pooling all cases is likely to obscure significant associations between a given risk factor and a specific disease.
We used standardized syndromic case definitions with the hope of
regrouping cases with similar disease, but found little to no differences in risk factors between our syndromic categories. Despite
being more standardized, our syndromic case definitions overlapped and did not equate to a single pathophysiology or a specific
confirmed diagnosis. In most cases, it is not possible to distinguish
ALE due to vaccination vs. other causes on clinical grounds, nor is
it possible to identify IgE-mediated reactions from those which are
not, although their risk factors are likely different. In the absence of
biological markers confirming a diagnosis or a pathophysiological
mechanism, pooling of cases by syndrome will limit our capacity
to identify risk factors.
Our study has other limitations. Cases were identified through
passive AEFI surveillance and subject to significant underreporting,
either by omission or lack of familiarity with reporting practices.
Reported cases likely represent the most severe or clinicallysignificant events, which may not be representative of all ALE, and
factors associated with this risk could partly be associated with
severity rather than occurrence. Also, interviews were conducted
5–8months following vaccination whichmayhavehamperedrecall
in both cases and controls resulting in bias towards the null. However, most of the risk factors assessed can be considered “stable
or permanent” conditions (e.g., history of medically-diagnosed
allergies, or asthma) which should be less affected by recall.
Also, for most individuals, pandemic vaccination was a salient
event reducing the impact of recall on our estimates. Differential recall bias could explain differences in transient risk factors,
such as history of respiratory illness and use of medication in
the days preceding vaccination, which would overestimate their
respective effects. The biggest concern applied to any study of
vaccine safety is the inability to discern contemporaneous from
causally-related associations, particularly in this instance given the
clinical overlap in viral – (e.g., ARI) vs. vaccine-induced allergic
presentations.
In summary, increased anaphylaxis and other allergic-like
events observed in association with AS03-adjuvanted pandemic
H1N1 vaccine remain mostly unexplained despite extensive risk
factor review. These findings do not alter the overall risk–benefit
balance or lead to change in current immunization practices,
but generated etiological hypotheses which should be tested in
properly designed confirmatory studies. However, prior to mass
vaccination with similar formulations, this safety signal warrants
further consideration and better understanding.
