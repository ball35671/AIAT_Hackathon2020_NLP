Kettel, W. A. (Influenza Research Center, Houston, TX 77030), T. R. Cate, and
R. B. Couch. Efficacy of sequential annual vaccination with Inactivated Influenza
virus vaccine. Am J Epktemlof 1988; 127:353-64.
Inactivated influenza virus vaccine efficacy after annual revacdnation has
been reported to be less than that after first vaccination in boarding school
children. We prospecthrely examined the immunogenicity and efficacy of this
vaccine in healthy 30- to 60-year-old volunteers in Houston, Texas, over two
epidemic seasons (1983-1985) encompassing outbreaks due to influenza A
(H3N2 and H1N1) and influenza B viruses. A placebo group that had never (or
not in recent years) received Inactivated influenza virus vaccine, a group that
received the vaccine for the first time (first vac), and a group given two or more
recent vaccinations (multivac) were evaluated in a double-blind fashion each
year. Vaccination induced higher frequencies of rise in serum antibody titer to
vaccine components in first vac than In multivac volunteers, but mean postvacdnatkHi triers were similar. Clinical and virotoglc evaluations of illnesses during
both epidemics and of influenza infections diagnosed serologicalty over the
epidemic seasons revealed no overall reduction In illness from that in the placebo
group for either vaccine group; modest reductions in influenza Infection-related
illness that were significant only for the multivac group against A/H3N2-related
illness (55%; p < 0.04); reduction in moderate-to-severe lower respiratory and/
or systemic illness due to influenza for multivac (73%, p < 0.025) but not first
vac (15%, p > 0.10) volunteers during the A/H3N2 epidemic; reduction In influenza
virus shedding In the multivac (54%, p < 0.05) but not the first vac (16%, p >
0.10) group when compared with the placebo group for both years; and overall
63-81% reductions in documented infections with each influenza vims for both
vaccine groups with the exception of A/H1N1 for the first vac group (24%, p >
0.10) and type B for the multivac group (57%, p = 0.067). Vaccine efficacy was
only modest in these studies, but in contrast to the earlier report In boarding
school children, efficacy appeared to be somewhat greater after repeated annual
vaccination than after first administration.

them at high risk for death or severe illness
with influenza virus infection. The recommendations have been expanded over the
years to include residents of nursing homes
and chronic care facilities, medical personnel caring for high-risk persons, healthy
persons who perform essential community
services, and others wishing to reduce their
risk of developing influenza (1).
The protective efficacy of inactivated
vaccine against influenza virus infection
has usually been 70-90 per cent in military
personnel, but protection of persons in
high-risk categories has been variable and
sometimes manifested only by reduction in
death and/or hospitalization (2, 3). Most
studies of influenza vaccine efficacy have
analyzed results over only one or two seasons without regard to the subject's history
of prior influenza vaccination. To our
knowledge, no formal, prospective, randomized trials have examined the immunogenicity and efficacy of inactivated vaccine when given annually as recommended.
Several recent reports have questioned
whether annual vaccination against influenza can protect over several epidemic seasons. One of these studies in a school for
boys (4) suggested that the first vaccination
with a current influenza virus strain provided protection against that strain, but
that the next annual vaccination with a
subsequent variant did not convey protection against the second strain. The cumulative influenza attack rate over three epidemic seasons was the same for unvaccinated boys as for those given annual vaccinations, with disease in vaccinated boys
shifted toward later epidemics. In another
study, inactivated influenza vaccine conferred significant protection against A/Vicpersons for their assistance with data collection and
analysis: Barbara Baxter, Leslie Clarke, George Divine, Cindy Dukes, Scott Elkins, Betty Geyer, Ken

toria/75 (H3N2) infection in a group that
had received few if any prior annual vaccinations, whereas the incidence of infection
in a young adult and a geriatric population
that had received multiple vaccinations was
not reduced (5). Protection in the latter
groups was limited to a reduction in days
absent from work per illness and subjective
moderation of illness severity.
To better evaluate the long-term efficacy
of annual vaccination against influenza and
to ascertain the cumulative effects of yearly
vaccination on serologic responses to inactivated influenza vaccine, we undertook a
long-term placebo-controlled study in
healthy 30- to 60-year-old adults. The immunogenicity and protective efficacy of influenza vaccine for the 1983-1984 and the
1984-1985 epidemics in relation to prior
vaccination experience are described in this
report.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Vaccine preparations
Trivalent zonal purified whole virion influenza vaccine (Fluzone, Connaught Laboratories, Swiftwater, PA) was administered in a single 0.5-ml dose intramuscularly in the upper arm. Each dose of the
commercial vaccine for the fall of 1983
contained 15 ng of hemagglutinin of each
of the following influenza strains: A/Philippines/2/82 (H3N2), A/Brazil/11/78
(H1N1), and B/Singapore/222/79. The
vaccine administered in the fall of 1984
contained 15 /ig of hemagglutinin of each
of A/Philippines/2/82 (H3N2), A/Chile/1/
83 (H1N1), and B/USSR/100/83. Placebo
was sterile saline for injection.
Study population and vaccination
procedures
Volunteers were employees 30-60 years
of age working in the Texas Medical Center
in Houston, Texas, or in surrounding industrial companies. Those with underlying
conditions that placed them in a category

recommended or for whom vaccine was
contraindicated were excluded from participation. Those considered healthy were enrolled after giving written consent according to protocols approved by local and National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases review boards.
Each fall, new volunteers having no history of vaccination within the preceding
three years and prior placebo recipients
were assigned to receive vaccine (first vac
group) or placebo (placebo group) using a
table of random numbers. New volunteers
who reported vaccination within the preceding three years and prior participants
who received vaccine the year before were
again vaccinated (multivac group). Volunteers were blinded as to whether they received vaccine or placebo. Blood specimens
for antibody studies were taken immediately prior to, and three to five weeks following, vaccination.
Epidemic evaluations
Influenza virus activity in Houston was
monitored in the Influenza Research Center by continuous performance of virus cultures on specimens from patients who presented to selected primary care facilities
with febrile respiratory disease (6). Data
from this continuous community surveillance were used to guide surveillance of the
present study population. Surveillance of
the study population was activated when
an increase in febrile respiratory illnesses
was noted in the community and was
stopped when illness frequencies in the
community had returned to the preepidemic baseline. The epidemic period was
defined as that interval during which community surveillance recovered influenza viruses from 10 per cent or more of persons
with febrile respiratory illness per calendar
week.
Surveillance of the study population was
activated by postcard notification. Volunteers were asked to report to an examination site if they developed any respiratory
or influenza-like illnesses. Illnesses were
evaluated for severity and anatomic location by a member of the team without referring to the volunteer's vaccination record. A specimen for virus culture was obtained from all volunteers presenting to the
site within five days of illness onset. Acute
and three- to four-week convalescent blood
specimens were also obtained for antibody
studies from each volunteer reporting during the epidemic period. Postcard notification served to stop the study group surveillance. Blood specimens were obtained from
all participants several weeks after the end
of the epidemic (spring blood), regardless
of whether illness was reported during the
epidemic period. At this time, all volunteers
were asked to record the major symptoms
of any illness they did not report during the
epidemic season.
Illness classification
All prospectively evaluated illnesses were
classified according to anatomic location
and severity. Symptoms and signs of disease involving the nose, pharynx, larynx,
and/or ear were designated as upper respiratory illness; symptoms and signs of disease of the trachea, bronchi, and/or lung
were designated lower respiratory illness. A
designation of systemic illness was based
on occurrence of myalgia, malaise, fatigue,
lethargy, chills, sweats, and anorexia An
oral temperature of 37.8 C or higher measured by the patient or at the time of examination was considered fever. The mean
severity of symptoms (1+ = mild, 2+ =
moderate, 3+ = severe) in a given anatomic
site (upper respiratory, lower respiratory,
systemic) was used to designate the illness
as mild, moderate, or severe. For the 1983-
1984 epidemic season, illness evaluations
were recorded at the time of initial presentation only. For the 1984-1985 epidemic
season, illness classification was based on
the information obtained both at the time
of initial presentation and when the convalescent blood specimen was collected.
Laboratory studies
Six-milliliter nasal washes with lactacted
Ringer's solution were performed on all

volunteers reporting with acute illness during both epidemics. Throat swab specimens
were added to the nasal wash specimen
during the second epidemic season. Pooled
respiratory specimens were mixed with
concentrated veal infusion broth and kept
at 4 C until tested for virus in the following
tissue cultures: WI-38 human embryonic
fibroblasts; Madin-Darby canine kidney;
LLC-MK2; and HEp-2. Procedures for detection and identification of influenza virus
have been described previously (7, 8).
Serum specimens for antibody studies
were stored at —20 C. Hemagglutinationinhibition antibody titers to the vaccine
and epidemic strains selected for optimal
sensitivity and specificity were determined
in all sera by standard methods with an
initial serum dilution of 1:4 (9). Strains
used for measuring the 1983 vaccine responses were A/Philippines (H3N2), A/
Bangkok/1/79 (H3N2), A/Brazil (H1N1),
and B/Singapore; those used for the 1983-
1984 epidemic season were A/Chile
(H1N1), A/Brazil (HlNl), B/USSR, and
B/Singapore. Strains used for testing the
1984 vaccine responses were A/Philippines
(H3N2), A/Panama/1/83 (H3N2), A/Chile
(HlNl), A/Brazil (HlNl), B/USSR, and
B/Singapore; those selected for the 1984-
1985 epidemic season were A/Philippines
(H3N2) and A/Panama (H3N2). All test
antigens were whole virus preparations. In
addition, complement-fixation antibody titers to type-specific antigens were determined in paired serum specimens collected
from volunteers presenting for evaluation
of illness during epidemic periods. Complement-fixation antibody titers were assayed
according to published methods with an
initial serum dilution of 1:8 (10).
Definition of influenza infection
A volunteer was considered to have been
infected if an influenza virus was isolated
and/or a fourfold rise in antibody titer occurred between postvaccination (preepidemic), acute, convalescent, and/or spring
(postepidemic) sera.
Vaccine efficacy
The per cent protection conferred by vaccine was calculated by the following formula:
Placebo — Vaccine
Placebo
x 100,
where placebo is the observed infection or
illness rate in the placebo group, and vaccine is the observed infection or illness rate
in the specified vaccine group.
Statistical methods
The x
2
 test was employed to analyze differences between proportions. Analysis of
variance was used to compare antibody titers between vaccine groups. Comparisons
of antibody rises within a group were made
by the paired Wilcoxon signed-rank test,
while comparison of mean antibody titers
between infected and uninfected volunteers
within a vaccine group was made by the
Wilcoxon nonpaired rank sum test. Ninetyfive per cent confidence intervals for vaccine efficacy were based on differences in
proportions.
RESULTS
Antibody responses to vaccination
The serum antibody responses to the different influenza viruses are summarized in
tables 1 and 2 according to vaccine group.
For 1983 (table 1), the multivac group had
significantly higher mean prevaccination
titers than the first vac or placebo group
against all three vaccine viruses and against
A/Bangkok (H3N2) virus, the A (H3N2)
component present in vaccines that were
distributed between 1980 and 1982 (p <
0.05 for each). Mean prevaccination titers
were similar for all viruses in the first vac
and placebo groups. Vaccinations induced
significantly more fourfold or greater rises
in titer against each of the vaccine antigens
in the first vac group than in the multivac
group (x2

>1:32 was approximately the same (p >
0.10). Geometric mean titers of antibody to
each virus rose significantly for both vaccine groups following vaccination (p <
0.001), and the final level achieved was
approximately the same. Although the difference was small, the postvaccination geometric mean titer against A/Bangkok was
higher in the multivac group than in the
first vac group (p < 0.05).
For 1984 (table 2), prevaccination geometric mean titers against all viruses tested
were significantly higher for the multivac
group than for the first vac or placebo group
(p < 0.05). Prevaccination titers against all
antigens tested were similar for the first
vac and placebo groups. Mean postvaccination titers to A/Panama (H3N2),
A/Chile (H1N1), and B/USSR were significantly higher for the first vac group than
for the multivac group (p < 0.05), although
the differences were small; mean postvaccination titers against A/Philippines
(H3N2), A/Brazil (HlNl), and B/Singapore were similar for the first vac and multivac groups. The final percentage of volunteers with postvaccination titers >1:32
was not statistically different for both vaccine groups with the exception of A/Panama (H3N2) and A/Chile (HlNl), in which
cases significantly fewer volunteers in the
multivac group achieved levels >1:32 (x2
 =
8.67 and 5.16, respectively, p < 0.025 for
each). Again, the percentage of volunteers
responding with a fourfold or greater rise
in antibody titer against each of the vaccine
antigens was significantly lower for the
multivac group when compared with the
first vac group (x2
 2: 34.9; p < 0.001 for
each).
Infection and illness during influenza

An epidemic caused primarily by influenza A/Victoria/7/83 (HlNl)- and B/
USSR/100/83-like viruses occurred in the
winter of 1983-1984; the epidemic period
was from January 8 to March 17, 1984.
Fifty-one per cent of isolates during the
epidemic were HlNl viruses, and 48 per
cent were B viruses in the Houston community surveillance. An epidemic caused

like viruses occurred in the 1984-1985 season between January 6 and March 9, 1985.
Figure 1 shows the number of patients with
febrile respiratory illness on whom surveillance cultures were performed each week in
the community surveillance and the number of cultures that were positive for influenza viruses (11).
Illness and infection among study participants who reported for evaluation of illness during the two epidemic periods are
summarized in table 3. The percentage of
volunteers reporting any illness was similar
for each vaccine group during each epidemic, as was the percentage with lower
respiratory and/or systemic illness and the
percentage with fever (p > 0.10). Virus
isolates other than influenza were mostly
picornaviruses—six of the eight for 1984
and all 19 of those for 1985. Frequencies of
influenza virus isolates were low and did
not differ between groups for any individual
type or subtype. Antibody responses to the
epidemic strains tended to occur more frequently among placebo recipients than
among volunteers in the multivac and first
vac groups. Overall, about one third of placebo volunteers who reported with an illness during each epidemic period were infected with an influenza virus. Reduction
in the number of volunteers with prospectively reported influenza infection-related
illnesses for each of the years 1983-1984
and 1984-1985 was 34 per cent for the first
vac group; reduction was 54 per cent and
55 per cent, respectively, for the multivac
group; only the 55 per cent for A/H3N2-
related illnesses in the multivac group (x2
= 4.21; p < 0.04) was statistically significant.

The duration of illness and number of volunteers whose activity was restricted were
similar for all three groups for the 1984-

When only moderate-to-severe (2-3+) prospectively evaluated lower respiratory and/
or systemic illness documented to be caused

seasons are summarized in table 4 according to virus type and vaccine group. All
infections detected by means of virus isolation and/or serum hemagglutinationinhibition antibody titer rises are included
whether or not the volunteer reported with
illness during the epidemic period. Although the differences in frequency of influenza virus isolation between groups were
not significant for any of the three epidemic
strains, the cumulative frequency of shedding any influenza virus during the two
years of observation was significantly lower
for the multivac group than for the placebo
group (9/423 vs. 25/539; x
2
 = 4.38; p < 0.05;
54 per cent reduction). The cumulative fregroup (13/333; 16 per cent reduction from
that in the placebo group) was intermediate
and not significantly different from that for
either of the other groups.
Significant differences also occurred in
the frequency of antibody responses, in volunteers with and without virus isolates (table 4). Among volunteers with an influenza
virus isolate, significantly fewer in the multivac than in the placebo group developed
a serum antibody rise to the isolate (1/9 vs.
15/25; x

 = 6.35; p < 0.025), but the proportion for first vac volunteers (8/13) was
similar to that for placebo recipients.

greater rises in serum antibody titers to
influenza A (HlNl and H3N2) and influenza B when compared with the corresponding placebo group (x2
 5: 5.71; p < 0.02
for each). Fewer influenza A (H3N2) and
influenza B (but not A/HlNl) infections
were detected in hemagglutination-inhibition tests in the first vac group when compared with the placebo group (x2
 = 7.22;
p < 0.01).
The number of infections (virus isolates
and/or antibody titer rises) from table 4
are converted to per cent protection for the
vaccine groups in table 5. Protection was
statistically significant (i.e., a significantly
lower frequency of infection for the vaccine
group than for the placebo group) in all but
two instances shown in table 5: HlNl infections in the first vac group (p > 0.10)
and influenza B infections in the multivac
group (x2
 = 3.34; p = 0.067). Further examination of the HlNl infections in the
first vac group revealed that they occurred
with significantly greater frequency in volunteers under the age of 33 years (i.e., born
in 1950 or later) than in those aged 33 or
older (7/47 vs. 2/115; p < 0.001). A similar
pattern was noted when placebo volunteers
under age 33 were compared with those 33
or older (8/66 vs. 14/232), but the difference was not significant. When individuals
under age 33 in the vaccine groups were
compared, significantly fewer HlNl infections occurred in the multivac group than
in the first vac group (0/30 vs. 7/47; p <
0.02). Volunteers of all ages in the multivac
group were protected against HlNl infection. The overall degree of protection was
not significantly different between first vac
and multivac groups for infection due to
any single virus or combination of them.
DISCUSSION
Despite a recommendation for annual
vaccination of elderly and high-risk populations with inactivated influenza vaccine,
little information is available concerning
the immunologic and protective effects of
these yearly injections.
Our data show that influenza vaccines
induce serum antibody that persists at a
somewhat higher level than antibody in
unvaccinated volunteers for at least one
year. Although proportional increases in
geometric mean titers and frequencies of
fourfold or greater antibody rises were
lower for persons given a repeat annual
vaccination than for those given vaccine
for the first time, mean postvaccination
titers to vaccine antigens were similar. Two
exceptions were that postvaccination titers
against new antigens in the fall of 1984 (A/
Chile (HlNl) and B/USSR) were slightly
higher in the first vac group than in the
multivac group, although the biologic significance is uncertain. In contrast, postvacTABLE 5

cination titers to antigens present in earlier
preparations of influenza vaccine (A/Philippines (H3N2), A/Brazil (HlNl), and B/
Singapore) were the same. Antibody responses to influenza B virus antigens were
considerably lower than those to type A
antigens for both years for both vaccine
groups. Although sensitivity of the hemagglutination-inhibition test for antibody to
type B viruses could have been increased
by use of split virus antigens (12), the present data obtained with whole virus antigens
suffices for comparison of responses of the
two vaccine groups.
Powers et al. (13) measured serum
hemagglutination-inhibition antibody responses in young adults given two or three
doses of the same commercial preparation
of trivalent influenza vaccine at six-month
intervals. Although a significant proportion
of individuals developed titers of >40 to the
A/Brazil (HlNl) component after each
dose of vaccine, repeated vaccination failed
to increase the number with such titers
against A/Bangkok (H3N2) or B/Singapore viruses. The effect of second and third
vaccinations on the geometric mean titer
for each antigen was minimal when compared with the significant rises that followed a first vaccination. The authors concluded that current recommendations for
annual vaccination cannot be supported
when vaccine antigens are not altered.
Brandriss et al. (14) noted a similar
suppression of antibody responses to the
A/Texas/77 (H3N2) and B/Hong Kong/72
vaccine antigens in a group of elderly persons, most of whom had received prior injections of inactivated vaccine. Zajac and
coworkers (15) examined the effect of prior
vaccination with influenza vaccine on antibody responses in a group of Air Force
personnel and found that fewer persons
who had been vaccinated the year before
achieved "protective titers" against vaccine
antigens when compared with recruits vaccinated for the first time; however, protection was similar during the subsequent epidemic.
Estimates of vaccine efficacy in our trial
during epidemics caused by each of the
major influenza types—influenza A (H3N2
and HlNl) and influenza B—support previous estimates when reduction in laboratory-confirmed influenza infection rates
are considered. The protective efficacy of
inactivated influenza vaccine in this
healthy, middle-aged, open population was
similar to that reported for military personnel (2), despite imperfect antigenic matches
between vaccine and epidemic viruses for
the combined influenza A (HlNl)-B outbreak in 1983-1984.
Of particular interest were the age relations of influenza A (HlNl) infections in
our study groups. The infection rate for
first vac volunteers under age 33 years was
similar to that of the placebo group. Significantly more first vac volunteers in this age
group were infected with this subtype when
compared with multivac volunteers of the
same age. Thus, repeated annual vaccination appeared to be superior to a single
vaccination for protection against HlNl
viruses in persons who may have had limited prior exposure to this subtype during
childhood.
Although significant protection against
documented influenza infections was demonstrated for all three major viruses in our
study, no reductions were noted in the frequency of respiratory illness reported during either epidemic season for either vaccine group when compared with the placebo
group. Similar observations have been
made in previous trials of inactivated vaccines (5, 16, 17). While the frequency of
total respiratory illness was similar in vaccinated groups when compared with those
receiving no vaccine in these earlier trials,
various investigators have noted reductions
in pneumonia and death (16), influenza
virus isolates or days of absence from work
(5), and influenza-specific illness rates in
vaccinated groups (17). We found statistically significant protection of the multivac
group against A/H3N2-related illness (55
per cent; p < 0.04) and against moderateto-severe lower respiratory and/or systemic
disease attributable to influenza A/H3N2

(73 per cent; p < 0.025), even though their
overall illness rate was nearly identical to
that of the placebo group.
Discrepancies between the level of protection against illness and that against infection diagnosed serologically have also
been observed by several other groups (18,
19). One possible explanation is that influenza vaccine is preventing influenza but
that other agents are causing illness in vaccinated groups. The frequency of isolation
of noninfluenza viruses capable of producing respiratory illness did not differ between vaccinated and unvaccinated groups
in the present studies, but not all of the
agents capable of causing respiratory disease would have been detected with the
tissue cultures employed, and no attempt
was made to determine serologically the
etiology of illnesses due to agents other
than influenza A and B viruses. Thus, it is
possible that the proportions of illness due
to agents other than influenza were greater
for the vaccinated groups than for the placebo group, although we have no data to
support this possibility.
Another possible explanation for the discrepancy between protection against illness
and that against infection is interference
with serodiagnosis of infection by prior vaccination. Francis and coworkers (20) demonstrated a lower frequency of fourfold
rises in serum hemagglutination-inhibition
antibody titers among vaccinated persons
who developed clinical influenza following
experimental challenge with influenza A/
PR8 virus than among unvaccinated persons. Similarly, Rapmund et al. (21) observed that the frequency of fourfold rises
in serum hemagglutination-inhibition antibody titers was lower in a group of recently vaccinated persons who developed
clinical influenza despite a similar level of
virus shedding in vaccinated and unvaccinated groups. In our study, confirmed influenza virus infection was more likely to
be detected in the placebo group on the basis of rises in serum hemagglutinationinhibition antibody titers than in vaccine
groups. Multivac volunteers were also significantly less likely to develop an antibody
rise following culturally proven influenza
virus infection than were placebo volunteers, but the effect was much less in first
vac volunteers. The magnitude of the effect
of prior vaccination on our ability to detect
subsequent infection serologically is uncertain. However, since the calculated protection rates depend largely on serologically
diagnosed infections, it seems likely that
actual protection against infection among
vaccinated groups was somewhat less than
the calculated estimates.
A major reason for undertaking this longitudinal study of the efficacy of influenza
vaccines was to determine prospectively
whether protective efficacy diminished
with sequential annual vaccinations. Although results from the two mild-to-moderate epidemic seasons reported here provided less dramatic evidence for vaccine
protection than was hoped for, they nevertheless suggest no loss of efficacy with sequential annual administration. In fact, the
strongest data for protection against virus
isolation and against infection-related illness by vaccination were obtained from the
multivac group. Continued observation of
our study population should provide further
clarification of the long-term effects of annual influenza vaccination.
