OBJECTIVE: To estimate the effect of first-trimester influenza vaccination on fetal and neonatal outcomes.
METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study examining delivery and neonatal outcomes after antepartum
exposure to the seasonal trivalent inactive influenza
vaccine. Data were collected and entered into an established computerized database. Outcomes by trimester of
vaccination were then compared with women who did
not receive the vaccine.
RESULTS: During the 5-year study period, 10,225 women
received the seasonal influenza vaccine antepartum;
8,690 of these delivered at our institution, 439 in the first
trimester and 8,251 in the second and third trimesters.
Women vaccinated antepartum were significantly older
with higher parity than women who declined vaccination. Neonates born to mothers receiving the vaccine in
any trimester did not have an increase in major malformations regardless of trimester of vaccination (2% regardless of vaccination group, P.9). Stillbirth (0.3%
compared with 0.6%, P.006), neonatal death (0.2%
compared with 0.4%, P.01), and premature delivery
(5% compared with 6%, P.004) were significantly decreased in the vaccinated group.
CONCLUSION: Influenza vaccination in the first trimester was not associated with an increase in major malformation rates and was associated with a decrease in the
overall stillbirth rate. This information will aid in counseling women regarding the safety of influenza vaccination in the first trimester.

LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: II
Pregnant women have long been noted to be at an
increased risk of serious illness as a result of
influenza, particularly in the later stages of pregnancy.
This risk is further increased in pregnant women with
underlying comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus,
asthma, and multifetal gestation. Influenza during
pregnancy has also been associated with an increased
risk of pregnancy complications including preterm
delivery and fetal distress.1,2 Vaccination with the
trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine is the cornerstone of prevention of influenza in pregnant women
and their newborn offspring. In a randomized controlled trial, vaccination with the trivalent inactivated
influenza vaccine was shown to reduce all febrile
respiratory illnesses by approximately one third in
vaccinated mothers and their newborns.3 Since 2004,
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and
the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practice
has recommended vaccination of all women who will
be pregnant during the influenza season regardless
of gestational age.2 This recommendation is supported by the American College of Obstetricians
and Gynecologists.4
Despite these recommendations, the majority of
pregnant women are not vaccinated. During the last
two decades, only 10 –24% of pregnant women in the
United States received an influenza vaccine.2,5 After
the H1N1 influenza pandemic, vaccination rates for
seasonal influenza increased. A survey of women
pregnant in the 2010 –2011 influenza season found
self-reported vaccination rates of 49%. It is yet to be
determined, however, if these higher vaccination levels will be maintained.6 Concerns about the safety of
influenza vaccination in pregnancy among patients
and health care workers have been cited as one of the
major barriers to vaccination.7,8
To date, no study has found an association between vaccination with the inactivated influenza vaccine in pregnancy and adverse maternal or neonatal
outcomes,9 –11 but few of these studies include data

from women vaccinated in the first trimester. In this
study, we compare neonatal outcomes in women who
received the influenza vaccination in the first trimester of pregnancy with those who received the vaccine
in the second and third trimesters and with unvaccinated women.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
This was a retrospective cohort study examining
neonatal outcomes after antepartum maternal influenza vaccination during five influenza seasons between October 2003 and March 2008. During the
study period, all pregnant women receiving prenatal
care in our clinic system were offered the annual
trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine. From October
2003 through March 2004, women were offered
vaccination only in the second and third trimesters. In
2004, the Advisory Committee of Immunization Practices of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention changed the pregnancy vaccination recommendations to include women in the first trimester.
Accordingly, from October 2004 through March
2008, vaccination was offered in all three trimesters.
Demographic information was entered into a
vaccination log in each of our prenatal clinics. The
vaccination record was then linked to our obstetric
database. Selected obstetric and neonatal outcomes
for all women delivering neonates at Parkland Health
and Hospital System are routinely entered into a
computerized database. Nurses attending each delivery complete an obstetric data sheet, and research
nurses assess the data for consistency and completeness before electronic storage. Data on neonatal outcomes are abstracted from discharge records. Information on malformations for all live births and
stillbirths was abstracted from the newborn nursery
hospital record at the time of discharge or death. In
addition, monthly committee reviews of all stillbirths
delivered at our hospital were also collected. Stillbirths were limited to a fetal death 500 g or more.
Malformations in live births were confirmed by neonatology fellows and faculty of the Department of
Pediatrics at the University of Texas Southwestern
Medical Center. Major malformations were categorized as those causing significant functional or cosmetic impairment or those that were life-limiting.
Examples of major malformations include neural tube
defect, hypoplastic left heart, ventral wall defect, and
craniofacial cleft.
Women receiving an influenza vaccination and
who delivered at our institution were compared with
women who received prenatal care during the months
of October through March for each of the 5 years of
the study. Neonatal outcomes were then assessed.
Statistical analysis was performed using SAS 9.1 and
included Student’s t test, 2
, and logistic regression.
We adjusted for race and diabetes in specific analyses.
This population-based, retrospective cohort study includes a fixed sample size dependent on the time
period of the study. Consequently, an a priori sample
size was not developed. This study was approved by
the institutional review board at the University of
Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas.
RESULTS
From October 2003 to March 2008, 10,225 women
received the trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine
and 8,690 delivered at our institution, 439 in the first
trimester and 8,251 in the second and third trimesters.
Demographic characteristics are listed in Table 1,
comparing the women accepting an influenza vaccine
with those who declined. Women receiving the vaccine antepartum were significantly older, with a
higher parity. They were also more likely to have a
pregnancy complication requiring them to be seen at
our Obstetrics Complications Clinic (72% compared
with 48%, respectively). Multiple gestations were
more common in those women receiving vaccinations, and body mass index (calculated as weight
(kg)/[height (m)]2
)was higher. Women vaccinated in
the first trimester had the highest medical complications rate at 81%, significantly higher than those
women receiving vaccination in the second or third
trimester (71%) (P.001).
Table 2 details the delivery and neonatal outcomes for the entire cohort. Although the overall
mean estimated gestational age at delivery was not
significantly different between the two groups, preterm delivery was decreased in those women receiving the influenza vaccine. Birth weight was not affected by vaccination. There was no increase in major
malformation rates in the two groups and, interestingly, the stillbirth and the neonatal death rates were
significantly decreased in those women receiving
influenza vaccination.
There were 447 neonates exposed to the influenza vaccine in the first trimester. Table 3 compares
selected neonatal outcomes by trimester of exposure
and with women who declined vaccination. Firsttrimester exposure to the annual influenza vaccine did
not result in an increase in major malformations. The
significant decrease in stillbirths was seen in the
second and third trimesters of vaccination compared
with the nonvaccinated group. Neonatal pneumonia
rates were highest in neonates born to women receiving the flu vaccine in the second or third trimester.
VOL. 120, NO. 3, SEPTEMBER 2012 Sheffield et al First-Trimester Influenza Vaccination 533
There was no statistical difference between the firsttrimester exposure and the nonvaccinated group.
Neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admissions were
higher in the neonates exposed to influenza vaccination in the first trimester; after adjusting for race and
diabetes, the odds ratio was 1.890 (1.3–2.8) compared
with the no-vaccination group. The NICU admissions
were lower in those women vaccinated in the second
and third trimesters.
DISCUSSION
In this study, we found that neonates exposed to the
seasonal trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine in the
first trimester of pregnancy did not have an increased
risk of major fetal malformations. In fact, vaccination
in any trimester was associated with a decrease in the
overall stillbirth rate, neonatal death, and preterm
delivery 36 or less and less than 32 weeks of gestation.
The high morbidity and mortality during pregnancy from influenza infection (pandemic and nonpandemic) has been reported for almost a century,
starting with the 1918 influenza epidemic.12–14 Influenza vaccination has been administered in pregnancy
for over 50 years to improve maternal health and fetal
and neonatal outcomes. Influenza vaccination of the
pregnant woman results in protective antibody titers,
comparable to levels in the nonpregnant adult. These
maternal antibodies then transmit transplacentally
and provide protection to the newborn during the first
few months of life.15–17 Several recent studies have
reported a decrease in influenza viral infection in
infants born to mothers who received the trivalent

inactivated influenza vaccine during pregnancy.3,18,19
Influenza vaccine of the pregnant woman has been
shown to also benefit the fetus.20 Omer and colleagues21 using surveillance data from the Georgia
Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System noted
a decrease in prematurity and small-for-gestationalage rates (as defined as less than 10%) in the cohort of
women receiving the seasonal influenza vaccine
during the period of widespread influenza activity.
Although vaccine effectiveness varies each year
depending on how well the vaccine strains match to
circulating virus and the incidence of influenza that
year, there is little doubt that maternal vaccination
during pregnancy is warranted for the health of the
mother–infant pair.22
These improvements in health outcomes, however, have to take vaccine safety into account. As
early as 1973 when a report of a population-based
collaborative perinatal project (1959 –1965) with over
2,000 pregnant women receiving the trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine was presented, vaccine safety
has been demonstrated.23 There is now a number of
papers reporting on the safety of trivalent inactivated
influenza vaccine during pregnancy, recently reviewed by Tamma and colleagues.9 Although no
harmful effects were reported in either the mother or
fetus or neonate, there is a paucity of contemporary
data from vaccination in the first trimester.3,10,24 The
U.S. Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System database from 1990 –2009 was recently reviewed.11 Adverse events in the mother are rare and no universal
patterns of pregnancy complications or fetal outcomes were observed. Although these data are reassuring, the Food and Drug Administration continues
to classify the trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine
as a pregnancy category B, indicating that reproductive animal studies have not shown a fetal risk, but
there are no controlled studies in pregnancy.
Despite the fact that the trivalent inactivated
influenza vaccine is considered effective and safe in
pregnancy, and is, in fact, recommended by the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and
American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, seasonal vaccination rates are historically dismal. Although these rates did increase in the setting of
the recent pandemic outbreak, it remains to be seen if
this increase can be sustained. Numerous reports have
been presented in recent years to try to determine
why vaccination rates are so low in this high-risk population. When patients were surveyed, a prevailing theme
was concern for maternal and fetal safety.6,8,25–29 When
obstetric health care providers were queried, a surprising number of respondents did not vaccinate in
the first trimester30 or felt that influenza vaccines were
not safe in pregnancy.7 Safety concerns were a major
issue for both patients and health care providers
despite impressive efforts by the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention and the American College of
Obstetricians and Gynecologists to educate the public
regarding vaccine safety. One of the limitations to
education has been the limited data available regarding first-trimester vaccination. Our study contributes
to the available safety literature and supports early
vaccination.
The increase in NICU admissions in neonates
whose mothers were vaccinated in the first trimester was an unexpected finding. This remained true
even when prematurity and a diagnosis of insulindependent diabetes was accounted for. This may
reflect the fact that there was a higher preponderance of women in the vaccination group with other
comorbid conditions followed in our Obstetrics
Complications Clinic, possibly leading to an NICU
admission. This NICU admission did not, however,
result in an increase in neonatal death or prolonged
length of stay.
There are several limitations to this study.
Women listed in the nonvaccinated group may have
received the trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine at
another location. Financial restrictions in our patient
population should have kept this number low because
the vaccine was offered free of charge at all of our
prenatal clinics. Furthermore, the potential addition
of some vaccinated women to the nonvaccinated

group would only serve to dilute the population,
lessening the significant differences. Given the large
control group, any statistical effect would likely be
small. Finally, there was a higher percentage of
women in the vaccinated group that was seen in our
obstetric complication clinic, possibly reflecting our
policy assuring that patients with comorbid conditions receive the influenza vaccine. This concentration of patients with comorbid conditions in the
vaccination group did not result in worse outcomes,
however, strengthening the argument that the vaccine
is safe in pregnancy. These women may have also had
high compliance rates for medical care, resulting in a
higher vaccination rate.
The 2009 influenza pandemic has focused new
attention on influenza in high-risk groups, including
pregnancy. Efforts to improve vaccination rates in
pregnancy have been escalated and much research
has gone into determining potential pitfalls and hurdles to overcome to increase this rate, safety being
one of the greatest concerns. Vaccine safety in the
second and third trimesters has been well described.
Our report describes the effect of influenza vaccination in the first trimester. There was no evidence of
increased major malformations diagnosed in the cohort of neonates born to mothers vaccinated in the
first 13 weeks of pregnancy. Immunization benefited
the entire cohort of women by its association with a
lower stillbirth and neonatal death rate as well as
preterm delivery. These effects are likely secondary
to the decrease in maternal influenza infection in
women who were vaccinated. In light of these
findings, patients and health care providers concerned about the safety of influenza vaccination in
the first trimester of pregnancy should be reassured,
which will hopefully lead to vaccination rates continuing to improve.
