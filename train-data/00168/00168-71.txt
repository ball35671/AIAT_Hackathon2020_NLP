In 2000, an influenza vaccine was associated with unusual ocular and respiratory symptoms (known as
“oculorespiratory syndrome” [ORS]) that possibly were due to numerous microaggregates of unsplit viruses
present in the product. We assessed the potential for an improved vaccine formulation (for use in 2001–2002)
to cause ORS and other symptoms in adults, using a double-blind, randomized, crossover study design.
Symptoms were ascertained 24 h after 622 doses of vaccine and 626 doses of saline placebo were injected.
The risk of ORS was 6.3% after vaccine injection and 3.4% after placebo injection, which yielded a significant
vaccine-attributable risk of 2.9% (95% confidence interval, 0.6–5.2). ORS symptoms were mild. Significant
differences in risk after injection of vaccine versus placebo existed for ocular soreness and/or itching (2.4%),
coughing (1.6%), and hoarseness (1.2%). Vaccine-attributable general symptoms were infrequent. We conclude
that certain mild oculorespiratory symptoms were triggered by an influenza vaccine that was otherwise minimally reactogenic and, hence, that such symptoms might be associated with influenza vaccines in general.
Trivalent, inactivated influenza vaccines are updated annually to match viruses in current circulation, and, historically, they have undergone only potency or immunogenicity testing to receive regulatory approval.
Little variation in vaccine safety was expected from year
to year. However, during the 2000–2001 influenza immunization season, Canadian health authorities received many more reports of vaccine-associated adverse
events than they had received in previous years; unusual
ocular or respiratory symptoms were mentioned in
most of these reports [1]. The adverse events reported
by 960 people met the case definition for a newly recReceived 19 September 2002; accepted 19 December 2002; electronically

ognized oculorespiratory syndrome (ORS). “ORS” was
defined as the presence of bilateral red eyes, and/or
facial edema, and/or any of the “ORS-defining respiratory symptoms” (i.e., coughing, wheezing, tightness
of the chest, difficulty breathing, or sore throat) that
began within 2–24 h after influenza vaccination and
resolved within 48 h after symptom onset [1]. Difficulty
swallowing and hoarseness were later added to the list
of ORS-defining symptoms [1]. The temporal elements
of the ORS definition were chosen in an effort to minimize confusion of ORS with immediate-type allergic
reactions or intercurrent respiratory infections.
ORS cases were generally mild and self-limited, but
10%–24% of individuals with ORS consulted a health
care provider [1, 2]. There were no deaths. Most individuals with ORS were women and were 30–59 years
of age. Ninety-six percent of the reported ORS cases
occurred after vaccination with Fluviral S/F (Shire Biologics), although this product accounted for only 31%
of vaccine doses distributed in Canada during the
2000–2001 influenza season [1]. Only 1% of the reDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/cid/article-abstract/36/7/850/318490 by guest on 15 October 2019

ported ORS cases were associated with Vaxigrip vaccine or Fluzone vaccine (Aventis Pasteur), which were also distributed in
Canada during that influenza season [1]. Retrospective surveys
performed in Quebec, where the implicated vaccine was used
exclusively, estimated an overall ORS attack rate of 3.4% (95%
CI, 2.4%–4.4%), which ranged to as high as 16% in women
40–59 years of age [2].
Electron microscopy revealed that the implicated vaccine
contained many large clumps of unsplit virions, particularly in
A/Panama (H3N2) preparations, in which up to one-third of
virions were unsplit [1]. Few microaggregates or unsplit virions
(2%) were evident in the 2 other influenza vaccines marketed
in Canada in 2000 [1]. These vaccines contained the same
strains and were split using Triton X-100. For the 2001–2002
influenza season, the deoxycholate splitting process previously
used for Fluviral S/F was combined with the use of Triton X100 for the A/Panama strain and was prolonged for the other
2 strains [1]. The federal regulatory agency requested that the
manufacturer assess the safety of the reformulated vaccine in
a controlled trial before the fall vaccination program. The present report describes the results of the safety evaluation.
METHODS
The present study was a multicenter, randomized, doubleblinded, crossover study that compared rates of symptom occurrence after vaccine and placebo injections. Subjects were
enrolled at 4 sites, which were located in provinces where Fluviral S/F vaccine was exclusively supplied for public vaccination
programs in 2000–2001. Three sites recruited mainly health
care workers, whereas the fourth site (located in Quebec City,
Quebec) recruited government office workers. Participants had
to be 30–59 years of age and generally healthy. Both first-time
and previous vaccine recipients were sought. Volunteers were
excluded from the study if they ever had experienced ORS
symptoms after influenza vaccination, were allergic to any component of the vaccine, ever had a serious reaction to influenza
vaccine, had immune system impairment or medication-related
immunosuppression, were pregnant, or had an active neurologic disorder or tendency to bleed. Also excluded from the
study were volunteers with preexisting ocular or respiratory
conditions that would have hampered recognition of ORS.
Study approval was obtained from the research ethics board of
each participating center, and appropriate informed consent
was obtained from each subject.
Subjects received influenza vaccine and placebo ∼7 days
(minimum, 5 days) apart, in random order. The vaccine administered was Fluviral S/F trivalent, split-formulation, inactivated, egg-derived influenza vaccine obtained from 1 lot that
had been manufactured for use during the 2001–2002 influenza
season. Each 0.5-mL dose of vaccine contained 15 mg of hemagglutinin antigen of A/New Caledonia/20/99 (H1N1), A/Panama/2007/99 (H3N2), or B/Victoria/504/2000. Adequacy of
splitting was assessed by electron microscopy before the vaccine
lot was released. The placebo injection consisted of 0.5 mL of
0.9% saline solution without preservative.
A specific nurse or pharmacist dispensed assigned injectables
in opaque, code-labeled syringes, effectively blinding all members of the field team and the subjects to treatment assignments.
Blinding was maintained until adjudication of the ORS cases
and initial data analyses were completed by the investigators.
Randomization lists were prepared for each site by the study
statistician, with treatment sequence assignments balanced
within each block of 10 subjects. Treatment assignment was
linked to the participants’ code numbers, which were assigned
serially at enrollment. Injections were administered into the
deltoid muscle by use of 3-mL syringes with 23-gauge needles,
which were 24 mm in length.
Safety assessment was based on structured telephone interviews with subjects that took place 24 h and 6 days after each
vaccination. When symptoms consistent with ORS were reported by subjects at 24 h after vaccination, another interview
was arranged to occur at ∼48 h after immunization to assess
symptom duration and severity.
On a daily basis, subjects used a worksheet checklist to record
solicited or other symptoms. Solicited symptoms are listed in
table 1. Subjects measured their temperature orally with an
electronic thermometer on the first 3 evenings after each injection was received and at any time that fever was suspected.
They referred to the worksheet during telephone interviews.
Interviews were structured to elicit details about each symptom,
including time of onset, duration, and whether the symptom
caused the subject to seek medical advice. Subjects rated the
intensity of most symptoms, on the basis of the effects of the
symptoms on the subjects’ ability to engage in normal activities
(i.e., easily tolerated symptoms vs. symptoms that interfered
with regular activities vs. symptoms that precluded regular activities). Unsolicited symptoms mentioned by subjects were
noted, and their causal relationship to immunization was assessed. Medications taken during the 6-day follow-up periods
were recorded, along with the reasons for their use.
The primary outcome measure was the vaccine-attributable
risk of ORS, which was based on symptoms consistent with
the national case definition of ORS [1]. This case definition
involved onset of specified symptoms (table 1) within 2–24 h
after vaccination and resolution of those symptoms within 2
days of onset. A second outcome of interest was the vaccineattributable risk of individual solicited symptoms.
The vaccine-attributable risks [3] of ORS and particular
symptoms were determined by subtracting the risk after placebo
injection from the risk after vaccine injection, and 95% CIs
were calculated using paired observations for maximal preciDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/cid/article-abstract/36/7/850/318490 by guest on 15 October 2019

recruited government workers. The mean age of the participants was uniform among the sites.
Figure 1 summarizes the compliance of subjects with the
main procedural steps of the study. Of 631 subjects given dose
1, a total of 617 received dose 2, for a crossover rate of 97.8%.
Intercurrent illness was the main reason for subjects not receiving dose 2. Overall, 622 doses of influenza vaccine were
given, and 620 of the 622 individuals who received the vaccine
were interviewed 24 h later. After 626 doses of placebo were
given, 624 subjects were similarly interviewed.
After administration of influenza vaccine and placebo, 60
instances of ORS symptoms were detected in 57 subjects (table
3). Cases were reported, with similar frequency, from all 4
centers (data not shown). A single ORS symptom occurred in
86% of subjects who had ORS after placebo injection and in
76% of subjects who had ORS after vaccine injection (P 1
.05). ORS symptoms were generally mild and easily tolerated,
but they interfered with the regular activity of 8 subjects (after
vaccine injection for 4 subjects and after placebo injection for
the other 4 subjects). No one with ORS symptoms sought
medical advice or needed hospitalization.
The occurrence of ORS symptoms after vaccine or placebo
injection is compared in table 3. Three subjects had ORS symptoms after both vaccine and placebo injection, although they
did not experience the same symptoms on each occasion. The
risk of vaccine-attributable ORS symptoms was significant
(2.9%; 95% CI, 0.6–5.2) ( , by McNemar’s exact test). P p .0198
Of the individual ORS symptoms, only hoarseness and coughing had a significant difference in risk after vaccine injection
versus risk after placebo injection (table 3). Combinations of
respiratory symptoms more often occurred after vaccine injection than after placebo injection.
Other symptoms reported by subjects with ORS are summarized in table 4. All injection-site symptoms were reported
more frequently among subjects with ORS after vaccine injection than among subjects without ORS after vaccine injection
or among subjects with ORS after placebo injection. Subjects
with ORS were more likely than others to report headache,
fatigue, muscle aches, or chills, but the risk differences after
vaccine and placebo injection were not significant.
We explored factors influencing the vaccine-attributable risk
of ORS. This risk was similar among men and women (3.2%
and 2.7%, respectively), by age (risk for subjects aged 30–39
years, 2.9%; for subjects aged 40–49 years, 1.6%; and for subjects aged 50–59 years, 4.4%), by center (risk range, 2.3%–
3.6%), and according to whether vaccine was given as the first
dose (2.2%) or the second dose (3.6%) in the series. First-time
recipients of influenza vaccine had a higher attributable risk of
ORS (5.0%) than did previously vaccinated subjects (2.2%),
but the difference was not statistically significant ( ). P p .094
Among all subjects who were evaluated 24 h after vaccine
administration, injection-site symptoms were common (more
so after vaccine injection than after placebo injection) (table
4). Approximately one-half of the vaccine recipients reported
pain, but only 11.6% reported consequent interference with
regular activities, and only 9 subjects (1.4%) reported taking
pain medication. Injection-site symptoms resolved fully by day
5 in 199% of subjects.
General symptoms occurred infrequently during the first 24
h after an injection was given (table 4). Fever (temperature,
38.0C) was reported by 5 subjects (0.8%) after vaccine injection and by none of the subjects after placebo injection.
Ocular soreness and/or itching was reported significantly more
often after vaccine injection than after placebo injection, as
were coughing and hoarseness. Other symptoms attributable
to vaccination included headache, fatigue, muscle aches and/
or soreness, nausea, and sleep disturbance, with risk differences
of 2.0%–5.6% (table 4). By day 2 after immunization, the risk
of general symptoms was nearly equal after vaccine and placebo
injection, except for sleep disturbance, the risk of which was

not equal until day 6 among subjects receiving vaccine and
subjects receiving placebo (data not shown). The risk of ocular
or respiratory symptoms developing after vaccine and placebo
injection did not differ during days 2–6 of surveillance (data
not shown).
During the 24 h after vaccine administration, women were
more likely than men to report certain symptoms, which were
limited to injection-site redness, swelling and pain, reduced arm
mobility, headache, and fatigue. Women were not more likely
than men to report ocular or respiratory symptoms after vaccine injection. After placebo injection, only headache occurred
more often among women than among men. Among first-time
vaccine recipients, attributable rates of injection-site and general symptoms were similar to those reported by previously
vaccinated subjects.
No subjects experienced a serious adverse event or anaphylaxis after vaccination. Most of the nonsolicited symptoms reported by subjects were categorized as likely being unrelated
to immunization.
DISCUSSION
This challenging preseason evaluation of an influenza vaccine,
including preliminary data analysis for regulatory review, was
completed in just 6 weeks. The reformulated vaccine proved
to be minimally reactogenic, although vaccine-attributable respiratory and ocular symptoms were still detectable. The vaccine
was approved for use on the basis of these observations, thereby
avoiding a nationwide vaccine shortage.
This study provides the first controlled data indicating that
certain ocular and respiratory symptoms occur as adverse effects of influenza vaccine, with their onset occurring within 24
h after injection. Symptoms attributable to vaccination included
hoarseness, coughing, and sore and/or itchy eyes. Bilateral conjunctival erythema, sore throat, difficulty swallowing, and nasal
congestion were also more common within 24 h after vaccine
injection, compared with placebo injection; however, the risk
differences were not statistically significant with the available
power. Ocular and respiratory symptoms were generally shortlived, similar to other vaccine-related adverse effects.
Some of the aforementioned symptoms are elements of the
case definition of ORS [1, 2]. According to the study definition
of ORS, the vaccine-attributable risk of ORS was 2.9% (P p
.0198, by McNemar’s exact test). Although direct comparison
with the vaccine implicated as the cause of adverse events during
the 2000 influenza season is not feasible, persons whose age and
sex are similar to those of persons included in the trial had ORS
risks of up to 16% [2]. The ORS symptoms attributed to the
reformulated vaccine were mild, well tolerated, and unlikely to
have been spontaneously reported as adverse events. Combined

ocular and respiratory symptoms occurred less than half as frequently among study subjects with ORS as among individuals
with ORS whose cases were reported in 2000 [1, 2]. Moreover,
chest discomfort, wheezing, and difficulty breathing featured
prominently in reported cases of ORS in 2000, appearing in 54%
of reports [2]; however, they were absent as vaccine-attributable
risks in this study. Of the many symptoms of ORS that were
included in the national case definition of ORS (table 1), only
coughing and hoarseness were found to be vaccine-attributable
symptoms. Had coughing and hoarseness alone been used to
define ORS, the vaccine-attributable risk would have remained
significant (2.3%; 95% CI, 1.0–2.6). The small number of cases

that we studied may not reflect the spectrum of ORS severity
that occurs when millions of people are vaccinated or when a
more reactogenic vaccine is used.
The placebo-controlled data from this study confirmed the
low risks of general adverse effects of influenza vaccine. Vaccine-attributable symptoms included headache, fatigue and/or
tiredness, muscle aches, sleep disturbance, and nausea, which
occurred at rates of 2.0%–5.6%. Most symptoms resolved
within 24 h after immunization, except for sleep disturbance
(possibly because of ongoing injection-site pain). These symptoms were of little clinical significance, but they were true adverse effects nonetheless. Other controlled trials involving
adults did not report general symptoms attributable to influenza vaccine, perhaps because older vaccine recipients are less
likely to experience them, or perhaps because symptom ascertainment was conducted after a longer interval after vaccination
[4–7]. First-time vaccine recipients did not have an increased
risk of general or local symptoms, which is in contrast to the
findings of earlier uncontrolled reports [8, 9] but is in keeping
with the results of another controlled study involving persons
in this age group [5]. As in previous studies, women in the
present study more often reported having local or general
symptoms, but this did not extend to ocular or respiratory
symptoms [5, 7, 10].
The design of the present study was robust. We chose our
study population to include persons who had the highest risk
for ORS, used full treatment masking to minimize bias, and
used a crossover design for procedural efficiency and optimal
control of host variables [4, 11]. The initial interviews that were
done 24 h after injections were given were timed to detect ORS
and other symptoms likely to have resulted from vaccination.
The number of subjects enrolled was sufficient to detect low
rates of vaccine-attributable symptoms (in the range of 2%).
Previous placebo-controlled trials of influenza vaccines had
limitations that we took care to avoid, including a priori classification of respiratory symptoms as coincidental, failure to
distinguish between respiratory symptoms that began within
24 h after vaccination or subsequently (or failure to distinguish
between respiratory symptoms of shorter or longer duration),
and failure to ascertain ocular symptoms [4–7].
This study had a number of limitations. Only one lot of a
particular influenza vaccine was studied, so the results may not
be generalizable to other products or annual formulations.
However, a cohort study performed in Canada in 2001 detected
ORS cases with similar frequency after administration of Fluviral S/F and Vaxigrip vaccines, which indicated that the adverse
effect is not limited to the products of one manufacturer [12].
Subjects were from a particular age group, so the results may
not apply to subjects of all ages. Informed and actively questioned subjects are more likely to report minor symptoms than
are members of the general population [13]. Because no minimum requirements for determination of symptom presence
were defined, it is inevitable that this trial discerned symptoms
that were milder than those reported to the adverse event surveillance system. Blinding of test products could not fully mask
that the frequency of injection-site pain associated with vaccine
was greater than that associated with placebo. The placebo
injection caused some discomfort (which subjects were told to
expect) that was sufficient to introduce uncertainty about the
treatment given. Pain could have prompted subjects to look
harder for all solicited symptoms, which possibly explains why
subjects with ORS had higher rates of injection-site and general
symptoms than did other vaccine recipients. Alternatively, the
greater frequency of a broad range of symptoms among subjects
with ORS might have resulted from the causative mechanism,
such as enhanced release of cytokines or chemokines. Individuals with ORS in 2000 also frequently reported general symptoms [2], which supports the presence of a common mechanism. The pathophysiology of ORS is not yet known; however,
a host factor is involved, because individuals with ORS are at
risk for recurrence of symptoms after revaccination in subsequent years [14, 15].
The improved safety profile of the 2001 vaccine formulation
indicates that efforts to revise the manufacturing process to
remove the ORS trigger were largely successful. Definite proof
that microaggregates of unsplit viruses were the cause of ORS
in 2000 remains to be established. Because it may not be possible to eliminate unsplit virions and aggregates altogether,
some low-level risk for triggering ocular and respiratory symptoms may be unavoidable. Formulations that unintentionally
contain more unsplit aggregated virions may cause an exaggerated effect, with increased frequency and severity of ocular,
respiratory, and other symptoms. Such full-blown symptoms
may be recognizable as a syndrome, but the mild symptoms
that we encountered likely do not warrant designation as a
syndrome per se. It would seem prudent to minimize the content of unsplit and aggregated virions in inactivated influenza
vaccines as a routine aspect of quality assurance.
In summary, this well-controlled study confirmed the excellent safety profile of a split influenza vaccine. Certain vaccine-attributable ocular and respiratory symptoms occurred at
rates of ∼2% but were mild. Symptoms with a low rate of
occurrence can be important when large populations are vaccinated in annual programs. Their occurrence and significance
should be monitored as influenza programs are extended to
include more children, adults of working age, and pregnant
women. Clinical trials of influenza vaccines should include appropriate assessment of early symptoms, including ocular and
respiratory symptoms.
