Abstract
Background: Influenza vaccination is routinely recommended for pregnant women, yet information on perinatal
outcomes is sparse.
Methods: We investigated the associations between trivalent (seasonal) influenza vaccination during pregnancy and
the risks of preterm delivery (PTD, live birth <37 weeks gestation) and small for gestational age birth (SGA, <10th
percentile in weight for sex-specific gestational age) during the influenza seasons 2006–07 through 2009–10. The
study population included 1619 mothers of live-born, non-malformed singleton infants interviewed as part of the
Slone Epidemiology Center’s Birth Defects Study. Associations between influenza vaccination and PTD and SGA
were assessed using Cox and logistic regression models, respectively, with propensity scores used to adjust for
confounding. Women vaccinated against pandemic H1N1 were excluded from the analysis.
Results: Influenza vaccination during pregnancy showed a near null association with PTD for influenza seasons
2006–07 through 2008–09 compared with unvaccinated women [adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) ranged from 0.79
[95% confidence interval (CI) 0.28, 2.21] in 2007–08 to 1.08 [95% CI: 0.40, 2.95] in 2008–09]. For 2009–10, the risk of
PTD was higher in vaccinated women (aHR, 7.81 [95% CI: 2.66, 23.0]). Influenza vaccination was not associated
with appreciable risks for SGA for all seasons with sufficient numbers of exposed SGA.
Conclusion: Though limited by study size, these findings add support to previous observations of little or no
increased risk of PTD or SGA associated with seasonal influenza vaccination for three of the four influenza seasons
in our study. The increased risk of PTD observed for the 2009–10 influenza season warrants further investigation.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
and the American Congress of Obstetricians and
Gynecologists recommend seasonal influenza vaccination for all women who will be pregnant during the
influenza season in order to reduce their considerably
increased risk of influenza-related mortality and
morbidity.1–3 Nonetheless, vaccination rates among
pregnant women in the US remain lower than ideal.4,5
Pregnant women may be reluctant to be vaccinated
because of concern that the vaccine may harm them or
their babies.4,6,7 There is limited evidence regarding
risks associated with influenza vaccination during
pregnancy, partly because pregnant women are typically excluded from clinical trials,8,9 leaving a gap in
knowledge that can affect vaccine uptake.
Two of the most common adverse pregnancy outcomes are preterm delivery (PTD) and small for gestational age birth (SGA). PTD (live birth before 37
weeks gestation) and SGA (<10th percentile in weight
for gestational age) are associated with increased perinatal mortality and both short- and long-term
morbidity.10–12 Previous studies of seasonal influenza
vaccination during pregnancy have found null or protective associations for PTD and SGA,13,14 but they
have often relied on medical records for exposure
assessment, collected limited information on the gestational timing of the vaccination, studied few first trimester exposures, and/or have not evaluated risks by
influenza season. The last concern is important since
antigens and manufacturing processes vary by season
and risks may similarly vary.
We sought to examine the associations between seasonal influenza vaccination [and not pandemic H1N1
(pH1N1) vaccination] during pregnancy and the risks
of PTD and SGA among a multiyear retrospective

cohort of pregnancies resulting in live-born, nonmalformed singleton infants. Exposure to influenza
vaccination during pregnancy was obtained by selfreport, thereby capturing vaccinations received both
inside and outside traditional medical provider settings. Vaccination date was also collected, permitting
consideration of the gestational timing of vaccination.
Methods
Study population
The Birth Defects Study (BDS), also known as the
Pregnancy Health Interview Study, is an ongoing
case-control study conducted by the Slone Epidemiology Center at Boston University since 1976.15,16 Cases
include infants diagnosed with at least one major
structural malformation. Controls include live-born
infants without any malformations. For the study
years included in this analysis (2006–10), malformed
infants and controls were identified from study hospitals serving the areas surrounding Philadelphia and
San Diego, as well as Rhode Island, Southern New
Hampshire, and (via the New York State Congenital
Malformations Registry) parts of New York State. In
Massachusetts, cases were identified through its
statewide birth defect registry and controls from a
population-based random sample of births. This study
has been approved by the Institutional Review Boards
of Boston University and relevant participating institutions, as appropriate.
Influenza vaccination exposure
Mothers of cases and controls were interviewed by
telephone within 6 months of pregnancy completion
by a study nurse about demographic, reproductive,
medical and behavioural factors, including the dates
of their last menstrual period (LMP) and delivery.
Beginning in July 2006, mothers were asked if they
received any vaccines, ‘such as tetanus, pertussis,
whooping cough, meningitis, flu shot or any other
vaccine’ between 2 months before their LMP and the
end of the pregnancy. The type and date of vaccination
were ascertained, as well as the setting where the
vaccine was administered. If the exact date of vaccination was not known, the respondent was asked if it
was the beginning, middle, or end of the month and
the 5th, 15th, or 25th day of that month was recorded,
respectively. Women who were only able to specify a
more general range of dates provided the start and
end dates of this range. All women who reported
receiving an influenza vaccination during pregnancy
were asked to provide a release to enable study staff
to obtain their vaccine record; approximately 60% of
women complied with this request.
Reports of seasonal trivalent influenza vaccination
were categorised according to the timing of receipt:
anytime during pregnancy (LMP to day before delivery), first trimester (LMP through 14 weeks), second
trimester (greater than 15 through 28 weeks), and
third trimester (greater than 29 weeks to day before
delivery). To maximise the accuracy of gestational
timing of exposure, we limited our analyses to women
who could be assigned a single trimester of exposure,
using the hierarchy of the date from the vaccine provider, then the subject’s reported vaccination date, and
then the mid-point of the subject’s reported exposure
date range if that date range spanned only one trimester. Influenza season was determined by vaccination
date between August 1 and July 31 of the following
year (e.g. a vaccination date of 15 September 2007 or
3 March 2008 was considered a ‘2007–08’ influenza
season exposure). To ensure equal opportunity for
exposure among non-exposed subjects, we included
only non-exposed subjects whose LMP dates fell
within the range of LMP dates reported by exposed
subjects; the reference group for all analyses was
women without reports of any influenza vaccination
(which included pH1N1 vaccination for the 2009–10
season) between 2 months before and the end of the
pregnancy.
Influenza-like illness (ILI)
In July 2009, assessment of ILI during pregnancy was
added to the BDS interview by asking the mother if
she had any ‘flu or flu-like illness’ during pregnancy.
If she replied affirmatively, further details were
obtained such as start and end date, duration, specific
symptoms, test results, and medication used. For this
analysis, ILI was defined as any self-report of flu or
flu-like illness.
Pregnancy outcomes
Gestational age at delivery and birthweight were
obtained by self-report from the mother during the
interview. Gestational age was determined by calculating the difference between the LMP and the day of

delivery. If the self-reported LMP date differed by
more than 7 days from the LMP date calculated from
the reported ultrasound-determined due date, then
the latter LMP date was used to calculate gestational
age. If the self-reported LMP date differed by 7 days
or less from the LMP calculated from the due date, we
chose to use the self-reported LMP date because it was
a date familiar to the mother and raised less confusion
during the course of the interview. SGA was based on
the sex-specific distribution of birthweights of infants
born in the US in 1999–2000.17,18
Study population
Because PTD and SGA are associated with birth
defects, we restricted our study to mothers of liveborn non-malformed infants (the BDS control group).
To estimate seasonal influenza coverage by season
and study site, we included women who had opportunity for prenatal exposure to seasonal influenza vaccines during the four seasons for which we had
complete information: 2006–07, 2007–08, 2008–09, and
2009–10.
For the risk analyses, we excluded 385 women who
reported exposure to the pH1N1 monovalent vaccine
in 2009–10 (either alone or in combination with seasonal influenza vaccination) or pH1N1 trivalent
vaccine in 2010–11, so that exposure and referent
groups were consistent across study years; further,
our findings for pH1N1 have been published.19 Additional exclusions for the risk analyses included:
known infant deaths, which were not systematically
ascertained (n = 2); women with multifetal gestations
(n = 47); subjects with missing birthweight (n = 6); and
reports of implausible gestational age (<25 or >42
weeks gestation, n = 2). Analyses also excluded
women for whom we could either not distinguish seasonal from pH1N1 vaccination in 2009–10 (n = 7) or
not assign a trimester of exposure based on their date
ranges (n = 78), but for a sensitivity analysis, these
women were included.
Statistical analysis
We considered our study participants to constitute a
retrospective cohort of completed pregnancies.20,21
Thus, we modelled the hazard of PTD using Cox
regression with influenza vaccination as a timevarying exposure; gestational age, in days beginning
at LMP, was the timescale.22,23 Full-term pregnancies
were censored at 37 weeks gestation and women with
vaccination later than 37 weeks were excluded
(n = 24). Models were run separately by trimester of
vaccination. Linear regression models were used to
evaluate the difference in gestational length (in days)
by exposure status. The outcome of SGA was a
dichotomous, compound measure that incorporated
gestational age; therefore, logistic regression was
chosen as the appropriate regression model. These
models were also run separately by trimester of vaccination and included influenza vaccinations up until
the day before delivery.
Propensity scores were used as covariates in the
regression analysis to adjust for confounding and variable selection for the propensity score models was
based on c-statistics. Variables included in the propensity score were maternal age at conception, race, education, family income, marital status, parity, study
centre, pre-pregnancy body mass index, family
history of birth defects, pregnancy intention,
periconceptional folic acid use, alcohol use, smoking,
asthma, diabetes, calendar quarter of LMP, infertility
treatment, treatment for high blood pressure or
toxemia, inter-pregnancy interval, illicit drug use, gestational weight gain, prenatal care initiation in first trimester, history of miscarriage, and employment
outside the home. The BDS interview does not identify history of PTD. Inclusion of additional factors and
several two-way interaction terms between smoking,
asthma, prenatal care initiation, and pregnancy intention did not affect the score’s ability to predict exposure (i.e. c-statistic changed <1%). Adjusted analyses
were only conducted when the number of exposed
cases was four or greater.
For 2009–10, the only influenza season for which we
had this information, reports of ILI were tallied by
seasonal influenza vaccination exposure status and an
odds ratio was calculated. For women vaccinated
against seasonal influenza, only reports of ILI occurring after vaccination were included. The association
between ILI and preterm birth was calculated as an
odds ratio.
All analyses were conducted with SAS 9.2 (SAS
Institute, Cary, NC, USA).
Results
Overall, 2136 mothers of live-born non-malformed
infants were included in estimates of seasonal influenza vaccination coverage for influenza seasons

2006–07 through 2009–10. For our analytical cohort of
pregnancy outcomes, the previously mentioned study
exclusions were applied (including exclusion of 385
women vaccinated against monovalent or trivalent
pH1N1), resulting in 1619 study subjects. The majority
of our study participants were white (60%, 964/1619),
25 years or older at time of conception (74%, 1203/
1619), and had at least a high school education (89%,
1439/1619; Table 1). When we examined the demographic characteristics of women, by vaccine status,
according to season, we observed differences for the
2009–10 season in race, age, study site, and calendar
quarter of LMP among vaccinated women (Supporting Information Tables S1–6).
Influenza vaccination
Thirty per cent (637/2136) of women reported seasonal influenza vaccination during pregnancy for the
four seasons collectively; for the 2006–07 through
2009–10 seasons, coverage was 18.4% (92/499), 19.6%
(140/715), 19.5% (145/743), and 32.7% (261/799),
respectively (one woman reported seasonal influenza
vaccination for two consecutive seasons while pregnant; Figure 1). Coverage was on average higher in
Massachusetts (38%) than other study sites (Philadelphia 25%, San Diego 23%, New York 33%). For our
analytic cohort, in which gestational timing of vaccination was assessed, seasonal influenza vaccination was
most commonly received during the second trimester
of pregnancy (41%, 138/334), followed by the third
trimester (34%, 114/334) and first trimester (25%,
82/334); 7% (24/334) of women reported an influenza
vaccination after 37 weeks gestation.
Preterm delivery
In our analytical cohort, 6.6% (n = 107/1619) of pregnancies resulted in PTD (Table 2). Gestational age at
delivery ranged from 25 to 42 weeks (median, 39). In
all seasons collectively, compared with women who
reported no influenza vaccination during pregnancy,
those who were vaccinated at any time during pregnancy had an adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of 1.37,
with a 95% confidence interval (CI) that included the
null. For vaccination during the first, second, and third
trimesters, aHRs were 0.66, 1.46, and 1.53, respectively, with all CIs including the null. Findings
changed minimally when we included as exposed the
85 women with either unknown influenza vaccination
type or with a reported vaccination date range that
spanned more than one trimester (data not shown).
Stratification by influenza season (Table 3) revealed
close to null associations with PTD for the 2006–07
through 2008–09 seasons (aHRs ranged from 0.79 in
2007–08 to 1.08 in 2008–09; all CIs included the null).
For the 2009–10 influenza season, the risk of PTD was
higher in vaccinated women (aHR = 7.81, [95% CI:
2.66, 23.0]); this risk was greatest for third trimester
exposure (aHR = 9.78, [95% CI: 2.64, 36.2]; Supporting
Information Tables S1–6). When we restricted the
2009–10 exposed group to the 15 women whose vaccination was confirmed by medical record, the aHR for
exposure anytime during pregnancy remained largely
unchanged (aHR = 7.32, [95% CI: 1.81, 29.6]). When
we included the 154 women vaccinated against both
seasonal and pH1N1 influenza that year, we observed
an attenuated, but still elevated, risk of PTD
(aHR = 3.54, [95% CI: 1.49, 8.41]; Supporting Information Tables S1–6). Overall, the average difference in
gestational length of pregnancy between women vaccinated for seasonal influenza alone and those
unvaccinated was −0.32 days [95% CI: −1.86, 1.23] and
for 2009–10, it was −6.22 days [95% CI:−10.5, −1.94]
(Supporting Information Tables S1–6).
Because we had no information about prior PTD,
we repeated the analysis for 2009–10 stratified by
parity. In primiparous women, the crude HR fell to
4.82 [95% CI 1.20, 19.3], but there were too few (n = 3)
exposed PTD subjects to permit an adjusted analysis;
in multiparous women the crude HR increased to 16.7
[95% CI 5.39, 52.0].
SGA
In our analytical cohort, 10.6% (172/1619) of infants
were classified as SGA (Table 2). Compared with
women reporting no influenza vaccination during
pregnancy, those vaccinated at any time during pregnancy had no increased risk for SGA (aOR = 1.03,
with a 95% CI that included the null) (Table 2).
Women with influenza vaccination during the first,
second, and third trimesters had aORs of 0.44, 1.53,
and 1.00, respectively; all CIs included the null. Estimates of association with SGA varied for the 2007–08
through the 2009–10 seasons (Table 4); aORs ranged
from 0.60 in 2009–10 to 1.40 in 2007–08, with all CIs
including the null. AORs for the 2006–07 season could
not be estimated because there were too few exposed
SGA.

ILI and preterm delivery
For the 2009–10 season, ILI during pregnancy was
reported by 3.1% (1/32) women vaccinated against
seasonal influenza and 6.4% (22/346) of women not
vaccinated (OR = 0.48, [95% CI 0.01, 3.16]). The risk of
preterm birth was 4.3% (1/23) among women reporting ILI and 5.6% (20/355) among women not reporting ILI (OR = 0.76, [95% CI 0.02, 5.24]).
Comment
Among a cohort of pregnancies resulting in singleton,
live-born, non-malformed infants, influenza vaccination at any time during pregnancy showed a modest
but unstable positive association with PTD. This
overall risk was entirely caused by an almost
eightfold increased risk in the 2009–10 season, with a
CI whose lower bound appreciably excluded the
null. For SGA, there was no evidence of an
appreciably increased risk overall or for all seasons
for which there were sufficient data to estimate risk.
Influenza vaccination coverage among pregnant
women increased from 2006–07 through 2009–10,
which is consistent with national estimates for same
period.24
With the exception of our observed risk for PTD in
the 2009–10 season, our study’s results are in agreement with previous null findings from other studies
focused on pre-pH1N1 seasonal influenza vaccination
in pregnancy.25–29 However, they are not in agreement
with recently observed protective associations for
these outcomes.30,31 Our finding of an almost eightfold
increased hazard for PTD associated with the 2009–10
seasonal influenza vaccination has not been previously
reported. However, none of these previous studies

included an examination of the seasonal trivalent
vaccine for the 2009–10 influenza season.
We considered a number of possible explanations
for our observed increased risk of PTD in the 2009–10
season. Over half of women vaccinated against influenza that year received the pH1N1 vaccine and were
therefore excluded from our analysis, introducing the
possibility of significant bias. In a post-hoc analysis,
we included women vaccinated against both seasonal
and pH1N1 influenza that year and observed an
attenuated, but still elevated, risk of PTD. We also
found differences in the demographic characteristics
of women vaccinated against only seasonal influenza
vaccine during the 2009–10 season compared with
those vaccinated in previous years. However, our propensity score analysis adjusted for all of these demographic factors. It is also important to note that we did
not have information on history of PTD; if such a
history were more common among subjects in the
2009–10 season compared with previous seasons, it
could confound the association we observed, as
history of PTD could both influence the decision to
get vaccinated and the risk of PTD in the index pregnancy. However, when we limited the 2009–10 analysis to primiparous women who could not have had a
prior PTD, the risk, though attenuated, was still
elevated. Unfortunately, numbers were too small (only
three exposed PTD) to allow adjustment for other
possible confounders. The question of residual
confounding by PTD history remains unresolved
among the multiparous women. Bias caused by
misclassification is also possible, though we previously found that maternal reports of vaccination
showed high positive and negative predictive values
compared with vaccination records,32 and restricting
the analysis to exposures confirmed by medical record
had little effect on the overall increased risk. Finally,
the elevated risk we observed for PTD in 2009–10 was
based on only nine exposed cases overall and five in
the third trimester, raising the possibility that our

findings may be due to chance, though this seems
unlikely based on the lower confidence bound of 2.7.
Strengths of our study include the collection of selfreported influenza vaccination exposure information
and our rigorous analytical design. As 24% of influenza vaccinations in our study were provided outside
of traditional medical settings (e.g. pharmacies, government flu clinics, schools, workplaces), studies that
rely solely on vaccinations recorded in the medical
record can result in exposure misclassification, which
could bias estimates towards the null.33 Where available, we were also able to use vaccination records to
verify maternal reports and obtain accurate dates. Our
comprehensive interview provided data on over 25
maternal risk factors that enabled us to create and
evaluate propensity scores for our adjusted analyses.
Further, we aligned pregnancies according to LMP, so
that the unvaccinated comparison group had the same
window of opportunity for influenza vaccination by
trimester of pregnancy. In contrast, other studies have
selected the unvaccinated comparison group based on
the time of delivery, which would be affected by the
gestational length of the pregnancy.26,34–36
These considerations notwithstanding, it is noteworthy that the elevated risk for PTD was observed
only in the one season (2009–10) when two influenza
vaccines were available – the seasonal and pH1N1
strains. With the exception of two studies, other investigations related to that season have focused on
pH1N1, without specific consideration of the risks
that might be associated with that year’s seasonal
vaccine. The Vaccines and Medications in Pregnancy
Surveillance System, a collaborative effort involving a
pregnancy registry cohort (conducted by the Organization of Teratogen Information Specialists) and our
case-control BDS, studied the pH1N1 vaccine in pregnancy, including both the 2009–10 season, when the
pH1N1 was given as a separate monovalent vaccine,
and subsequent years, when it was combined with the
seasonal vaccine. The cohort arm identified a threefold
increase in PTD risk associated with exposure to the
pH1N1 vaccine in the years 2009–12 compared with
women not exposed to any vaccine37 (numbers were
insufficient to consider risks for 2009–10 seasonal
vaccine alone); in analyses of BDS data, for the
2009–10 season, we found a comparable threefold risk
associated with exposure to the pH1N1 vaccine,
whether or not women were also exposed to that
year’s seasonal vaccine;19 a subanalysis confined to the
small proportion of women who received the pH1N1

vaccine alone revealed some attenuation in risk. Given
that there was likely some misclassification of the two
vaccines that year (particularly among women
without medical vaccination records available), it is
quite possible that the threefold risk observed for
pH1N1 was in part explained by the eightfold risk we
have now observed in association with that year’s seasonal vaccine alone.
Biological explanations for an increased risk of PTD
among the women vaccinated with the seasonal
vaccine could include a greater susceptibility to
pH1N1 infection (conferring an increased risk of PTD)
compared with unvaccinated women.38 However, in
our study, ILI was not more common in women vaccinated against seasonal influenza in 2009–10 nor was
PTD more common in women reporting ILI. Alternative possible explanations could include a novel
vaccine antigen exposure, as a new B antigen strain
was introduced in the trivalent seasonal vaccine that
year;39 further, production practices by vaccine manufacturers may vary by year potentially introducing
new antigens.
Pregnant women are now considered to be among
the highest priority groups to receive influenza vaccination,3,26,40 as maternal vaccination has been shown to
benefit both the pregnant woman and her offspring.
Continuing research on influenza vaccination and
perinatal outcomes is critical to provide additional
information on the safety of influenza vaccination
during pregnancy. This is particularly important as the
vaccines are not identical from year to year, with variations in both the antigen strains selected and production practices.
In conclusion, with the exception of PTD associated
with the 2009–10 seasonal vaccine, our study found no
meaningful increases in PTD or SGA risks associated
with seasonal trivalent influenza vaccination during
pregnancy over the years of our study. These findings
provide some reassurance to providers and pregnant
women regarding seasonal influenza vaccine safety.
The finding for PTD risk during the season when
there was a separate pandemic vaccine warrants
further consideration.
