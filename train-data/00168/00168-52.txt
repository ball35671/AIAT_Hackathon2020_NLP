The effects of intranasal inoculatioti with live attenuated, CR influenza virus vaccines on pulmonary
function in healthy and asthmatic adults were evaluated in placebo-controlled, double-blind studies.
In 46 healthy adult volunteers, there were no statistically significant alterations in pulmonary
function as measured by spirometry and histamine bronchoprovocation tests in the first week
following monovalent CR influenza virus vaccine [type ,4 (H3N2, HIN1) and type B]. Among
healthy adults with pre-inoculation PC 2 os < 10 mg ml- i, 8[12 were infected following vaccination
but no significant alterations occurred in histamine bronchoprovocation. In 11 asthmatic adults,
no statistically significant alterations in pulmonary function, as measured by spirometry, were
noted during the first 7 days postinoculation with bivalent CR influenza virus vaccine type ,4 ( H3N2
and HIM). Postinocalation respiratory illnesses were more common in CR influenza virus vaccine
recipients than placebo recipients, but they were mild, consisting of a febrile pharyngitis and transient
rhinorrhea. Attenuated CR influenza virus vaccines do not appear to impair pulmonary function
during the first week following immunization of healthy and asthmatic adults.

Introduction
Influenza virus infections occur in a seasonal pattern and
are often accompanied by excess mortality 1-3. The excess
mortality tends to occur in the elderly and in persons
with certain chronic diseases, principally in those with
chronic pulmonary or cardiac disease. Vaccination is a
method to decrease the infection rate and the severity of
illness when infection occurs. In spite of recommendations
to vaccinate all members in high risk groups with
inactivated influenza virus vaccine, vaccination rates are
generally < 20% 4.
Live attenuated influenza virus vaccines have been
extensively evaluated for safety and efficacy. Attenuation
has been achieved: by selection of inhibitor resistant
mutants; by recombination of the pathogenic virus with
a strain known to be attenuated in man, e.g., the
A/PR/8/34 strain; by recombination of the pathogenic
virus with a temperature-sensitive mutant; or by recombination of the pathogenic virus with a cold-adapted
mutant 5. These vaccines have been studied with the
hope of increasing protection against infection and
increasing acceptance among recipients. Temperaturesensitive vaccine viruses cause local infection in the lower
temperatures of the nasopharynx (32°-34°C) but their
replication is restricted at the higher temperatures of the
lower respiratory tract (37°-38°C). Cold-recombinant
(CR) influenza virus vaccines express the haemagglutinin

and neuraminidase of wild-type influenza viruses and the
internal genes of a cold-adapted donor virus; they also
exhibit the property of temperature sensitivity. These
cold-adapted mutants are selected by their ability to grow
at 25°C.
A number of reports have demonstrated changes in
pulmonary function tests during and/or following infection
with respiratory viruses, including rhinovirus and type
A influenza virus 6-2°. Some reports have also noted
changes in selected pulmonary function tests after
administration of live attenuated influenza virus vaccines 2 x-25; other reports have failed to demonstrate such
changes 2°'26-33. When noted, changes in pulmonary
function have usually been present within the first week
following illness or vaccination. The purpose of the study
was to determine if there would be significant changes
in pulmonary function tests performed serially within the
first week after intranasal vaccination with different CR
influenza virus vaccines in several groups of volunteers:
normals, those with mild bronchial hyperreactivity and
those with asthma.
Materials and methods
Study population
Seventy-four healthy volunteers between the ages of
18 and 40 years with and without serum neutralizing
antibodies (NtAb) to influenza viruses A (H3N2 and
H1N1) or B were enrolled. One placebo and one vaccine
recipient were not used in data analysis because of
documented extraneous viral infection (parainfluenza
virus type 2, picornavirus). Volunteers were selected who
demonstrated no or mild reactivity to inhaled histamine

(histamine bronchoprovocation) on screening pulmonary
function tests. Nineteen volunteers with a history of
asthma were studied. One vaccine and one placebo
recipient were not used in the final data analysis because
of documented extraneous viral infection (picornavirus,
parainfluenza virus type 3). All 17 evaluable asthmatic
subjects had a history of intermittent wheezing; 15 were
receiving either continuous or intermittent bronchodilation therapy. All asthmatic subjects had been
clinically stable by history during the few months
preceding enrolment. All vaccine studies were performed
between July :and October of 1985-1988. Informed
consent was obtained from each participant in accordance
with protocols approved by local and National Institute
of Allergy and Infectious Disease review boards.
Individuals were excluded if they had acute respiratory
illness, allergy to eggs or were pregnant. All studies with
CR vaccines were performed on an outpatient basis. In
each group, volunteers were randomly assigned to receive
either CR vaccine or placebo in a 2:1 ratio, respectively.
CR vaccines
Healthy volunteers received monovalent CR influenza
virus vaccine or placebo [normal allantoic fluid (Flow
Laboratories, Bethesda, USA)] in a double-blind protocol. Recruitment of volunteers took place over several
years. If randomized to receive vaccine, the volunteer
received the most current A (H1N1, H3N2) or B influenza
virus vaccine available for testing. The inoculated
monovalent CR influenza A (H 1N 1) virus vaccines, were
the following: A/Dunedin/6/83-CR64 (lot E-221; 107.2
p.f.u./0.5ml) or A/Kawasaki/9/86-CR125 (lot E-264;
106.7 TCIDso/0.5ml). The inoculated monovalent CR
influenza A (H3N2) virus vaccines were the following:
A/Korea/1/82-CR59 (lot E-204; 106"° TCIDso/0.5 ml) or
A/Bethesda/1/85-CR90 (lot E-259; 1071 TCID~o/0.5 ml).
The inoculated CR influenza B virus vaccines were the
following: B/Texas/1/84-CRB87 (lot E-255; 107.6 TCIDso/
0.5ml) or B/Ann Arbor/1/86-CRBl17 (lot E-268; 107.2
TCIDso/0.5 ml). The vaccine or placebo was delivered
as 0.25 ml per nostril.
In volunteers with asthma, bivalent CR influenza A
(H3N2+H1N1) virus vaccine or placebo [normal
allantoic fluid (Flow Laboratories)-] was used in separate
double-blind studies. Since the majority of these volunteers were seropositive to at least one of the available
influenza strains, bivalent vaccine was given to increase
the likelihood of infection with one of the two vaccine
viruses. The bivalent CR influenza A virus vaccine
contained either A/Texas/1/85-CR98 (lot E-256; 107.2
TCIDso/0.5 ml) plus A/Bethesda/1/85-CR90 (lot E-259;
107"1 TCIDso/0.5ml ) or A/Kawasaki/9/86-CR125 (lot
E-263; 107.o TCIDso/0.5 ml) plus A/Bethesda/1/85-CR90
(lot E-259, 107.3 TCIDso/0.5 ml). The vaccine or placebo
was delivered as 0.25 ml per nostril.
Laboratory tests
Nasal washes were performed with 10ml of lactated
Ringers on days 0, 2, 3-4 and 7 postinoculation. In a
group of 8 volunteers receiving B/Texas/I/84 CRB87,
nasal washes were also taken on day 1. The recovered
nasal wash (NW) was added to veal infusion broth
containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and
antibiotics and kept at 4°C until inoculated into
appropriate tissue culture. Preinoculation specimens
(NW + throat swab specimens) in all subjects and day 2,
3-4 and 7 specimens in subjects with unexplained
respiratory illnesses were tested for the presence of
extraneous viruses on Madin-Darby canine kidney
(MDCK), human embryonic lung fibroblasts (WI-38),
human epidermoid carcinoma (HEp-2), and continuous
rhesus monkey (LLC-MK2) tissue culture cells.
Serum was obtained pre (day 0) and post (days 21-28)
inoculation and tested for NtAb using MDCK cells in
microtitre plates as previously described 34. A preinoculation titre of ~< 4 was defined as being seronegative.
Infection was defined as virus isolation and/or >t four-fold
rise in serum NtAb titre between pre and postinoculation
serum samples.
Pulmonary function tests
Routine spirometry was performed on days 0, 3-4 and
7 postinoculation on either a Medical Graphics pneumotachometer or an Ohio 822 rolling seal spirometer.
Spirometric data were selected in accordance with the
criteria outlined by the Snowbird Workshop 35 and
included measurements of FEV 1, "FVC, FEV1/FVC, and
FEF25_75. A >/5% decrease in FEVI or FVC compared to baseline was considered significant in healthy
volunteers; a t>13% decrease in FEV 1 or >111%
decrease in FVC compared to baseline was considered
significant in asthmatic volunteers 36'37. Lung volumes
and airway resistance were determined by the shallow
pant technique using a Medical Graphics body plethysmograph. Single breath diffusion capacity (DLco) was
performed on a sub-group of the healthy volunteers using
a PK Morgan Analyzer with 9.70% helium, 0.294% CO
and 20.6% 0 2 as a test gas.
Histamine bronchoprovocation tests were performed
on healthy volunteers using a modification of previously
described methods 38. Twofold dilutions of histamine
were used: 1.0, 2.5, 5.0 and 10mgm1-1. Subjects took
five breaths of aerosol generated by a Baylor Dosimeter
designed to deliver air, 61min-1, for 2 s via a hand held
nebulizer. FEVI was measured 2min after the fifth
breath. The provocation concentration at which a 20%
decrease in FEV1 was noted (PC2o) was calculated as
follows39:
(20-R1)(C2-C1)
PC2o - t-C1
R2-R1
C1 is the histamine concentration producing a <20%
FEV~ fall and C2 is that concentration producing a
>20% FEV 1 fall. R1 and R2 are the percentages of
reductions in FEV 1 produced by C1 and C2, respectively.
A significant reduction in PC2o was considered to be a
>t 20% fall in FEV 1 at a t> 2-dilutions lower concentration
of histamine compared to baseline 4°.
All pulmonary function tests (PFTs) in the healthy
adult volunteers were performed at the same time of day,
usually in the morning, except for the day 3-4 studies
which were performed in the late afternoon. All PFTs in
the asthmatic group were performed at the same time on
each test day, usually in the morning. Volunteers on
bronchodilator inhalers were asked to refrain from use
on the mornings prior to their PFT studies.
Clinical evaluation
Volunteers were seen and examined on days 0, 2, 3-4
and 7 following inoculation. A temperature of >~ 37.8°C
218 Vaccine, Vol. 8, June 1990 
was considered fever. Signs and symptoms were categorized as mild, moderate or severe by the physician
observers. In addition, temperatures and symptoms were
recorded by the volunteer in a daily diary for 7 days
following inoculation. Records were assessed for illness
at the end of the clinical observation period by blinded
physicians (RLA and SBG). Illness was defined as signs
and symptoms of an upper and/or lower respiratory
illness occurring during the first 7 days postinoculation,
plus the volunteer's perception that he/she had a
respiratory illness during the week following inoculation.
Statistical methods
Demographic and illness differences between vaccine
and placebo recipients were analysed by ;(2 with Yates'
correction, Fisher's two-tailed exact test, or Wilcoxon's
rank sum test. Differences in pulmonary function test
results within vaccine and placebo recipient groups were
analysed by Student's paired t-test. Differences between
vaccine and placebo recipient groups were analysed by
unpaired t-test.
Using Rozas' data 36 on the daily variation of FEV 1
and FVC in normal healthy adults, it was calculated that
10 volunteers would need to be vaccinated to detect a
mean change in FEV 1 or FVC of 5% at an or=0.05 and
a 1~ = 0.20. It was estimated that seven asthmatics would
need to be vaccinated to detect a mean change of 13%
in FEV 1 or 11% in FVC at an ct = 0.05 and a fl = 0.2036'37.
Results
Population characteristics, clinical and virologic
responses in healthy adults following monovalent
CR influenza virus vaccine
Seventy-two healthy adult volunteers were enrolled in
the study: 26 received placebo and 46 received a
monovalent CR vaccine (see Table I). There were no
significant differences in mean [_+s.d.] age (26.2+3.3
versus 27.4_+3.3) or sex ratio (M:F=30:16 vs. 12:14)
between vaccine and placebo recipients. Two placebo
(<1 and 10 pack years) and two vaccine (<1 and 3
pack years) recipients were active cigarette smokers.
Approximately 25% gave a history of hay fever.
Among the 26 placebo recipients, four (15%) had an

upper respiratory tract illness (URI) during the first seven
days of the study. There were no documented influenza
or other viral infections in this group of volunteers. A
higher number of the CR vaccine recipients (17/46, 37%)
than placebos (4/26, 15%) had a respiratory illness during
the first seven days of the study (Z 2 = 2.77, 0.05 < p < 0.10).
Twelve illnesses in the CR vaccine recipients were
associated with evidence of influenza infection (39%) and
five illnesses were reported in the uninfected volunteers
(33%). No viral isolates were found in these uninfected
CR vaccine recipients with respiratory illness. All
respiratory illnesses were mild, afebrile URIs with sore
throat (13/17) and rhinorrhea (6/17) being the predominant symptoms. Symptoms began within one day of
vaccination in ten and began within 3 days of vaccination
in all CR vaccine recipients; the symptoms lasted an
average of 3 days (range 1-7 days). Illnesses in placebo
recipients were similar (2/4 sore throat and 2/4 rhinorrhea)
but tended to begin later (days 2-5, placebo rank
sum=70.5, p<0.05 compared to vaccine, Wilcoxon's
rank sum test).
One female volunteer who received A/Kawasaki/9/86
CR125 developed subacute thyroiditis within one week
postinoculation. No viral isolates were found, but a
32-fold serum NtAb titre rise (1:4 to 1:128) to the vaccine
strain was measured. No extraneous virus was identified
by virus culture (MDCK, LLC-MK2, HEp2 and WI-38
cells) or by serologic studies for mumps (ELISA), rubeola
(HI), adenovirus (complement fixation), enteroviruses
(coxsackie A 7, 9, 10 and 16, coxsackie B 1-6, echo type
4, 9, 11 and 16 by complement fixation) and Epstein-Barr
virus VCA and EBNA antibodies (Specialty Laboratories,
Inc). HLA typing revealed phenotype A1, 3; B17 (w4)
w41 (w6); DR4, X (DQw3; DRw52, DRw53). At one
year postinoculation, the volunteer was euthyroid but
had mild local thyroid tenderness.
Seventy percent (31/46) of the monovalent CR
influenza virus vaccine recipients were infected as
determined by virus isolation and/or serologic response.
Of the 27 seronegative volunteers, 23 (85%) were infected.
Significantly more volunteers who received CR influenza
A/H1N1 or CR influenza B virus than who received CR
influenza A/H3N2 virus vaccine were infected (12/16 vs.
4/13, Z2=4.02, p<0.05 and 15/17 vs. 4/13, p=0.002,

Fisher's two-tailed exact test, respectively). However,
there were no significant differences in infection frequency
among seronegative CR influenza A or CR influenza B
virus vaccine recipients. Of the 31 infected individuals,
12 (39%) shed virus and had seroconversion by NtAb
antibody tests, 14 (45%) shed virus only and 5 (16%)
had infection documented by seroconversion only.
Recovery of vaccine virus was more common in
seronegative volunteers compared with seropositive
volunteers (19/27 vs. 7/19, Z2=3.83, p<0.05).
Population characteristics, clinical and virologic
responses in asthmatic adults following bivalent
CR influenza virus vaccine
Seventeen volunteers with a history of asthma were
enrolled in the study: six received placebo and 11 received
a bivalent CR vaccine (see Table 1). There were no
significant differences in mean [_+s.d.] age (37.2_+21.5
vs. 36.2_+ 14.9) or sex ratio (M:F=3:3 vs. 4:7) between
placebo and vaccine recipients. One placebo (20 pack
years) and one vaccine (10 pack years) recipient were
active cigarette smokers.
Among the six placebo recipients, four (67%) had an
illness during the first seven days of the study; no
influenza or other viral infections were documented in
this group of asthmatic volunteers. Sore throat (2/4) and
rhinorrhea were the most common symptoms in this
group. One volunteer who received placebo was hospitalized for exacerbation of asthma five days after inoculation;
however, no viral infection could be documented in this
patient. Of the 11 bivalent CR influenza A virus vaccine
recipients, 4 (36%) had a respiratory illness during the
first 7 days following vaccination. The illnesses were
transient, mild URIs which resolved uneventfully and
required no additional therapy. Sore throat (4/4) and
rhinorrhca (3/4) were the predominant symptoms and
lasted an average of 4 days. All four of the illnesses were
in volunteers who had documented infection with the CR
vaccine. None of the vaccine recipients noted an increased
use of bronchodilation therapy in the week following
vaccination.
Seventy-three percent (8/11) of bivalent CR influenza
A vaccine recipients were infected as determined by virus
isolations and/or serologic response. No volunteer was
seronegative to both H1N1 and H3N2. All patients
seronegative to H1N1 or H3N2 were infected (5/5). Of
the eight infected asthmatic volunteers, four shed virus
and six had significant NtAb titre rises to vaccine virus.
Only one volunteer had a significant antibody response
to both of the CR vaccine strains administered.
Pulmonary function results after CR vaccine
No significant changes in mean FEV~, FVC, and
FEF2~_~5, occurred among the healthy or asthmatic
adults on days 3-4 or 7 postvaccination (see Table 2).
No significant changes in FEV~/FVC occurred among
the healthy or asthmatic adults on days 3-4 or 7
postvaccination (data not shown). DEc o was unchanged
in 15 CR influenza A virus vaccine and 6 placebo
recipients on days 3-4 and 7 postvaccination. Among
the CR influenza A/H3N2 virus vaccine recipients, there
were higher mean [_+ s.d.] RAW values measured on day
3-4 compared to day 0 values (1.70__ 0.41 vs. 1.48 __ 0.38,

differences within or between the CR vaccine groups for
any measured value for any day.
A significant decrease in FEV x and FVC was noted
on day 3-4 or 7 postinoculation in 13% (percent drop
in FEV I ranged from 5.9% to 12.4%) and 15% (percent
drop in FVC ranged from 6.6% to 14.1%) of the
monovalent vaccine recipients, respectively (see Table 3).
This was not statistically significantly different from the
percentage of placebo recipients who had a similar
• decrease in FEV 1 or FVC, 15% (percent drop of FEV 1
ranged from 5.1% to 6.9%) and 12% (percent drop in
FVC ranged from 5% to 7.8%), respectively.
A significant decrease in PC2o was noted in 2/26
volunteers who received CR monovalent vaccine and had
baseline PC2o levels of > 10mgm1-1 (Table 3). One of
the two volunteers maintained a PC2o of ~5 mgml-1
when last tested at 7.5 months postvaccination. This
volunteer had a baseline NtAb titre of 1:24 but developed
a URI; no virus was isolated and there was no
seroconversion to the vaccine virus administered. The
other volunteer had a transient drop in PC2o to
5 mgml-1 on day 3 postinoculation which returned to
baseline on day 7 but he was not ill or infected.
Among the placebo recipients with baseline PC2o levels
of < 10 mg ml- 1, 4 of 7 were < 5rag ml- 1. Among the
CR vaccine recipients with baseline PC2o levels of
< 10mgml -~, 6 of 12 were <5mgml -~. Two of the CR
vaccine recipients with baseline PC2o values < 5mg ml-1
reacted to histamine at a dilution concentration one lower
than baseline on day 7 postvaccination, compared with
0 of 4 placebo recipients (p=0.47, Fisher's two-tailed
exact test).
A significant decrease in FEV~ and FVC was noted
on day 4 and/or 7 in 9% (percentage drop in FEV 1 was
13%) and 9% (percentage drop in FVC was 12.5%) of
CR bivalent vaccine recipients, respectively. This was not,
statistically, significantly different from the placebo
recipients who had a similar reduction in FEV1 or FVC,
33% (percent drop in FEV~ ranged from 13.9% to
18.7%) and 17% (percent drop in FVC was 12.9%),
respectively. Bronchoprovocation tests and body plethysmography were not performed in these subjects.
Discussion
This is the first report of sequential pulmonary function
testing in asthmatic adults following bivalent CR
influenza A virus vaccine administration and in normal
healthy adults following monovalent CR influenza A/
H1N1 and CR influenza B virus vaccine administration.
In our normal Volunteers who received monovalent CR
influenza virus A or B vaccines, there were no significant
changes in mean FEV1, FVC, FEV1/FVC, or FEFzs_vs.
Similarly, in the subjects with asthma who received a
bivalent CR influenza A virus vaccine, no significant
changes were found in mean FEV x, FVC, FEV1/FVC,
or FEF25_75.
In a group of normal volunteers with more complete
pulmonary function testing, there were no significant
changes in RAW or DLco in the first week following
vaccination with CR influenza A virus vaccines. There
was also no change in RAW in recipients of influenza B
virus vaccine over the same time interval. Though there
was a transient increase in RAW in the recipients of the
CR influenza A/H3N2 on days 3-4 postvaccination, this
finding may have been the result of multiple comparisons;
when the alpha was corrected for multiple comparisons,
p was greater than 0.10.
None of the 23 infected (seroconversion and/or virus
shedding) volunteers had a significant change in histamineinduced bronchial reactivity following vaccination with

monovalent CR A or B influenza virus vaccine. Two of
the 15 uninfected volunteers had a significant increase in
their airway reactivity following vaccination. Both were
initially seropositive. None of the eight subjects who
demonstrated both baseline bronchial hyperresponsiveness and evidence of infection had a significant change
in their postvaccination airway reactivity.
Vaccine-associated respiratory symptoms and signs
were found in approximately one-third of our normal
volunteers during the first week of study, a number close
222 Vaccine, Vol. 8, June 1990 
to that (16/47) reported by Belshe and Van Voris 41 in
a dose-response study in seronegative children. Other
reports 42~4 have noted URIs in <10% of vaccine
recipients. The illnesses in this study were mild and
short-lived. The illnesses seen in the placebo recipients
were typical of viral URIs present in the community at
the time of the study and occurred significantly later than
those seen after vaccine. No significant differences in
illness frequency between bivalent CR and placebo
asthmatic adults were noted.
Onehealthy adult female volunteer developed subacute
thyroiditis in the first week following vaccination with
A/Bethesda/1/85 (CR90). Although influenza virus was
not isolated before or on three separate days during the
first week after vaccination, a significant NtAb titre rise
was demonstrated to the vaccine strain administered. No
other viruses were isolated and no antibody titre rises to
several viruses were noted. Other published reports have
stated that 'viral URI' precedes up to one-third of the
cases of subacute thyroiditis, and subacute thyroiditis
has been associated with naturally occurring influenza A
infection in two studies ¢~7. In one published study,
cases of subacute thyroiditis were associated with an
increased frequency of HLA-Bw354a. Our volunteer's
HLA phenotype did not show a pattern consistent with
an increased risk of subacute thyroiditis. However, a
causal relationship between influenza virus vaccination
and the occurrence of subacute thyroiditis in our
volunteer cannot be excluded.
Many previously published reports have examined the
effects of natural influenzal infection or influenza
vaccination on pulmonary function (Table 4). Pulmonary
function testing changes have been commonly noted after
natural infection, but the changes have not been
consistent from study to study x3-19. Some studies 13'14
have noted changes in simple spirometry measurements
(FEV1, FVC, FEF25_vs) not noted in other studies 15-19.
Changes in airway resistance, specific conductance or
bronchial reactivity were present more consistently16-19.
Inactivated influenza vaccine, which is currently
recommended for prophylaxis, has also been associated
with some changes in pulmonary function testing in
asthma patients, though these findings are not consistently
present 24'33''.9-s6. The authors found no significant
changes in FEV1, FVC or FEF25_75 in 16 volunteers
with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
during the first week following standard vaccination with
commercially prepared-trivalent influenza virus vaccine
(Atmar and Greenberg, data not shown).
Live attenuated vaccine viruses seem not only to be
attenuated in terms of the clinical symptoms they cause
but in their effects on pulmonary function. Though many
of the trials have not been placebo-controlled or
double-blind, changes in pulmonary function have been
uncommon 2°-33. When changes have been noted, they
have not been felt to be clinically significant 21-25. These
findings are in agreement with those of our study.
In summary, no clinically significant changes in
pulmonary function were found in any of the groups
which received live attenuated monovalent or bivalent
CR influenza virus vaccines. In healthy normal volunteers
and in those with mild bronchial hyperreactivity, there
were no statistically significant changes in routine
spirometry, DLco, RAW or histamine bronchoprovocation
after monovalent CR vaccine administration. In volunteers with asthma, there were no statistically significant
Live influenza vaccines and pulmonary function: R.L. Atmar et al.
changes in routine spirometry after bivalent CR vaccine
administration. Although live attenuated influenza virus
vaccines were associated with mild upper respiratory
tract illnesses in approximately a third of recipients, no
lower respiratory tract illness or clinical worsening of
pulmonary function was seen in any volunteer. Thus,
using this and previously reported studies, CR influenza
virus vaccines do not appear to impair pulmonary
function during the first week following immunization in
healthy and asthmatic adults.
