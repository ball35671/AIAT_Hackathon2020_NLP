Background: A(H1N1)v2009 influenza vaccination of pregnant women was a challenge for health care
providers, as little safety data were available.
Methods: We prospectively followed the pregnancies of women who were vaccinated at any time during
pregnancy or ≤4 weeks prior to conception and compared these outcomes to a control cohort matched by
the estimated date of birth. Primary endpoints: rate of spontaneous abortion and major malformations.
Secondary endpoints: preeclampsia, gestational age at birth, and birth weight.
Results: Pregnancy outcome of 323 women immunized with adjuvanted or non-adjuvanted
A(H1N1)v2009 influenza vaccines from 2009-09-28 to 2010-03-31 were compared to 1329 control subjects. The risk for spontaneous abortions (HR 0.89; 95% CI 0.36–2.19) and the rate of major malformations
(all trimesters: OR 0.87; 95% CI 0.38–1.77; preconception and first trimester exposure: OR 0.79; 95% CI
0.13–2.64) did not vary between the two cohorts. Furthermore, there was no increase in preeclampsia,
prematurity, and intrauterine growth retardation in the vaccinated cohort.
Conclusion: The results of our study do not indicate a risk for the pregnant woman and the developing
embryo/fetus after H1N1 vaccination. We provide and apply methods novel in observational studies on
pregnancy outcome, especially if a single dose exposure is investigated.

1. Introduction
Pregnancy increases the risk of influenza-associated complications. This is true for both seasonal and pandemic influenza [1–3]
including the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. A recent review of 120 publications confirms a higher rate of hospitalization and intensive
care in pregnant compared to non-pregnant women of reproductive age or to the overall population [4]. Presumably, the higher
risk, observed mainly during the second and third trimester of
pregnancy, derives from various physiological and immunological
changes. Case reports describe stillbirths and other severe pregnancy complications due to H1N1 influenza [5–7].

The German Standing Vaccination Committee (STIKO) adopted
the WHO’s recommendation in October 2009, opting for the first
time for influenza vaccination in healthy pregnant women [8],
preferably with a non-adjuvanted split-virion vaccine during the
second or third trimester.
The A(H1N1)v2009 influenza vaccination campaign began in
Germany in the last week of October 2009. There are few studies investigating the safety of seasonal influenza vaccines in early
pregnancy. In particular, a shift of the Th2-dominated immunology
in pregnant women towards Th1, possibly resulting in placentation
disorders and spontaneous abortion, was discussed for adjuvanted
vaccines [9,10].
The expertise of the Institute for Clinical Teratology and Drug
Risk Assessment in Pregnancy (in the following referred to as
the Institute), together with its cooperating partner institutions
allowed the design and conduct of an appropriate observational
study. The primary goal was to estimate the risk for spontaneous
abortions and major birth defects. Preeclampsia, gestational age at
birth, and birth weight were evaluated as secondary endpoints.

2. Methods
2.1. Study protocol
Thisprospective observational cohort studyusedparallel groups
of exposed and non-exposed pregnant women. Design and analysis were performed according to the STROBE statement adapted
to the needs of pregnancy outcome studies [11,12]. Subjects
were enrolled through the Institute’s consultation service on drug
exposure during pregnancy, offered free of charge to pregnant
women and health care providers. During the pandemic season, the initiative to study the safety of vaccines along with the
Institute’s offer of information was advertised by federal health
authorities, obstetric and other professional societies. Data collection was performed using three structured questionnaires at
(i) first contact, (ii) six weeks after first contact, and (iii) eight
weeks after the estimated date of birth (EDOB) for exposed and
controls. The project (No. 322/09) was approved by the Ethics
Committee ofthe Johann-Wolfgang-Goethe-Universität, Frankfurt,
Germany.
2.2. Documentation
A detailed history of drug use is recorded at the first contact. The interview also includes demographic characteristics,
previous and current obstetrical history, family history, maternal chronic diseases, and other risks or exposures. Follow-up is
especially focused on congenital anomalies and postnatal disorders. For this purpose, the hospital discharge summaries are also
requested. Congenital malformations were independently classified into major and minor by two experts according to established
standards [13–15].
2.3. Inclusion and exclusion criteria
The study cohort consists of women vaccinated during pregnancy or within four weeks prior to conception covering the
period from 2009-09-28 to 2010-03-31. Unknown outcome of
pregnancy and absence of prenatal pathologic findings at the time
of consultation were mandatory for inclusion as a prospective
case. Vaccination was allowed to have taken place before study
entry. The control cohort consists of pregnant women who were
not vaccinated against A(H1N1)v2009 influenza. Exclusion criteria
for controls were (i) exposure to teratogenic or fetotoxic substances (i.e. acitretin, carbamazepine, isotretinoine, lenalidomide,
methotrexate, mycophenolate, phenobarbital, phenprocoumon,
phenytoin, thalidomide, valproate, warfarin, AT1-antagonists, or
ACE inhibitors), (ii) exposure to oseltamivir and/or zanamivir,
and (iii) treatment of H1N1 influenza, malignant or unspecified tumors, malignancy related conditions, convulsions without
eclampsia, febrile convulsions, and hypoglycemic convulsion
(MedDRA terms). A random sample of all available controls with
an EDOB in the range of the study cohort was selected aiming for a
4/1 ratio (controls/vaccinated).
2.4. Vaccines
Pandemrix® (GlaxoSmithKline) is an AS03-adjuvanted monovalent split-virion influenza vaccine almost exclusively used to
vaccinate against pandemic influenza A(H1N1)v2009 in Germany.
A non-adjuvanted split-virion vaccine CSL H1N1 Pandemic
InfluenzaVaccine® (CSL Biotherapies) was approved by the responsible national authority, the Paul-Ehrlich-Institut, in November
2009 exclusively for vaccination of pregnant women. Between the
beginning of the vaccination campaign and first availability of the
non-adjuvanted vaccine, pregnant women at higher risk due to
predisposing chronic diseases were vaccinated with adjuvanted
vaccines. This approach was supported by the STIKO.
To a limited extent Celvapan® (Baxter), a monovalent wholevirion H1N1 influenza vaccine, was also available in Germany.
In neighboring countries, additional pandemic vaccines such as
Focetria® (Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics) were licensed. Pregnant women who reside in Germany and received vaccination in
another state were not excluded from the study.
2.5. Statistics
The effect of vaccination on the risk of spontaneous abortion
and induced abortion was assessed using Cox proportional hazards models considering vaccination as a time-dependent covariate
[16]. As women usually enter the cohort several weeks after conception, delayed entry into the study was taken into account [17].
These analyses were performed considering spontaneous abortion,
induced abortion, and live birth as competing events. To assess the
effect of vaccination on the risk of major malformations, a logistic
regression was performed. Live births and pregnancy losses with
pathology were used as study population. Calculating crude malformation rates,the total number affected is divided by the number
of all liveborns plus the number of pregnancy losses with malformations. Genetic syndromes were excluded. The propensity score
[18] was estimated using boosted regression trees [19,20] including body mass index, age, alcohol consumption, smoking habits,
drug consumption, number of previous pregnancies, number of
previous fetal losses, number of previous children with malformation, other diseases, and family medical history as covariates.
The logit of the propensity score was included as a covariate in
the logistic regression. The propensity score method was used
as a device for bias reduction in place of traditional regression
adjustment; the rationale being that the vaccination is more common in the study, hence easier to model than the pregnancy
outcome.
Comparison of gestational age at birth between groups was performedusing aCoxproportionalhazardsmodel,taking into account
delayed entry and including vaccination as a time-dependent
covariate. The same covariates as for propensity score estimation
above were included in the model.
The effect of vaccination on the risk of preeclampsia was
addressed through logistic regression. All pregnancies were considered, hence a new propensity score logit using the covariates
detailed above was included in the model.
To compare birth weights, liveborns were classified according to the birth weight/gestational age percentile table derived
from the German Perinatal Study [21]. A score was then
derived through standardization and included in a linear model
as the dependent variable. Included covariates in the model
were vaccination and gestational week at birth. Additionally,
propensity score stratification including the same covariates
as described above was used. Pregnant women were classified into five strata defined by the quintiles of their propensity
scores.
For all models including covariates, missing values were
addressed using multivariate imputation by chained equation
assuming that the data were missing at random [22]. We generated
50 imputed data sets per outcome. The multiple imputation models
included the respective outcomes – for live births,the Nelson-Aalen
estimates of the cumulative live birth hazard and event indicator
[23] – and the covariates used to construct the propensity scores.
For each imputed data set, the propensity score was estimated and
used in the fitted models as described above. Results were then
combined using Rubin’s rule [24].All analyses were performed with
R version 2.13 (R Development Core Team).

3. Results
3.1. Cohort size and characteristics
Between 2009-04-01 and 2010-07-31 (covering the entire
period between the first reports of A(H1N1)v2009 worldwide and
the last request regarding A(H1N1)v2009 vaccination received
by the Institute) the Institute performed 16,738 consultations on
reproductive safety of medicinal products and other noxa. These
included 715 consultations on the A(H1N1)v2009 influenza vaccine, of which 409 pregnancies with confirmed A(H1N1)v2009
vaccination were prospectively documented. Follow-up was completed in 323/346 cases (Fig. 1). Inclusion criteria for controls were
met by 5575 cases with initiated follow-up. Of these, 3355 with
EDOBs corresponding to the vaccinated cohort (from 2009-12-08
to 2010-09-22, i.e. earliest and latest EDOB) were considered for
study. Out of these, 1618 cases were randomly chosen according
to a ratio of 4.7/1 (controls/vaccinated). 1329 cases could be completed (Fig. 1).
Maternal characteristics are comparable between the cohorts,
except for gestational age at study entry, smoking habits, number
of previous elective terminations of pregnancy (ETOPs), and educational status (Table 1). As we still had baseline information for the
women lost to follow-up, we could compare them to those who
completed the study. This comparison did not suggest a selection
bias (data not shown).
3.2. Vaccines used and time of vaccination
Mostly, non-adjuvanted split-virion vaccine was used
(216/323), primarily during the second and third trimester.
AS03-adjuvanted vaccine was applied in 90 cases, predominantly
prior to conception and during the first trimester. Due to the lack
of alternative vaccines until late November 2009, we registered
mainly adjuvanted vaccine exposure in the early study period. Two
pregnant women were vaccinated with MF59-adjuvanted subunit
vaccine. For 15 patients, the vaccine type could not be ascertained
(Supplementary Table 1).
Open-ended questions revealed systemic adverse reactions
for 35/216 (16.2%) after immunization with the non-adjuvanted
split-virion vaccine and for 23/90 (25.6%) after vaccination with
AS03-adjuvanted vaccine. These include, but are not limited to (i)
abnormal fatigue, (ii) headache, (iii) fever >38 ◦C, (iv) nausea, and
(v) dizziness. In 84/216 (38.9%) and in 64/90 (71.1%) cases after vaccination with the non-adjuvanted and AS03-adjuvanted vaccine,
respectively, typical local reactions were documented.
3.3. Pregnancy outcome and neonatal characteristics
The outcomes of the pregnancies are summarized in Table 2.
The rate of live births of the vaccinated cohort is higher than in the
control cohort(97.2%vs. 87.9%) due to fewer spontaneous abortions
and ETOPs. But these crude rates must not be used as estimates of
true outcome rates, as they are suspected of being biased.
Fig. 2 illustrates pregnancy course, outcome, and time of vaccination. Two extremely pre-term births and two late abortions (23rd
and 24th gestational week) occurred in the control cohort. Furthermore,two late ETOPs (22nd gestational week each) wereperformed
among controls because of malformations of the urinary tract and
severe preeclampsia.
There were no notable differences between newborns of the
vaccinated and the control cohort(Table 2). After adjustment,there

was neither a significant difference in gestational age of liveborns
(HR 1.03; 95% CI 0.91–1.17) nor a significant birth weight difference
(p value 0.82) between the two cohorts.
In the control cohort, two live births before the 26th gestational week were reported. One child weighing 610 g was born after
maternal flu-like infection at 22 + 4 weeks and died two hours postpartum. The other child was delivered by Cesarean section at 24 + 3
weeks after an unspecified maternal infection, weighing 810 g.
3.4. Malformations
Malformations were present in 30 cases of the vaccinated and
in 138 of the control cohort (Table 3). Adjusted OR for all malformations was 0.92 (95% CI 0.58–1.46) and for major malformations
1.11 (95% CI 0.51–1.46). Similarly, there was no significant effect
after evaluation of crude ORs. If only vaccinations during the first
trimester and prior to conception were considered, crude OR was
0.99 (95% CI 0.43–2.00) for all and 0.79 (95% CI 0.13–2.64) for major
malformations. In 2/18 cases after vaccination prior to conception
and in 6/52 cases after first trimester vaccination, malformations
were observed. Ofthese,there were two major malformations after
AS03-adjuvanted vaccination: anencephaly resulting in ETOP (vaccination at gestational week 1 + 2) and club feet (vaccination at
gestational week 3 + 6) (Supplementary Table 2).
3.5. Spontaneous abortions
Spontaneous abortions were observed in 5/323 (Tables 2 and 4)
cases of the vaccinated and in 105/1329 cases of the controls
(Table 2). Adjusting to vaccination time and study entry, this

accounts for a small but not significant lower risk among the vaccinated (HR 0.89; 95% CI 0.36–2.19).
3.6. Preeclampsia
In ten of 314 live births after vaccination, pregnancy was complicated by preeclampsia (3.18%; Supplementary Table 3). In most
cases of preeclampsia, vaccination took place at the end of the
second/beginning of the third trimester. Among controls, 53/1169
pregnancies with live birth (4.53%) plus one resulting in late ETOP
were complicated by preeclampsia (crude OR 0.69; 95% CI 0.31–1.4;
ORadj 1.15; 95% CI 0.54–2.46).
3.7. Retrospectively reported cases
Twelve cases with A(H1N1)v2009 vaccination were retrospectively reported to our Institute, i.e. after the end of the pregnancy

(Supplementary Table 4). There were three fetal losses: one
spontaneous abortion, one ETOP because of Turner syndrome, and
one stillbirth. The other pregnancies ended in live births. Two of
these infants had malformations but vaccination occurred beyond
the first trimester: (i) agenesis of the chest muscle after vaccination at 29 gestational weeks and (ii) pulmonary valve stenosis after
vaccination at 38 + 2 gestational weeks. One preterm birth of twins
at 29 + 4 gestational weeks was reported, both twins showed typical prematurity-related problems. The other pregnancy outcomes
were uneventful.
4. Discussion
4.1. Pregnancy outcomes
Our study did not detect specific risks of H1N1 immunization
during pregnancy and is thus inline withearlier observations. However, we present one ofthe first studies on A(H1N1)v2009 influenza
vaccination in pregnancy based on data collected in parallel for
exposed and controls applying identical standards. Lin et al. did not
find a higher adverse event rate in 198 pregnant women vaccinated
M. Oppermann et al. / Vaccine 30 (2012) 4445–4452 4451
with non-adjuvanted vaccine compared to 198 age-matched pregnant women [25]. Other studies used background rates from the
general population. For example, Omon et al. published the results
of a French descriptive study: 569 pregnant women, vaccinated
with the non-adjuvanted split-virion vaccine Panenza® (SanofiPasteur), showed no statistical differences compared to the general
population in the risks of malformation, maternal, and neonatal
conditions [26]. Similarly, Tavares et al. did not observe adverse
pregnancy outcomes among 265 pregnant women vaccinated with
AS03-adjuvanted vaccine [27].
As expected, systemic and local reactions were more often
reported after the use of AS03-adjuvanted vaccine than of nonadjuvanted vaccine, and were comparable to the known adverse
reactions after influenza vaccination. No severe events occurred in
our cohort.
The relatively small number of vaccinated women might not
permit to definitely discard a risk associated with vaccination, or to
study specific birth defects. However, we achieved highly reliable
exposure and outcome data by active prospective data collection
and standardized documentation. Furthermore, analysis of cases
lost to follow-up did not suggest a significant selection bias. An
elaborated methodology was provided to deal with the main challenges of epidemiologic studies for vaccination in pregnancy, these
being left truncation by delayed study entry, competing risks of
pregnancy outcomes, and punctual exposure at individual times.
In our study, vaccination is the time-dependent risk factor taking
place at virtually every time during pregnancy. In contrast, for studies on long-term prenatal drug treatment, exposure is handled as
a fixed covariate. Regarding the study entry, a broader range than
usual was observed, probably due to the updated recommendation
for vaccination of pregnant women. Delayed study entry – here
ranging from gestational week five to week 30 and beyond – has
to be taken into account in order to avoid biased results [17]. Both
aspects, delayed entry and varying exposure times, have to be considered for all analyses with time of an event as the dependent
variable, e.g. abortion, ETOP, and time of birth.
4.2. Primary endpoints
For both primary endpoints, spontaneous abortions and major
malformations, no increased risk associated with vaccination could
be determined. However, since immunization dates were distributed almost uniformly over the entire period of pregnancy
(Fig. 2B), only a limited number occurred in the first trimester, the
critical time period for both endpoints. Therefore, special efforts
had to be made to adjust for confounders. For spontaneous abortions and ETOPs, adjustments were impossible due to the low
number of events caused by delayed study entry and the high
proportion of vaccination in late pregnancy. For the analysis of malformations, we applied the counterfactual approach, correcting for
differences in confounders between the cohorts by the summarizing propensity score. Due to the low number of malformations, a
direct regression model would lead to numerically instable estimations. For successful bias correction it is crucial that all relevant
information on confounders is available. We applied imputation
methods for potentially missing values of covariates. In future studies, more efforts should be made to reduce missing values for the
socio-economic status to facilitate imputation and adjustment.
4.3. Secondary endpoints
For gestational age at birth and birth weight, the study has
higher power for detection of effects associated with vaccination
due to the higher effective sample size in both cohorts. However,
we observed no indications for prematurity or intrauterine growth
retardation after vaccination. The model for gestational age at birth
and the comparison of adjusted birth weight revealed no effects for
the newborn.
The risk for preeclampsia was comparable in both cohorts and
within the expected range. In most cases of preeclampsia, vaccination took place at the end of the second/beginning of the third
trimester and thus beyond the time when placentation disorders,
a major cause of preeclampsia [28], could have been induced.
4.4. Retrospectively reported cases
Our prospectively derived results are supported by the retrospectively reported cases that do not contain any evidence of a
specific risk or teratogenic effect. Furthermore, the small number
of reported adverse reactions in pregnancy provides further reassurance, since the pandemic situation caused increased alertness
among patients and physicians due to the critical discussion of the
new vaccines in Germany. Our Institute is the national facility for
pharmacovigilance in pregnancy and receives drug reports for evaluation from the Paul-Ehrlich-Institut, the Drug Commission of the
German Medical Association, and health care professionals. If there
was a real risk, a much higher number of reports would have been
expected.
5. Conclusion
There is no indication yet for any unwanted effect of H1N1-
vaccination to the pregnant woman or the unborn. However, lack
of evidence of increased risk must not be interpreted as evidence of
no risk. Larger studies are needed to confirm the anticipated safety
of immunization during pregnancy.
