Abstract
Background: In 2009, pregnant women were specifically targeted by a national vaccination campaign against pandemic A/
H1N1 influenza virus. The objectives of the COFLUPREG study, initially set up to assess the incidence of serious forms of A/
H1N1 influenza, were to assess the consequences of maternal vaccination on pregnancy outcomes and maternal
seroprotection at delivery.
Methods: Pregnant women, between 12 and 35 weeks of gestation, non vaccinated against A/H1N1 2009 influenza were
randomly selected to be included in a prospective cohort study conducted in three maternity centers in Paris (France)
during pandemic period. Blood samples were planned to assess hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody against A/H1N1
2009 influenza at inclusion and at delivery.
Results: Among the 877 pregnant women included in the study, 678 (77.3%) had serum samples both at inclusion and delivery,
and 320 (36.5%) received pandemic A/H1N1 2009 influenza vaccine with a median interval between vaccination and delivery of
92 days (95% CI 48–134). At delivery, the proportion of women with seroprotection (HI antibodies titers against A/H1N1
2009 influenza of 1:40 or greater) was 69.9% in vaccinated women. Of the 422 non-vaccinated women with serological data,
11 (2.6%; 95%CI: 1.3–4.6) had laboratory documented A/H1N1 2009 influenza (1 with positive PCR and 10 with serological
seroconversion). None of the 877 study’s women was hospitalized for flu. No difference on pregnancy outcomes was
evidenced between vaccinated women, non-vaccinated women without seroconversion and non-vaccinated women with
flu.
Conclusion: Despite low vaccine coverage, incidence of pandemic flu was low in this cohort of pregnant women.No effect
on pregnancy and delivery outcomes was evidenced after vaccination.

Introduction
There is strong evidence that pregnant women and infants are
at increased risk of severe illness following infection with influenza
virus [1]. Hospitalization for respiratory illness related to seasonal
influenza is more frequent in pregnant than in non pregnant
women [2,3], and the risk of death in pregnant women increased
during influenza pandemics compared to non-pandemic years [4].
The emergence of A/H1N1 influenza infection in Mexico and
in Australia in early 2009 raised further awareness and concern
worldwide. In June 2009, World Health Organization raised the
pandemic alert level to the highest level of 6 [5]. In August 2009,
researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
reported that 6/45 (13%) patients who died from 2009 A/H1N1
influenza between mid-April and mid-June were pregnant women
[6]. The disproportionately increased risk of mortality due to A/
H1N1 2009 influenza infection in pregnant women was confirmed
by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention survey [6].
Pregnant women have been therefore designated as a top priority
group to receive the pandemic A/H1N1 2009 influenza vaccine
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 December 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 12 | e52303
[7–11]. In France, the vaccination campaign was launched in
November 2009; a single dose of a non-adjuvanted A/H1N1 2009
influenza vaccine was recommended for all pregnant women after
the first trimester [11].
Most of available data are issued from retrospective studies and
prospective cohort studies are still lacking to better understand
how A/H1N1 2009 influenza pandemic affects pregnant women.
Furthermore, whereas some studies have shown safety, immunogenicity and effectiveness of seasonal flu vaccination in pregnant
women [4,12,13], additional data are still needed to assess the
safety and efficacy of maternal vaccination during pandemic
period.
In the context of the A/H1N1 2009 influenza pandemic, we
planned a prospective study conducted in the general population
of pregnant women to assess the incidence, the maternal-fetal
impact of 2009 influenza pandemic, and the effectiveness and the
safety of maternal vaccination. When it appeared that the
pandemic level expected by public health services would be not
achieved, the objectives of the study were redefined to assess: 1) the
incidence of laboratory-documented influenza 2009 pandemic, 2)
the effects of pandemic vaccination on pregnancy outcome and 3)
the proportion of women with seroprotection against influenza
2009 A/H1N1 at delivery, both in vaccinated and in nonvaccinated women.
Patients and Methods
Pandemic A/H1N1 2009 Influenza and Vaccination in
France
In France, a first wave of A/H1N1 2009 influenza infection was
reported in July 2009. Detection of pandemic A/H1N1 2009
influenza viruses remained then sporadic until week 42 (October
12–18). In the second wave, influenza like illness (ILI) incidence
peaked in week 49 (November 29-December 4) and fell below the
epidemic threshold in the last week of the year [14]. Pandemic A/
H1N1 2009 influenza vaccine was administered, free of charge, in
centers dedicated to pandemic vaccination. A single dose of a nonadjuvanted A/H1N1 2009 influenza vaccine (PanenzaH) was
recommended for all pregnant women after the first trimester of
pregnancy. On November 20, 2009, PanenzaH was available and
women in the second or third trimester of pregnancy asked to get
vaccinated by receiving a letter from the National health
insurance.
Study Design
The COFLUPREG (COhort on FLU during PREGnancy)
study was a prospective cohort study conducted on pregnant
women in three tertiary maternity centers in Paris (France) during
the pandemic A/H1N1 2009 influenza. Women were included
from October 12, 2009 to February 3, 2010.
Pregnant women between 12 and 35 weeks of gestation were
eligible to the study if they were aged $18 years and were
speaking and understanding French. Main exclusion criteria were
laboratory documented A/H1N1 2009 influenza during the last 6
months and vaccination against A/H1N1 2009 influenza before
inclusion.
Pregnant women were randomly selected in order to obtain a
representative sample of pregnant women followed in these
maternity hospitals. The draw was made on the list of women to
visit the following week in each of the maternity hospitals. The
randomization numbers were established using tables of order for
permutation and this procedure was stratified according to center.
The sampling fraction was 1 in 4 and could theoretically include
until 25 women a day for consultation across all three centers. The
randomization plan and generated list were only known to study
personnel not involved in clinical procedures. The selected women
were contacted by phone one week before the scheduled date of
the consultation to inform them of the study. If they were
interested in participating, documents and written information
were sent. The day of consultation, the women signed the
informed consent and the data for inclusion were then filled using
a specific case report form.
At inclusion in the study, the following data were collected:
socio-demographic characteristics (mother age, geographic origin,
lifestyle (single or couple), socio-professional category), medical
factors (co-morbidity associated with a high-risk of occurrence of
severe form of flu, flu symptoms since the beginning of pregnancy,
seasonal flu vaccination in the previous 5 years, smoking),
obstetrical characteristics (gestational age, gestity, parity, twin
pregnancy, significant obstetrical history, current pregnancy
complication) and factors associated with a higher risk of viral
exposure and disease-spreading (number of children under 18
years of age at home, work in contact with children, healthcare
workers and professional with contact with the public). Comorbidity associated with a risk of occurrence of severe flu was
defined by the presence of at least one of the following diseases:
chronic lung disease (including asthma), severe cardiopathy, severe
chronic nephropathy, severe neuropathy, severe myopathy, sicklecell disease, diabetes mellitus, immunodeficiency, morbid obesity
and alcoholism with chronic hepatopathy. Significant obstetrical
history was defined as having at least one of the following events:
late miscarriage (between 14th and 21th +6 days weeks of
gestation), preterm delivery (between 22th and 36th +6 days weeks
of gestation), and history of pre-eclampsia/gestational hypertension, intrauterine growth restriction, fetal malformation or fetal
death. Current pregnancy complication was defined as having at
least one of the following complications: placenta prævia,
pyelonephritis, pre-eclampsia/gestational hypertension, gestational diabetes mellitus, suspicion of intrauterine growth restriction,
fetal malformation, preterm labor and premature rupture of
membranes (PROM).
All the included women were followed by doctors or midwifes
with monthly visits until delivery. During each visit, information
on the occurrence of fever or respiratory symptoms or documented A/H1N1 influenza infection and vaccination against A/H1N1
2009 influenza (participant verbal report) was prospectively
collected in the case report form by a clinical research assistant
dedicated to the study.
After inclusion in the study, women having fever, respiratory
symptoms, or a contact with documented case of A/H1N1
influenza infection were asked to consult at the maternity as soon
as possible. Women having an ILI defined as an oral temperature
of more than 37.8uC with at least one influenza-like symptom
(cough, sore throat, rhinorrhea, nasal obstruction) were asked to
provide specimens of nasal and throat swabs for virology testing
and blood sample for assessment of HI antibodies against A/
H1N1 2009 influenza.
At delivery, maternal and perinatal outcome data were
collected: maternal outcomes were onset of labor, mode of
delivery, occurrence of fever during labor, and post partumhaemorrhage. Perinatal outcomes were fetal and neonatal death,
gestational age at delivery, birth weight, Apgar score at 5 min, and
transfer to neonatal intensive care unit.
Blood samples were planned for assessment of HI antibodies
against A/H1N1 2009 influenza at inclusion and at delivery, and
in case of ILI.
Written informed consent was obtained from each woman
before enrolment. The protocol was conducted in accordance with
Pandemic Influenza 2009 Vaccine and Pregnancy
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 December 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 12 | e52303
the Declaration of Helsinki and French law for biomedical
research and was approved by the ‘‘Ile-de-France 3’’ Ethics
Committee (Paris, France). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01192737.
Laboratory Methods
Hemagglutination inhibition antibodies against A/H1N1
2009 influenza. Immunological assays were performed in a
centralized laboratory (Virology Laboratory, Cochin Hospital,
Paris, France) in a blind way. The titer of antibodies against the
vaccine strain was measured in all samples by hemagglutinationinhibition (HI) assay as described by the WHO Collaborating
Centre for Influenza, Centres for Diseases Control, Atlanta, USA
[15]. Serum samples were treated by enzymatic treatment to
destroy nonspecific inhibitors. Sera were then tested in serial twofold dilutions starting at 1:10, all sera from a single patient being
tested on the same plate. Hemagglutination was performed in a
microtiter plate using human O rhesus negative erythrocytes and 4
units of A/California/7/2009 (H1N1v) vaccine as antigen
(PanenzaH). The sample titer was the highest dilution that
completely inhibited hemagglutination. Negative samples were
assigned a titer of 1:5. The geometric mean HI antibody titers at
each time point were used for the analyses.
Seroprotection rate was defined as the percentage of women
with a HI titer of 1:40 or greater, seroconversion rate as the
percentage of women with a HI titer ,1:10 at inclusion and a titer
of 1:40 or greater at delivery, or showing a significant increase in
antibody titer defined as a titer of 1:10 or greater at inclusion and
at least a fourfold increase in titer between inclusion and delivery
[16–18].
Molecular detection of H1N1pdm09 pandemic influenza a
virus. Nasopharyngeal secretions were collected by endonasal
swabbing using flocked nylon swabs. H1N1pdm09 infection was
diagnosedby real-time reverse transcription–PCR (RT-PCR) assay on
a 7500 Real Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA)
according to the protocol designed by the National Influenza Center
Northern-France (Institut Pasteur, Paris, France) (http://www.sante.
gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/Protocoles_CNR_03122009.pdf). PCRs were
done locally.
Statistical Analysis
A sample size of 2000 patients was initially planned to evaluate
the incidence and the characteristics of A/H1N1 2009 influenza
infection in the population of pregnant women. Indeed, with the
initial hypotheses of an attack rate of A/H1N1 influenza up to
40% [19] in the absence of intervention, the inclusion of 2000
pregnant women in the cohort could allow the evaluation of about
800 cases of influenza infection. With an estimated frequency of
severe forms requiring hospitalization of about 30%, about 130 of
the 2000 women would have developed severe influenza [6], a
number of cases enough to evaluate the incidence and the
characteristics of A/H1N1 2009 influenza infection in pregnant
women. When it appeared for epidemiological reasons (both lower
attack rate and frequency of severe forms) that the objectives of the
study could not be achieved, the H1N1 independent advisory
board of the ‘‘Institut de Microbiologie et des Maladies
Infectieuses’’ (IMMI) decided to stop inclusion in February 2010
after 919 inclusions. The modified endpoints were: effects of
pandemic vaccination on pregnancy outcomes (gestational age at
delivery, mode of delivery, mean birth weight, Apgar score,
neonatal outcome) and the standard HI endpoints (seroprotection
rate, geometric mean titers, seroconversion ratewith 95% confidence intervals [CI]) for immunogenicity at delivery, both for
vaccinated and not vaccinated pregnant women.
Chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test (in cases of low number of
data) were used for comparisons of qualitative variables. KruskalWallis test was used for comparison of quantitative variables. A pvalue ,0.05 was considered significant.
For proportions, exact binomial 95% CI were calculated. For
geometric mean titers, 95% CI were computed by taking the
exponent (log10) of the lower and upper limits of the 95% CI of the
log10-transformed titers.
Results
Study Patients
A total of 4171 women were screened, among whom 427
refused to participate, 668 were ineligible, and 2157 were not
included.Women were included from October 12, 2009 to
February 3, 2010; first delivery occurred in November 2009 and
last delivery in August 2010. Among the 919 pregnant women
included, 4 withdrew their consent and 1 had exclusion criteria; 37
women (4%) were excluded of analysis due to loss of follow up (i.e.
women who gave birth in another hospital and with less than 3
follow-up visits) (Figure 1). No difference in maternal baseline
characteristics was evidenced between the 877 pregnant women
included in the study and the 37 pregnant women excluded of the
analysis.
The demographic profiles and the clinical characteristics of the
877 women of the cohort are described in Table 1. Among them,
507 (57.8%) were included with gestational age between 12 and 22
weeks, 203 (23.1%) between 22 and 28 weeks, and 167 (19.0%)
between 28 and 35 weeks. Blood sample was available at baseline
for 825 (94.1%) of those 877 women; 43 (5.2%) had HI antibodies
against 2009 A/H1N1 influenza with titers of 1:40 or greater.
Follow up
Between inclusion and delivery, only three women benefited of
an additional visit for ILI: one of them at 19 weeks of gestation had
positive 2009 A/H1N1 influenza PCR, one was PCR-negative,
and no PCR was done for the third one. The woman with

confirmed A/H1N1 influenza received oseltamivir and delivery
occurred at term without complication for mother and infant. The
two other women did not receive oseltamivir and delivered at term
without complication for mother and infant.
A total of 55 women reported ILI, among whom only 3
benefited of an additional visit at the maternity, and 72 women
reported contact with a H1N1 case, among whom 24 had a nasal
swab with negative result.
A total of 39 women (including the woman previously
mentioned with positive PCR) (4.5%) received oseltamivir without
additional visit or PCR (20 for ILI, and 19 for preventive reasons),
including 25 (64.1%) women who were not vaccinated against A/
H1N1 2009 influenza.
None of the 877 women was hospitalized for influenza.
Three hundred and twenty (36.5%) women were vaccinated
against pandemic A/H1N1 2009 influenza between inclusion and
delivery. Median gestational age at vaccination was 23.6 weeks
(95% CI: 18.7–30.6) and median interval between vaccination and
delivery was 92 days (95% CI: 48–134).
Immune Status Against Pandemic A/H1N1 2009 Influenza
Serum samples both at inclusion and delivery were available for
678 (77.3%) women, of whom 256 (37.8%) had received A/H1N1
2009 influenza vaccine.
At inclusion, 13 (5.1%) of vaccinated women and 19 (4.5%) of
non-vaccinated women had HI antibodies against A/H1N1 2009
influenza strain with titers of 1:40 or greater (Table 2). At delivery,
the seroprotection rate was 30.3% (95% CI: 26.8–33.9): 69.9% in
vaccinated women, and 6.2% (95% CI: 4.1–8.9) in non-vaccinated
women.
Ten (2.3%) of the 422 women who did not receive the vaccine
seroconverted between inclusion and delivery. None of them
reported both fever and at least one flu symptom; one had isolated
fever, two had isolated respiratory symptoms without fever, and six
did not report any flu symptoms. None of them received
oseltamivir.
Finally, flu was laboratory-documented in 11 women among the
422 non-vaccinated women with serological data (1 with positive
PCR and 10 with serological seroconversion) (rate 2.6 per 100
pregnant women [95% CI: 1.3–4.6]) and no severe flu occurred.
Consequences of A/H1N1 2009 Influenza Vaccination on
Pregnancy Outcomes
There was no significant difference on pregnancy (onset of
labour, mode of delivery,gestational age at delivery) and perinatal
outcomes (birth weight, Apgar score, and transfer to neonatal care
unit) between women who received A/H1N1 2009 influenza
vaccine and women non-vaccinated (Table 3). Determinants of non
vaccination were studied in the cohort and previously published
[20]. In a multivariate logistic regression, immigrant women and
those having a low socio-economic status were independent factors
of non vaccination. We compared pregnancy and perinatal
outcomes in vaccinated and non vaccinated women according to
different categories of ‘‘immigrant women’’ and ‘‘socio-economic
status’’. No significant differences were evidenced between the two
groups (data not shown).No difference on pregnancy and perinatal
outcomes was evidenced between vaccinated women, non-vaccinated women without seroconversion, and women with virologically confirmed influenza or who seroconverted without vaccination, and between women who received oseltamivir and those who
did not receive oseltamivir (data not shown).
Discussion
In this cohort of pregnant women conducted during the H1N1
2009 pandemic, the number of laboratory-documented influenza
infections remained low despite low vaccine coverage (36.5%):
only one woman had PCR-confirmed A/H1N1 influenza and 10
non-vaccinated women seroconverted between inclusion and
delivery; no serious case of influenza and no hospitalization for
influenza were reported. Of note, the low level of influenza
infection (rate of 2.6 per 100 pregnant women) is reliable since
both PCR and serological data were combined for diagnosis.
It could be suggested that the low rate of influenza infection in
our cohort was related to the willingness of women to participate to
the study with a selection of women understanding preventive
measures to avoid flu infection. However, vaccination rate (36.5%),
although rather low, was close to the coverage rate in general

population of French pregnant women (29.3%) [21] and we showed
previously that vaccine coverage was not higher in women with
higher risk of exposure to the virus [20]. Other effective ways to
reduce the transmission of influenza virus including hygiene habits
could have play some role in this cohort population aware of the
issues related to A/H1N1 influenza during pregnancy and keener to
avoid infection than the general population.
We did not evidence an impact of A/H1N1 influenza infection
on maternal and perinatal outcomes but only few women
experienced flu. The pregnancy outcomes did not appear to be
seriously affected by pandemic and were comparable with those of
the French perinatal survey during non pandemic periods [21]. In
the national French registry created to screen pregnant women
with laboratory-confirmed A/H1N1 2009 influenza, the morbidity
and ICU management was increased mainly in at-risk patients
[22]; maternal mortality remained low and was lower than
mortality rates observed in other countries [23,24]. The UK study
of 256 pregnant women admitted to hospital with confirmed A/
H1N1 influenza evidenced a significantly high risk of poor
pregnancy outcome with higher perinatal mortality in infants
born from infected vs. uninfected women (39/1000 vs. 7/1000
births, respectively) [25]. The low number of laboratorydocumented influenza infections in our cohort does not allow
extrapolating our results on maternal and perinatal outcomes.
However, the design of our study is adapted to assess the incidence
of flu in this population of pregnant women and the impact on less
severe pregnancy outcomes. The differences of results between our
study and others could be also explained by the characteristics of
the population, health system and pandemic characteristics.
When it appeared that the infection rate of the pandemic was
less than expected, the inclusions in the study were stopped but
COFLUPREG cohort was nevertheless pursued since there was
an opportunity to assess immunogenicity, safety and consequences
of vaccination on outcomes of pregnancies. Indeed, vaccine safety
is a special concern in pregnant women. Previous studies suggested
that inactivated seasonal influenza vaccines were safe during
pregnancy [26–31]. Data were lacking in pregnant women for the
pandemic A/H1N1 2009 influenza vaccine, especially studies with
comparative data on pregnancy outcome between vaccinated and
non-vaccinated women. A French study in 107 pregnant women
who received one dose of non-adjuvanted pandemic A/H1N1
2009 influenza vaccine between 22 and 32 weeks of gestation did
not evidence adverse events of special interest [32]. The
prospective study of Tavares et al with AS03-adjuvanted pandemic A/H1N1 2009 influenza vaccine in 267 pregnant women
did not evidence an increase of the risk of adverse pregnancy
outcomes (spontaneous abortion, congenital abnormalities, preterm delivery, low birth weight neonates or maternal complications) [33]. In a large cohort study conducted in Denmark among
54 585 pregnant women (7062 vaccinated women), no evidence of
an increased risk of fetal death associated with exposure to an
adjuvanted pandemic A/H1N1 2009 influenza vaccine during
pregnancy was found [34]. In the present study, we confirm the
safety of one injection of the non-adjuvanted A/H1N1 2009
influenza vaccine. Indeed, among the 320 pregnant women who
were vaccinated, no significant difference on maternal and
perinatal outcomes was observed in comparison with the group
of 557 pregnant women who were not vaccinated.
Among vaccinated women, the seroprotection rate (defined as
titers above 1:40) at delivery was only 69.9%. In the PREFLUVAC study, performed with the same vaccine at the same
period, the women were vaccinated between the 22th and 26th
weeks of pregnancy and 92% of them achieved seroprotection at
delivery; the median duration between vaccination and delivery
was 12 weeks [32]. The COFLUPREG study was not designed as
a vaccine trial and was performed in naturalistic real life
conditions. Therefore, the follow-up of each woman varied widely
according to time of delivery, between 2 and 8 months after
vaccination. This could explain to some extent the lower
seroprotection rate in the COFLUPREG study among vaccinated
women. The interlaboratory variability of HI method has also
been previously reported and could also explain why seroprotection rate at delivery here appeared lower than expected [35].
Our study has some limits. First, due to the change of the primary
objective and early arrest of inclusion, the study was not powered for
assessment of rare serious events related to vaccination. Second, the
study was performed in three clinical wards in academic hospitals in
Paris and consequently the cohort could be not representative of the
French population of pregnant women. Third, the groups of
vaccinated and non-vaccinated pregnant women were not randomized. Therefore, it is possible that vaccinated women had not
the same initial risk of pregnancy complications than nonvaccinated women. Indeed, we previously showed that the rate of
coverage in the same cohort was low in immigrant women and
women with low economic status and these conditions could be
associated with poor pregnancy outcomes [20].
In conclusion, despite low vaccine coverage, incidence of
pandemic flu was very low in this cohort of pregnant women.
No effect on pregnancy and delivery outcomes was evidenced after
vaccination. However, seroprotection rate at delivery appeared
lower than expected in vaccinated women.
