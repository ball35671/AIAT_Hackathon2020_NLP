abstract
A randomized placebo-controlled double-blind trial of a nasally administered inactivated trivalent
influenza vaccine formulated with partially purified meningococcal outer membrane proteins (OMPTIV) was conducted in 1349 healthy adults aged 18–64 years. Subjects received either vaccine containing
15 g of haemagglutinin (HA) of each of three influenza strains for the 2003–2004 season on days 0 and
14, or 30 g on day 0 and saline placebo on day 14, or placebo on days 0 and 14. Vaccination was well
tolerated, with similar reactogenicity as placebo. Compared to placebo, statistically significant increases
in mean serum haemagglutinin inhibition reciprocal titers and salivary secretory IgA to all 3 antigens
were seen on day 28 for both vaccine dose groups. The incidence of culture-positive influenza and fever
>37.8 ◦C and cough and one or more of sore throat, runny nose or nasal congestion, muscle or joint ache,
headache, fatigue, or chills or culture positive influenza and at least two of these symptoms was low
(16/1349; 1.2%). In the intent-to-immunize population too few febrile culture-confirmed illness events
(n = 4) occurred to perform analysis. Fever occurred infrequently, even in the presence of positive cultures and disabling multi-symptom disease. In participants receiving all doses of either vaccine regimen
the incidence of culture-confirmed influenza with respiratory symptoms and with or without fever was
0.77% (7/904) vs. 2.03% (9/443) in placebo recipients (p = 0.045, Fisher’s exact test; relative risk reduction
62%), despite circulation of a drift variant A/H3N2 that was poorly matched to vaccine. An OMP-TIV vaccine was well tolerated and reduced risk of symptomatic culture confirmed influenza. Vaccine efficacy
will need to be validated in a season with a higher attack rate.

1. Introduction
Annual vaccination is identified as the most important measure to prevent morbidity and mortality associated with seasonal
influenza each winter [1]. Although currently available influenza
vaccines provide substantial protection against infection in healthy
persons, this protection is incomplete [2] and uptake of the vaccine,
especially among persons at highest risk for complicated influenza
and their caregivers, remains suboptimal [1].
Vaccines delivered to the nasal mucosae have the advantage
of not requiring injection and thus being more acceptable to
vaccinees. They may also stimulate both systemic and mucosal
immune responses, thus enhancing personal protection and potentially reducing transmission to others [3]. A prototype monovalent,
influenza A/H1N1 adjuvanted vaccine had an acceptable safety
profile and was immunogenic when given nasally to 154 healthy
adults in two phase 1 clinical trials and so subsequently a trivalent formulation was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled, dose-ranging clinical trial to assess the safety
and immunogenicity [4], as well as in a human challenge study [5].
The adjuvant/delivery system for this vaccine consists of
hydrophobic, proteinaceous, nanoparticles composed of purified
Neisseria meningitidis outer membrane proteins (OMPs). These
nanoparticles can non-covalently associate with amphiphilic antigens, such as the key antigens of inactivated influenza vaccines, the
viral haemagglutinins and neuraminidase, by virtue of an antigen’s
hydrophobic anchor sequence.
We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled trial to provide a preliminary assessment of the protective efficacy of a
nasally administered meningococcal outer membrane protein
adjuvanted trivalent influenza vaccine (hereinafter abbreviated
OMP-TIV) against laboratory-confirmed influenza infection during
the 2003–2004 influenza season in Canada.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Vaccine
Formulation of OMP-TIV product has been previously described
[4]. The vaccine contains equal parts of three monovalent egggrown, formalin-inactivated influenza antigens formulated with
OMPs of N. meningitidis serogroup B strain 8047 at an initial ratio
of OMP to haemagglutinin (HA) of 4:1. After diafiltration to remove
detergents necessary to keep the OMPs in stable solution in the
absence of antigen, the overall total protein to HA ratio in the final
vaccine product is 2.5 to 5:1. The trivalent vaccine stock for this
study contained HA from each of A/New Caledonia/20/99 [H1N1],
A/Panama/2007/99 [H3N2] and B/Shangdong/7/97 [H1N1], which
were the influenza antigens recommended for inclusion for the
2003–2004 season [1,6]. There were two test articles studied: a lot
with 75 ± 15 g of iHA from each of the three influenza strains and
a lot with 150 ± 30 g HA from each of the three influenza strains
per milliliter. Both lots are sterile, colorless to yellowish opalescent
and preserved with 0.01% thimerosal. The placebo control was sterile phosphate-buffered isotonic saline with 0.01% thimerosal, and
was colorless.
2.2. Study population
Adults aged 18–64 years inclusive, in good general health as
determined by a screening evaluation (history, physical examination, selected clinical laboratory tests), who were willing to forgo
the approved 2003–2004 intramuscular influenza vaccine and who
gave informed consent, were eligible to participate. Exclusion
included membership in groups for which annual influenza vaccination is recommended; presence of significant acute or chronic,
uncontrolled medical or psychiatric illness; pregnancy; infection
with Human Immunodeficiency Virus, Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C
Virus; chronic use of any medication or product for symptoms
of rhinitis or nasal congestion or any chronic nasopharyngeal
complaint or use of such product within seven days prior to immunization; asthma; symptoms or diagnosis suggesting gag reflex
impairment or predisposition to aspiration; use of systemic glucocorticosteroids or immunosuppressive medications; receipt of
investigational drugs in the prior month, presence of febrile or
upper respiratory tract illness on the day of immunization, and
known hypersensitivity to mercurials or chicken eggs.
2.3. Study design
The study protocol was approved by the Research Ethics Board
at each participating institution or by a central ethics board. Enrolment was conducted at 28 sites in Canada. Written informed
consent was obtained from all participants.
The study was double-blind, randomized and placebocontrolled. Neither the subject nor the site study team (staff
performing clinical safety or efficacy evaluations and investigators)
were aware of patient assignment. One research nurse at each site
was responsible for randomization, maintenance of the treatment
log, test article preparation and administration. This staff member
did not perform any safety or efficacy observations and could not
reveal treatment assignment to participants or other study staff.
Subjects were assigned centrally within blocks and stratified within
each site by age ≤49 and >49 years, and history of prior influenza
immunization within 2 years.
The primary outcome measure for efficacy was cultureconfirmed influenza illness (CCI) defined as fever (oral temperature
>37.8 ◦C) and cough and at least one of sore throat, runny nose or
nasal congestion, muscle or joint ache, headache, fatigue, or chills
(with symptoms sufficient to impede normal daily activities) and
a positive nose and throat swab culture for influenza A or B virus
(Table 1). A co-primary endpoint measure was a positive nose and
throat swab culture for influenza A or B virus and at least two of
the following 8 symptoms: fever, cough, sore throat, runny nose or
nasal congestion, muscle or joint ache, headache, fatigue, or chills.
The secondary outcome measure, influenza-like illness with evidence of influenza infection, required laboratory confirmation of
influenza by either a positive culture for influenza A or B virus, or
positive RT-PCR for influenza A or B virus or a 4-fold rise in reciprocal titer for a circulating influenza strain between days 28 and 180
and fever and cough and at least one of sore throat, runny nose or
nasal congestion, muscle or joint ache, headache, fatigue, or chills.
2.4. Study procedures
Vaccine and placebo were delivered to the nasal mucosae using
a VP3/100 nasal spray pump (Valois of America, Greenwich, CCCN)
with the participant in a sitting position. The test article was
administered on days 0 and 14 following one of the following
regimens: (1) meningococcal OMP-adjuvanted trivalent influenza
vaccine with 15 g of each HA antigen on days 0 and 14, or (2)
meningococcal OMP-adjuvanted trivalent influenza vaccine with
30 g of each HA antigen on day 0 and saline placebo on day
14, or saline placebo on days 0 and 14. The volume administered
intranasally was 0.20 mL (0.10 mL per nostril). The nose piece of
the pump was placed in one nostril while the participant occluded
the other nostril. While the participant gently inhaled through the
nose, the actuator was fully depressed. The process was repeated
for the other nostril.
A complete physical examination was performed and recorded
at the screening visit. Symptom-focused or complete physical

examinations were performed, as appropriate, for evaluation of
participant complaints throughout the trial. On days 0 and 14 a
directed physical examination of the ears, nose, throat and cervical and auricular lymph nodes was conducted. Participants were
monitored for 30 min after the immunization on days 0 and 14
for any immediate adverse events, and then completed a questionnaire which graded selected complaints as 0 (none), Grade 1
(mild), Grade 2 (moderate) or Grade 3 (severe). From days 0 to 7
subjects self-monitored evening oral temperature and completed
a written memory aid of reactogenicity. On days 3, 7, 17 and 21
participants reported the maximum oral temperature and severity
score in the previous days via an interactive voice response system.
A clinic visit for subject assessment was initiated if symptom complaints exceeded Grade 2. Prior to the day 14 dose subjects were
questioned about interim adverse events, and a physical exam was
performed. Coding for adverse events was according toMedical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MeDRA®, Chantilly, VA) version
6.1.
Blood and nasal mucous samples were collected on days 0
and 28 for haemagglutiin inhibition (HI) reciprocal titers and salivary secretory IgA (sIgA) measurement, respectively. Nasal mucous
samples were obtained by instilling 5 mL of sterile phosphatebuffered saline through the nostril with the participant tilting his or
her head back to a 45◦ angle and waiting 10 s. The participant then
leaned forward to allow the saline to pour into a sterile sample
container. This procedure was completed for each nostril.
Telephone contacts with subjects were made every two weeks
to solicit adverse events and identify influenza-like illness. Spontaneous illness reports were received via toll-free telephone call
center and reported to investigators. If the participant illness
included at least two of the illness criteria, and was severe enough
to impede normal daily activities then a nurse visit was initiated.
The nurse verified symptoms, collected nose and throat swabs and
recorded the participant’s temperature.
The final clinical visit occurred at approximately 7 months after
enrolment (April–May) to record changes in concomitant medication, adverse events, and for physical examination or laboratory
testing if deemed appropriate by the site investigator.
2.5. Laboratory methods
Influenza viruses were cultured on MDCK cells in small 1 mL
vials and cytopathic effects and/or positive hemadsorption tests
were confirmed by monoclonal antibodies. A multiplex RT-PCR
test was used to detect influenza A and B viruses as reported
[7]. Influenza A viruses were subsequently subtyped by another
RT-PCR assay [8]. Systemic immune responses were assessed by
serum HI antibody titers specific for the three viruses included
in the vaccine, prior to vaccination, just prior to the first dose
and 28 days after the first dose. Sera were tested by standard
microtitre haemagglutination-inhibition methods after treatment
with receptor-destroying enzyme. Nasal washes were concentrated approximately 4-fold using CentriconTM centrifugal filter
devices (50,000 molecular weight cut-off) as described by the manufacturer (Millipore Corporation, Billerica, MA). Strain-specific sIgA
responses were measured by kinetic enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (KELISA) as previously described [10]. With the
following modification: optical density at 650 nm was recorded
every 12 s for a total run time of 5 min at 25 ± 3 ◦C using a
Benchmark PlusTM Microplate Spectrophotometer and Microplate
ManagerTM version 5.2 build 103 Software (Bio-Rad Laboratories,
Mississauga, ON, Canada) to generate a KELISA rate. A mean rate
was calculated from the triplicate for each sample. Repeated assays
on standard samples yielded a day-to-day coefficient of variation
of ≤20%. A small number of samples required assay at additional
dilutions to obtain KELISA rates in the linear response range of
the assay; results were corrected for the dilution factor. Total sIgA
levels in nasal wash were quantified by radial immunodiffusion
using BINDARIDTM kits as described by the manufacturer (The Binding Site Ltd., Birmingham, UK). Virus-specific sIgA KELISA rates
in each sample were then normalized to the arithmetic mean of
total sIgA determinations for all specimens from the entire study
population.
2.6. Data analysis and statistical considerations
The safety analysis included all enrolled subjects who received
at least one dose of the test article. Subjects were analyzed according to the actual article received rather than the article to which
they were randomized. A 1-sided hypothesis test at the overall
0.025 level of significance was used in primary analyses, or a 2-
sided hypothesis test at the overall 0.05 level of significance in other
analyses. The analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint, cultureconfirmed influenza, was based on an intention-to-immunize
sample (ITI) which included any subject who received at least one
dose of test article. Subjects were analyzed under the treatment to
which they were randomized. This method excluded persons who
were randomized but did not receive test article. (A number of subjects were enrolled but not given the test article because enrollment
closed when overall study subject accrual targets were met.) The
additional primary efficacy endpoint, culture-positive influenza A
or B in participants that met criteria for an illness visit, was based
on the evaluable subjects (ES) i.e., those who had a complete regimen (i.e. one dose of placebo in the placebo group, at least one dose
of 30 g, 2 doses of 15 g). The secondary analysis of participants
with influenza-like illness and evidence of influenza infection (i.e.

on the evaluable subjects.
For both the ITI and ES comparisons of 2 OMP-TIV doses with
placebo, 1-sided categorical data analysis models were used that
adjusted for stratification (age, gender and prior influenza immunization within 2 years) as well as interactions with the vaccination
group. The final analysis included the vaccination group and those
covariates which were significantly associated with outcome. Vaccine efficacy estimates are presented as relative risk, their lower
97.5% confidence bounds, and a p value for the test of zero efficacy.
Continuous data were summarized using descriptive statistics (n,
median, mean, range).
Serum HI antibody reciprocal titers were log transformed (log 2)
and their means and 95% confidence intervals (CI) presented by
vaccination group. Titers less than 1:10 or greater than 1:640 were
treated as 1:5 or 1:1280, respectively, during log transformation.
Proportions of subjects with HI antibody reciprocal titers of at least
40 or showing a 4-fold rise from baseline were calculated. Salivary sIgA kinetic enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay levels were
normalized on a total sIgA content of the specimen. HI antibody
reciprocal titers and salivary-specific IgA levels were compared
between groups postimmunization by a linear model (SAS PROC
GLM). The model adjusted for baseline HI reciprocal titer, age, gender, and prior influenza immunization within 2 years.
Proportions of subjects in each group having each reactogenicity
complaint after each dosage administration and overall were calculated; the higher grade severity of immediate complaint and oral
temperature for two doses was used in the overall summary and
compared by a generalized Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel test adjusting for site, age and prior influenza immunization within 2 years.
Maximum reaction rates complaints (Grade 2 or higher) or temperature ≥37.8 ◦C were also compared between each dosage using
McNemar’s Chi squared test. Adverse events were coded according to system organ class by the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory
Activities (MeDRA®) version 6.1.
Safety analysis included all enrolled subjects who received at
least one dose of test article; subjects were analyzed according to
actual test article received.

3. Results
3.1. Demographics
Of 1349 participants enrolled, 1348 were randomized (99.9%).
Completion rates in the three study arms are seen in Fig. 1. One
subject was ineligible for the intent-to-immunize sample, and
two were ineligible for the evaluable subject population. Thus the
intent-to-immunize population was 1348, the safety population
1349 and the evaluable subject population 1347. The demographics
of the intent-to-immunize population are seen in Table 2
.
3.2. Reactogenicity and safety
There were no significant differences in the incidence of any
immediate complaint or post-immunization temperature between
the three study groups (Table 4). Less than 10% of participants
reported any immediate complaint after either dose of vaccine or
control. Among the Grade 1 complaints (mild), the most common
were: burning or stinging in the nose (133/1349; 9.9%), lightheadedness or dizziness (107/1349; 7.9%), itching in the nose, throat
or eyes (96/1349; 7.1%), and burning or stinging in the throat
(39/1349; 2.9%). The incidence of these complaints decreased after
exposure to the second dose of the test article. There were no Grade
3 complaints; two placebo recipients reported Grade 2 dizziness or
lightheadedness (2/1349; 0.5%). Fever (37.8–38.2
◦C) occurred in
one placebo and one 30
g dose recipient.
Considering reactogenicity complaints reported over 7 days
after either dose, incidence rates were remarkably similar between
the three treatment groups, and no significant differences between
active and placebo treatment groups were noted. For each complaint solicited, >50% of subjects in all groups reported no symptom
(Grade 0) at any time point, and <6% of subjects overall reported any
complaint at Grade 2 or 3 severity. The most common complaints
were all of Grade 1 severity and included runny nose (571/1349,
42.3%), stuffy nose (517/1349, 38.3%), headache (450/1349, 33.4%),
sneezing (386/1349, 28.6%), sore throat (363/1349, 26.9%), tiredness/fatigue (338/1349, 25.1%), and cough (282/1349, 20.9%). In no
case did the incidence in any treatment group deviate by more than
3% from the overall rate.
Spontaneously reported adverse events occurred in 66.9% of
the trial population, including 305/455 recipients of two OMP-TIV
doses at the 15
g dose level (67.0%), 296/451 recipients of one
OMP-TIV dose at the 30
g dose level (65.6%), and 302/443 recipients of placebo (68.2%); there were no clear imbalances among
MedDRA preferred terms across the treatment groups. There were
7 serious adverse events, 6 of which were assessed by the investigators as not related to the test article. An episode of hypersensitivity
in a single participant (15
g group) was deemed probably related
to the test article by the local investigator. This event occurred in a
50-year-old woman who had never previously received influenza
vaccine, after the second 15
g dose of vaccine. About 8 min after
vaccine receipt she developed rash, dyspnea, palpitations, dizziness, blurred vision, tachycardia and hypotension. She improved
within 15 min of supine positioning and intramuscular diphenhydramine, and had no further sequelae.
3.3. Immunogenicity
Statistically significant increases in geometric mean serum HI
titers and in the proportion of subjects with HI titers
≥1:40, a level
suggested as correlating with protection in adults, were observed

in both active treatment groups in contrast to placebo recipients
(Table 3 and Fig. 2). Responses were more frequent, and of larger
magnitude, for the two influenza A viruses than for the influenza B
component. Rises in geometric mean salivary sIgA levels specific for
all 3 antigens were also observed on day 28 for both active vaccine
regimens compared to placebo (Table 3 and Fig. 3)
3.4. Efficacy
The incidence of laboratory confirmed influenza was low in
the overall study population; with only 16/1347 participants overall having a positive culture (1.2%). The incidence of disease by
outcomemeasure is seen inTable 5. In the intent-to-immunize population (n = 1348) too few cases of CCI (primary outcome measure)
occurred to perform a meaningful analysis (n = 4). This result was
conditioned primarily by the very low incidence of fever (either
self-observed or nurse-confirmed) in these adult subjects, even in
the presence of influenza culture positivity and 4–5 other symptoms which interfered with normal daily activities. In participants

receiving either active vaccine regimen, and using a clinical outcome of without fever, the incidence of influenza was 0.77% (7/904)
compared to 2.03% (9/433) in placebo recipients (p = 0.045, Fisher’s
exact test; relative risk reduction 62%). The addition of RT-PCR as a
diagnostic tool increased the case rates only slightly and did not
materially affect the apparent efficacy. Considering seroconversion to circulating strains as evidence of influenza infection (4-fold
antibody rise) increased the number of cases while slightly decreasing apparent efficacy. The influenza season in Canada peaked
in December and the predominant strain was A/Fujian/411/02-
like [H3N2], a drift variant that was not well-matched to the
vaccine.
4. Discussion
In this multicenter phase 2 randomized placebo-controlled trial
of a nasally administered inactivated influenza vaccine we have
demonstrated that this novel adjuvanting method produces a vaccine that is minimally reactogenic and immunogenic. A relatively
mild influenza season among the adult subjects enrolled in this
study precluded evaluation of efficacy.
Although the incidence of influenza was too low in our study
population to convincingly demonstrate vaccine efficacy, we did
observe a relative risk reduction in symptomatic culture-confirmed
influenza of 62% compared to placebo recipients despite the circulation of a drift variant. The 2003–2004 influenza season saw the
emergence of the A/Fujian strain, accounting for 96.8% of H3N2
isolates in Canada that year [9], which was mismatched with
A/Panama/2007/99 [H3N2] in the recommended vaccine. Although
vaccines with strains well matched to circulating virus can result
in 80% (95% CI 56–91%) efficacy in preventing influenza in healthy
adults, the efficacy of mismatched vaccines is estimated at 50% (95%
CI 27–65%) in systematic reviews [2]. National influenza surveillance for 2003–2004 indicated that the age groups most affected

were children <5 years of age (33% of isolates) followed by persons over 65 years (25% of isolates) [9]. Adults 25–64 years of age
contributed only 20% of confirmed cases. Convincing evidence of
efficacy of the nasally administered meningococcal outer membrane protein adjuvanted trivalent influenza vaccine would require
validation in much larger numbers of subjects, and preferably a
season with a higher attack rate and better match between circulating strains and vaccine antigen. The vaccine was significantly
immunogenic relative to placebo as measured by both rise in both
serum HAI titers and salivary IgA levels on day 28, and the majority of recipients had a four-fold rise in antigen-specific antibody
titers, or an HI titer >1:40, or both on day 28. The vaccine was significantly immunogenic relative to placebo as measured by both
rise in both serum HAI titers and salivary IgA levels on day 28.
We have previously shown that local immune responses occur by
day 14 after immunization [4]. It is important to note that serum
HAI titers, which are widely used for the evaluation of parenterally delivered influenza vaccines and serve as the basis for annual
re-registration of these products, capture of only one aspect of the
immune response to a mucosal vaccine. Past experience with this
vaccine suggests we should not expect serum HAI responses of the
same magnitude as those elicited by an intramuscular product. The

potential efficacy of a mucosal vaccine may depend to a substantial
extent on secretory IgA or even cellular responses, for which there
are no gold-standard assays at present or accepted standards for
protective responses.
Fever and cough are considered important clinical hallmarks of
influenza. Interestingly we found the majority of outpatient adults
with laboratory-confirmed influenza and multi-symptom respiratory disease impeding normal daily activities and cough, could not
provide confirmation of fever. It is possible that due to the intermittent nature of fever, we were unable to document this sign at
the time of clinical assessment. However, no specific symptom or
combination of symptoms is diagnostic of influenza [10]. The combination of fever and cough increases the likelihood ratio that a
patient has influenza by only 1.9, and absence of these symptoms
(negative likelihood ratio) performs even more poorly at 0.54 [10].
Future trials should include as an outcome measure laboratoryconfirmed influenza associated with significant respiratory illness
both with and without fever.
The larger sample size of this trial has permitted a more accurate
estimate of reactogenicity than was possible in earlier and smaller
phase 1 and 2 studies using a monovalent and trivalent product
[4,11]. Of over 1300 participants, one vaccine recipient had a fever
(37.8–38.2 ◦C) in the post-vaccinal period, and less than 10% had
transient burning or stinging in the nose or itching in the nose,
throat or eyes. These complaints decreased in frequency after the
second dose of vaccine. There were no Grade 2 or 3 complaints. One
subject had a hypersensitivity reaction deemed probably related to
the test article.
Ease of administration is an important characteristic of vaccine
delivery, for both the health care provider and the vaccine recipient. Nasally administered vaccines should be more acceptable than
injectable ones for up to 10% of the population with a fear of needles [12,13]. Inactivated influenza vaccines based on nasal spray
administration appear to be more acceptable than nasal drops to
vaccinees [3]. Programs using nasally administered vaccines could
also be simpler to implement since vaccine providers would not
have to have the skill set required for injectable medications, and
thus potentially less expensive. Vaccines administered by this route
also have the potential advantage of enhanced production of nasal
IgA [14].
