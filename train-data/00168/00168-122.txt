OBJECTIVE: The 2009-2010 A/H1N1 pandemic provided a unique setting to study the safety of MF59-adjuvanted vaccination in pregnancy.
STUDY DESIGN: This was an observational cohort study of the safety of
an MF59-adjuvanted A/H1N1 vaccine (Focetria) conducted among
4508 pregnant women (2295 vaccinated vs 2213 unvaccinated), with
3 month follow-up of neonates.
RESULTS: No maternal deaths or abortions occurred among the vaccinated women. No differences between the vaccinated and unvaccinated
cohorts were observed for gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, stillbirth, low
birthweight, neonatal deaths, or congenital malformations. The risk of premature birth was significantly decreased among the vaccinated women
(adjusted proportional hazard, 0.69; 95% confidence interval, 0.51–0.92).
No differences were observed in rates of congenital malformations after
vaccination in the first (2.1%), second (2.7%), or third (2.1%) trimesters.
CONCLUSION: There was no evidence of a safety risk for MF59-adjuvanted A/H1N1 vaccination in pregnant women; protection was observed against premature birth.

Soon after the outbreak of the A/H1N1
influenza pandemic in 2009, pregnant women were recognized as a highrisk group.1,2 In the United States, pregnant women had a 4-fold greater risk of
hospitalization because of A/H1N1 infection than the general population at
the start of the pandemic,3 and in the first
months of the pandemic, 13% of all
A/H1N1-related deaths reported in the
United States occurred among pregnant
women. Anticipated effects of A/H1N1
infection on the health of newborns3,4
were confirmed in the United Kingdom,
where the risks of perinatal mortality as
well as premature birth were 4-fold
higher in mothers infected with A/H1N1
during their pregnancy.5
Pregnancy has previously been recognized as a risk factor for complications
both during influenza pandemics and
regular influenza seasons.6-8 Given the
good immune responses elicited by influenza vaccination in pregnant women
and their offspring,9,10 vaccination has
been recommended since the late 1950s
to reduce the burden of seasonal influenza in pregnant women and their offspring.9,11 A recent randomized controlled interventional trial in Bangladesh
showed a significant reductionin theinfluenza burden in both vaccinated pregnant
women and their offspring.12 The protective effect in newborns was also shown in
several observational studies.13,14
Focetria (Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics, Cambridge, MA), an egg-derived A/H1N1 influenza vaccine adjuvanted with MF59, was one of the first
A/H1N1 vaccines to be licensed in Europe.15 MF59 is a squalene-based oilin-water emulsion used in Europe
since 1997 in the seasonal influenza
vaccine, Fluad (Novartis Vaccines and
Diagnostics). More than 50 million
doses have been distributed to date,
with no safety signals other than some
increased local injection site reactions
and general reactions associated with
vaccination (myalgia, headache, fatigue, and malaise) up to 7 days after
the vaccination.16,17

A comprehensive preclinical assessment
(including embryofetal toxicity and teratogenicity studies) and clinical trials in
more than 20,000 subjects did not show
any safety signalwith theMF59 adjuvant.18
An analysis of the outcomes among 103inadvertently vaccinated pregnantwomenin
these trials did not find any adverse effect
on the pregnancy outcomes.16 To further
assess the safety of the MF59 adjuvant in
pregnancy,we conducted an observational
study to evaluate outcomes in pregnant
women who received the MF59-adjuvanted A/H1N1 influenza vaccine during
the recent pandemic.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
This was an observational comparative
cohort study conducted in 3 countries in
which the MF59-adjuvanted A/H1N1
vaccine was the only vaccine administered to pregnant women: The Netherlands, Italy, and Argentina.
Recruitment and follow-up
There was no distinction in the way vaccinated women and controls were recruited. In The Netherlands, women
were recruited at 27 midwife practices
(76.0%) and 7 hospitals (23.4%) across
the country. A small group (0.6%) was
recruited by general practitioners. In Italy and Argentina, women were recruited at 2 hospitals (Rome and Cordoba). Recruitment ran from January to
August 2010 in The Netherlands, May to
June 2010 in Italy, and July to August
2010 in Argentina. To maximize the
number of subjects, enrolment included
both currently pregnant women (enrolled during antenatal care visits) and
women whose pregnancy had already
ended but covered the timing of the pandemic vaccine’s availability. The latter
group was identified from the delivery
list in the midwife or hospital unit and
then recruited sequentially. All women
who provided informed consent were
enrolled except those who had received a
different pandemic influenza vaccine or
if the investigator believed that data collection or follow-up would be difficult.
Investigators collected information on
demographics (date of birth, ethnicity,
education, occupation, and income),
previous obstetric history and past or
current risk factors (tobacco, alcohol
and recreational drug use, concurrent
medications), results of any prenatal
testing and the pregnancy outcomes, including all birth characteristics, at the
prenatal consultations or at birth for the
women enrolled while still pregnant. For
women enrolled after delivery, this information was extracted from the medical records. Information from the pediatric 3 month visit was requested to
identify any congenital malformations
not detected at birth.
All data were collected on site via electronic data capture. Serious adverse
events (SAEs) were also collected separately throughout the study and reconciled with the study outcomes, thereby
providing an additional level of data verification for most outcomes of interest.
Source documentation was verified for
all study outcomes.
Vaccination
A/H1N1 vaccination of pregnant women
occurred in November and December
2009 in The Netherlands,19 between October and December 2009 in Italy,20 and
between February and August 2010 in
Argentina.21 Each woman was asked following enrollment whether and when she
had received theMF59-adjuvanted A/H1N1
vaccine. This information was confirmed
by either asking the vaccination centers to
confirm the vaccinationfrom their records
or by examining the vaccination cards. If
no such confirmation could be obtained,
we followed the pregnant woman’s
recollection.
Outcomes
The 3 groups of outcomes of interest were
pregnancy-related diseases (preeclampsia,
gestational diabetes, and maternal death),
pregnancy outcomes (spontaneous or induced abortions, stillbirth, or live birth),
and birth outcomes (birthweight, prematurity, congenitalmalformations, and neonatal death). Abortions were considered
as losses before 22 weeks of gestation.
Congenital malformations were considered only if confirmed following examination of an aborted pregnancy or stillborn child or in a live-born baby at birth
or at the 3 month pediatric visit. Each
congenital malformation was also reported as an SAE, which included a detailed narrative.
These reports were reviewed and adjudicated by an expert panel, blinded to the
vaccination status. Malformations were
retained if the diagnosis provided is listed
in the EuropeanSurveillance ofCongenital
Anomalies (EUROCAT) guidelines as a
congenital anomaly or if the information
provided sufficed to so classify it assuch.22
Cases with a malformation with insufficient information to determine whether
it met EUROCAT criteria (eg, hemangioma with unknown location) were conservatively retained. Malformations diagnosed prenatally before vaccination
and chromosomal malformations were
excluded from the analyses. Outcomes
were recorded from time of vaccination
in the vaccinated cohort and from the
time of enrollment in the unvaccinated
cohort recruited during pregnancy and
from the whole antenatal care record for
the unvaccinated cohort recruited after
delivery.
Sample size
A 2% background rate of major birth defects, as observed in The Netherlands,
was assumed for the sample size calculation.23 Based on a 2 group 2 test with
normal approximation at the 5% significance level (2 sided), 2434 evaluable
pregnancies would provide 80% power
to detect a doubling of the background
rate (ie, anticipated rate in unvaccinated
cohort). To allow for approximately
15% of pregnancies being nonevaluable
for the assessment of major birth defects
and assuming a 25% loss to follow-up,
4056 subjects needed to be enrolled.
Statistical analyses
All analyses were performed using SAS
version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary,
NC). We used logistic regression models
to estimate the odds ratios associated
with vaccination for all outcomes. The
differences in initiation points for the
data collection combined with the timing of the vaccination in pregnancy resulted in a differential follow-up time between the vaccinated and unvaccinated
cohort. To account for this differential
follow-up time and for the fact that the
occurrence of most outcomes depends

177.e2 American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology SEPTEMBER 2012
on the gestational age, we also used proportional hazard (PH) models with gestational age as the time factor for all outcomes except congenital malformations.
For these PH models, we imputed the
date of the last menstrual period (LMP)
from the date of delivery for 10% of
women who did not report their LMP
and for 7% for whom the reported LMP
was considered erroneous as it suggested
a pregnancy of more than 42 weeks.
We provide results of both the logistic
regression models that use the most
complete data and the proportional hazard models that adjust for the differential
follow-up time. We also ran the PH
models without the women with missing
or erroneous LMPs in a sensitivity analysis to assess the potential impact of the
LMP imputation. A small proportion of
women dropped out from the PH models because of missing vaccination dates
(6%) or missing onset dates of the outcome (1%). We adjusted the estimates
for all outcomes on parity, smoking, and
maternal age.
In addition, we let the automated SAS
procedure Stepwise select, per individual
outcome of interest, any additional significant variables including enrollment
type (during or after pregnancy), type of
health care practitioner enrolling, ethnicity, current alcohol use, and previous
history of the specific outcome of interest. Other variables were not included
because they had too many missing data
(education, profession, and income) or
because they had very few positive entries (recreational drug use and concomitant medication).
The study was approved by local ethical review committees in each individual
country.
RESULTS
Enrollment and follow-up
Of the total 4529 enrolled women, most
(4281, 94.5%) were recruited in The Netherlands,followed byArgentina (239,5.3%)
and Italy (9, 0.2%). Twenty-one were excluded from the analyses (7 pregnancies
completed prior to the vaccination campaign, 5 received a vaccine other than the
MF59-adjuvanted A/H1N1 vaccine, 7

with incomplete or withdrawn consent,
and 2 with unknown vaccination status).
Because 16 women dropped out before
pregnancy completion and 48 had twins,
we had a total of 4540 evaluable pregnancy outcomes, of which 4522 were live
births. We obtained information on the
3 month pediatric follow-up on 4385 infants (97.0%) (Figure).
Characteristics of the cohorts
The mean age at enrollment was 32 years
and most women (83.3%) were of white
origin. The vaccinated cohort was comparable with the unvaccinated cohort for
most characteristics (Table 1), with the
exception that more vaccinated women
were enrolled after delivery, belong to
the “other” ethnicity or were enrolled by
the “other” professional category and
less vaccinated women had a previous
history of an elective abortion.
Pregnancy and neonatal outcomes
There were no maternal deaths. Nearly
all pregnancies (99.6 %) resulted in a live
birth, a rate mostly explained by the relatively high gestational age at enrollment
in the cohort enrolled during pregnancy.
For the same reason, there were few spontaneous abortions and elective terminations (0.2% and 0.1%, respectively). The
rates of prematurity and low birthweight
were relatively low compared with rates in
The Netherlands where most women were
recruited, suggesting a relatively healthy
cohort.24 Potential congenital malformations were reported in a total of 365
babies: 188 (8.1%) among the vaccinated
and 177 (7.9%) among the unvaccinated. Of these, the adjudication committee retained 106 as true congenital
malformations, 9 of which were excluded from the analysis (2 were diagnosed prenatally before vaccination and
7 were chromosomal malformations).
Thus, the total number of confirmed
congenital malformations included in
the analysis was 97.
The logistic regression and proportional hazard analyses did not indicate a
significantly increased risk in the vaccinated compared with the unvaccinated
cohort for any of the outcomes of interest. Vaccination was not associated with
any significant increase in risk of gestaTABLE 1

tional diabetes, preeclampsia, stillbirth,
low birthweight, preterm birth, neonatal
deaths, or congenital malformations (Table 2). In fact, there was a significant reduction in the vaccinated cohort in premature births in the unadjusted logistic
regression and both the adjusted and unadjusted PH models.
There was also a significant reduction
in the vaccinated cohort in gestational
diabetes with logistic regression; however, no significant reduction was seen in
the PH models for this outcome. Odds
ratios and proportional hazards could
not be obtained for spontaneous and
elective abortions because no case was
reported in the vaccinated cohort versus
9 cases (0.4%) and 3 cases (0.1%), respectively, in the unvaccinated cohort.
Congenital malformations in the vaccinated cohort were not more frequent
among women who received the first
vaccination in the first trimester (2 of 94,
2.1%) than among women who received
the first vaccination in the second (35 of
1319, 2.7%) or third trimesters (19 of
889, 2.1%). The distribution of various
malformations was also comparable between the 2 cohorts with the exception of
numerical imbalances for ventricular septum defects (11 cases among the vaccinated and 2 among the unvaccinated) and
for cleftlip and/or palate (0 among the vaccinated and 5 among the unvaccinated).
The sensitivity analysis removing the
subjects with imputed LMP did not show
any different results.
COMMENT
The 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic and the concerns over the large-scale use of newly licensed vaccines prompted manufacturers,
regulators, and academic groups to conduct a large number of interventional and
observational safety studies, several of
which included pregnant women.
Our study of more than 4500 pregnant
women is the largest comparative safety
study of an MF59-adjuvanted vaccine in
pregnancy and one of the largest studies
with prospective follow-up of pregnant
women for any vaccine.
We did not find any adverse effect of
the MF59-adjuvanted A/H1N1 vaccine
on the ongoing pregnancy or on the health
of the mother or the newborns. The rates
of gestational diabetes, preeclampsia,
abortions, stillbirth, low birthweight, prematurity, neonatal deaths, and congenital
malformations among themore than 2000
vaccinated women and their offspring
showed no increase compared with those
in unvaccinated controls.
Tamma et al25 conducted a review of
the safety of influenza vaccination in
pregnancy and concluded that no study
to date has shown adverse consequence
following influenza vaccination in
pregnancy. One of the few clinical trials of flu vaccination conducted in pregnant women showed no increase in adverse events compared with recipients of a
pneumococcal vaccine.12 A review of the
spontaneous reports made to the Vaccine
Adverse Event Reporting System on pregnant women vaccinated with the H1N1
vaccine in the United States, equally did
not detect any safety concerns.26
Few nonaluminium adjuvanted vaccines, besides the MF-59 adjuvanted flu
vaccines, are currently licensed. Tavares
et al27 prospectively assessed the safety of
another adjuvanted A/H1N1 vaccine
used in the United Kingdom in a limited
cohort of 267 women and did not observe any adverse effect on the pregnancy
outcomes or the offspring of the vaccinated women when compared with the
rates from the literature.
The overall rate and pattern of major
congenital malformations observed in
this study was comparable with what has
been previously reported in The Netherlands.23 The rate of malformations was
also not higher in the women who received their first vaccination in the first
trimester. The numerical imbalances for
ventricular septum defects (against the
vaccinated cohort) and for cleft lip
and/or palate (in favor of the vaccinated
cohort) are most likely related to a
chance finding. Compared with EUROCAT data, the rates of both events were
unusually low in the cohort with the fewest cases. There was also no pattern of

malformations (eyes, ears) in the vaccinated women that are associated with
teratogenic exposures in the second trimester, when most women were exposed
to the vaccine.
We observed a significantly lower risk
of preterm birth among vaccinated
women in the proportional hazard
model, which accounts for differences in
follow-up times between cohorts. Prematurity has been linked to A/H1N1 infection in the United Kingdom and The
Netherlands,5,28 and it is thus plausible
that vaccination could offer a protective
effect. A similar observation was made in
the state of Georgia, where babies born
between 2004 and 2006 to mothers vaccinated against seasonal influenza during pregnancy were less likely to be premature than infants of unvaccinated
mothers born in the same period (adjusted odds ratio, 0.60; 95% confidence
interval, 0.38 – 0.94).29Analyses that take
into account the timing of pregnancy in
relation to exposure to the pandemic and
to study initiation would be needed to
further explore this beneficial effect of
vaccination in our study.
On the other hand, the significantly
decreased odds for gestational diabetes is
most likely related to the differential follow-up times, as illustrated by the absence of any effect in the proportional
hazard model. The same is likely to be
true for the numerical difference observed in the number of abortions.
Our study has several strengths, related to its size, rigor, and design. The
study had high power to detect adverse
outcomes in late pregnancy and among
the offspring of the vaccinated women,
as illustrated by the narrow 95% confidence intervals around some of the risk estimates. In addition, the high follow-up
rate at 3 months of age ensured that few
outcomes such as congenital malformations not obvious at birth would have been
missed. We went beyond classical epidemiological practice to apply some good
clinical practices such as source document verification and serious adverse
events collection and follow-up. Adjudication of congenital malformations by a
blinded committee increased the validity
of this outcome. Finally, information on
both cases and controls was collected
through direct contact with all players involvedin the pregnancy and perinatal care,
including the health care practitioners providing vaccinations and treatment, the
mothers, and the pediatricians.
Our study also has some limitations.
Because A/H1N1 vaccination was recommended for women in their second
or third trimester, we enrolled relatively
few women (n  94) vaccinated in their
first trimester. This limited our ability to
assess the impact of vaccination on outcomes occurring early in pregnancy such
as spontaneous abortions. It is reassuring to note that the rates of congenital
malformations among these women
were not elevated, although the number
of first-trimester exposures remains too
low to permit any firm conclusions regarding safe first-trimester use.
We cannot exclude that women who
opted for vaccination were more or less
likely to have adverse pregnancy outcomes or an inclusion bias of vaccinated
women who were more or less likely to
have an adverse pregnancy outcome.
Vaccination rates in the cohort enrolled
following delivery (61%) were consistent
with published rates in The Netherlands,
where most women were recruited, suggesting that recruitment after delivery
was not related to vaccination status.30
Before delivery some investigators may,
however, have preferentially included
vaccinated women with suspicion of an
adverse outcome, thus creating a falsely

increased risk in the vaccinated cohort.
Of the 6 women who had a prenatal diagnosis of a congenital malformation
and who were enrolled before delivery, 5
(83%) were vaccinated. This relatively
high proportion, more than double the
vaccination rate of 37% in the cohort enrolled before delivery, suggests such preferential enrolment may have occurred.
In addition, as pointed out in a report
by the Dutch Health Council, it is likely
that in The Netherlands relatively more
pregnant women with underlying medical conditions were vaccinated because
the original A/H1N1 vaccine recommendation was to immunize only pregnant women with underlying medical
conditions.31 This recommendation was
changed very late, just before the actual
immunization campaign started. We did
not collect information on these conditions and therefore could not adjust for
such a potential bias, which would have
resulted in falsely elevated risks in the
vaccinated cohort. It is reassuring that
despite these potential sources of bias
against the vaccinated cohort, no safety
signal was detected.
For a small proportion of the vaccinated
women (11.9%), we could not obtain verification of their vaccination status from
the general practitioner. However, given
the exceptional pandemic situation
and the public debate around the vaccination campaign, we expect the recall to be
accurate for most of these women.
Influenza vaccination rates remain
low among pregnant women, despite the
increase observed following the 2009
pandemic in the United States.32 Concerns over safety are one of the main reasons for not taking the vaccine.30,33-36
Our study found no safety risk among
more than 2000 pregnant women receiving the MF59-adjuvanted A/H1N1 vaccine. These and similar results from
other studies should provide reassurance
when offering influenza vaccination, including MF59-adjuvanted formulations
to all pregnant women. f
