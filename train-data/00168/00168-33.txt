Background. The efficacy of influenza vaccines may vary annually. In 2004 –2005, when antigenically drifted
viruses were circulating, a randomized, placebo-controlled trial involving healthy adults showed that inactivated
vaccine appeared to be efficacious, whereas live attenuated vaccine appeared to be less so.
Methods. In 2005–2006, we continued our trial, examining the absolute and relative efficacies of the live attenuated and inactivated vaccines in preventing laboratory-confirmed symptomatic influenza.
Results. A total of 2058 persons were vaccinated in October and November 2005. Studywide influenza activity
was prolonged but of low intensity; type A (H3N2) virus was circulating, which was antigenically similar to the vaccine
strain. The absolute efficacy of the inactivated vaccine was 16% (95% confidence interval [CI], 171% to 70%) for the
virus identification end point (virus isolation in cell culture or identification through polymerase chain reaction) and
54% (95% CI, 4%–77%) for the primary end point (virus isolation or increase in serum antibody titer). The absolute
efficacies of the live attenuated vaccine for these end points were 8% (95% CI, 194% to 67%) and 43% (95% CI,
15% to 71%), respectively.
Conclusions. With serologic end points included, efficacy was demonstrated for the inactivated vaccine in a year
with low influenza attack rates. The efficacy of the live attenuated vaccine was slightly less than that of the inactivated
vaccine, but not statistically greater than that of the placebo.
Trial registration. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00133523.
Influenza vaccines for seasonal protection need to be
updated annually because of the mutability of influenza
viruses [1]. The efficacy of the vaccines may vary in different years, depending on how closely the circulating
strains resemble those in the vaccines [2]. There may
also be differences in efficacy in a given year between the
2 kinds of currently licensed influenza vaccine—the replicating live attenuated vaccine and the inactivated vaccine.
In 2004 –2005, a drifted influenza A (H3N2) virus,
A/California/07/2004, circulated [3]. In addition, 2 lineages of type B were prevalent, only one of which was
included among the recommended vaccine strains [4].
In that year, 3 studies of vaccine efficacy were conducted
[5 –7]. One compared the efficacy of live attenuated vaccine with that of inactivated vaccine in young children
and indicated that overall, the live attenuated vaccine
offered more protection [5]. A small study of healthy
adults that involved a new formulation of recombinant
vaccine containing only viral hemagglutinin suggested
that it had high protective efficacy against the drifted
type A (H3N2) virus [6]. We also conducted the first
year of a continuing study in healthy adults [7]. We
demonstrated significant protective efficacy for the inactivated vaccine, compared with placebo, for the priReceived 20 November 2007; accepted 22 February 2008; electronically published 3 June 2008.

mary outcome, which was isolation in cell culture or increase in
serum antibody titer, and for virus identification end points; the
efficacy of the live attenuated vaccine was less, in part because of
lower efficacy against influenza type B.We report here the results
from the second year of the study (2005–2006), in which a type A
(H3N2) virus, antigenically similar to the strain included in the
vaccine, circulated [8].
METHODS
Study design and objectives. The study was a multiyear, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, community-based
trial [7]. Our primary objective each year was to evaluate the
absolute efficacies of the inactivated and live attenuated influenza vaccines (vs. placebo) in preventing laboratory-confirmed
symptomatic influenza caused by circulating strains. Secondary
objectives included estimating the relative efficacy of one vaccine, compared with that of the other, and examining the humoral immune response to vaccination.
Participant enrollment and follow-up. Participants were
healthy men and women, aged 18 to 48 years, recruited at 6 study
sites (4 University sites and 2 community sites) in Michigan.
Persons with any health condition for which the inactivated vaccine was recommended or for whom either vaccine was contraindicated were excluded [9]. The study was approved by the
institutional review board at the University of Michigan Medical
School.
At enrollment, written informed consent was obtained and
participants were randomly assigned to receive a single intervention: the inactivated influenza vaccine or matching placebo
(i.e., physiologic saline) by intramuscular injection or the live
attenuated influenza vaccine or matching placebo (i.e., normal
allantoic fluid) by intranasal spray, in ratios of 5:1 and 5:1, respectively. Participants and nurses administering study interventions were unaware of whether vaccine or placebo was administered, but they were aware of the route of administration.
Persons initially enrolled in year 1 of the study (2004 –2005) who
reenrolled in year 2 received the same intervention that they had
been randomly assigned in year 1. Additional subjects were enrolled for the first time in year 2 of the study to supplement the
sample size so that it reached planned levels. Blood specimens
were collected immediately prior to vaccination, one month after vaccination, and at the end of the influenza season for evaluation of immune response to vaccination and serologic determination of influenza infection. Participants recorded data on
solicited local and systemic reactions to vaccination on diary
cards each day for 7 days after vaccination. From November
2005 through April 2006, participants reported the occurrence
of illnesses with 2 or more respiratory or systemic signs or symptoms, and throat swab specimens were collected for influenza
isolation and identification.
Vaccines and placebos. Both the inactivated vaccine (Fluzone; Sanofi Pasteur) and the live attenuated vaccine (FluMist;
MedImmune) were licensed for use during the 2005–2006 influenza season. Each 0.5-mL dose of Fluzone for intramuscular administration was formulated to contain 15 g hemagglutinin
from each of the following strains: A/New Caledonia/20/99
(H1N1), A/New York/55/2004 (H3N2) [A/California/7/2004
like], and B/Jiangsu/10/2003 [B/Shanghai/361/2002 like]. Each
0.5-mL dose of FluMist for intranasal administration was formulated to contain a median tissue-culture infective dose of
106.5–107.5 live attenuated influenza virus reassortants of the
same strains.
Efficacy measurements. Symptomatic influenza-like illness
was characterized by at least 1 respiratory symptom (cough or
nasal congestion) plus at least 1 systemic symptom (fever or feverishness, chills, or body aches). Eligible illnesses also had to
have occurred during the period of surveillance-defined influenza activity. The predetermined primary outcome was development of symptomatic influenza A or B illness that was
laboratory-confirmed, either by isolation of influenza virus in
cell culture or by comparison of paired post-vaccination (preseason) and postseason serum samples that showed a 4-fold
increase in hemagglutination-inhibition antibody titer to a circulating influenza strain. Secondary end points included illnesses confirmed by identification of virus in real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays.
Laboratory assays. Laboratory tests were performed in the
influenza laboratory at the University of Michigan, School of
Public Health [7]. All throat swab samples collected during surveillance were tested in cell culture to identify participants with
culture-positive influenza and to define the period of local influenza activity. Throat swab samples obtained from participants
with symptomatic influenza-like illness were tested in real-time
PCR assays (Applied Biosystems) with primers and probes designed by the Influenza Division of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for universal detection of influenza A
and B viruses. All isolates were strain typed and evaluated for
antigenic relatedness to vaccine strains by the CDC Influenza
Division. Serum samples collected from all participants with
symptomatic influenza-like illnesses and serum samples from a
subset of randomly identified participants without similar illnesses were tested with the hemagglutination-inhibition assay to
measure the immune response to vaccination and for serologic
determination of influenza infection. The viral antigens used in
the assay represented the virus strains present in the vaccines
plus the circulating A (H3N2) variant, A/Wisconsin/67/2005
[8].
Statistical analysis. Absolute and relative efficacy were estimated by calculation of the relative risk of laboratoryconfirmed symptomatic influenza in each vaccine group, compared with the placebo group, and in one vaccine group
compared to the other, respectively, with calculation of exact

confidence intervals [7]. For the purpose of efficacy analyses, the
group who received injected placebo and the group who received
nasal spray placebo were considered equivalent and combined.
Point estimates of vaccine efficacy were calculated as follows:
(1  the relative risk)  100. Estimates were adjusted for participation in year 1 of the study (2004 –2005). Differences in the
proportions of reactions reported after vaccination between
each vaccine group and the matching placebo group were examined using Fisher’s Exact test. P  .05 or a positive lower bound
of the confidence interval for vaccine efficacy was considered to
indicate statistical significance. Statistical analyses were generated using the SAS (version 8.2; SAS Institute) and StatXact (version 7; Cytel) statistical packages.
Assuming absolute vaccine efficacies of 80%, the study was
planned to have statistical power sufficient to estimate efficacy
with a 2-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) with a positive lower
bound. Given a conservative attack rate of 5% for community
influenza, we estimated that we would need to enroll 1800 subjects.
RESULTS
Participants. A total of 2058 participants received study interventions during October and November 2005. Of 1247 participants initially enrolled in year 1 of the study (2004 –2005), 972
(77.9%) continued to participate in year 2; the proportion of
prior-year study participants did not significantly vary by intervention group (P  .76). In addition, 1086 new subjects were
enrolled in year 2 of the study and randomly assigned to a study
intervention. Participant characteristics were similar across intervention groups; the mean age of participants was 24.9 years,
1440 (70.0%) of the participants were 25 years old, and 1246
(60.5%) were women. There were 73 participants (3.5%) who
failed to complete all scheduled visits; loss to follow-up did not
significantly vary by intervention group (P  .76).
Reported reactogenicity. Table 1 compares the frequencies
of reported reactions for each vaccine group and the group that
received the matching placebo, similarly administered. Arm
soreness, arm redness, and muscle aches were all significantly
associated with receipt of the inactivated vaccine; trouble
breathing and red eyes, reported in other studies as ocular respiratory syndrome [10], were also associated with receipt of the
inactivated vaccine, but smaller risk differences were measured.
Sore throat and runny nose or congestion were the only reactions significantly associated with receipt of the live attenuated
vaccine.
Serious Adverse Events. A total of 3 serious adverse events
occurred among participants within 30 days after receipt of
study interventions, and 18 additional events occurred during
Table 1. Local and systemic reactions reported by 1917 participants in the 2005–2006 study within 7 days after receipt of study
interventions.

the next 6 months that participants were followed up. Only 1
adverse event— hospitalization for viral meningitis after receipt
of the live attenuated vaccine—was considered to be possibly
related to the study intervention.
Immune response to vaccine. Serum samples collected
from all 526 participants who developed symptomatic influenzalike illness and serum samples from a subset of 480 participants
who did not develop similar illnesses (1006 [49%] of 2058 participants) were tested with the hemagglutination-inhibition assay. Comparison of paired serum samples collected before vaccination and 30 days after vaccination showed a 4-fold
increase in hemagglutination-inhibition antibody titer to an influenza strain in the following groups: 341 participants (76.5%)
who received inactivated vaccine and 88 participants (20.4%)
who received live attenuated vaccine, to the A/H3 vaccine strain
(P  .001); 333 participants (74.7%) who received inactivated
vaccine and 118 participants (27.4%) who received live attenuated vaccine, to the A/H3 variant that circulated in 2005–2006
(P  .001); 230 participants (51.6%) who received inactivated
vaccine and 42 participants (9.7%) who received live attenuated
vaccine, to the A/H1 vaccine strain (P  .001); and 255 participants (57.2%) who received inactivated vaccine and 86 participants (20.0%) who received live attenuated vaccine, to the type B
vaccine strain.
Studywide influenza activity. Among the reported illnesses, 621 illness episodes that occurred in 526 participants
(25.6%) met the criteria and qualified as symptomatic influenzalike illness cases. Influenza A (H3N2) circulated in the study area
from early January through mid-April; influenza type B also circulated, but at very low levels. This situation was similar to that
observed nationally and in the state as a whole [8, 11].
Laboratory-confirmed symptomatic influenza. Of 526
participants with symptomatic influenza-like illness, 24 (4.6%)
had culture-confirmed influenza. All 23 isolates recovered from
participants with culture-confirmed influenza A were straintyped as the A (H3N2) circulating variant, A/Wisconsin/67/2005
[8]. The single influenza B isolate recovered was strain-typed as
B/Ohio/01/2005 like, part of the Victoria lineage not included in
the vaccine. Thirty-two participants (6.1%) with symptomatic
influenza-like illness had PCR-confirmed influenza; 31 of the
confirmed illnesses were type A (H3N2) and 1 was type B. Fortyseven participants (8.9%) with symptomatic influenza-like illness had serologic evidence of influenza infection; 46 were serologically confirmed as type A (H3N2) and 1 was type B.
Vaccine efficacies. Influenza virus was identified by culture
or PCR in only 6 participants (1.8%) in the placebo group (table
2). Given the lower than expected attack rate, for these end
points the study was underpowered to measure statistically significant vaccine efficacy. The absolute efficacy of the inactivated
vaccine was 23% (95% CI, 153% to 73%) for both the “virus
isolation in culture” end point and the “real-time PCR identification” end point; absolute efficacy was 16% (95% CI, 171%
to 70%) for the combined “virus isolation and/or real-time PCR
identification” end point. The absolute efficacy of the live attenuated vaccine was 8% (95% CI, -194% to 67%) for end points
that considered PCR results, but it was 61% (95% CI, 48% to
89%) for the virus isolation end point.
The attack rate in the placebo group increased to 4.7% when
we added cases in which infection was identified by serologic
testing, resulting in increased statistical power. The absolute efficacy of the inactivated vaccine was 54% (95% CI, 4%–77%) for
the primary study end point—virus isolation in culture and/or
increase in antibody titer. The absolute efficacy of the live attenuated vaccine for the primary end point was slightly less, at 43%
(95% CI, 15% to 71%), but not statistically greater than that of
the placebo.
DISCUSSION
In 2004 –2005, the first year of our ongoing study, subject enrollment fell short of projected targets; however, the influenza season was a typical one, with various indicators above epidemic
threshold levels [3]. A drifted type A (H3N2) virus, A/California/
07/2004, and type B viruses of both lineages circulated. In our
study in that year, the attack rate in the placebo group as measured by virus isolation and/or real-time PCR identification was
7.8%, and thus we had sufficient statistical power to assess the
significant efficacy of either vaccine against placebo. The vaccine
efficacy for this combined end point was 75% (95% CI, 42%–
90%) for the inactivated vaccine and 48% (95% CI, 7% to
74%) for the live attenuated vaccine [7].
In 2005–2006, more participants than projected were enrolled; however, the influenza season was protracted and of low
intensity. Attack rates in the placebo group, as determined by
virus isolation and/or real-time PCR identification, were only
1.8%—far lower than expected in most years [8]. With such low
attack rates, statistically significant reductions produced by vaccine were difficult to demonstrate, and in fact, neither vaccine
showed significant benefit over placebo for the “virus isolation
and/or real-time PCR identification” end points. The primary
end point (which was determined when the Investigational New
Drug agreement under which the study was carried out was approved)—virus isolation combined with serologic identification
of infection—produced an attack rate in the placebo group of
4.7%, and higher efficacy of the vaccines was demonstrated. The
absolute efficacy of the inactivated vaccine was 54% and significantly greater than that of the placebo, whereas the absolute
efficacy of the live attenuated vaccine was modestly less. Interpretation of efficacy estimates using serologic end points must be
approached with caution; it is known that, for several reasons,
they will favor the inactivated vaccine over the live attenuated
vaccine [12, 13].
In 2004 –2005, the live attenuated vaccine performed less well
than the inactivated vaccine when each was compared with the

placebo group, but in the second year of the study there was little
evidence of a difference. How can this be explained? First, in
contrast to the first year, the low attack rates in 2005–2006 made
statistically significant reductions produced by either vaccine
difficult to demonstrate. Second, in the first year, the differences
between the 2 vaccines appeared to be related, in part, to differences in efficacy against type B influenza, with the live attenuated
vaccine performing less well; the 2005–2006 season did not offer
an opportunity to test efficacy against type B influenza. Likewise,
the type A/H3 virus circulating in the first year of the study was
drifted from the vaccine strain, whereas in the second year of the
study, the circulating virus was similar to the vaccine strain. Finally, it is possible that there was variable susceptibility to the live
attenuated vaccine virus at the time of vaccination in year 1 of
the study, compared with year 2; for example, the A/H3 vaccine
virus in 2004 –2005 was similar to the Fujian strain, a virus that
had caused major outbreaks during the previous year [14].
With the low attack rate in 2005–2006, the efficacy estimates
were unstable and varied with the particular laboratory criteria
that were used. Still, we did demonstrate continuing efficacy at
least for the inactivated vaccine. Because vaccine efficacy can
change from year to year and because, given the experience in the
previous year, efficacy may not be consistently related to drift,
further evaluation of vaccines in different situations is warranted. In particular, it is important to determine additional correlates of protection, of which serologic antibody titer is only
one. All of this will help to develop improved and perhaps more
predictably efficacious vaccines.
