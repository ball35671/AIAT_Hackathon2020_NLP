Abstract—Background: A potential link between the recombinant hepatitis B vaccine and an increased risk of multiple
sclerosis (MS) has been evaluated in several studies, but some of them have substantial methodologic limitations.
Methods: The authors conducted a nested case-control study within the General Practice Research Database (GPRD) in
the United Kingdom. The authors identified patients who had a first MS diagnosis recorded in the GPRD between
January 1993 and December 2000. Cases were patients with a diagnosis of MS confirmed through examination of medical
records, and with at least 3 years of continuous recording in the GPRD before their date of first symptoms (index date). Up
to 10 controls per case were randomly selected, matched on age, sex, practice, and date of joining the practice. Information
on receipt of immunizations was obtained from the computer records. Results: The analyses include 163 cases of MS and
1,604 controls. The OR of MS for vaccination within 3 years before the index date compared to no vaccination was 3.1 (95%
CI 1.5, 6.3). No increased risk of MS was associated with tetanus and influenza vaccinations. Conclusions: These findings
are consistent with the hypothesis that immunization with the recombinant hepatitis B vaccine is associated with an
increased risk of MS, and challenge the idea that the relation between hepatitis B vaccination and risk of MS is well
understood.

More than 350 million people worldwide are chronically infected with the hepatitis B virus. Of these, 65
million will die from cirrhosis or liver cancer.1 The
hepatitis B vaccine is over 95% effective in preventing chronic hepatitis B infection, and it is the first
vaccine against a major human cancer.1 It has also
been considered one of the safest vaccines ever produced.2,3 The World Health Organization recommends that hepatitis B vaccine be integrated into
national immunization programs, and over 140 countries have done so.
In 1996, about 200 cases of CNS demyelinating
disorders following hepatitis B vaccination were reported to the French pharmacovigilance system,4 and
two years later the French government suspended
routine immunization of preadolescents in schools.2
The potential link between vaccination against
hepatitis B and an increased risk of multiple sclerosis (MS) or demyelinating disease has since been
evaluated in several studies.5-11 Most studies were
consistent with a null association between the vaccine and MS, but some of them had methodologic
limitations that include retrospective ascertainment
of vaccination status, use of date of diagnosis or an
imprecise date of first symptoms of MS, and small
sample size. We adopted a nested case-control approach to evaluate the association between recombinant hepatitis B vaccination and risk of MS in a
prospectively followed British population.
Methods. Study population. The General Practice Research
Database (GPRD) includes over 3 million Britons who are enrolled
with selected general practitioners (GPs).12 These physicians have
been trained to record their patients’ medical and demographic
information in a standard manner, and have agreed to supply it
anonymously for research purposes. In addition, practices used in
this study agree to collaborate in specific research projects by
providing photocopies of their patients’ paper medical records after personal identifiers have been removed. The information recorded in the GPRD includes drug prescriptions, which are
computer-generated by the physicians (using the VAMP software)
and automatically transcribed into the computer record (according
to a coded drug dictionary based on the United Kingdom Prescription Pricing Authority), vaccines, medical diagnoses, which are
entered using a classification compatible with the International
Classification of Diseases (ICD), and demographic information.
The information on drug exposure, vaccinations, and diagnoses
recorded in the GPRD has been found to be of satisfactory quality
for drug safety studies.13,14
Case ascertainment. Case ascertainment was conducted in
two stages. In the first stage, we selected individuals of all ages
with a first diagnosis of MS (ICD code 340.0) recorded in the
database between January 1, 1993, and December 31, 2000. We

then reviewed each computer record to assign a date of first symptoms to each individual. In the second stage, we contacted the GPs
of these potential MS patients and requested photocopies of all
MS-related paper records available in the GP’s office, including all
consultations, specialist referrals, test results, and hospital discharges. Paper records cover a longer period, often from birth or
childhood, than computer records. Two physician investigators
(M.A.H., M.J.O.) reviewed the paper medical records independently and blinded to the computerized exposure information,
filled out a questionnaire including information on symptoms and
diagnostic procedures, and classified the patients into MS, possible MS, or no MS diagnosis according to standardized research
criteria.15,16 To determine the onset of symptoms of MS we used
the symptoms and criteria proposed by Poser.17 Discrepancies
were discussed until a consensus was reached. Our review of
medical records confirmed 438 (61.4%) of the 713 first-stage cases
as cases of MS with a first diagnosis on or after January 1, 1993.
The remaining 275 subjects were not confirmed because 1) they
had a diagnosis of possible MS (59) or prevalent MS (83 cases
diagnosed before January 1, 1993) or 2) they did not have MS (52),
or medical records could not be obtained because the patient had
transferred out to another practice (71) or died (10). Ninety-eight
percent of the confirmed cases had been seen and diagnosed by a
neurologist in the United Kingdom, and 85% of the diagnoses
were supported by a positive result on MRI. The date of first
symptoms retrieved from the computer records was, on average,
24 months later than the date of first symptoms retrieved from
the paper records. The earliest date of first symptoms was assigned to each case.
Of the 438 MS cases, 282 had their first symptoms after their
first computer recorded medical information, and 163 had their
first symptoms at least 3 years after their first computer recorded
medical information.
Study design. We carried out a case-control study nested
within the GPRD cohort. Cases were patients in the GPRD with a
confirmed diagnosis of MS between January 1, 1993, and December 31, 2000, and with at least 3 years of continuous recording in
the database before their date of first MS symptoms. Up to 10
controls per case were randomly selected, matched on age (1
year), sex, practice, and date of joining the practice (1 year).
Controls had to be alive, be free of an MS diagnosis, be present in
the database at the index date, and have at least 3 years of
continuous recording in the database before the date of first symptoms of their corresponding case (the index date).
Because some previous studies used date of diagnosis of MS (as
opposed to date of first symptoms of MS), for comparison purposes
we conducted a second nested case-control study in which up to 10
controls per case were randomly selected as described in the previous paragraph, using the date of diagnosis as the index date.
Vaccinations assessment. Exposure to hepatitis B vaccine was
determined from the computerized medical records. Subjects were
classified as never or ever vaccinated during the 3 years before the
index date. We also classified them by the time they received their
last immunization (never, 0 to 1, 1 to 2, 2 to 3 years before
index date) and by the number of immunizations received (0, 1 to
2, 3 or more) during the 3 years before the index date. We also
extracted information on vaccination against tetanus and influenza, the two most common vaccinations in this population.
Statistical methods. We used conditional logistic regression to
estimate OR and their 95% CI, adjusted for the matching factors.
Under our design, the OR is a consistent estimator of the incidence rate ratio of MS in vaccinated vs unvaccinated subjects.
Statements about statistical significance refer to the conventional
(and arbitrary) 0.05 cutoff.
Human subjects. This research was approved by the Human
Subjects Committee of the Harvard School of Public Health, and
by the Scientific and Ethical Advisory Group of the GPRD.
Results. Our analyses included 163 MS cases and 1,604
matched controls (table 1). All vaccinated cases were over
18 years of age at first symptoms. One unvaccinated case
was 16 years of age at first symptoms.
The proportion of cases that received at least one hepatitis B immunization during the 3 years before the date of
first symptoms was 6.7%, compared with 2.4% of controls
(table 2). The OR of MS for vaccination vs no vaccination
was 3.1 (95% CI 1.5, 6.3). No increase in the risk of MS
was observed for vaccination against influenza and tetanus (see table 2).
These results did not materially change after adjustment for smoking, and did not vary significantly by sex,
age (40, 40 or more years), calendar time (1988 to 1994,
1995 to 2000), clinical course of the disease (relapsingremitting or progressive), and type of first symptoms (eye
symptoms, sensory symptoms, other). The OR (95% CI) of
MS for vaccination vs no vaccination was 2.4 (1.2, 4.8)

when the analysis included possible MS cases (188 cases
and 1,838 controls), and 2.6 (1.2, 5.4) when the analysis
was restricted to subjects without known indications for
hepatitis B vaccination, i.e., occupational risk of hepatitis
B infection, or history of alcoholism, drug abuse, or chronic
renal failure/dialysis (159 cases and 1,576 controls).
The risk was greater, although not significantly, when
the last immunization took place within the second or
third years before first symptoms compared with the first
year before first symptoms (table 3). Greater number of
immunizations was not clearly associated with a greater
risk. The age at the index date was similar by case-control
and vaccination status. Specifically, the mean (SD) of age
was 37.0 (10.0) years for vaccinated cases and 36.1 (9.7)
years for unvaccinated cases (p value  0.76). The mean
(SD) of age was 34.9 (9.5) for vaccinated controls and 36.4
(9.7) for unvaccinated controls (p value  0.35).
The proportion of cases that received hepatitis B immunization after the index date was 1.2% compared with 2.3%
of controls. The OR of MS for vaccination vs no vaccination
after first symptoms was 0.5 (95% CI: 0.1, 2.1). When we
used the cases’ date of diagnosis as the index date, the OR
of MS for vaccination vs no vaccination within the 3 years
before the matching date was 1.0 (95% CI: 0.5, 2.1). The
mean (median) time between first symptoms and diagnosis
was 5.0 (2.7) years.
Discussion. We estimated that immunization
against hepatitis B was associated with a threefold
increase in the incidence of MS within the 3 years
following vaccination. Other common immunizations
were not associated with an increased risk of MS.
Our study cannot distinguish whether the hepatitis B vaccine hastens the onset of MS in persons
destined to develop the disease years later, or
whether it causes new cases of MS in susceptible
individuals. However, the similar age at first symptoms between vaccinated and unvaccinated cases
does not support the former explanation.
Elucidating the reasons for the association between hepatitis B vaccine and MS may eventually
contribute to a better understanding of the etiology
of MS, but any decision concerning hepatitis B vaccination needs to take into account the large benefits
derived from the prevention of a common and potentially lethal infection. It is also important to stress
that 93% of the MS cases in our study had not been
vaccinated.
The use of a nested case-control study minimized
the bias due to inappropriate selection of controls,
and the use of prospectively recorded computerized
vaccination records prevented recall bias. Other
types of differential misclassification of vaccination
history are also unlikely because exposure information was gathered prospectively before the first
symptoms of the disease. A certain degree of nondifferential (random) misclassification of vaccination
history is possible (e.g., a small proportion of persons
might have been vaccinated without their GP’s
knowledge), but its practical consequence would be
an attenuation of the association between vaccination and MS. As always in observational research,
confounding is a theoretical explanation for the association. Our analyses are therefore matched on and
adjusted for various known or suspected risk factors
for MS.
The use of computerized medical records is an efficient strategy to identify individuals with a diagnosis of MS. However, our approach was to combine the
use of computerized medical records to identify individuals with a diagnosis of MS with the retrieval and
review of paper medical records to determine their
date of first symptoms, since we found that the computer records did not provide sufficient information
to determine the subjects’ clinical history, including
date of first MS symptoms. An accurate determination of the date of first symptoms is important because, as we observed, the probability of hepatitis B
vaccination decreases after clinical onset of MS.
Thus, the use of dates that are posterior to the true
date of first symptoms may cause a downward bias
of the OR for acute exposures such as vaccinations.
Several case-control studies have evaluated the
association between hepatitis B vaccination and risk
of MS or demyelination (table 4). Two French studies
found about a 1.5-fold increase in the risk of a first
episode of CNS demyelination during the 2 months
following hepatitis B vaccination.5,6 In both studies,
the date of first symptoms was ascertained by review
of medical records, and dates of vaccination were
obtained retrospectively by questionnaire and phone
interview of the participants. Concurrently with the
first reporting of results from the French studies, a
preliminary assessment of the association between
hepatitis B vaccination and MS in the GPRD found a
1.6-fold increase (95% CI 0.6, 4.0) in the risk of MS
or demyelination during the 12 months following
hepatitis B vaccination.7 MS diagnoses and dates of
first symptoms were ascertained by review of computerized records only. More recently, a case-control
study in three North American health maintenance

organizations (HMOs) found a nonsignificant increase in the risk of MS or optic neuritis 1 to 5 years
after vaccination against hepatitis B, and no increase before 1 year or after 5 years.8 The date of
first symptoms was retrieved from medical records
and telephone interviews, and vaccination histories
included both vaccinations recorded in HMO records
and those reported in telephone interviews.
A case-control study nested in the Nurses’ Health
Studies did not find an increased risk of MS associated with hepatitis B vaccination in women.9 The
vaccination status was obtained retrospectively and
the analysis included only women who self-reported
never having been vaccinated in a questionnaire,
and those who self-reported having been vaccinated
and for whom vaccination certificates were available.
This design may cause selection bias leading to a
downwardly biased OR.18-20 Perhaps more important,
the date of first symptoms of the disease was retrospectively assessed by questionnaires sent to each
case and the current treating neurologist or
internist.
Two other studies did not find an increased risk of
MS after immunization against hepatitis B. A study
conducted in a database consisting of integrated
pharmacy and medical claims from six HMOs in the
United States found no difference in the 3-year risk
of diagnosis of demyelinating diseases between subjects vaccinated and non-vaccinated for hepatitis B.10
This null finding is consistent with our null finding
in the GPRD when we used date of diagnosis, rather
than date of first symptoms, of MS to define the
period of risk. An ecologic study compared the number of adolescents who developed MS before (1986 to
1992) and after (1992 to 1998) a school-based hepatitis B vaccination program was implemented in British Columbia, Canada.11 Nine out of 288,657
unvaccinated teenagers and 5 out of 289,651 vaccinated teenagers had first symptoms of MS, but the
unvaccinated had up to 13 years of follow-up,
while the vaccinated had only up to 7 years of
follow-up and therefore less opportunity to be diagnosed with MS.
The recombinant hepatitis B vaccine is a noninfectious viral vaccine derived from hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) produced in genetically
engineered yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) cells.
Although several viruses (e.g., Epstein-Barr virus)
have been postulated to cause MS, the hepatitis B
virus has not been prominent in the discussions of
viral triggers of MS.21 It is therefore unclear how a
recombinant vaccine that contains purified HbsAg, a
portion of the hepatitis B virus, could trigger the
immunologic processes that lead to MS. The vaccine
also contains an adjuvant (aluminum hydroxyphosphate sulfate), a mercury-based preservative
(thimerosal, eliminated from recent formulations),
and yeast proteins (up to 5%), but these components
have not been separately studied in relation to the
risk of MS.
