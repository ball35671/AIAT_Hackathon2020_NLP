SUMMARY
One hundred and nineteen volunteers were divided into five groups, and each
volunteer inoculated subcutaneously with an aqueous subunit B/Hong Kong/73
vaccine containing 40, 20, 10, or 5 /ig of HA or saline alone in a 0-5 ml volume.
The incidence of reactions was recorded 24 h after inoculation. One month
following immunization the serum HI antibody to B/Hong Kong/73 virus was
measured; each volunteer was inoculated intranasally with live, attenuated
influenza B (RB77) virus; and the incidence of infection by the challenge virus was
determined by HI antibody response.
The results showed that the incidence of reactions to all doses of vaccine were
relatively low, the severity mild, and the duration short. However, the incidence
of reactions was highest for those given 40 /ig HA and least for those given
5 /ig HA. The serum HI antibody responses to vaccine showed a dose-response
relationship. For volunteers given 40 jig HA, 22 (96%) showed a fourfold rise in
antibody titre and all volunteers had antibody titres of > 40 following immunization: for volunteers given 5/igHA the g.m.t. increased from 16-6 to 86*1; and
for those given 10 and 20//gHA the response was intermediate. Following
challenge, the lowest incidence of infection was seen in volunteers given the highest
dose of vaccine. However, all doses of vaccine induced some protection against
challenge virus infection, and the incidence of infection was directly related to the
serum antibody titre at the time of challenge. The 50 % protection titre of serum
HI antibody was estimated as 15 to 20.

agents. In addition, several types of influenza A vaccine have been developed and
tested, and shown to protect against natural disease (Stuart-Harris & Schild, 1976;
Kilbourne, 1975). Studies carried out on influenza B virus vaccines have been less
extensive, and it has been assumed that the results obtained in studies with
influenza A vaccines also apply to influenza B virus and vaccines. This may not
be fitting or advisable, since influenza A and B viruses have distinctive properties.
In particular, it has been reported that the haemagglutination-inhibiting antibody
response to infection or immunization with influenza B viruses is not a good index
of immunity to reinfection (La Montagne, 1980). Because of this and other
differences, the practice of using data obtained from experiments with influenza
A to standardize influenza B virus vaccines is questionable, and it is necessary to
establish the formulation of influenza B vaccines specifically and independently.
In the present study, the reactogenicity and serum haemagglutination-inhibiting
(HI) antibody-response of volunteers to graded doses of aqueous influenza B
vaccine was evaluated. In addition, 1 month after immunization all volunteers
were challenged intranasally with live attenuated influenza B vaccine to determine
the susceptibility of the volunteers to infection.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Virus and virus vaccine
Purified aqueous subunit vaccine was kindly prepared and supplied by Sandoz
Virusforschungsinstitut, Vienna. Briefly, influenza virus B/Hong Kong/73 grown
in embryonated eggs was harvested, pooled and purified by rate-zonal centrifugation; inactivated virus particles were treated with cetyl-trimethyl bromide
(CTAB) and the released haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) subunits
purified in linear sucrose gradients (Bachmayer, 1975). The subunit preparation
was diluted in saline to give vaccine containing concentrations of 40, 20, 10 and
5 ftg of HA per 0-5 ml dose; these concentrations of HA were determined by the
single radial diffusion test (Schild, Wood & Newman, 1975; Wood et al. 1977). A
control solution without virus antigen was also prepared. All vaccines were
supplied under code.
Live attenuated influenza B virus RB77, a recombinant of cold-adapted B/Ann
Arbor/66 and B/Tecumseh/77 and bearing the HA and NA antigens of the latter
virus, were used for virus challenge studies; this virus strain is very similar to
influenza virus B/Hong Kong/73. The virus was supplied in ampoules by Sandoz
Virusforschungsinstitut, Vienna, and used without passage in this laboratory. The
virus had a titre of 10™ 50% egg-infectious doses (EID50)/per ml, and volunteers
were each inoculated intranasally and dropwise with 0-5 ml of virus suspension,
as described previously (Potter et al. 1977; Jennings et al. 1978).
Experimental procedure
One hundred and nineteen student volunteers aged 18-19 years were recruited
from the Science and Medical Faculties of the University of Sheffield; all were in
good health, and none had allergy to eggs or egg products. A specimen of blood
was obtained from each volunteer and the haemagglutination-inhibition (HI)
antibody titro to influenza virus B/Hong Kong/73 determined. From these results

the volunteers were divided into five groups, each containing approximately equal
numbers of volunteers with similar titres of serum HI antibody. Volunteers in the
first group were inoculated by the deep subcutaneous route with 0*5 ml of aqueous
subunit B/Hong Kong/73 vaccine containing 40 fig HA; and volunteers in the
other four groups received 20 fig HA, 10 fig HA, 5 fig HA, or saline in a 0*5 ml
volume by the same route. The vaccines were all administered under code, and
neither the volunteers nor the inoculator knew which vaccine was given. Reactions
to immunization were determined from a questionnaire completed by the volunteer
24 h after immunization (Jennings et al. 1978). No reactions were reported after
48 h, but further questionnaries were not completed. One month after immunization a second blood sample was obtained from each volunteer to determine the
serum HI antibody response to vaccine. Subsequently, each volunteer was
inoculated intranasally with live attenuated RB77 virus. This virus vaccine in a
0*5 ml volume was inoculated intranasally and dropwise to volunteers lying flat
on their backs with neck extended. A final blood sample was obtained from each
subject 1 month after challenge to determine the serum HI antibody response to
the challenge virus infection.
Haeinagglutination-inhibiting (HI) antibody titrations
Serum samples from volunteers were coded and forwarded to the National
Institute of Biological Standardization and Control for haemagglutinationinhibiting (HI) antibody assays: these were carried out by standard tests following
treatment with cholera filtrate (Philips-Duphar-B.V.) for 18 h at 37 °C, and
subsequently heating at 56 °C for 1 h (W.H.O., 1953). Reference antisera were
included in each test to standardize the test sensitivity.

and were analysed under three headings: these were local reactions of redness,
swelling or itching; local pain which was continuous or pain on contact or pressure;
and systemic reactions of fever, headache, insomnia, or muscle pain. The results
were expressed as the number of reactions reported as a percentage of the total
number of possible reactions, and are shown in Table 1. For volunteers inoculated
with 40/jgHA of virus vaccine, 23*6% reported local reactions, 19-4% reported
local pain, and none experienced systemic reactions. For volunteers given
5-0 fig HA of virus vaccine the incidence of local reactions was 9*3 %, local pain 6*7 %
and no systemic reactions were reported. The results for volunteers given 10 fig HA
or 20 fig HA of virus vaccine were intermediate; and the incidence of reactions for
the four doses showed a clear dose-response relationship for both local reactions
and local pain (Table 1). In all cases reported reactions were mild in nature, of short
duration, and did not persist beyond 48 h post-inoculation.
Serum haemagglutinalion-inhibiting (HI) antibody response to immunization
The titres of haemagglutination-inhibiting (HI) antibody present in the serum
of the volunteers before and after immunization with various doses of aqueous
subunit influenza B/Hong Kong/73 vaccine are shown in Table 2. Of the
volunteers given 40 fig HA of vaccine, 21 (91 %) had serum HI antibody titres of
< 40 prior to immunization, and 22 (96 %) had antibody titres of ^ 60 following
immunization: for volunteers given 5 fig of vaccine, 17 (68%) had antibody titres
of ^ 1:40 prior to immunization, and 18 (72%) had antibody titres of ^60
following immunization. The results obtained for volunteers given 10 fig HA or
20 fig HA show intermediary responses. Thus, significant increases in serum HI
antibody titre were observed following immunization with all doses of vaccine
(Table 2). None of the 23 volunteers given saline experienced a significant rise or
fall in serum HI antibody titre to influenza B/Hong Kong/73 virus during the
period of observation. This indicated that no natural infections by influenza B virus
took place in the study population during the period of observation, and that rises
in serum HI antibody titre were the response to vaccine.

following immunization with varying doses of aqueous subunit vaccine are
summarized in Table 3. Twenty-two volunteers (96%) given 40 fig HA of vaccine
showed a ^ four-fold rise in antibody titre, and all volunteers had antibody titres
of ^ 40 following immunization. Following immunization the geometric mean titre
(g.m.t.) increased from 8-5 to 321-8. For volunteers given 5/tg HA of vaccine, 13
(52%) showed a ^ four-fold increase in antibody titre, and 19 (76-0%) had titres
of > 40 following immunization. The g.m.t. increased from 16-6 to 86*8 after
immunization. Again, the results obtained for immunization with 10//g or
20 fig HA of vaccine showed intermediary results (Table 3). The changes of serum
HI antibody related to the virus vaccine administered showed a clear dose—response
relationship: for volunteers given 40, 20,10 or 5 fig HA the g.m.t. or HI antibody
at 1 month after immunization was 321-8,152-6,137-6 and 86-1, respectively (Table
3). In addition, the extent of the increase in serum HI antibody was related to
the dose of vaccine administered: volunteers given 40 fig HA of vaccine produced
a 37.8-fold increase in serum HI antibody, and volunteers given 20,10 and 5 fig HA
showed 15*3-, 8-3- and 5-2-fold increase, respectively (Table 3).
Incidence of infection following challenge virus inoculation
Vaccine-induced immunity was measured 1 month following immunization with
aqueous subunit B/Hong Kong/73 vaccine by intranasal inoculation of all
volunteers with 1070
 EID50 of attenuated influenza virus RB77: this challenge
infection did not induce clinical symptoms in the volunteers, and a four-fold rise
in HI antibody titre to the challenge virus was taken as proof of infection. The
incidence of infection by the challenge virus in volunteers given different doses
of inactivated vaccine is shown in Table 4. Of the 23 volunteers immunized with
40 fig HA of B/Hong Kong/73 vaccine, no infections by the challenge virus were
detected: for the 24 volunteers given 20/tgHA of vaccine one infection was
recorded, and this occurred in a volunteer who had no detectable serum HI
antibody at the time of challenge infection. For volunteers given 10 and 5 fig HA
of vaccine, three (12-5%) and five (20%) infections were found; five of these
infections were in volunteers with undetectable levels of serum HI antibody, and
in two volunteers with low levels of HI antibody to RB77 virus. In contrast, of the
23 volunteers given saline, 15 (65*2%) were infected by the challenge virus; 13
(68*4%) of these infections wore recorded in those with no detectable antibody to
the challenge virus (Table 4). In total, of 35 volunteers with no detectable serum

related to pre-challenge serum HI antibody titre. Figures in parentheses indicate
number of subjects.
HI antibody prior to challenge infection, 54'2 % were infected, and the incidence
of infection declined as the titres of serum HI antibody in the volunteers increased
(Table 4). The relationship between the serum HI antibody titre and susceptibility
to challenge virus infection is shown in Fig. 1. The results indicate a clear
relationship; extrapolation from the graph indicates that the 50 % protection titre
of serum HI antibody to the challenge virus was approximately 15-20.
DISCUSSION
Although a large number of studies have been carried out using inactivated and
live influenza A vaccines, fewer studies have been performed with influenza B
vaccines. Moreover, the practice of translating data obtaining in experiments with
influenza A vaccines to the formation of influenza B vaccines, may not be justified,
since the latter virus has distinctive characteristics (La Montagne, 1980). Thus, the
dosage of HA to be included in the influenza B vaccines to induce a satisfactory
serum antibody response, and the level of serum HI antibody necessary to give
immunity to challenge-virus infection should be established separately for influenza
A and B viruses. In the present study, volunteers were immunized with graded
doses of an aqueous subunit influenza B vaccine. The vaccine was well tolerated
and even doses of 40 /*g HA produced only mild and transient local reactions, and
no systemic reactions were reported; questionnaires relating to reactions were
completed only at 24 h after inoculation but no reactions were reported after 48 h
in the volunteers, all of whom were questioned. The serum HI antibody response
to the influenza B/Hong Kong/73 showed a clear dose-response: thus, over 85%
of volunteers given 20 or 40 /*g HA of vaccine showed a four-fold increase in
antibody, the g.m.t. increased to > 150 and the increase in antibody was 15-fold.
In contrast, only 1C of 24 (66*7 %) of volunteers given 10 /ig HA of vaccine showed
a fourfold increase in antibody titre and the increase was 8-3-fold. The results
obtained for 20 jtg HA of vaccine were satisfactory, but this was not so for lower
doses. In addition , the serum response to the influenza B vaccine were lower than
those obtained for comparable doses of influenza A vaccine (Nicholson el ah 1979).

Challenge infections with attenuated RB77 virus resulted in no infections in
volunteers given 40 ng HA and only one (4*2 %) in the group given 20 /ig HA. This
was considered a satisfactory immunization. In contrast, for volunteers given 10
and 5 /ig HA three (12*5%) and five (20-0%) were infected respectively, and this
indicates a relatively poor response to vaccine. Thus, immunization with 20 fig HA
gave satisfactory protection against challenge-virus infection, and this result is
similar to that seen for immunization with influenza A vaccines.
Analysis of the results of the incidence of challenge-virus infection with reference
to the level of serum HI antibody showed that a serum HI antibody titre of 15-20
was consistent with 50 % protection by challenge virus infection. In similar studies
with influenza A virus, the 50% protective level of serum HI antibody was 30-40
(Hobson, Beare & Ward-Gardner, 1972; Meikeljohn et. 1952; Potter & Oxford,
1979). This finding may not indicate that less serum HI antibody is necessary for
protection against influenza B virus infection, but rather that the HI test is less
sensitive in detecting HI antibody to influenza B viruses than to influenza A. This
explanation is supported by the lower serum HI antibody responses seen following
immunization, and the relative insensitivity of the HI test compared to the single
radial haemolysis test in detecting antibody to influenza B virus, which is not seen
for antibody to influenza A viruses (Oxford, Yetts & Schild, 1982). In addition,
this would explain the finding of some studies that serum HI antibody titres are
a poor indicaton of immunity to influenza B infection. These present findings apply
only to influenza B/Hong Kong/73 virus vaccines, and the studies should be
repeated using other influenza B virus vaccines to determine if the results are
typical.
We wish to thank the student volunteers at the University of Sheffield for their
co-operation in this study. The studies were supported by a grant from the Medical
Research Council.
