Background. More efficient methods are needed to manufacture influenza vaccines. This trial compared the
efficacy of cell culture–derived influenza vaccine (CCIV) and egg-derived trivalent inactivated vaccine (TIV) with
placebo against laboratory-confirmed influenza illness in healthy adults in the United States, Finland, and Poland
during the 2007–2008 influenza season.
Methods. A total of 11,404 study participants aged 18–49 years were randomized equally to receive CCIV
(Optaflu; ), TIV (Agrippal; ), or placebo ( ). Each participant was observed during a n p 3828 n p 3676 n p 3900
6-month study surveillance period. Nasal and throat swabs for virus isolation and characterization were collected
from all patients with influenza-like illness. Vaccine immunogenicity was evaluated in a subset of 1045 participants.
Results. Efficacy of CCIV and TIV against vaccine-like (83.8% [1-sided 97.5% confidence interval [CI] lower
limit, 61.0%] and 78.4% [1-sided 97.5% CI lower limit, 52.1%], respectively) and all circulating influenza virus
strains (69.5% [1-sided 97.5% CI lower limit, 55.0%] and 63.0% [1-sided 97.5% lower limit, 46.7%], respectively)
exceeded the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research efficacy criteria. Immunogenicity of both vaccines
exceeded the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research licensing criteria. Both vaccines were well tolerated,
with similar safety profiles. Most solicited reactions were mild to moderate in severity and transient. No vaccinationrelated serious adverse events were reported; no withdrawals resulted from vaccine-related adverse events.
Conclusions. Both CCIV and TIV were effective in preventing influenza caused by vaccine-like and by all
circulating influenza virus strains, were well tolerated, and had good safety profiles. Both vaccines can be considered
for annual influenza vaccination campaigns.

Influenza virus infections are a major cause of respiratory illness, morbidity, and mortality in elderly people, very young people, and those with intercurrent
disease [1, 2]. Vaccination remains the principal control
for seasonal infections and is a core strategy in pandemic influenza preparedness. Seasonal influenza vaccines are typically produced from viruses propagated

in hen eggs. The supply of eggs is limited and obtaining them requires advance planning, potentially making rapid increase in production difficult in case of increased demand or a pandemic. The World Health Organization has recommended using established mammalian cell lines as alternative culture systems [3]. Cell
culture propagation offers assured availability of substrate for virus growth, which could increase flexibility
to meet shifts in demand [4, 5]. Three cell lines have
shown promise for vaccine production, Madin Darby
canine kidney (MDCK), Vero, and PER.C6. Vero cells
are used to produce poliovirus, rabies, and rotavirus
vaccines [6, 7]. A Vero cell–derived whole-cell H5N1
influenza vaccine has been evaluated [8], and the
PER.C6 line has been shown to yield influenza viral
titers sufficient for vaccine production [9]. In 2007,

the European Medicines Agency approved an MDCK cell culture–derived influenza vaccine (CCIV) (Optaflu; Novartis Vaccines) [10, 11].
Approximately 4000 doses of this CCIV have been administered to healthy adult and elderly individuals in 5 trials that
evaluated the safety and immunogenicity, compared with Novartis Vaccines’ European (Agrippal) or American (Fluvirin)
licensed trivalent inactivated vaccines (TIVs) [11–15]. CCIV
was as immunogenic, safe, and well tolerated as the TIVs; all
3 vaccine virus strains met European (Committee for Medicinal
Products for Human Use) and United States (Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research [CBER]) immunogenicity criteria for licensing [16, 17].
This trial (NCT00630331), conducted in healthy adults in
the United States, Finland, and Poland during the 2007–2008
influenza season, evaluated the clinical efficacy of CCIV (Optaflu) and TIV (Agrippal), compared with placebo, to prevent
laboratory-confirmed influenza. To our knowledge, this was the
largest randomized, placebo-controlled trial yet conducted to
evaluate the efficacy of inactivated influenza vaccines against
virus-confirmed influenza and the first to evaluate the efficacy
of a trivalent CCIV.
METHODS
Study design and objectives. This randomized, placebo-controlled, observer-blind trial evaluated the efficacy, safety, and
immunogenicity of influenza vaccination in healthy adults in
the United States, Finland, and Poland during the 2007–2008
influenza season. The ethics committee or institutional review
board of each center approved the study. Healthy individuals
were eligible if they could comply with study procedures. All
gave written informed consent before enrollment. Major exclusion criteria included a health condition for which inactivated vaccine is recommended, employment prone to influenza
transmission, influenza vaccination or laboratory-confirmed
influenza within 6 months of enrollment, history of GuillainBarre´ syndrome, a temperature of 37.8C and/or acute illness
within 3 days of enrollment, and pregnancy or breast-feeding.
Female individuals of childbearing potential agreed to continue
using a reliable birth control method. A urine pregnancy test
was performed on female participants before vaccination. Individuals aged 18–49 years were randomized equally, with use
of an interactive voice response system, to receive a single dose
of CCIV, TIV, or placebo. Influenza surveillance began 21 days
after vaccination. Each study participant was observed during the 6-month study surveillance period or for 6 months after vaccination, whichever was longer. Study duration was ∼9
months.
The primary objective was to demonstrate the efficacy, compared with placebo, of each study vaccine against confirmed
influenza illness caused by virus strains antigenically similar to
those of the vaccines. Secondary objectives included demonstration of vaccine efficacy against nonvaccine viruses and all
circulating strains and the safety and tolerability of each vaccine.
Influenza was defined as an episode of influenza-like illness (ie,
fever [temperature, 37.8C] plus sore throat or cough), with
subsequent laboratory confirmation of influenza virus. Seroprotection and seroconversion rates and antihemagglutinin geometric mean titers were determined on day 1 (baseline) and 3
weeks after vaccination in the first 1045 participants enrolled
at United States sites, who were randomized 8:25:2 to CCIV

nogenicity analysis.
Vaccines. CCIV and TIV (Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics) contained 15 mg of hemagglutinin per 0.5-mL dose of each
virus strain recommended for the 2007–2008 Northern Hemisphere influenza season: A/Solomon Islands/3/2006 (H1N1)–
like, A/Wisconsin/67/2005 (H3N2)–like, and B/Malaysia/2506/
2004–like. Vaccines and placebo (0.5 mL of phosphate-buffered
saline) were administered in the deltoid muscle of the nondominant arm. Only the vaccine administrator had access to
the randomization code.
Reactogenicity and safety. Study participants were monitored for 30 min after vaccination for immediate reactions.
Participants recorded the occurrence, duration, and severity of
local injection site (ecchymosis, erythema, induration, swelling,
and pain) and systemic (chills, malaise, myalgia, arthralgia, headache, sweating, fatigue, and fever [oral temperature, 37.8C])
reactions for 7 days after vaccination. Solicited reactions were
graded as follows: mild, no limitation of normal daily activities;
moderate, some limitation; or severe, unable to perform normal
daily activities. Unsolicited reactions were recorded for 21 days
after vaccination; serious adverse events were monitored for
the entire study.
Influenza surveillance. Beginning 21 days after vaccination, participants reported influenza-like illness symptoms, defined as fever (temperature, 37.8C) plus sore throat or cough,
as well as body aches, chills, headache, and runny or stuffy
nose, to investigators. Active influenza-like illness surveillance
was also conducted during weekly telephone calls from the call
center. Participants reporting influenza-like illness symptoms
underwent clinical evaluations; nasal and throat specimens were
obtained for laboratory confirmation of influenza virus. Because peak shedding of virus may occur during the first 24–72
h of illness [18], specimens were targeted for collection within
24 h after symptom onset, with a window of 120 h.
Laboratory methods. Combined nasal and throat specimens were evaluated for influenza virus (Covance) in RhMK
cell culture and by polymerase chain reaction testing (ResPlex
III Plus, Qiagen). Confirmation and subtyping of infected cells
was performed by fluorescence staining with fluorescein isothiocyanate–conjugated antibody against type-specific influenza anDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/cid/article-abstract/51/9/997/293487 by guest on 15 October 2019

tigens [19]. Further characterization of polymerase chain reaction–positive specimens was not possible.
The hemagglutinin viral titers were performed on influenzapositive cultures using a standard erythrocyte assay [19]. The
hemagglutinin titer was the highest dilution of virus to cause
agglutination. All specimens with hemagglutinin titers 1:4
were typed according to strain and evaluated for antigenic relatedness to vaccine strains at the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention. Isolates were considered to be vaccine matching if there was a 4-fold difference in the titer of the participant’s isolate and the vaccine strain against a reference antiserum. Nonvaccine strain isolates were characterized by an
hemagglutination inhibition antibody titer 1:8 against specific reference strain antisera.
Serum samples for immunogenicity evaluation were assessed
by hemagglutination inhibition assays against egg-derived vaccine A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and B-strain antigens at the Novartis
Vaccines Clinical Serology Laboratory. Serum samples were pretreated with receptor destroying enzyme to block nonspecific
inhibitors [20] and tested at an initial dilution of 1:10. The
hemagglutination inhibition titer was the highest dilution that
showed complete inhibition of hemagglutination. Negative samples were assigned a titer of 1:5.
Statistical analysis. Vaccinated study participants who were
evaluable 21 days after vaccination were included in the efficacymodified intention-to-treat population. The efficacy per protocol
population included those individuals who were evaluable during
the individual 6-month surveillance period. The vaccine efficacy
was estimated as (1 relative risk)  100, where relative risk
was the ratio of the percentages of vaccine recipients with influenza to placebo recipients with influenza (Pvaccine/Pplacebo). Vaccine
efficacy was assessed for significance versus placebo with use of
simultaneous 100  (1  a) Sidak-corrected 1-sided confidence
intervals (CIs) for the 2 relative risks, where . a p .025
The study population size calculation of 11,700 individuals
(3900 per group) was based on determining the vaccine efficacy
for each vaccine compared with placebo separately. Comparison
of the 2 vaccines was not planned. For a vaccine efficacy of
70%, a projected confirmed influenza attack rate of 3%, and
a 1-sided a of .0125, the power to reject the null hypotheses
that the vaccine efficacy was 40% for each of the vaccines
was 92%. To adjust for this double comparison, the Bonferroni
method was used to estimate the power. The analyses were
conducted using SAS software, version 9.1 (SAS Institute).
Seroprotection and seroconversion rates, geometric mean titers on days 1 and 22, and geometric mean ratios of geometric
mean titers on days 1 and 22 were calculated. Seroprotection
rates met the CBER immunogenicity criteria if the lower limit
of the 2-sided 95% CI for the percentage of seroprotected individuals was 70%. The seroconversion criterion was met if
the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for the percentage of
seroconverted individuals was 40%. The 95% CIs were calculated using the Clopper-Pearson method.
RESULTS
Study participants. A total of 11,404 participants were randomized, 11,382 were vaccinated, and 10,844 (95%) completed
the study (Figure 1). Overall, 560 participants withdrew from
the study: 206 in the CCIV group, 166 in the TIV group, and
188 in the placebo group. One participant in the CCIV group
withdrew after an adverse event (head injuries), and 4 died, 2
in the CCIV and 1 each in the TIV and placebo groups. None
of these events was judged as related to study treatment. The
most frequent reason for withdrawal was loss to follow-up,
which occurred at a rate of 5% in the CCIV and 4% in the
TIV and placebo groups. Less than 1% of the participants in
each group withdrew for other reasons (eg, withdrawal of consent, inappropriate enrollment, protocol violation, and inability to classify). A total of 11,301 study participants who were
vaccinated (3791, 3648, and 3862 in the CCIV, TIV, and placebo groups, respectively) were evaluable 21 days after vaccination and were included in the efficacy-modified intenDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/cid/article-abstract/51/9/997/293487 by guest on 15 October 2019

rus was confirmed in 25% (CCIV), 22% (TIV), and 44% (placebo) of those influenza-like illness case samples.
A total of 231 influenza cases were caused by all circulating
strains (ie, vaccine-like, non–vaccine-like, and untyped), including 140 of 3843 in the placebo group, 42 of 3776 in the
CCIV group, and 49 of 3638 in the TIV group (vaccine efficacy
of 69.5% [1-sided 97.5% CI lower limit, 55.0%] and 63.0% [1-
sided 97.5% CI lower limit, 46.7%], respectively). The placebo
attack rate was 3.64% (Table 2). For all circulating strains, the
vaccine efficacies against the A/H1N1 strains were 89.3% (1-
sided 97.5% CI lower limit, 73.0%) for the CCIV and 81.5%
(1-sided 97.5% CI lower limit, 60.9%) for the TIV groups, with
efficacies of 75.6% (1-sided 97.5% CI lower limit, 35.1%) and
49.3% (1-sided 97.5% CI lower limit, 9.0%) against A/H3N2
strains and 49.9% (1-sided 97.5% CI lower limit, 18.2%) and
53.2% (1-sided 97.5% CI lower limit, 22.2%) against B strains,
respectively. B strains predominated among the nonvaccine
strains, causing all but 1 of the 116 cases of confirmed B strain
influenza.
Overall, 60 influenza cases were caused by vaccine-like strains,
including 44 of 3843 in the placebo group, 7 of 3776 in the CCIV
group, and 9 of 3638 in the TIV group (Table 2). The overall
vaccine efficacy was 83.8% (1-sided 97.5% CI lower limit,
61.0%) for the CCIV and 78.4% (1-sided 97.5% CI lower limit,
52.1%) for the TIV group. An A/H1N1 virus was isolated from
56 of 60 cases, including 43 in the placebo group, 5 in the
CCIV group (vaccine efficacy, 88.2%), and 8 in the TIV group
(vaccine efficacy, 80.3%). Three cases were caused by vaccinelike H3N2 strains and only 1 by a vaccine-like B strain.
There were 134 culture-confirmed influenza cases caused by
non–vaccine-like strains, including 74 of 3843 in the placebo
group, 30 of 3776 in the CCIV group, and 29 of 3638 in the
TIV group, giving vaccine efficacies of 58.7% (1-sided 97.5%
CI lower limit, 33.5%) for the CCIV and 58.6% (1-sided 97.5%
CI lower limit, 32.9%) for the TIV group (Table 2). Again,
most of these (115 cases; 85.8%) were caused by B strain viruses.
The overall and anti-A/H1N1 vaccine efficacies of each vaccine were highly significant, compared with placebo, for all
circulating and for vaccine-like strains, and the lower limits of
the 1-sided 97.5% CIs for vaccine efficacy of the CCIV and
TIV groups were well above the 40% predefined study objective
and CBER efficacy criterion. Only 43 influenza cases were
caused by A/H3N2, an attack rate of 0.65%, making reliable
vaccine efficacy estimation difficult. The vaccine efficacy point
estimate against influenza B was ∼50% despite a vaccine mismatch, but the 97.5% CI lower limit was !40%.
Immunogenicity. Baseline seroprotection rates, seroconversion rates, and antihemagglutinin geometric mean titers did not
differ among the study groups. Both vaccines were highly immunogenic, with postvaccination responses to type B slightly
higher in the TIV group (Table 3). Seroprotection rates, seroconversion rates, and geometric mean ratios before to after
vaccination for both vaccines and all 3 vaccine virus stains
exceeded both European (Committee for Medicinal Products
for Human Use) and United States (CBER) immunogenicity
licensing criteria [16, 17].
Reactogenicity and safety. The percentage of study participants reporting solicited reactions was similar in each group.
Most reactions occurred within 2 days after vaccination and
were transient in duration. The most frequent local reaction
was injection site pain, reported by 30%, 24%, and 10% of
participants in the CCIV, TIV, and placebo groups, respectively.
Erythema was reported by 13% of participants in each vaccine
group and by 10% given placebo (Figure 2). The most common

solicited systemic reactions were headache (15% in all groups),
fatigue (10% in the CCIV and placebo groups and 11% in the
TIV group), myalgia (12%, 10%, and 7% in the CCIV, TIV,
and placebo groups, respectively), and malaise (8%, 7%, and
6% in CCIV, TIV, and placebo groups, respectively) (Figure 2).
Severe solicited reactions were reported in !1% of participants
in any study group.
Possibly or probably related unsolicited adverse events were
reported by 1%–2% of study participants on days 1–7 and by
!1% of participants from days 8–23; none were reported on
days 23–181. Three participants in the CCIV group and 1 each
in the TIV and placebo groups withdrew after adverse events
that were not considered to be related to vaccination. Four
deaths occurred, 2 in the CCIV group and 1 each in the TIV
and the placebo groups (all of which were judged unrelated to
the study vaccines). The remaining 127 serious adverse events
(42 participants in the CCIV group, 35 in the TIV group, and
38 in the placebo group) were determined by the investigator
to be unrelated to the study vaccine. No individuals withdrew
from the study because of a vaccine-related adverse event.
DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this was the largest randomized, placebocontrolled trial yet conducted to evaluate the efficacy of inactivated influenza vaccines and the first to evaluate the efficacy
of a vaccine produced using a continuous cell culture system.
The study was designed to demonstrate the efficacy of CCIV
and TIV separately against placebo, an approach taken to decrease the size of the required placebo group, thus reducing
the number of participants potentially developing influenza.
The total number of 785 (7%) of 11,257 participants who reported influenza-like illness symptoms was consistent with influenza surveillance data from Europe and the United States
for the 2007–2008 influenza season [21, 22]. The vaccine efficacies of both CCIV and TIV against influenza caused by all
circulating influenza strains and by vaccine-like strains were
highly significant, compared with placebo, and both exceeded
CBER vaccine efficacy criteria.
The vaccine efficacies of both study vaccines against vaccinelike influenza virus strains were consistent with results obtained
in healthy adults with conventional TIVs, which have been the
standard for many years. A recent meta-analysis of 48 randomized trials involving 166,000 healthy adults found that the overall vaccine efficacy was 80% (95% CI, 56%–91%) against influenza when the vaccine matched the circulating strain and
circulation was high but decreased to 50% (95% CI, 27%–
65%) when it did not match [23]. In this study, the vaccinematched strains were nearly all A/H1N1. However, most influenza cases were caused by type B strains that were not vaccinelike, and the vaccine efficacy point estimate against these nonmatching B strains was ∼50%. This reduced the efficacy against
all circulating strains. A large TIV trial conducted in Europe in
the 2006–2007 influenza season using surveillance similar to
ours found a comparable placebo attack rate of 3.2% and efficacy against culture-confirmed influenza of 66.9% (95% CI,
51.9%–77.4%), compared with placebo, against vaccine-like
strains and 61.6% (95% CI, 46.0%–72.8%) against any circulating strain [24].
Both CCIV and TIV were well tolerated. Only mild-moderate
injection site pain occurred more frequently in the CCIV group.
The safety results were consistent with previous studies of this
CCIV vaccine and with results observed in studies that compared
another MDCK-propagated CCIV and TIV [11–15, 25–28].
Both CCIV and TIV met all CBER immunogenicity criteria
for all 3 viral strains. The influenza B strain seroprotection
rates, seroconversion rates, and geometric mean titers were lower for the CCIV than the TIV group, but that was not reflected
by any differences in the B strain efficacy results. The immunogenicity results were in line with other trials of vaccines
propagated in MDCK cells and egg-derived controls [11–15,
25–28].
Influenza virus propagation in cell culture offers potential
benefits, compared with propagation in eggs. Most cell stocks,
including MDCK cells, can be stored frozen, and the supply
needed for vaccine production can be generated quickly [29].
Thus, the time between the choice of seasonal influenza virus
strains and availability of vaccine might be shortened to allow
a change in production and incorporate late emerging strains.
Importantly, cell culture could assist in providing supplies of
prepandemic and strain-specific pandemic vaccines more
quickly than is possible with egg-based systems alone [30]. Cell
culture avoids an egg allergy contraindication and, as a closed
system, carries a reduced risk of microbial or chemical contamination. Finally, MDCK cells adapted to rapid growth in
suspension media do not require microcarriers, enzyme treatment for subculture, or protein supplements to promote adhesion to a substrate [31].
This study has shown that CCIV (Optaflu) and TIV (Agippal), which have been in routine use in the European Union
and other countries, both exceeded efficacy and immunogenicity criteria as defined by regulatory authorities. Both CCIV
and TIV can be considered for use in annual influenza vaccination campaigns.
