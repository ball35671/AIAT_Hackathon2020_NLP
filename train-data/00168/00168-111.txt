As  a  result  of  these  experiences,  preg­
nant women have been placed in a priority category for the administration  of  vaccines in areas where influenza epidemics are antici­ pated.
Such a situation existed in  1962, when  a
recurrence of Asian influenza was antici­ pated, on epidemiologic grounds, during the winter of 1962-1963. The U. S. Public Health  Service  recommended  that  pregnant

This paper was presented at the General Sessions of the Annual Meeting of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, Miami, Fla., May 17-22, 1964. The study was originally supported by a grant from  Lederle   Laboratories,  Pearl  River, N.Y.
Submitted for publication  Jan. 30, 1964.
 
A review of the literature during the sum­ mer of 1962 failed to reveal any documenta­ tion of the  effectiveness  of  such  a  program for pregnant women, even though beneficial effects had  been  observed  among  children and adults in the 1957 epidemic14 of influ­ enza. Later in the  fall,  there  were  comments in the literature" on this situation. Moreover, early in 1963, a  report  based  on  serologic and clinical datarn  suggested  that  "There  is no indication that pregnant  women  are  a higher risk group," and  questioned  the  need for placing pregnant women in  a  priority group.
In view of the lack of documentation of the beneficial effect of immunization of preg­ nant women, and the question  of  its need, the following  investigation  was  undertaken.

METHODS  AND  MATERIALS
All ward-service patients who came to the antepartum and gynecology clinics from October 1962 to January 1963, were offered participation in a "Flu-Vaccine  Program." All  obstetric  patients,  including  those  with
 

830	Obstotrlcs  and
 

 
medical complications, were included. Gyne­ cologic patients were mostly seen for benign diseases; no patients with carcinoma were used in the control groups.
The program consisted of the withdrawal of 10 cc. of blood, the subcutaneous admin­ istration of  1.0 cc. of a polyvalent vaccine* containing  200  U.  A"  antigen,  a  repeated administration  of  1.0 ml. of vaccine  lmonth later, and the withdrawal of a second 10-cc. sample of  blood  one month  after  that. The investigation had been designed as a double­ blind procedure  to begin in September, but because of technical difficulties in manufac­ turing,  the  vaccine  was  not  available  until October, and the placebo  not  until Decem­ ber. The anticipated epidemic was imminent; therefore,  both  pregnant   and  nonpregnant patients  received  the vaccine  from October to  December;  from  December  to  January, saline   controls   were   administered.   Thus, there  were  4  groups  of  patients:  pregnant women   who   were	immunized,   pregnant women who received a placebo, nonpregnant (gynecologic) patients who were immunized, and  nonpregnant  women   who  received   a placebo.  Only one blood  (at the first inter­ view)  was  drawn from the placebo  groups, and only one injection offered.
In subsequent visits, the patients were asked if they had had a "sore arm," or "fever" the first 2-3 days after the injection, and whether or not they had to go to bed because of the reaction. After the winter had passed and epidemiologic evidence was avail­ able that the influenza outbreak was on the wane (April 1963), postcard questionnaires were mailed to all patients who had received the vaccine or placebo asking if they had ex­ perienced "the flu with fever."
If the patient did not return the card, or indicated that she had had the "flu," she was telephoned, the details of any illness dis­ cussed, and a judgment made as to whether or not this was  a true upper-respiratory  in-

fection with fever. Also, the number of days in bed due to the illness was asked and reported.
The population  studied  was mostly  from
the "hill" district of Pittsburgh, an area of low socioeconomic level with a largely Negro population. They represent the pregnant and nonpregnant female population living in crowded, poor conditions who therefore had the greatest chance of contracting and propa­
gating  an  outbreak  of  influenza.  Their  at­
tendance at antepartum clinics was irregular,
and although the patients' names, addresses, and phone numbers were obtained from them directly and every effort made to reach these individuals by mail, phone, and direct con­ tact in the various clinics they attended, the drop-out rate in the study was high. In order to gather more information on the incidence of influenza-like symptoms in nonimmunizcd women for control purposes, all women at­ tending the antepartum and gynecology clinics in April who had not been part of the study were asked if they had been immunized the preceding  winter. If not, they also were asked if they had had "the flu with fever," and if so, how many days they had spent in bed. The ·results of this survey  were com­ bined with those from the original control groups.
Sera from  the  clotted  blood  were  stored
frozen until analyzed. A A"/Jap 305/63 antigen isolated during the outbreak in Alle­ gheny County was used in a complement­ fixation technic. Baseline and postimmuniza­ tion sera were divided according to whether or not the patients were pregnant.  These sera were then grouped according to the week of the month during which they were drawn,  usually  in  pools  of  35  aliquots  of
1.1	ml. each, and the pool analyzed for anti­
body titer. In addition, all postimmunization sera from immunized patients were analyzed individually.
To  extend  our  observations  of  the  anti­
body-titer levels of  the pregnant population throughout  the  winter,  pools  of  35  sera  a
 

week from patients registering with the ante­ partum clinic were obtained through the serology laboratories of the hospital from January on. The observations of antibody­ titer levels of the nonpregnant population were extended  by  analysis of  sera obtained
for syphilis detection from the Negro  15- to

virus was isolated and identified from a pa­ tient in an Allegheny County hospital on Feb. 10, 1963. This  A2/Jap  305/63  virus was used as antigen in all studies reported here. Several subsequent successful viral iso­ lations were obtained that month.
SEROLOGIC TITERS. The pooled sera from nonimmunized pregnant and nonpregnant women were analyzed with respect to anti­ body titers against A2/Jap 305/63 influenza antigen throughout the winter months. These titers are shown in Fig. 1 and  2. The titers in the nonimmunized population began  to rise as early as November and reached  a peak in February for both pregnant and non­ pregnant women.

This suggests that the Asian influenza was endemic in the community from late 1962 to February,   1963.
MORTALITY. Deaths in the county due to respiratory disease increased markedly in the middle of February, 1963, and reached a 6-year high for the week of Mar. 1-8; no maternal mortalities were reported. In the wake of the 1957-58 Asian influenza epi­ demic,  similar highs  had  been  reported.
ABSENTEEISM. Schools and businesses in the  county  reported  a  marked  increase  in
 

 
absenteeism  during  February   and   March, that subsided to  normal  winter  levels  by April.

SYSTEMIC SIDE EFFECTS. On return visits, patients were also asked if any reaction other than local pain was noted. If the patients indicated that they experienced malaise, they were asked the number of days spent in bed due to malaise following the injection. These data, presented in Table 2, indicate that some

systemic  reaction  was  experienced   by  15-
20%  of the immunized  groups,  again about
twice the incidence reported  by Seltser, and
 
LOCAL  SIDE  EFFECTS.	These were evalu­
ated by direct interview of those patients re­ turning. Table  1 presents  data on local  ten­ derness  at  the  injection  site  ("sore  arm"). Of   patients   receiving   saline,   40%   com­ plained   of   pain.  Thus,  the  true  probable incidence of pain due to influenza  vaccina­ tion  is probably  closer to  83%  minus  40% or 43%  than the 83% reporting, or less than half the women receiving the injection. This is  still  somewhat  more  than  the  25 %  re-
 
that the risks of immunization on the average would include about half a day spent in bed because of malaise. The differences between our study and Seltser's are probably due to different reporting by the different popula­ tions, rather than to differences in the out­ breaks studied.

phone, or personal visit in April and asked if they had experienced influenza symptoms (defined as upper respiratory ailment accom­ panied by fever) during the winter. In addi­ tion, a personal survey of different patients attending the same clinics in April was un­ dertaken to supplement information on the incidence of influenza symptoms in the  non­ immunized  population.   These   combined data, presented in Table 3, show that  there were somewhat  fewer  immunized  patients who had influenza-like illness than non­ immunized. Also, there appears to be a decrease in number of days in bed due to influenza reported by patients immunized compared  to  those  not  immunized.  Those who  had  been  immunized  experienced,  on the average, less than half a day in bed, com­ pared to one day experienced by the non­ immunized  group.
Of more than passing  interest is the ob­ servation that the data of Table 3 seems to show a slight tendency for both the immu­ nized and nonimmunized  pregnant  patients to experience fewer and milder cases of influ­ enza-like illness than the nonpregnant. The numbers in the groups are too small to make these differences significant, but they suggest at least that pregnant women fare no differ­ ently from nonpregnant women during a flareup of an endemic influenza virus, whether immunized or not.
 
Sero/ogic Swdies
POOLED SERA. Figures  I and  2 present the results of analysis of pooled sera. These data show that patients immunized in Octo­ ber and November had a distinct antibody­ titer rise and peak in early January, a pattern different from the nonimmunized population. There was no difference in antibody response between pregnant and nonpregnant women, indicating that pregnant women's ability re­ sponding to antigen stimulation by a virus endemic in the community is no different from that of the nonpregnant.
INDIVIDUAL  TITER  RESPONSES.	Compari­
son of the pooled serum titers to both preg­ nant and nonpregnant  patients'  individual titers revealed essentially no difference in the pattern of rise and fall of antibody  response throughout  the winter  months.
Analysis of the individual titer responses with respect to length of gestation when im­ munization occurr d failed to reveal any pattern suggesting that the response was dif­ ferent in any trimester, or postpartum, indi­ cating that the stage of pregnancy had no influence on the response. Also, analysis of individual titer responses with respect to time bel:ween immunization and drawing of serum revealed that the peak antibody levels were reached on about the eighth to ninth week, at which time over half the individual titers

were  1:60 or  1:80, a pattern  similar to that in nonpregnant patients.
Finally, individual responses grouped ac­ cording to patients' ages again failed  to  re­ veal any pattern, suggesting  that  the  age  of the pregnant woman has little effect on her ability  to  respond  to  antigenic  stimuli.

Effect on Fetus
Some data  are available to shed light on the question of the effect of vaccination on the developing fetus. In the study, 19 women received their first vaccination before the twelfth week of pregnancy. Of these, infor­ mation as to fetal outcome is available on 13. All but one had normal term deliveries of infants with no congenital anomalies. One aborted a 5-month twin gestation 40 days after immunization. The length of time be­ tween immunization and abortion, as well as the increased occurrence of abortions in twin gestations suggest that there is no causal re­ lationship between the  immunization  and this abortion.

DISCUSSION
This investigation was designed to evaluate the efficacy and need of immunizing preg­ nant women. Certainly, the observations on antibody responses among pregnant women similar to the nonpregnant control groups establishes the comforting fact that pregnant women are able to respond to this type of immunization about as well as nonpregnant women. Age of the patient and stage of the gestation appear to have no effect on re­ sponse. Also comforting is the lack of fetal damage, expressed either in miscarriage or anomalies found after immunization in the first trimester. Thus, immunization with the current polyvalent vaccine during pregnancy appears to be as safe and serologically effec­ tive as immunization in the nonpregnant state.
ln considering a program of immunization
of  pregnant  women,  several  more  factors must  be  weighed.  This  study  demonstrates
 
that local reaction will occur in about half of the women receiving the vaccine, a medi­ cally unimportant but annoying occurrence. Also, about one out of 5 or 6 patients will experience malaise sufficiently severe that all immunized women run the risk of becoming bedridden for an average of about a third of a day due to malaise (Table 2)-again a minor but annoying reaction.
The benefits of immunization appear to be
debatable. The vaccine reduced the number of patients in the study who became ill with febrile upper respiratory diseases during the winter from 23% to 15%. The differences, however, were not found to be statistically significant. Moreover, recent reports of studies on the vaccine efficacy in men, women, and children in Baltimore, 11 and in children in Ohio,4 cast serious doubt upon the value of immunizing populations in an­ ticipation of outbreaks of endemic viruses, since in both studies the vaccinated groups experienced as much influenza-like illness as the nonvaccinated controls.
Analyzing  our  data  another  way,  non­
immunized patients ran a risk of about one day in bed due to influenza-like symptoms, whereas immunized risked 0.38 days, a sta­ tistically significant difference. To their risks, however, must be added the risks attending immunization. Since immunized patients run a risk of 0.4 days in bed due to maiaise (Table 2), they run a risk of 0.40 plus 0.38, or 0.78 days in bed, compared to an average risk of one day for the nonimmunized pa­ tient. These risks are not very different. These relationships are true for both the pregnant and nonpregnant patients, allowing at least the conclusion that pregnant women receive no more or no less benefit from im­ munization  than  do the  nonpregnant.
Finally,   the   question   must   be   asked
whether it is justifiable to place pregnant women in a priority category for receiving influenza vaccine. Observations of the mater­ nal mortality rates during the 1918 and 1957 outbreaks  of  influenza  support  this  view.
 

However, the data presented here do not in­ dicate that influenza is more serious among pregnant women than nonpregnant as meas­ ured by the number of patients contracting upper-respiratory ailments  and  the  number of days spent in bed due to these diseases. This is in keeping with the recent observa­ tion of Widelock, 10 who failed to detect any increase in maternal mortality due to influ­ enza after the initial epidemic in  1957.
The disparity between  the  1918 and  1957 epidemics  and  these  studies  of  subsequent ones can perhaps be resolved by postulating that  pregnant  women  may  respond  poorly to primary antigenic stimulation but normally to secondary stimulation. This hypothesis has been  suggested  by  observations  in  animals0 and   humans1   in   reactions   to   skin  grafts, where primary  grafts were tolerated  slightly longer than in nonpregnant  controls, but the "second-set"  rejection  phenomenon  was  as accelerated  as  in  the  nonpregnant.  In  viral vaccination  studies, the effectiveness of pri­ mary   immunization   during  pregnancy   ap­ pears to have been  slightly less than  in the nonpregnant,   as   measured   by   subsequent protection  from intracerebral  damage due to the St. Louis encephalitis virus in mice10  and antibody-titer rises against polio in humans.3 If this is true, it may explain why the initial epidemics  due to new  viral  strains  in  1918 and  1957 caused  such  morbidity  and  mor­ tality  among  pregnant  women-their   ability to combat the viral agent with antibody for­ mation having been decreased. In subsequent recurrences,	however,	pregnant	women would most probably  have been exposed to the  agent previously  and  would  handle  the infection as well as the nonpregnant. It may, then,  be  advisable  to  try  to  immunize  the pregnant population  during an outbreak of a new viral influenza agent, but in subsequent recurrences,  the  indication  for  immunizing pregnant women would probably be the same as for the nonpregnant  and would be based on the medical status of the individual.
 

SUMMARY   AND   CONCLUSIONS
In anticipation of an outbreak of Asian influenza, 363 pregnant and 138 nonpreg­ nant  women   attending   the   ward   clinics of Magee-Womens Hospital in Allegheny County were immunized with commercially available polyvalent influenza vaccine. Con­ trol groups received saline placebos or no injection. Data are presented to establish that there was an outbreak of Asian influenza in Allegheny County, that pregnant women re­ sponded to immunization both serologically and clinically in the same manner as non­ pregnant patients, that no unusual fetal wast­ age or anomalies resulted in first-trimester immunization, and that the benefits  derived by immunizing pregnant women are the same as those derived by immunizing nonpregnant.
Evidence is also presented from the litera­
ture to support the following recommenda­ tions: when epidemics due to new strains of viral influenza are anticipated, it may be ad­ visable for pregnant. women to have priority ratings in receiving vaccines. In anticipation of subsequent cyclic outbreaks due to recur­ rences of these viral agents, however, the indications for vaccinating pregnant women should probably be the same as those for the nonpregnant, based perhaps on the chronic medical status of the individual, since preg­ nant women appear to handle the endemic virus infections as well as their nonpregnant sisters.
