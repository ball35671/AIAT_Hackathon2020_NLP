Immunogenicity of 1967 Polyvalent and
1968 Hong Kong Influenza Vaccines
William J. Mogabgab, MD, and Eduardo Leiderman, MD
Influenza A2 vaccine containing 300 chick-cell agglutination (CCA) units per
dose of the Hong Kong variant provided a high degree of protection during an
outbreak of respiratory illnesses in military personnel in December 1968 and
January 1969. This inactivated chicken embryo-propagated virus vaccine stimulated hemagglutination-inhibition antibody responses that were equivalent to
natural infection. Polyvalent vaccine, 1967 formula, was not without some
contribution in preventing disease in those who did not receive Hong Kong
influenza vaccine. Influenza A2 comprised 56% of all respiratory illnesses
during the outbreak. Virus was isolated in rhesus monkey kidney cultures
from pharyngeal washings of a third of the individuals with serologic evidence
of infection by influenza A2.
The degree of antigenic change in the 1968
strain of influenza A2 virus indicated the ne¬
cessity for modification of the existing vaccine for¬
mula.1 Planned availability of unvaccinated military
personnel provided a population in which antigenicity and protective effects of 1967 military for¬
mula polyvalent vaccine and new monovalent 1968
influenza A2 (Hong Kong) vaccine could be evalu¬
ated and compared.2
Described herein are the immunogenic effective¬
ness of an experimental monovalent Hong Kong
vaccine and the degree of contribution of 1967
polyvalent influenza vaccine, each determined by
antibody responses and reduction of illnesses.
Materials and Methods
Population.-Three thousand airmen in training
at Keesler Air Force Base, Mississippi, 18 to 21
years of age, previously unvaccinated for influenza
during their military service, were given either
monovalent influenza A2 (Hong Kong) vaccine,
placebo, or 1967 polyvalent vaccine during the last
two weeks of November 1968. These men were
scattered randomly throughout dormitories, bar¬
racks buildings, and training programs.
Evaluation.—All respiratory illnesses were classi¬
fied as febrile (more than 101 F [38.3 C] or greater), afebrile (less than 101 F), pharyngitis, bronchitis,
or pneumonia, and whether or not the patient was
hospitalized. After vaccination, and for the dura¬
tion of the influenza A2 outbreak, pharyngeal wash¬
ings and blood specimens from approximately 20
men in acute and convalescent stages were obtained
each week. The men were selected in a random
fashion without regard to clinical category of their
illnesses. Respiratory disease rates and occurrence
of specific influenza A2 infections in all three groups
were determined. Observations were also made on
other trainees who were given 1967 polyvalent vac¬
cine at the same time.
Virus Isolation and Serology.—Pharyngeal wash¬
ings in 0.5% lactalbumin hydrolysate in Hanks'
solution, refrigerated and stored at -
60 C, were
inoculated into primary rhesus monkey kidney

ruses were identified with chicken
antiserum to influenza A2/Aichi

were done with serum samples
treated with receptor-destroying
enzyme (RDE) of Vibrio cholerae
and then heated at 56 C for 30

Results
Antibody Response Following Polyvalent Vac¬
cine.—In order to evaluate the ability of polyvalent
influenza vaccine to protect against the predicted
epidemic of Hong Kong influenza A2, hemagglutination-inhibition antibody responses were deter¬
mined in trainees and in seasoned men who had
been vaccinated annually for several years (Table
1). Antibody increments to the major component
of the vaccine, influenza A2/Taiwan 1/64 were
minimal in both groups, in part because of the high
initial antibody titers in all individuals. Potency of
this single component could not be determined.
This polyvalent vaccine did have some effect,
though not large, on antibody to influenza A2/
Aichi 2/68 as shown at the bottom of Table 1.
Thus, it seemed possible that some slight degree of
protection might be achieved by this vaccine.
Antibody Response Following Monovalent Hong
Kong Vaccine and Infection.—Levels of hemagglutination-inhibition antibody were relatively low be¬
fore vaccination and the amounts stimulated in
most individuals were appreciable (Table 2). The
responses were approximately the same order of
magnitude as those caused by natural infection as
shown in Table 3 but the final levels were higher in
the latter. The initial mean antibody titers of this
group were more than those of the vaccinated sub¬
jects because over half had received polyvalent vac¬
cine and two had had Hong Kong vaccine prior to
infection. It was also apparent that this single dose
of monovalent vaccine did not remove all individ¬
uals from the susceptible range, at least based upon
hemagglutination-inhibition antibody titers prior to
infection. Thus, a virus concentration of 300 CCA
units/ml appeared to be less than ideal for vacci¬
nation of this population.
Sensitivity of Rhesus Monkey Kidney Cultures
for Isolation of Hong Kong Virus.—During the epi¬
demic period, December and January, more than
200 pharyngeal washings from airmen with all types
of respiratory illnesses were inoculated into rhesus
monkey kidney cultures. Virus was isolated on first
passage from 25 of 78 (34%) with antibody re¬
sponse and one without sérologie evidence of infec¬
tion. Cytopathic effects were readily discernible and
hemagglutination titers with human type O erythrocytes of 1:64 to 1:128 were adequate for identifi¬
cation or antigenic characterization of isolates."
This system provided a practical and relatively
rapid method of recovering the 1968 influenza A2
virus.
Effect of Vaccination on Incidence of All Respi¬
ratory Illnesses.—Numbers and rates of respiratory
illnesses classified according to clinical types that
occurred during the influenza A2 outbreak at Kees¬
ler Air Force Base are shown in Table 4. Most of
these were afebrile upper-respiratory illnesses,
pharyngitis was second, and febrile diseases third.
Reduction in disease rates of each clinical type by
Hong Kong vaccine provides an index of the pro¬
portion of illnesses caused by influenza A2 virus in
each. Thus, the impact of influenza from a total
number of illnesses standpoint was larger in those
categories that did not exhibit the classical features
of the disease.
The disease rate reduction in the group that
received polyvalent vaccine was insufficient for sta¬
tistical significance at the 95% confidence level.
However, Hong Kong vaccine prevented enough
respiratory illnesses of all types to demonstrate ef¬
fectiveness even without identification of specific
influenza A2 infections. This might not have been
true if the attack rate had not been appreciable.
Prevention of Confirmed Influenza A2.—The in¬
cidence of infection by influenza A2 (Hong Kong)
virus as determined by hemagglutination-inhibition
with acute- and convalescent-stage serum samples
from airmen with all types of respiratory illnesses
as shown in Table 5. Polyvalent vaccine prevented
a considerable number of infections in the selected

group. In support of this observation were the sim¬
ilar results that were obtained from the other
airmen who had received the same vaccine simul¬
taneously (not in study). Based upon the difference
in percentages with sérologie evidence of influenza
in the placebo and polyvalent vaccine groups, there
was a protection ratio of 1.5:1 or a 35% reduction
in influenza A2 illnesses, but this was not enough
for significance at the 95% confidence level. Mono¬
valent Hong Kong vaccine in a single dose of 300
CCA units produced a considerably greater degree
of immunity in these individuals. Only two vaccine
failures were observed and the results were highly
significant. Comparisons of the serologically con¬
firmed percentages of influenza in the Hong Kong
and placebo groups reveals a protection ratio of
7.3:1, or an 86% reduction. Obviously, this was not
the most severe test of a vaccine since it was given
just before the outbreak and with sufficient time for*
antibody response. Also, the vaccine was antigenically like the epidemic strain. Nevertheless, the
dose was only three fourths of the standard 1968
licensed Hong Kong vaccine.1 Moreover, the vacci¬
nated men were interspersed in a much larger
group of persons experiencing a considerable rate of
infection even though most had received 1967 poly¬
valent vaccine.
Comment
Effectiveness of the monovalent vaccine contain¬
ing the 1968 influenza A2 Hong Kong variant was
predictable on the basis of the hemagglutinationinhibition antibody responses that were considera¬
ble and comparable to those caused by natural
infection.5 "
The vaccine had a relatively good immunogenic capacity even though it contained only
300 CCA units per dose. Because of the high inci¬
dence of infection (56%) in individuals with respi¬
ratory disease during the epidemic period, accurate
evaluation was readily obtained. Even the total
respiratory disease rate was sufficiently reduced
(42.8%) in the Hong Kong vaccinated group to be
statistically significant. The latter effect might not
have been noticeable with a lower influenza A2
attack rate.
Some protection from the 1967 polyvalent vac¬
cine was also expected, but with much less certainty
on the basis of its limited ability to stimulate
hemagglutination-inhibition antibody to the Hong
Kong type of influenza A2. Nevertheless, the place¬
bo group had 32 serologically confirmed influenza
illnesses, while those who received polyvalent vac¬
cine had only 15 illnesses.
The importance of maintaining carefully moni¬
tored populations for evaluation of influenza vac¬
cines should be obvious. Frequent antigenic changes
in influenza A and B viruses and development of
improved vaccines makes it mandatory that field
evaluations under controlled conditions be conduct¬
ed regularly.
