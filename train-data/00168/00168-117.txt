Objectives: To describe the uptake of 2009 A/H1N1 influenza vaccination among pregnant women and
determine if vaccination was associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes.
Study Design: A historical cohort study was performed using booking, delivery suite and neonatal unit
discharge records from the Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital, Dublin, Ireland. Singleton
deliveries to women pregnant before (December 2008–September 2009) and during the pandemic
(December 2009–September 2010) were included.
Information on vaccination status and type of vaccine was collected on admission to the delivery suite.
Logistic regression analyses were used to determine maternal characteristics associated with
vaccination. Pregnancy outcomes were compared for vaccinated and unvaccinated women, with
adjustment for differing maternal characteristics. Outcomes included vaccination status, preterm birth,
size for gestational age, neonatal intensive care admission, congenital anomalies and perinatal death.
Results: Of 6894 women pregnant during the pandemic, 2996 [43.5%] reported vaccination at delivery. In
the early weeks of the vaccination programme rates of over 70% were achieved. Of those vaccinated, 246
[8.2%], 1709 [57.0%] and 1034 [34.5%] were vaccinated in the first, second and third trimesters
respectively. Vaccination was less likely in younger age groups, those who were not in the professional/
manager/employer socioeconomic group, women from Eastern Europe, Africa and Asia/Middle East,
those who reported an unplanned pregnancy, women who booked late for antenatal care and recipients
of publicly-funded obstetric care. Irish nationality was associated with reporting vaccination. There was
no association between vaccination during pregnancy and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Women who
were vaccinated were less likely to have a preterm delivery than unvaccinated women.
Conclusion: 2009 A/H1N1 influenza vaccination uptake was influenced by maternal sociodemographic
factors. High vaccination uptake can be achieved in a pandemic situation. Future public health campaigns
should provide clear information on vaccination safety in pregnancy, ensure consistent vaccination
recommendations from healthcare professionals and provide easy access to vaccination in order to
optimise uptake rates in subgroups of the population who less likely to be vaccinated. There was no
association between vaccination and adverse pregnancy outcomes.

11 Introduction
12 Pandemic 2009A/H1N1 influenza infection appeared to increase
13 the risk of severe maternal morbidity and mortality and was
14 associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes [1–4], including
15 perinatal death [1]. Previous pandemics also demonstrated the risk
16 of serious adversematernal andfetaloutcomes [5].In order toreduce
17 the risk of such adverse outcomes vaccinations against pandemic
18 2009A/H1N1 influenza were licensed and recommended for use 19 during pregnancy [6]. In Ireland two vaccines were commercially
20 available and recommended for use in the national immunisation

25 Seasonal influenza vaccines have been administered to pregnant
26 women since the late 1950s [7], and the US Advisory Committee on 27 ImmunizationPractices (ACIP)has, since 2004,encouraged pregnant
28 women to be vaccinated against seasonal influenza regardless of
29 gestation [8]. Uptake rates of 2009A/H1N1 influenza vaccine varied
30 internationally during the pandemic with studies reporting rates in
31 pregnant women from as low as 4.7% to as high as 85% [9–11]. 32 Variations in international recommendations relating to the optimal
33 timing of vaccination in pregnancy, the selection of non-adjuvanted
34 vaccines for pregnant women and the need for seasonal influenza 35 vaccinationinpregnancyledtomediacommentaries, speculationon 36 vaccine safety and public anxiety.
37 Available data support the use of the inactivated influenza 38 vaccine during all stages of pregnancy, particularly for women with
39 medical conditions that may increase the risk of complications.
40 Reassuring pharmacoepidemiological studies have indicated that
41 2009A/H1N1 influenza vaccination is not associated with adverse
42 pregnancy outcomes including fetal death, preterm birth and
43 congenital anomalies [12–17]. Vaccination may have reduced the
44 risk of influenza-related fetal death during the pandemic [12]. 45 It is important to study the determinants of vaccination uptake
46 in pregnant women in a variety of settings, given the regional
47 variations that have been previously reported [18]. It is also
48 essential that extensive data are available on pregnancy outcomes
49 after gestational vaccine exposure in order to inform decisions on 50 vaccination by pregnant women and health professionals,
51 particularly during a pandemic situation. This study has two main
52 objectives. The first objective is to describe the uptake and
53 determinants of 2009A/H1N1 influenza vaccination in pregnant
54 women during the pandemic. The second objective is to determine
55 if there is an association between vaccination and adverse
56 pregnancy outcomes.
57 Materials and methods
58 The Irish pandemic flu vaccination programme began in early
59 November 2009 and ended on the 31st of March 2010 [19]. In the
60 initial phase high risk groups, including pregnant women, were 61 offered prioritised access to the vaccine. Vaccination was offered in
62 vaccination centres set up by the Health Service Executive, in
63 vaccination clinics run by the maternity hospital to coincide with
64 antenatal clinics and in primary care. Details of vaccination
65 provider were not available for this study.
66 All singleton deliveries during the study period were eligible for
67 inclusion. Data on maternal characteristics, medical and obstetric
68 history recorded at the antenatal booking interview and perinatal
69 outcomes recorded in the delivery suite and neonatal intensive
70 care unit were extracted from electronic hospital records at the
71 Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital in Dublin
72 (CWIUH). CWIUH is a tertiary referral maternity hospital serving
73 a diverse urban/suburban catchment area and delivering approxi74 mately 12% of all Irish births. The majority of women (approxi75 mately 85%) receive antenatal care in the public system. Antenatal
76 care may be delivered by an obstetric team within the hospital or it
77 may involve combined care delivered by an obstetrician and a 78 primary care doctor. The hospital also offers midwifery-led
79 antenatal care to low risk women.
80 Data on vaccination status was recorded at delivery from the
81 beginning of December 2009. The following questions were added
82 to the delivery suite admission form:
(1) 83 H1N1 vaccine this pregnancy? (Yes/No)
(2) 84 When given (1st dose) (1st trimester, 2nd trimester, 3rd
85 trimester).
(3) 86 Vaccine used? (Celvapan 1 dose, Celvapan 2 doses, Pandemrix,
87 unknown)
88 Preterm and very preterm deliveries were defined as delivery
89 prior to 37 and 32 weeks gestation respectively. Gestational age is
90 routinely determined from the first day of the last menstrual
91 period (LMP). The booking visit ultrasound scan estimate is used if
92 there is uncertainty of the LMP date or if there is a discrepancy of
more 93 than seven days between the LMP and ultrasound estimates.
94 Birthweight is measured by a midwife or paediatrician on the
95 delivery suite using electronic scales. Small for gestational age was 96 defined as a birthweight determined to be less than the 10th
97 centile customised for maternal weight, height, gestation and
98 infant sex [20]. Congenital anomalies were ascertained from
99 electronic records of any anomalies identified by midwifery or 100 paediatric staff on the delivery suite or from congenital anomaly,
101 body system or discharge diagnoses fields in the neonatal unit
102 electronic discharge records.
Descriptive 103 statistics were used as appropriate to describe
maternal 104 characteristics of vaccinated and unvaccinated women.
Univariable 105 logistic regression analyses were used to determine
106 odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for associations between
maternal 107 characteristics and vaccination. Cases with missing data
were 108 excluded from the logistic regression analyses. The levels of
missing 109 data for each maternal characteristic and pregnancy
110 outcome are indicated in Tables 1 and 2. 111 Pregnancy outcomes were compared between vaccine-exposed
women 112 delivering between December 2009 and September 2010
113 and two comparison groups. The first comparison group included
women 114 delivering from the beginning of December 2009 to the
115 end of September 2010 who reported that they had not been
116 vaccinated at the time of delivery (unvaccinated group). The
117 second comparison group included women delivering from the
118 beginning of December 2008 to the end of September 2009,
119 representing a time period prior to the mass vaccination
120 programme and the main wave of the pandemic (prevaccination
121 group). Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses
were 122 used to generate unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios
123 examining the association between vaccination and adverse
124 perinatal outcomes. The multivariable analysis included adjustment 125 for age band at delivery, socioeconomic group, region,
126 planning of pregnancy, booking gestation, public obstetric care and
127 smoking in pregnancy.
128 A separate univariable logistic regression analysis was carried
129 out to determine if vaccination was associated with congenital
130 anomalies after first trimester exposure with comparison to the
131 unvaccinated group.
132 The study was approved by the Hospital’s Research Ethics
133 Committee on 16th May 2012 (Study No. 3–2012).
134 Results
135 Vaccine uptake
Of 136 6894 women delivering between the beginning of December
137 2009 and the end of the following September, 2996 women [43.5%]
138 reported vaccination at delivery. The temporal distribution of
139 vaccination during pregnancy is represented in Fig. 1. Vaccination
140 in the first, second and third trimesters was reported by 246 [8.2%],
141 1709 [57.0%] and 1034 [34.5%] vaccinated women, respectively.
142 Celvapan1 was received by 1692 [56.5%] women, with approximately 143 half receiving a single dose and half receiving two. A single
144 dose of Pandemrix1 was received by 698 [23.3%] women, with a 145 further 606 [20.2%] women unsure of the specific vaccine used.
Maternal 146 characteristics of vaccinated and unvaccinated
women 147 are outlined in Table 1. Compared with women in the

148 25–29 age group, those between 30–39 years were more likely to
149 report vaccination. Vaccination was most likely in the professional,
150 manager and employer socioeconomic group compared to all other
151 groupings. There were regional variations in vaccination uptake
152 with women from Eastern Europe less likely to report vaccination
153 than those from Western Europe (odds ratio 0.21, 95% Confidence
154 Interval 0.17–0.25). Women from Africa and Asia/Middle East were 155 also less likely to report vaccination. Irish nationality was 156 associated with reporting vaccination (OR 2.25, 95% CI 2.01– 157 2.51). Women who reported an unplanned pregnancy were less
158 likely to be vaccinated. Those booking after 20 weeks were less
159 likely to be vaccinated (OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.39–0.62) compared to
160 those booking between 12 and 20 weeks’ gestation. Women who
161 received privately-funded obstetric care were more likely to report
162 vaccination (OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.25–1.63).
Maternal 163 and perinatal outcomes for the vaccinated and
164 unvaccinated groups are compared in Table 2. Adverse perinatal
165 outcomes did not appear to differ significantly between the
166 vaccinated group and the two comparison groups. In the
167 unadjusted analyses, vaccinated women were less likely to have
168 an elective caesarean section than the unvaccinated group.
169 Preterm birth (<37 and <32 weeks’ gestation) was also less likely
170 in the vaccinated women compared to the unvaccinated group.
171 This association was not found when the prevaccination group
were 172 used for comparison. Adjustmentfor maternal characteristics
173 that differed significantly between the vaccinated and unvaccinat174 ed groups including age, socioeconomic group, region, planning of
175 pregnancy, booking gestation, funding of obstetric care and
176 smoking with multivariable logistic regression analyses did not
177 alter the results. The adjusted OR for the association between

199 the vaccination programme. Of the women with known vaccine
200 type, the majority [70.7%] received the cell-line-derived, thio201 mersal free, non-adjuvanted product Celvapan1. Women who
202 were less likely to be vaccinated included those in younger age
203 groups, those who were notin the professional/manager/employer
204 socioeconomic group, women from Eastern Europe, Africa and
205 Asia/Middle East, women who booked late for antenatal care,those
206 who reported an unplanned pregnancy and those who received
207 publicly-funded obstetric care. Vaccination was not associated
208 with adverse pregnancy outcomes.
209 Strengths and limitations
210 This study was conducted in a large tertiary referral maternity
211 hospital that delivers approximately 9000 babies annually. Data on 212 maternal characteristics, medical history, vaccination status and
213 pregnancy outcomes were routinely collected by midwives using
214 structured computer-guided and paper questionnaires. Data were 215 available on a diverse group of women from a broad range of socio216 economic groupings. Virtually all deliveries during the study
217 period were included in the analysis, reducing the risk of selection
218 bias. This study also provided information on both adjuvanted and
219 unadjuvanted vaccines. The study results are likely to be general220 isable to women receiving antenatal care in similar hospital
221 settings worldwide, though international variations in vaccine
222 uptake are likely.
223 This study was limited by the inclusion of only one maternity
224 hospital. Current constraints imposed by the Irish Data Protec225 tion Act precluded a planned study including the three main
226 Dublin maternity hospitals which deliver 4 in 10 Irish babies.
227 Data were not available on the vaccination provider or the model
228 of antenatal care. Pregnancy outcomes were ascertained after
229 information on vaccination status was collected, this may have
230 potentially led to biased assessment of outcomes, however there
231 is no evidence to suggest that this occurred. The study was also
232 limited by the constraint of ascertainment of vaccination status
233 at delivery as this prevented any analysis of the relationship
234 between vaccination and early pregnancy loss and also intro235 duced the risk of recall bias. Reliance on maternal self-report of
236 vaccination status, vaccine used and timing of vaccination is a 237 potential limitation, however, the high profile nature of the
238 pandemic vaccination recommendations meant that most
239 women knew this information. Congenital anomalies were 240 ascertained from routine hospital records up to the time of
241 hospital discharge. There was limited recording of clinical details
242 of anomalies and it is possible that misclassification led to an 243 underestimation of congenital anomalies for all neonates.
244 Although multivariable logistic regression was used to adjust
245 for differing maternal characteristics between the comparison
246 groups, it is possible that residual confounding remained. This
247 residual confounding may have explained the apparent differ248 ences in the elective caesarean section rate between the
249 vaccinated and unvaccinated groups.
250 Interpretation
251 There are a number of factors that may have an impact on 252 vaccination uptake rates in the pregnant population. Maternal
253 characteristics associated with vaccination include working
254 outside the home, being multiparous and having a higher level
255 of education [21]. Other factors include the safety concerns of both
256 patients and healthcare workers and also a lack of recommenda257 tion of vaccination by medical professionals [22]. A US survey of
258 postpartum women, which reported a vaccination rate of 34%,
259 indicated that the strongest determinants of vaccination were 260 awareness of vaccine safety and health professional
261 recommendations [23]. Some studies identified that pandemic
262 2009 A/H1N1 influenza vaccination was actually offered to a
minority 263 of women during pregnancy [24,25]. Maternal comorbidities 264 have also been demonstrated to affect the likelihood
265 of vaccination along with regional variations in uptake [18]. 266 Several similar studies in a variety of international settings have
267 reported uptake rates in pregnancy below 15% [10,21,22,26]. 268 Vaccine availability issues early in the pandemic may have reduced
269 uptake in some studies. Higher rates of 37–85% have been reported
270 in other studies from the US and UK [27–29]. In a Dutch online
271 survey with a 20.6% response rate, 63% of pregnant women 272 reported vaccination [30]. An EU survey reported that for pregnant
women, 273 Ireland had the second highest vaccination coverage at
274 32% after the Netherlands at 58% [31]. In line with the findings of
275 this study, vaccination was much less likely in Eastern European
276 countries. Low uptake of the vaccine in pregnancy has also been
277 reported in an Australian study [32]. 278 The higher estimates from some patient surveys may be caused
279 by sampling bias. Uptake rates will also vary between studies
280 depending on the time period included. In this study, vaccination
281 rates of up to 70% were achieved in women delivering in the weeks
282 after the initiation of the vaccination campaign. These uptake rates
may 283 be explained by clear public health messages given in
284 antenatal clinics along with specific vaccination clinics run in the
285 hospital to coincide with antenatal clinics. Vaccination was also
286 available through national vaccination programmes run in the
287 community by public health services.
288 This study adds to previous findings of regional variations in
289 vaccination uptake [18,31]. Maternal characteristics associated with
290 not being vaccinated were similar in several international studies. A
291 Canadian study also reported variations in vaccination rates related
292 to maternal age, socio-economic status and late booking [33]. A
293 French study had similar findings with higher vaccination rates in
women who were 294 older, employed and born in France [34]. 295 Ressuring data are provided on the safety of pandemic 2009A/
H1N1 296 influenza vaccination in pregnancy. Previous studies support
297 the current findings of no association between pandemic 2009A/
H1N1 298 influenza vaccination in pregnancy and adverse pregnancy
299 outcomes including fetal death, preterm birth and congenital
300 anomalies [12–17]. One previous study also noted an association
301 between vaccination and a marginal risk reduction for caesarean 302 section [17]. 303 There was some evidence of a possible protective effect of
304 vaccination with regard to preterm birth. The unadjusted and
305 adjusted analyses indicated that preterm birth below 37 and 32
weeks 306 ’ gestationwas less likely in the vaccinated group compared to
307 theunvaccinated.Therewasnoevidenceof a significantdifference in
308 pretermbirth rateswhen thevaccinated groupwere compared to the
309 prevaccination group. Maternal 2009/H1N1 infection has been
310 associatedwithpretermbirth,particularlywithinfectioninthe third
311 trimester [4]. Confounding by unmeasured maternal characteristics
may 312 explain this difference. Alternatively the association may be
313 indicativeofaprotectiveeffectofvaccination, reducing febrileillness
314 and associated preterm delivery. The protective effect of the vaccine
may 315 have prevented preterm birth within the vaccinated group
which 316 had preterm birth rates that were similar to rates in the
317 prevaccination comparison group. A lower likelihood of preterm
318 birth after pandemic 2009A/H1N1 influenza vaccination in preg319 nancy has previously been reported [16,35], though this finding was 320 not consistent across all studies [14,17].
Women with 321 an underlying health condition are more likely to
322 be vaccinated during pregnancy [18]. These underlying health
323 conditions may predispose a proportion of the vaccinated group to
324 adverse pregnancy outcomes, however, there was no evidence of
325 an increased risk of adverse outcomes for the vaccinated group in
326 this study.

327 Conclusion
328 This study demonstrates that high influenza vaccine uptake
329 rates can be achieved for pregnant women in a pandemic
330 situation. Future public health campaigns should provide clear
331 information on vaccination safety in pregnancy, ensure consistent
332 advice and vaccination recommendations from healthcare pro333 fessionals and provide easy access to vaccination e.g. through
334 integration with antenatal care to optimise uptake rates in
335 subgroups of the population who are less likely to be vaccinated.
336 Reassuring data from geographically diverse locations on the
337 relationship between maternal vaccination and pregnancy out338 comes will aid future vaccination campaigns. This wealth of safety
339 data will attenuate public uncertainty about vaccine safety in
340 pregnancy. The available data may also improve uptake rates in
341 pregnant women in future pandemics.
