Background: Numerous case reports have suggested a
possible association between optic neuritis and receipt
of several different vaccines. The most frequently identified vaccines associated with optic neuritis in the literature are influenza and hepatitis B, and a report describing 2 US military cases suggests an association
with the currently used anthrax vaccine (anthrax vaccine adsorbed).
Objective: To test the hypothesis that optic neuritis may
be associated with anthrax, smallpox, hepatitis B, and influenza vaccines.
Design: We conducted a matched case-control study
among US military personnel from January 1, 1998,
through December 31, 2003, using the Defense Medical
Surveillance System. Statistical associations between vaccine exposures and optic neuritis within 6-, 12-, and 18-
week study intervals were estimated through multivariable conditional logistic regression analyses.
Subjects: A total of 1131 cases of optic neuritis and 3393
controls were matched by sex, military component, and
deployment status.
Results: No statistically significant associations between optic neuritis and anthrax vaccine were observed
for any of the 3 study intervals: 6-week interval (odds
ratio [OR], 1.18; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.74-
1.87), 12-week interval (OR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.63-0.35),
and 18-week interval (OR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.58-1.14). Furthermore, no difference in optic neuritis risk was detected when comparing those who received no dose, 1
dose, and 2 doses of anthrax vaccine. Similarly, no statistically significant associations were observed between optic neuritis and smallpox, hepatitis B, or influenza vaccines within any of the study intervals. No vaccine
to vaccine interactions were statistically significant.
Conclusions: The results from this vaccine postmarketing surveillance investigation suggest that there is no association between optic neuritis and receipt of anthrax,
smallpox, hepatitis B, or influenza vaccinations in the US
military, whether these vaccines are administered alone
or in combination. The negative findings presented here
are important to the continuing discussions regarding the
safety of these vaccines.

F OR MORE THAN A QUARTER
century, published case
reports have suggested an
association between optic
neuritis and certain immunizations, often based on a temporal
proximity between vaccine exposure and
disease onset. While these reports suggest the hypothesis that a possible association exists between the administration
of certain vaccines and optic neuritis,
conclusive epidemiologic evidence from
population-based studies is lacking and
only 1 such study has been published to
date.1 Complicating these findings are
the rarity of this health condition and the
scarcity of databases that hold the necessary information for analyzing this topic
with accuracy and statistical power.
Optic neuritis is an acute, typically idiopathic inflammation of the optic nerve.
It is clinically characterized by vision loss
and pain and is often the sentinel event in
multiple sclerosis (MS). Approximately
one quarter to one third of persons with
idiopathic optic neuritis develop MS within
10 years (range, 24%-39%).2-4 In both MSassociated and isolated monosymptomatic optic neuritis, the cause is presumed
to be an autoimmune reaction resulting in
a demyelinating inflammation of the optic nerve.5
Various genetic and environmental
factors are suspected to predispose individuals to develop optic neuritis and an assortment of infections, stressors, and exogenous antigens, including vaccinations,
have been proposed as possible triggers.6
The most frequently identified vaccines
associated with optic neuritis in case reports are influenza and hepatitis B7-13; however, there is 1 report suggesting an assoAuthor Affiliations: Bacterial

ciation with the currently used anthrax vaccine, anthrax
vaccine adsorbed.14
To investigate whether a possible association exists
between receipt of anthrax vaccine and optic neuritis
among US military personnel, we conducted a matched
case-control study using a longitudinal surveillance database, the Defense Medical Surveillance System (DMSS).
METHODS
DEFENSE MEDICAL SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM
The DMSS is an active surveillance system administered by the
Department of Defense to integrate data from medical treatment facilities, vaccination centers, and military personnel offices worldwide. Inpatient and outpatient diagnosis data are
coded using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) and medical encounter data are most comprehensive for active-duty personnel.
STUDY DESIGN
A matched case-control study design was used with each optic
neuritis case matched to 3 controls based on sex, deployment
during the 18 weeks preceding the diagnosis date, and the military component in which the individual served (eg, active or
reserve/National Guard). The protocol for this vaccine postmarketing surveillance investigation was approved by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Institutional
Review Board and reviewed by the Food and Drug Administration and Department of Defense.
DEFINITION AND ASCERTAINMENT OF CASES
AND SELECTION OF CONTROLS
We defined optic neuritis cases as those having a first-time diagnosis of the following ICD-9-CM codes: optic neuritis, unspecified (377.30); optic papillitis (377.31); retrobulbar neuritis, acute (377.32); and optic neuritis, other (377.39) during
the period between January 1, 1998, and December 31, 2003.
We excluded all persons with any of the ICD-9-CM codes representing optic neuropathies related to nutrition, toxicity, meningococcal meningitis, and syphilis (ICD-9-CM codes 377.33,
377.34, 036.81, and 094.85, respectively). From these resultant 1799 cases, 604 were excluded for having diagnoses of ischemic and compressive optic neuropathies within 1 year prior
to their first diagnosis of optic neuritis, or for having an injury
to the eye or orbital region within 18 weeks of optic neuritis.
A further 64 were excluded because they had not completed at
least 18 weeks of military service before the diagnosis. Thus,
we considered 1131 persons matched to 3393 controls (n=4524)
as optic neuritis cases.
Defense Medical Surveillance System diagnostic histories and
administrative data for all the remaining cases were reviewed
by a neuro-ophthalmologist. Cases within a predefined category of unclassifiable diagnostic certainty (defined as those
diagnosed with optic neuritis but having another concurrent
optic condition [eg, glaucoma, retinal scar], having numerous
MS, migraine, and psychiatric diagnoses, or having a prior record of sarcoidosis or alcohol dependence) were analyzed in the
full sample and were also restricted in a separate analysis.
In addition to meeting the 3 matching criteria, controls were
selected if their DMSS diagnostic records indicated no history
of an optic neuropathy, if they served in the military on the same
date of diagnosis as their matched case, and if they had at least
18 weeks of military service preceding this index date.
DEFINITION OF VACCINE EXPOSURE
We ascertained the date of each case’s first diagnosis of optic
neuritis and determined all vaccinations received during each
of the following 3 prior study intervals from the electronic record; 6 weeks (42 days), 12 weeks (84 days), and 18 weeks (126
days). For each of the 3 matched controls, we determined all
vaccinations during the 3 intervals predating their index date.
We focus on reporting statistical test results for the 18-week
study interval because the onset of a vaccine-mediated optic
neuritis would typically be expected to occur within this time
period following vaccination, and of the 3 study intervals, this
period is composed of the most vaccinations received by the
study subjects.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Bivariate analyses using the 2 statistic assessed differences
between cases and controls. Correlational analyses were performed using the  coefficient to observe the extent to
which vaccinations were coadministered during the 18-week
study interval. Univariate models demonstrated the unadjusted measurements of effect for each of the vaccines under
investigation.
Conditional logistic regression analyses were conducted to
estimate odds ratios using the SAS Proc Logistic statistical
software (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC) for this matched casecontrol design. Variables controlled in this analysis included
race (white, black, other), ethnicity (non-Hispanic, Hispanic),
age grouping (18-24, 25-34, 35 years), military service
branch (US Army, Air Force, Marines, Navy), occupational
category (medical/scientific/research, hazardous/combat,
administrative/communications), and prior diagnosis of MS.
Exposure to anthrax, smallpox, hepatitis B, and influenza vaccines were included in a multivariable model with P values
less than .05 considered statistically significant for each of the
6-, 12-, and 18-week study intervals. Potential 2-way interactive terms with P values less than .15 were allowed into the
model.
Analyses were performed on the sample excluding those cases
identified as having unclassifiable diagnostic certainty from the
neuro-ophthalmologic review. Stratified analyses were conducted for study subjects by prior diagnosis of MS, military deployment during the 18-week period preceding optic neuritis
diagnosis/index date, and military component.
RESULTS
The descriptive epidemiology of optic neuritis cases and
their matched controls is presented in Table 1. Statistically significant differences between cases and controls were found for race, age, service branch, and occupational category.
Fewer cases than controls (5.7% vs 7.6%, respectively) were given the anthrax vaccine within 18 weeks
of the diagnosis/index date (P=.02). Of those cases receiving the anthrax vaccine, 41 (64.1%) received 1 dose
and 23 (35.9%) received 2 or more doses within this study
interval. Among controls receiving the anthrax vaccine,
163 (63.4%) received 1 dose and 94 (36.6%) received 2
or more doses within the 18-week study interval. Correlation tests for the administration of these vaccines
showed that anthrax and smallpox vaccines were the most
frequently coadministered vaccines within the 18-week
study interval (=.31).

Table 2 presents results from the multivariable conditional logistic regression model, after adjusting for age,
race, ethnicity, military service branch, occupational category, previous MS diagnosis, and other vaccinations
(smallpox, hepatitis B, and influenza). A statistically nonsignificant negative association was observed (odds ratio [OR], 0.81; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.58-
1.14) between anthrax vaccine administration and optic
neuritis for the 18-week study interval. In addition, no
statistically significant associations were observed for anthrax vaccine administered during the 12- and 6-week
study intervals (OR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.63-1.35; and OR,
1.18; 95% CI, 0.74-1.87, respectively); however, there
were progressively fewer study subjects available for each
of these comparative analyses. Similarly, no statistically
significant associations were observed between optic neuritis and prior receipt of smallpox, hepatitis B, or influenza vaccination within any of the 3 study intervals. No
difference in adjusted risk of optic neuritis was detected
when comparing those who received no doses of anthrax vaccine with those receiving 1 dose (OR, 0.82; 95%
CI, 0.55-1.21), and to those receiving 2 or more doses
during the 18-week study interval (OR, 0.81; 95% CI,
0.48-1.38). Furthermore, no vaccine to vaccine interactions achieved statistical significance in the final model.
We conducted a separate analysis excluding those
cases having unclassifiable diagnostic certainty and
observed only minor differences between these results
and the multivariate conditional logistic regression
results for the full sample presented in Table 2. We also
conducted separate stratified conditional multivariable
analyses for only those study subjects who had no prior
diagnosis of MS, were not deployed within the
18-month interval, and were in the active component of
the US military. Again, no significant differences were
observed between results for these strata and for the full
sample.
COMMENT
This investigation found no evidence that receipt of anthrax vaccine is associated with the onset of optic neuritis in the US military population. In addition, no statistically significant associations were observed between
optic neuritis and prior receipt of smallpox, hepatitis B,
and influenza vaccinations within any of the 3 study intervals. Moreover, no statistically significant interactive
effect on optic neuritis risk was observed, and there were
no significant differences in the risk for developing optic neuritis when we restricted our analysis to study subjects having high diagnostic certainty, no prior history
of MS, no deployment in the prior 18-week interval, and
only active component personnel.
This vaccine postmarketing surveillance investigation
of whether anthrax vaccine is possibly associated with optic neuritis in the US military was selected as a priority adverse event topic for study by the CDC’s Vaccine Analytic Unit with input from a workgroup of the National
Vaccine Advisory Committee.15 With questions concerning the safety of anthrax vaccine raised by the media, by
some scientists, and by some members of the Armed Forces,

the negative findings presented here are important to this
vaccine’s continuing safety discussion.16
One earlier case report by Kerrison et al14 described 2
US military patients diagnosed with optic neuritis after
receipt of the anthrax vaccine. These patients developed acute optic neuritis shortly after receiving a second and fourth anthrax vaccination. The authors suggested a possible association between optic neuritis and
prior receipt of the anthrax vaccine, possibly as a result
of a potential immune-mediated response to optic nerve
antigens that was stimulated by the vaccine. However,
the authors were unable to detect common epitopes shared
by both the anthrax vaccine and the retina/optic nerve
in support of this hypothesized pathogenic mechanism.
The CDC and Food and Drug Administration’s jointly
administered, passive surveillance system, the Vaccine
Adverse Event Reporting System, has received 7 reports
of optic neuritis following receipt of the anthrax vaccine alone (CDC, unpublished data, August 24, 2005).
In an expanded clinical evaluation, members of the Anthrax Vaccine Expert Committee reviewed all Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System reports from 1998 through
2001 considered possibly associated with the receipt of
the anthrax vaccine.17 Of these reports, only 1 was identified as optic neuritis and was determined by the Anthrax Vaccine Expert Committee to have an “unclassifiable” causal relationship with the anthrax vaccine.
In an analysis of DMSS diagnostic codes for anthraximmunized and nonimmunized US service personnel from
1998 through 2000, Lange et al18 reported a statistically
significant elevated postvaccination adjusted rate ratio
of 2.74 (95% CI, 1.56-4.80) for the nonspecific 3-digit
ICD-9-CM code 377 (disorders of optic nerve and visual
pathways). The authors’ conclusions were limited by this
broad definition of optic disorders and the lack of any
diagnostic validation; nonetheless, the optic disorders remained rare with a prevaccination diagnosis rate of 1 of
100 000 person-years and a postvaccination diagnosis rate
of 2.9 of 100 000 person-years.
DeStefano et al1 investigated whether several vaccines
were associated with MS and optic neuritis using the Vaccine Safety Datalink database. These investigators found
no statistically significant increased risk associated with
hepatitis B, tetanus, influenza, measles/mumps/rubella,
measles, and rubella vaccines. Furthermore, no statistically significant associations were observed between the
administration of these immunizations during 3 study intervals (1 year, 1-5 years, and 5 years) and the development of MS or optic neuritis. The authors concluded
that vaccinations do not cause central nervous system demyelination and do not trigger its clinical presentation
among persons having subclinical disease,1 although other
researchers contend that insufficient evidence exists from
which to state this definitively.19
Particular strengths of this vaccine postmarketing surveillance investigation included the availability of the large
DMSS database for studying this extremely rare diagnostic endpoint. No previously published epidemiologic study
is known to have possessed a sufficiently large sample
size to enable calculation of specific vaccine exposure risks
within 6-, 12- and 18-week postvaccination intervals. Our
investigation’s relatively brief exposure intervals tend to
lessen the opportunity for chance causations to be introduced in the analysis. It is well accepted that the onset of vaccine-mediated optic neuritis would typically occur within several weeks after vaccination. We were also
able to adjust for any potential effects from other (smallpox, hepatitis B, and influenza) vaccines administered to
study subjects within the same study intervals as anthrax vaccine. In addition, we assessed individual effects and possible interactions between these vaccines.
A possible weakness of our study is the omission to conduct a medical record review to confirm the diagnosis of
optic neuritis. Nevertheless, we consider that the level of
diagnostic validity was probably high because this specific condition is typically associated with an acute, severe presentation which would likely result in the patient
being clinically investigated and diagnosed by an ophthalmologist.While medical records were not reviewed as part
of this study, we retrieved complete DMSS diagnostic
histories of all cases, which were individually reviewed
for diagnostic quality by an experienced neuro-ophthalmologist. In addition, when we repeated our analysis
and excluded those cases suggested by this neuroophthalmic review to be of an unclassifiable diagnostic validity, the results did not change substantively.While some
nondifferential misclassification of exposures or diagnoses is possible,18 it is unlikely that it would have produced sufficient bias to change our results or conclusions. We could not rule out an infectious cause for a
minority of cases, particularly those having diagnosed
chronic sinusitis or unspecified viral infections within 18
weeks of the optic neuritis diagnosis.
Compared with controls, subjects were more likely to
be older than 35 years and less likely to fall within the 18-
to 25-year-old group. This age imbalance between cases
and controls is significant in that demyelinating optic neuritis generally has the highest incidence in persons younger
than 35 years; however, it is not clear whether this age relationship exists with potential vaccine-mediated optic neuritis. We believe that any possible confounding effect of
age was adequately controlled in the multivariable logistic regression analyses, and using a continuous age variable in the model produced almost identical, statistically
non-significant results as those reported in Table 2.
Finally, the lack of any appreciable differences between our multivariate conditional logistic regression results and the results from our separate analyses (which
excluded those subjects having unclassifiable diagnostic certainty, prior diagnosis of MS, deployments within
the 18-month study interval, and reserve and National
Guard personnel) suggest that the full sample results presented in Table 2 sufficiently explain the data. In summary, the results of this vaccine postmarketing surveillance investigation contribute to evidence that there is
no association between optic neuritis and anthrax, smallpox, hepatitis B, and influenza vaccines, whether administered alone or in combination.
