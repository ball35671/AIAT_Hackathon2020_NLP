Background
Outcome after spontaneous (non-traumatic) intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) is influenced by haematoma volume; up to one-third
of ICHs enlarge within 24 hours of onset. Early haemostatic therapy might improve outcome by limiting haematoma growth. This is
an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2006, and last updated in 2009.
Objectives
To examine 1) the effectiveness and safety of individual classes of haemostatic therapies, compared against placebo or open control, in
adults with acute spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage, and 2) the effects of each class of haemostatic therapy according to the type
of antithrombotic drug taken immediately before ICH onset (i.e. anticoagulant, antiplatelet, or none).
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Stroke Trials Register, CENTRAL; 2017, Issue 11, MEDLINE Ovid, and Embase Ovid on 27 November
2017. In an effort to identify further published, ongoing, and unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCT), we scanned bibliographies of relevant articles and searched international registers of RCTs in November 2017.
Selection criteria
We sought randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of any haemostatic intervention (i.e. pro-coagulant treatments such as coagulation
factors, antifibrinolytic drugs, or platelet transfusion) for acute spontaneous ICH, compared with placebo, open control, or an active
comparator, reporting relevant clinical outcome measures.
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and contacted corresponding authors of eligible RCTs for specific data
if they were not provided in the published report of an RCT.

Main results
We included 12 RCTs involving 1732 participants. There were seven RCTs of blood clotting factors versus placebo or open control
involving 1480 participants, three RCTs of antifibrinolytic drugs versus placebo or open control involving 57 participants, one RCT of
platelet transfusion versus open control involving 190 participants, and one RCT of blood clotting factors versus fresh frozen plasma
involving five participants. We were unable to include two eligible RCTs because they presented aggregate data for adults with ICH
and other types of intracranial haemorrhage. We identified 10 ongoing RCTs. Across all seven criteria in the 12 included RCTs, the
risk of bias was unclear in 37 (44%), high in 16 (19%), and low in 31 (37%). Only one RCT was at low risk of bias in all criteria.
In one RCT of platelet transfusion versus open control for acute spontaneous ICH associated with antiplatelet drug use, there was a
significant increase in death or dependence (modified Rankin Scale score 4 to 6) at day 90 (70/97 versus 52/93; risk ratio (RR) 1.29,
95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04 to 1.61, one trial, 190 participants, moderate-quality evidence). All findings were non-significant for
blood clotting factors versus placebo or open control for acute spontaneous ICH with or without surgery (moderate-quality evidence),
for antifibrinolytic drugs versus placebo (moderate-quality evidence) or open control for acute spontaneous ICH (moderate-quality
evidence), and for clotting factors versus fresh frozen plasma for acute spontaneous ICH associated with anticoagulant drug use (no
evidence).
Authors’ conclusions
Based on moderate-quality evidence from one trial, platelet transfusion seems hazardous in comparison to standard care for adults with
antiplatelet-associated ICH.
We were unable to draw firm conclusions about the efficacy and safety of blood clotting factors for acute spontaneous ICH with or
without surgery, antifibrinolytic drugs for acute spontaneous ICH, and clotting factors versus fresh frozen plasma for acute spontaneous
ICH associated with anticoagulant drug use.
Further RCTs are warranted, and we await the results of the 10 ongoing RCTs with interest.

Treatments to help blood clotting to improve the recovery of adults with stroke due to bleeding in the brain
Review question
Do treatments to help blood clot reduce the risk of death and disability for adults with stroke due to bleeding in the brain?
Background
More than one-tenth of all strokes are caused by bleeding in the brain (known as brain haemorrhage). The bigger the haemorrhage,
the more likely it is to be fatal. Roughly one-third of brain haemorrhages enlarge significantly within the first 24 hours. Therefore,
treatments that promote blood clotting might reduce the risk of death or being disabled after brain haemorrhage by limiting its growth,
if given soon after the bleeding starts. However, haemostatic drugs might cause unwanted clotting, leading to unwanted side effects,
such as heart attacks and clots in leg veins.
Study characteristics
We found 12 randomised controlled trials, including 1732 participants, up to November 2017.
Key results
We found moderate-quality evidence of harm from platelet transfusion for people who had used antiplatelet drugs until they had a brain
haemorrhage. We found no evidence of either benefit or harm from other haemostatic therapies for people with brain haemorrhage.
Quality of the evidence
Overall, the quality of the evidence was moderate to low.
More information will become available from the 10 trials that are ongoing.

Description of the condition
The burden of haemorrhagic stroke is out of proportion to its
frequency as a subtype of stroke. Although haemorrhagic stroke
causes 11% to 22% of all new strokes (Feigin 2009), it caused
50% of all stroke deaths, and approximately 42% (47 million)
of the disability-adjusted life years lost due to stroke in the 2013
Global Burden of Disease study (Feigin 2015). Spontaneous (nontraumatic) intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) accounts for twothirds of haemorrhagic stroke, amounting to more than two million strokes per year (Al-Shahi Salman 2009a). ICH is due to
cerebral small vessel disease, and may be associated with the use
of antithrombotic (i.e. anticoagulant or antiplatelet) drugs. The
age-specific incidence of ICH - like the age-specific incidence of
ischaemic stroke and myocardial infarction - rises with age (Feigin
2015). Two-thirds of people who have an ICH are 75 years or
older (Lovelock 2007; Samarasekera 2015). Given that the number of people aged 75 years and older is projected to rise in many
parts of the world, the burden due to ICH incidence, recurrence,
and prevalence will rise.
Outcome after stroke due to ICH is poor: one-year survival is 46%
(95% confidence interval (CI) 43% to 49%), five-year survival is
29% (95% CI 26% to 33%), and predictors most consistently associated with death are increasing age, decreasing Glasgow Coma
Scale score, increasing ICH volume, presence of intraventricular haemorrhage, and deep or infratentorial ICH location (Poon
2014). Approximately one-third of acute ICHs (i.e. less than 24
hours after symptom onset or time last seen well) enlarge from
three to 24 hours after onset (Brott 1997); ICH growth is independently associated with death and poor outcome (Davis 2006).
Description of the intervention
The three main components of haemostasis (the process that stops
bleeding) are vasoconstriction, platelet plug formation, and coagulation.
Vascular smooth muscle cell vasoconstriction is a blood vessel’s
first response to injury. They constrict the damaged vessels, which
reduces the amount of blood flow through the area and limits the
amount of blood loss. Collagen is exposed at the site of injury,
which causes platelets to adhere to the injury site.
Primary haemostasis is achieved by platelets, which adhere to damaged endothelium to form a platelet plug. Plug formation is activated by the Von Willebrand factor, which is found in plasma.
When platelets are activated, they express glycoprotein receptors
that interact with other platelets, producing aggregation and adhesion. Platelets release cytoplasmic granules that contain serotonin, adenosine diphosphate (ADP), and thromboxane A2, all of
which increase the effect of vasoconstriction. ADP attracts more
platelets to the affected area, serotonin is a vasoconstrictor, and
thromboxane A2 assists in platelet aggregation, vasoconstriction,
and degranulation.
Secondary haemostasis starts once a platelet plug has been formed.
Blood plasma clotting factors are activated in a sequence of events
known as the coagulation cascade. Inactive fibrinogen produces a
fibrin mesh around the platelet plug to hold it in place. Red and
white blood cells are trapped in the mesh to produce a thrombus,
or clot. Tissue factor (also called platelet tissue factor, factor III,
or thromboplastin) is a protein that is exposed after endothelial
damage, which leads to thrombin formation and activation of the
tissue factor pathway, as well as its circulating ligand factor VII.
Therapies that intervene in primary haemostasis (e.g. platelet
transfusion) or secondary haemostasis (e.g. administration of clotting factors (fresh frozen plasma (FFP), or prothrombin complex
concentrate (PCC), or antifibrinolytic drugs) might promote clot
formation, decrease bleeding, and thus improve outcomes by limiting ICH growth.
How the intervention might work
Theoretically, early interventions to reduce acute ICH volume
might improve outcomes. Although surgical craniotomy to evacuate spontaneous supratentorial ICH and reduce ICH volume
was found to reduce the odds of dying or becoming dependent
compared with medical management alone, the result was not
very robust, and surgical evacuation is not frequently used (Prasad
2008). Therefore, medical (non-surgical) interventions to promote haemostasis, and limit haematoma growth, have become the
main focus of acute ICH therapeutic research.
Why it is important to do this review
Various haemostatic therapies have been investigated in a variety
of spontaneous bleeding conditions with little evidence for their
effectiveness in some settings (Johansen 2015: Stanworth 2012;
Wikkelsø 2013), but clear benefit in others (Ker 2015). It is unclear whether they are effective for acute ICH. Therefore, we systematically reviewed the literature for randomised controlled trials
(RCTs) of all potential haemostatic therapies for the treatment of
acute spontaneous ICH.

Criteria for considering studies for this review
Types of studies
Randomised controlled trials, whether published or unpublished,
regardless of the language of publication. Pseudo-randomised
studies were not eligible.
Types of participants
People of any sex, aged 16 years or older. We restricted this review to people with radiographically-confirmed acute spontaneous
intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH). Where possible, we grouped
RCTs, or participant subgroups, by whether ICH was associated
with antiplatelet drug use, anticoagulant drug use, or neither.
Types of interventions
Single or multiple haemostatic therapies (including antifibrinolytic drugs, blood coagulation factors, antidotes to specific antithrombotic drugs, platelet transfusion, or other platelet activation therapies), regardless of dosage or route of administration.
Interventions could be compared against placebo, open control,
or an active comparator.
Types of outcome measures
We assessed the following outcomes at 90 days after randomization
(or at the end of scheduled follow-up, if not provided at 90 days).
Primary outcomes
• Death or dependence from any cause (measured on a
standard rating scale, such as the modified Rankin Scale)
Secondary outcomes
• All serious adverse events (if possible, with a separate
analysis of arterial and venous thromboembolic events, including
deep vein thrombosis symptomatic pulmonary embolism,
arterial embolism, myocardial infarction, ischaemic stroke, and
disseminated intravascular coagulation)
• Change in volume of ICH on follow-up brain imaging
• Death from any cause (categorised into early (e.g. less than
seven days) and late (e.g. between seven days and the end of
follow-up) if possible)
• Quality of life
• Mood
• Cognitive function
Search methods for identification of studies
See the ’Specialized register’ section in the Cochrane Stroke Group
module. We searched for trials in all languages, and arranged for
the translation of relevant articles when necessary.
Electronic searches
The Cochrane Stroke Group Information Specialist searched the
Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched 27 November 2017), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials
(CENTRAL; 2017, Issue 11) in the Cochrane Library (searched
27 November 2017; Appendix 1); MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 27
November 2017; Appendix 2); and Embase Ovid (1974 to 27
November 2017; Appendix 3).
One review author (ZL) also searched the following international
registers of RCTs on 27 November 2017.
• US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register
ClinicalTrials.gov (clinicaltrials.gov) using the search strategy in
Appendix 4;
• World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical
Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP; apps.who.int/trialsearch) using
the search strategy in Appendix 5.
Searching other resources
In an effort to identify further published, ongoing, and unpublished RCTs, three authors (RA-SS, NS, and ZL) scanned bibliographies of relevant articles.
Data collection and analysis
Selection of studies
Two authors independently checked the titles and abstracts of
studies identified by the search strategy for RCTs meeting the
selection criteria for the first version of this review (You 2006). Two
authors (ZL or RA-SS) independently screened the results of the
updated searches for potentially eligible studies for this updated
review, and obtained the full published articles or trial registry
entries for studies likely to be relevant RCTs. Two authors (NS and
RA-SS) independently read these potentially eligible RCTs in full,
and confirmed their inclusion according to the inclusion criteria.
Data extraction and management
Two authors (NS and RA-SS) used a standard data collection form
to independently extract data on risk of bias, other RCT characteristics, participants, methods, interventions, outcomes, and results. If necessary, we sought additional data from the principal
investigators of RCTs that met, or potentially met the inclusion
criteria. We sought unpublished data that were not quantified in
Haemostatic therapies for acute spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage (Review) 5
Copyright © 2018 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
the original publications, or not presented as stratified by intracranial haemorrhage type, from the principal investigators and pharmaceutical companies. In the one study for which these data were
not forthcoming, RA-SS measured the numbers in the relevant
groups in the stacked bar charts, using Adobe Acrobat Professional
measuring tools on the PDF of the published study (Mayer 2008
(FAST)). In one phase II study, we could obtain only limited data
from the Novo Nordisk website (F7ICH-1602 2007).
Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
Two authors (NS and RA-SS) independently assessed included
RCTs’ risk of bias, according to the seven criteria of the Cochrane
’Risk of bias’ tool (Higgins 2011). The same two authors discussed
and agreed on the overall quality of the evidence for each outcome,
using the GRADE approach (Higgins 2011).
Measures of treatment effect
We calculated risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous data, and mean
difference (MD), or standardized mean difference (SMD) for different measures of the same outcome, for continuous data.
Dealing with missing data
We sought missing data from studies’ corresponding authors, and
used all the data that were available to us.
Assessment of heterogeneity
We estimated inconsistency between RCTs using the I² statistic.
Assessment of reporting biases
We used funnel plots to assess publication bias where there were
sufficient data.
Data synthesis
We used a random-effects model (because we expected studies of
different drugs and doses to estimate different, yet related, treatment effects) to calculate RRs and 95% confidence intervals (CIs),
with the inverse variance method.
Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity
We expected to find that the choice of intervention and comparator would be largely determined by the use and type of antithrombotic drug taken prior to a spontaneous acute ICH (e.g.
fresh frozen plasma (FFP), or prothrombin complex concentrate
(PCC) for anticoagulant-associated ICH, platelet transfusion for
antiplatelet-associated ICH). However, where interventions were
used for ICH, whether it was associated with antithrombotic drug
use or not (e.g. the clotting factor recombinant activated factor
VII, antifibrinolytic drugs), and where ICH evacuation using craniotomy was performed, we stratified our analyses by pre-ICH antithrombotic drug use and use of surgery.

Description of studies
Results of the search
Our searches identified 31 potentially eligible randomised controlled trials (RCT); see Figure 1 for the flowchart describing the searches done for this update. We excluded nine studies because: they never started (Ciccone 2007; NCT02429453),
they did not report any of our primary or secondary outcomes
(Meng 2003; Zhou 2005), they did not report data and outcomes in the intracerebral haemorrhage population (Kerebel
2013; Steiner 2016 (INCH)), they did not quantify outcomes
(Madjdinasab 2008), the study was stopped due to poor enrolment but never reported results (NCT00222625), or the study
did not relate to a haemostatic therapy (Li 2016). Ten RCTs
were still in the process of recruitment (Liu 2017 (TRAIGE);
Meretoja 2014 (STOP-AUST);NCT00699621;NCT02777424;
NCT02866838; NCT03044184; NOR-ICH), follow-up (Sprigg
2016 (TICH-2)), or reporting (NCT00810888; NCT01359202)
at the time of writing, and will be assessed for inclusion with
the next update. This left 12 RCTs that we included in this review, all of which included acute intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH)

We included seven RCTs of blood clotting factors versus placebo
or open control involving 1480 participants (F7ICH-1602 2007;
Imbert 2012 (PRE-SICH); Li 2012; Mayer 2005a; Mayer 2005b;
Mayer 2006; Mayer 2008 (FAST)), three RCTs of antifibrinolytic drugs versus placebo or open control involving 57 participants (Arumugam 2015; Sprigg 2014 (TICH-1); Zazulia 2001
(ATICH)), one RCT of platelet transfusion versus open control
involving 190 participants (Baharoglu 2016 (PATCH)), and one
RCT of blood clotting factors versus fresh frozen plasma involving
five participants (Boulis 1999).
Included studies
We included 12 RCTs. For details, please refer to the ’
Characteristics of included studies’ table.
Of the seven RCTs of blood clotting factors versus placebo or
open control, six examined blood clotting factors in adults with
acute spontaneous ICH (F7ICH-1602 2007; Li 2012; Mayer
2005a; Mayer 2005b; Mayer 2006; Mayer 2008 (FAST)), and one
in adults with acute spontaneous ICH undergoing craniotomy
(Imbert 2012 (PRE-SICH)). Five studies were funded and conducted by Novo Nordisk, and compared the use of various doses
of intravenous recombinant activated clotting factor VII (rFVIIa;
(973 participants)) against placebo (422 participants), started
within four hours of ICH onset in adults (F7ICH-1602 2007;
Mayer 2005a; Mayer 2005b; Mayer 2006; Mayer 2008 (FAST)).
Novo Nordisk supplied supplementary, unpublished data from
three trials (Mayer 2005a; Mayer 2005b; Mayer 2006), but did not
respond to several requests to provide further data from two trials
(F7ICH-1602 2007; Mayer 2008 (FAST)). The other study of intravenous rFVIIa was performed independently of Novo Nordisk,
as a single centre, phase II study, in adults with acute spontaneous
ICH within six hours of ICH onset (Li 2012). We had not prespecified the exclusion of RCTs of haemostatic therapies following
surgical intervention, so we included Imbert 2012 (PRE-SICH),
which was a phase II study of intravenous rFVIIa in adults with
acute spontaneous ICH undergoing craniotomy, administered immediately after the evacuation of the haematoma, within 24 hours
of ICH onset.
Of the three RCTs of antifibrinolytic drugs versus placebo or open
control, Zazulia 2001 (ATICH) was a phase II RCT of intravenous
aminocaproic acid compared against supportive treatment alone,
started within three hours of ICH onset in adults. Dr AllysonZazulia provided unpublished data, because the trial was stopped after
the enrolment of three participants because recruitment had been
slow, and the investigators decided that the rationale for rFVIIa
was better (Zazulia 2005). Sprigg 2014 (TICH-1) was a phase II
RCT of intravenous tranexamic acid compared against supportive
treatment alone, started within 24 hours of ICH onset in adults.
Arumugam 2015 was a phase II RCT of intravenous tranexamic
acid compared against supportive treatment alone, started within
eight hours of ICH onset in adults.
We found one RCT of platelet transfusion versus open control
involving 190 participants (Baharoglu 2016 (PATCH)).
We found one RCT of blood clotting factors versus fresh frozen
plasma involving five participants with acute spontaneous ICH
associated with anticoagulant drug use (Boulis 1999).
Excluded studies
We excluded nine studies. For details, please refer to the ’
Characteristics of excluded studies’ table. We excluded two eligible RCTs because they presented aggregate data for adults with
ICH as well as other types of intracranial haemorrhage, and the
study authors could not provide data restricted to the ICH group
alone by the time this review was submitted (Kerebel 2013; Steiner
2016 (INCH)). One abstract proposed a RCT of tranexamic acid
for ICH, but the corresponding author confirmed that funding
had not been obtained (Ciccone 2007). We found two studies of
aprotinin, but it was unclear whether they included some participants in both studies, and the outcome measures used were unsuitable for meta-analysis in this review (Meng 2003; Zhou 2005).
NCT02429453 was a planned RCT of fresh frozen plasma (FFP)
versus prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC), but was terminated before enrolment began. NCT00222625 was a study of coagulation factors, but it was “stopped due to slow recruitment”
(Iorio 2012). Dr Iorio has not responded to requests for clarification about whether any data were collected. Madjdinasab 2008
was a study of coagulation factors, but no results were reported,
and there was no response from the authors to requests for information for this review. Finally, Li 2016 was excluded as the intervention (TRABC) did not appear to be haemostatic, and had four
Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) medicinals.
We identified 10 ongoing or recently completed but unreported
RCTs. See ’Characteristics of ongoing studies’ table for details.
Two RCTs examined blood clotting factors versus placebo or open
control (NCT00810888; NCT01359202), five examined antifibrinolytic drugs versus placebo or open control in acute spontaneous ICH (Liu 2017 (TRAIGE); Meretoja 2014 (STOP-AUST);
NCT03044184; NOR-ICH; Sprigg 2016 (TICH-2)); one RCT
examined antifibrinolytic drugs versus placebo or open control in
acute spontaneous ICH associated with anticoagulant drug use
(NCT02866838); one RCT examined platelet transfusion versus
open control (NCT00699621), and one RCT examined blood
clotting factors versus fresh frozen plasma in acute spontaneous
ICH associated with anticoagulant drug use (NCT02777424).

Across all seven domains in the 12 included RCTs, we assessed
that the risk of bias, according to the Cochrane ’Risk of bias’ tool,
and guidance in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of
Interventions, was unclear in 37 (44%), high in 16 (19%), and low
in 31 (37%; (Figure 2; Figure 3; Higgins 2011)). Only one RCT
was at low risk of bias in all domains (Sprigg 2014 (TICH-1)).

Allocation
The risk of bias in random sequence generation was low in two
RCTs, unclear in 10 RCTs, and high in none. The risk of bias
in allocation concealment was low in two RCTs, unclear in nine
RCTs, and high in one.
Only four RCTs clearly described the method of randomization (
Baharoglu 2016 (PATCH); Mayer 2005b; Sprigg 2014 (TICH-1);
Zazulia 2001 (ATICH)), and one RCT simply mentioned ’block
randomization according to site’ (Mayer 2008 (FAST)).
Allocation was reported as being concealed in the papers for
Baharoglu 2016 (PATCH) and Sprigg 2014 (TICH-1), there was
a risk of unblinding in one study (Mayer 2008 (FAST)), and the
rest were unclear about allocation concealment.
It became apparent during questioning after the presentation of
the Mayer 2008 (FAST) data at the European Stroke Conference
in Glasgow, UK, in 2007 (Mayer 2007), that the imbalance in
allocation between the three groups in this trial (there were approximately 30 more participants analysed in the 80 mcg/kg dose
group than the other two groups) was due to the 80 mcg/kg dose
of rFVIIa tending to be packed in the first of the three boxes of
study drug for part of the trial (which might have unblinded investigators, in view of the preponderance of thromboembolic adverse
events with the higher dose).
Blinding
Five of the 12 RCTs did not blind the intervention and comparator (Arumugam 2015; Baharoglu 2016 (PATCH); Boulis 1999;
Imbert 2012 (PRE-SICH); Zazulia 2001 (ATICH)), four did
blind intervention and comparator, and the risk of bias was unclear
in three RCTs. Whether participants and personnel were blinded
to treatment allocation was only explicitly stated in Baharoglu
2016 (PATCH), but correspondence with the study authors verified that this was the case for Mayer 2006; Zazulia 2001 (ATICH),
and Sprigg 2014 (TICH-1). The risk of bias in the remaining
RCTs was unclear in three RCTs, and high in five RCTs.
Risk of bias from blinding of outcome assessment was low in five
RCTs, high in one RCT, and unknown in six RCTs. Assessment of
radiological outcome was blinded to treatment allocation in nine
included RCTs (Arumugam 2015; Baharoglu 2016 (PATCH);
Imbert 2012 (PRE-SICH); Mayer 2005a; Mayer 2005b; Mayer
2006; Mayer 2008 (FAST); Sprigg 2014 (TICH-1); Zazulia 2001
(ATICH)), but information was not provided in others.
Incomplete outcome data
Overall, the risk of bias from incomplete outcome data was low
in six RCTs, high in two RCTs, and unclear in the remaining
four RCTs. Only Baharoglu 2016 (PATCH); Mayer 2008 (FAST),
and Sprigg 2014 (TICH-1) provided data about completeness of
clinical follow-up. In Arumugam 2015 and Li 2012, four participants had missing data. Boulis 1999 excluded eight participants
after randomization. The last-observation-carried-forward technique was used in Mayer 2005b and Mayer 2008 (FAST), which
is likely to be unbiased only if the completeness of follow-up was
high.

Selective reporting
Bias from selective outcome reporting was low in eight RCTs,
appeared to be low in two RCTs, and high in two other RCTs.
Other potential sources of bias
There were differences in baseline characteristics between treatment and control arms in the rFVIIa RCTs, especially in Mayer
2008 (FAST): 90-day case fatality was worse in the placebo group
in Mayer 2005b (29%) than in Mayer 2008 (FAST) (19%), which
might be one explanation for the difference between the RCTs’
findings. There was no visual evidence of funnel plot asymmetry in
the largest group of RCTs, which compared blood clotting factors
versus placebo or open control for death or dependency (Figure
4).

We analysed data on intervention effects In 12 RCTs involving
1732 participants (1150 allocated to intervention and 582 allocated to control or active comparator), split by type of intervention as follows.
Blood clotting factors versus placebo or open control
In RCTs of blood clotting factors (N = 1018) versus placebo or
open control (N = 462) for acute spontaneous ICH with or without surgery, use of blood clotting factors led to non-significant
reductions in death or dependence (risk ratio (RR) 0.87, 95%
confidence interval (CI) 0.70 to 1.07; six trials, 1390 participants;
moderate-quality evidence; Analysis 1.1); in death (RR 0.75, 95%
CI 0.51 to 1.09; seven trials, 1480 participants; moderate-quality evidence; Analysis 1.3); in all serious adverse events (RR 0.81,
95% CI 0.30 to 2.22; two trials, 87 participants; moderate-quality evidence; Analysis 1.4); and in ICH growth (RR 0.74, 95%
CI 0.36 to 1.48; three trials, 151 participants; moderate-quality
evidence; Analysis 1.6). Blood clotting factors resulted in a nonsignificant increase in all serious thromboembolic serious adverse
events (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.91; five trials, 1398 participants; moderate-quality evidence; Analysis 1.5). In these analyses,
the I² varied from 0% to 53%. We downgraded the quality of the
evidence by one level because of concerns with design and risk of
bias.
Antifibrinolytic drugs versus placebo or open control
In RCTs of antifibrinolytic drugs (N = 33) versus placebo or open
control (N = 24) for acute spontaneous ICH, use of antifibrinolytic drugs led to non-significant increases in death or dependence (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.57 to 2.75; one trial, 24 participants;
moderate-quality evidence; Analysis 2.1), in death (RR 1.16, 95%
CI 0.31 to 4.39; three trials, 57 participants; moderate-quality
evidence; Analysis 2.2), in all serious adverse events (RR 1.50,
95% CI 0.39 to 5.83; one trial, 24 participants; moderate-quality
evidence; Analysis 2.3), and in thromboembolic serious adverse
events (RR 1.59, 95% CI 0.07 to 35.15; one trial, 24 participants;
moderate-quality evidence; Analysis 2.4). Antifibrinolytic drugs
led to a non-significant reduction in ICH growth (RR 0.76, 95%
CI 0.56 to 1.05; three trials, 57 participants; moderate-quality
evidence; Analysis 2.7). In these analyses, the I² was 0% to 1%.
We downgraded the quality of the evidence to moderate because
of imprecision.
Platelet transfusion versus open control
In one RCT of platelet transfusion (N = 97) versus open control
(N = 93) for acute spontaneous ICH associated with antiplatelet
drug use, platelet transfusion led to a significant increase in death
or dependence (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.61; one trial, 190
participants; moderate-quality evidence; Analysis 3.1), and nonsignificant increases in death (RR 1.42, 95% CI 0.88 to 2.28; one
trial, 190 participants; moderate-quality evidence; Analysis 3.2),
in all serious adverse events (RR 1.46, 95% CI 0.98 to 2.16; one
trial, 190 participants; moderate-quality evidence; Analysis 3.3),
in thromboembolic serious adverse events (RR 3.84, 95% CI 0.44
to 33.68; one trial, 190 participants; moderate-quality evidence;
Analysis 3.4), and in ICH growth (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.56 to 2.20;
one trial, 190 participants; moderate-quality evidence; Analysis
3.5). We downgraded the quality of the evidence by one level
because of imprecision.
Clotting factors versus fresh frozen plasma
No conclusions could be drawn from one small RCT of clotting
factors (N = 2) versus fresh frozen plasma (N = 3) for acute spontaneous ICH associated with anticoagulant drug use, which did
not report the primary outcome of this review.

Summary of main results
There was moderate-quality evidence, based on the findings of one
RCT (190 participants), that platelet transfusion appeared hazardous in comparison to standard care for adults with antiplateletassociated intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH). Based on moderatequality evidence, we were unable to draw firm conclusions about
the efficacy and safety of blood clotting factors versus placebo or
open control for acute spontaneous ICH with or without surgery
(seven trials, 1480 participants), or antifibrinolytic drugs versus
placebo or open control for acute spontaneous ICH (three trials, 57 participants). The one very small trial (five participants)
we found on clotting factors versus fresh frozen plasma for acute
spontaneous ICH associated with anticoagulant drug use did not
measure our primary outcome, and provided limited data on the
secondary outcomes.
Overall completeness and applicability of
evidence
Alongside the 12 included RCTs, we were unable to include two
eligible RCTs (N = 113) comparing clotting factors versus fresh
frozen plasma for acute spontaneous ICH associated with anticoagulant drug use because data on participants with intracerebral haemorrhage could not be separated from participants with
subdural intracranial haemorrhage (Kerebel 2013; Steiner 2016
(INCH)). This resulted in a shortage of data comparing clotting
factors versus fresh frozen plasma for acute spontaneous ICH associated with anticoagulant drug use.
The results of 10 ongoing or recently completed unreported
RCTs are awaiting completion and publication (Characteristics of
ongoing studies). Two of these were recently completed RCTs (N
= 142) investigating clotting factors in participants with radiological criteria associated with increased risk of haematoma expansion,
so the RCTs in the review only include all patients with ICH and
not the subgroup most at risk of ICH growth, i.e. those with the
radiological ’spot sign’ (tiny, enhancing foci within haematomas)
(NCT00810888; NCT01359202).
There were few data available on antifibrinolytic drugs versus
placebo after spontaneous acute ICH, but five ongoing RCTs
(N > 2500) are investigating the antifibrinolytic drug tranexamic
acid versus placebo in acute spontaneous ICH without anticoagulant use (Liu 2017 (TRAIGE); Meretoja 2014 (STOP-AUST);
NCT03044184; NOR-ICH; Sprigg 2016 (TICH-2)), and with
anticoagulant drug use (NCT02866838). Publication of the
largest RCT is expected in 2018 (Sprigg 2016 (TICH-2)).
It was unclear whether recruitment was complete for one RCT of
platelet transfusion (N = 100; NCT00699621). Further RCTs of
platelet transfusion seem unlikely, so we await the publication of
this RCT to see if the findings of Baharoglu 2016 (PATCH) are
externally valid.
Quality of the evidence
We included 12 RCTs with 1732 participants (1150 allocated to
intervention, 582 allocated to control or active comparator). One
double-blind RCT (Sprigg 2014 (TICH-1)), and one open RCT
(Baharoglu 2016 (PATCH)), were at low risk of bias, but the risk
of bias of most other RCTs was moderate to high (Figure 2; Figure
3). The RCT finding harm from platelet transfusion has not been
replicated in another RCT (Baharoglu 2016 (PATCH)).
The largest quantity of data was from RCTs of recombinant activated clotting factor VII (rFVIIa), which were at moderate risk of
bias, and their results were moderately inconsistent, showing nonsignificant benefits of rFVIIa. These findings have not changed
practice (Hemphill 2015 (AHA ICH); RCP 2016; Steiner 2014
(ESO ICH)), and have led to explorations of the use of rFVIIa
in ICH sub-groups in as-yet-unpublished RCTs (NCT00810888;
NCT01359202).
We rated the overall quality of all of the available evidence as
moderate for three comparisons on the grounds of imprecision
(Analysis 1.1; Analysis 2.1; Analysis 3.1), and poor for one comparison on the grounds of imprecision and limitations in study
design (Analysis 4.1).
Potential biases in the review process
We followed a dual review process: two authors (NS and RA-SS)
independently extracted data that reduced identification bias and
improved risk of bias assessment in comparison to the previous
update of this review.
We were unable to include data from two eligible studies that separately showed benefits of clotting factors versus FFP on intermediate outcomes (speed of international normalised ratio (INR) reduction) after intracranial haemorrhage as data were not available
for the ICH population; we hope to include these RCTs in the
next update of this review to also examine the effect of clotting
factors versus FFP on clinical outcomes (Steiner 2016 (INCH);
Kerebel 2013).
Agreements and disagreements with other
studies or reviews
This review was completed after the most recent updates of the
European and North American ICH guidelines (Hemphill 2015
(AHA ICH); Steiner 2014 (ESO ICH)). These guidelines predated the results of Baharoglu 2016 (PATCH), and simply found
that “the usefulness of platelet transfusions in ICH patients with
a history of antiplatelet use is uncertain”. Guidance on platelet
transfusion has changed to reflect the results of Baharoglu 2016
Haemostatic therapies for acute spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage (Review) 17
Copyright © 2018 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
(PATCH), where platelet transfusion was associated with a worse
outcome, hence platelet transfusion is not recommended (Dastur
2017). Consistent with our findings, guidelines have not recommended the use of clotting factors, such as rFVIIa for acute spontaneous ICH not associated with anticoagulant use (Hemphill 2015
(AHA ICH); RCP 2016; Steiner 2014 (ESO ICH)). The AHA
and ESO guidelines preceded the publication of Steiner 2016
(INCH), but the national stroke guidelines in the UK recommend
using prothrombin complex concentrate for anticoagulant-associated ICH, reflecting the findings of Steiner 2016 (INCH) on the
intermediate outcome of speed of INR reduction (RCP 2016).
A U T H O R S ’ C O N C L U S I O N S
Implications for practice
Platelet transfusion appears hazardous in comparison to standard
care for adults with antiplatelet-associated ICH (this is based on
the findings of one trial). We are unable to draw firm conclusions
about the efficacy and safety of blood clotting factors for acute
spontaneous ICH (with or without surgery), antifibrinolytic drugs
for acute spontaneous ICH, clotting factors or fresh frozen plasma
for acute spontaneous ICH associated with anticoagulant drug
use.
Implications for research
Although rFVIIa does not appear beneficial on the basis of
existing evidence, RCTs of its use in specific subgroups have
been undertaken and their results are awaited (NCT00810888;
NCT01359202). Clotting factors appear superior to fresh frozen
plasma for normalising coagulation in the RCTs that we could
not include because they were not restricted to ICH (Kerebel
2013; Steiner 2016 (INCH)), but their superiority for improving
clinical outcome needs to be established. The effect of antifibrinolytic drugs for acute ICH is uncertain, but in view of their effects in other conditions (Ker 2015), the results of several ongoing
RCTs are keenly awaited (Liu 2017 (TRAIGE); Meretoja 2014
(STOP-AUST); NCT02866838; NCT03044184; Sprigg 2016
(TICH-2)).

Characteristics of included studies [ordered by study ID]
Arumugam 2015
Methods Single-blinded, randomised placebo-controlled trial of tranexamic acid (intravenous 1 g
bolus, followed by infusion 1 g/h for 8 h) in acute (< 8 h) primary ICH. Strict blood
pressure control (target SBP 140 mmHg to 160 mmHg)
A repeat brain CT was done after 24 h to reassess haematoma growth. The primary
objective was to test the effect of tranexamic acid on haematoma growth. Other objectives
were to test the feasibility, tolerability, and adverse events of tranexamic acid in primary
ICH
Participants Inclusion criteria
• Patients aged ≥ 18 years (either sex),
• Non-surgically managed patients who were evaluated by the on-call neurosurgeon
and, were deemed inappropriate for surgical intervention,
• Event within 8 h of onset,
• Hypertensive intracerebral bleed, and
• Supratentorial lesion.
Exclusion criteria
• Patients on anticoagulant therapy,
• Brainstem bleed,
• Intraventricular bleed on the first brain CT brain, including participants who
developed an intraventricular bleed during the study,
• Malignant hypertension,
• Subarachnoid haemorrhage suggestive of a ruptured aneurysm,
• Trauma,
• Blood disorder (e.g. haemophilia and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura),
• Infection (e.g. dengue haemorrhagic fever),
• Hepatic or renal impairment,
• Previous venous thrombosis or embolic disease,
• Recent ischaemic event (within 12 months), such as ischaemic stroke, MI, or
peripheral artery disease, and
• Pregnant or breast-feeding women (pregnancy was evaluated in women of childbearing age using a urine pregnancy test).
Interventions Intervention: tranexamic acid (1 g diluted in 100 mL of 0.9% saline) over a period of 10
minutes. The initial dose was followed by a maintenance dose of 1 g/h for 8 h. Labetalol
infusion 2 mg/min to achieve SBP 140 mmHg to 160 mmHg
Comparator: placebo mentioned, but not described. Labetalol infusion 2 mg/min to
achieve SBP 140 mmHg to 160 mmHg
Outcomes Repeat CT brain scan was performed after 24 h, and a blinded radiologist evaluated the
size and volume of the haematoma. Adverse events due to tranexamic acid that occurred
within 24 h of the treatment were documented by the investigator or pharmacist

underlying aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation
• Planned surgical evacuation of intracerebral haemorrhage within 24 h of
admission
• Intraventricular blood more than sedimentation in the posterior horns of the
lateral ventricles
• Previous adverse reaction to platelet transfusion
• Known use of vitamin K antagonist (unless INR ≤ 1.3) or history of coagulopathy
• Known thrombocytopenia (lower than 100 cells x 10
/L)
• Lacking mental capacity by national legal standards before intracerebral
haemorrhage
• Death appeared imminent
Interventions Intervention: standard care with platelet transfusion within 90 minutes of diagnostic
brain imaging
Comparator: standard care
Outcomes The primary outcome was shift towards death or dependence rated on the mRS at 3
months, and analysed by ordinal logistic regression, adjusted for stratification. Variables
and the Intracerebral Haemorrhage Score Secondary clinical outcomes at 3 months were:
survival (mRS score of 1 to 5), poor outcome defined as an mRS score of 4 to 6, and
poor outcome defined as an mRS score of 3 to 6
The secondary explanatory outcome was median absolute intracerebral haemorrhage
growth in mL after 24 h on brain imaging
Safety outcomes were defined as complications of platelet transfusion (transfusion reactions, thrombotic complications)

Methods Randomised (2:1), open-label, single-blinded parallel group phase 2 pilot trial involving
21 participants with spontaneous supratentorial ICH diagnosed by CT
Participants Inclusion criteria
• People 18 to 75 years of age with spontaneous supratentorial ICH documented by
CT scan
• Surgery was expected within 24 h from the onset of symptoms
Exclusion criteria
• MI or the placement of coronary or carotid stents in the 6 months prior to the
study
• Solid organ transplantation
• Pregnancy
Interventions All participants were intubated, ventilated, and underwent craniotomy with the intention of complete haematoma removal. The haematoma cavity was lined with Surgicel
(Johnson & Johnson, New Brunswick, NJ, USA). Blood pressure was measured continuously, and data were collected every 1 to 2 h. Efforts were made to maintain the mean
arterial blood pressure between 90 mmHg and 130 mmHg, PaCO within the range
of 35 mmHg to 40 mmHg, natraemia between 137 and 147 mmol/L and to obtain
normoglycaemia (80 mg/dL to 110 mg/dL)
Intervention: 100 mcg/kg of rFVIIa (NovoSeven, Novo Nordisk, Denmark) by intravenous infusion in 5 to 10 minutes immediately after evacuation of the haematoma, at

Comparator: saline solution by intravenous infusion in 5 to 10 minutes immediately
after evacuation of the haematoma, at the beginning of the closure of the dura
Outcomes Haematoma volume was assessed by CT scan immediately, 18 h to 30 h, and 5 days to 7
days after evacuation of the haematoma. The primary endpoint was haematoma volume
at 18 h to 30 h after surgery. Outcome was evaluated at 6 months using the mRS; poor
outcome was defined as death or an mRS score of 4 to 5, and good outcome was defined
as an mRS score of 0 to 3

Allocation concealment (selection bias) High risk It became apparent during questioning after the presentation of this trial’s data at
the European Stroke Conference (Glasgow
2007), that the imbalance in allocation between the 3 groups in this trial (there were
approximately 30 more participants analysed in the 80 mcg/kg dose group than the
other 2 groups) was due to the fact that
the 80 mcg/kg dose of rFVIIa tended to
be packed in the first of the 3 boxes of
study drugfor part of the trial (which might
have unblinded investigators, in view of the
preponderance of thromboembolic adverse
events with the higher dose)

endpoint trial of tranexamic acid (intravenous 1 g bolus, 1 g infusion/8 h) in acute (<
24 h) spontaneous ICH
Participants Adults with acute (< 24 h after ictus) spontaneous ICH were identified and enrolled
from the stroke service at Nottingham University Hospital NHS Trust. The principal
exclusion criteria included secondary ICH (anticoagulation, known vascular malformations), previous venous thromboembolic disease, recent (< 12 months) ischaemic events
(ischaemic stroke, MI, PAD), renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate <
50 mmol), and pregnancy or breast feeding
Interventions Intervention: intravenous tranexamic acid (Cyklokapron; Phamacia Limited, Kent, UK)
administered as a 1 g loading dose infusion for 10 minutes followed by a 1 g infusion
for a period of 8 h
Comparator: matching placebo (0.9% saline) administered by identical regime
Outcomes The primary outcome was trial feasibility (surrogate for trial acceptability: number of
participants screened who were eligible for enrolment and who gave informed consent)
Secondary outcomes included tolerability (adverse events occurring during or after administration of tranexamic acid) and safety (clinical information on ischaemic events, i.
e. ischaemic stroke, TIA, acute coronary syndrome, PAD, and VTE were also recorded)
. The Data Safety Monitoring Committee reviewed unblinded safety data after 6, 12,

Trial name or title The Spot Sign for Predicting and Treating ICH Growth study (STOP-IT)
Methods The purpose of this study is to determine if computed tomography angiography can predict which individuals
with ICH will experience significant growth in the size of the haemorrhage. For individuals who are at high
risk for haemorrhage growth, the study will compare the drug recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) to
placebo to determine the effect of rFVIIa on ICH growth
Participants Inclusion criteria

Trial name or title ’Spot Sign’ Selection of Intracerebral Hemorrhage to Guide Hemostatic Therapy (SPOTLIGHT)
Methods This clinical trial will enrol 110 participants from approximately 15 Canadian stroke centres. People coming
to the emergency department with bleeding in the brain not due to trauma or other known causes who can
be treated within 6 h of onset will undergo CT angiography using standard CT scanners (’CAT scan’). Those
with a ’spot sign’, a type of marker on the CT scan that shows the brain is still bleeding, will be randomly
assigned to a single injection of ’factor 7’ (a blood clotting drug used in haemophilia) or placebo (inactive
saline); people without a spot sign will not be treated. The researchers will look at how much bleeding happens
after the treatments are administered, as well as clinical outcomes such as death and disability. The researchers
think that factor 7 will cause the bleeding to stop faster and possibly decrease death and disability

Outcome of NOAC-ICH can be devastating and is a major cause of death and disability. There is no
proven treatment for NOAC-ICH. Haematoma expansion (HE) is associated with unfavourable outcome.
Tranexamic acid (TA) is an anti-fibrinolytic drug that is used in a number of bleeding conditions other than
ICH
Participants Inclusion criteria
• Acute ICH (symptom onset < 12 h)
• Prior treatment with a novel direct oral anticoagulant (apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, or rivaroxaban;

• Inclusion criteria clarified to allow placebo,
open control, or active comparators.
• Literature and trial register search strategies
updated to November 2017.
• Stratification of analyses by antithrombotic use.
• We added six new trials and data from a further
334 participants, for a total of 12 trials and 1732
participants.
10 December 2017 New citation required and conclusions have changed • Our new conclusion is that platelet transfusion
seems hazardous in comparison to standard care for
adults with antiplatelet-associated acute spontaneous
intracerebral haemorrhage.
• We remain unable to draw firm conclusions
about the efficacy and safety of blood clotting factors
and antifibrinolytic drugs for acute spontaneous
intracerebral haemorrhage.

RA-SS registered the title, developed the original protocol, and wrote the first two versions of the review. All authors revised the protocol.
RA-SS and ZKL screened the title and abstracts of potentially eligible studies. RA-SS and NS reviewed potentially eligible studies in
full, appraised their risk of bias, extracted data from them, and obtained further data from study authors. RA-SS and NS updated the
review. PB and TS edited and provided comments on the review. RA-SS is responsible for the final version and is the guarantor.

• Title modified.
• Inclusion criteria clarified to include participants with stroke due to intracerebral haemorrhage accompanied by any sort of
antithrombotic drug use.
• Inclusion criteria clarified to allow placebo, open control, or active comparators.
• Literature and trial register search strategies updated (see Appendix 1; Appendix 2; Appendix 3; Appendix 4; Appendix 5). Some
of the names of the databases have been changed, some databases have been superceded, and we abandoned searches of other
databases: CenterWatch Clinical Trials Listing Service (www.centerwatch.com); Computer Retrieval of Information on Scientific
Projects (crisp.cit.nih.gov); NIH Clinical Research Studies Database (clinicalstudies.info.nih.gov); Stroke Trials Directory (
www.strokecenter.org/trials); and Trials Central (www.trialscentral.org/ClinicalTrials.asp) were not searched; pharmaceutical
companies were not contacted.
• Introduction of new secondary outcomes: death from any cause (categorised into early (< 7 days) and late (between 7 days and
the end of follow-up) if possible), quality of life, mood, cognitive function.
• Stratification of analyses by antithrombotic use and intended surgery.
• New and ongoing trials added.
