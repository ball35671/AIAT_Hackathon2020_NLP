Background: Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) can be devastating,
particularly if hematoma expansion (HE) occurs. Tranexamic acid (TA), an antifibrinolytic drug, significantly reduced mortality in bleeding patients after trauma in the
large CRASH-2 trial. The CRASH-2 ICH substudy found that TA nonsignificantly
reduced mortality and dependency in traumatic ICH. The aim of this study was
to assess the feasibility of performing a randomized controlled trial of tranexamic
acid in spontaneous ICH, ahead of a definitive study. Methods: We performed
a single-center, prospective, randomized (2:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled
blinded endpoint trial of TA (intravenous 1 g bolus, 1 g infusion/8 h) in acute
(,24 hours) spontaneous ICH. The primary objective was to test the feasibility of recruiting to the trial. Other objectives included tolerability (adverse events) and the
effect of TA on HE and death and dependency. Results: The trial was feasible,
with 24 patients enrolled (TA, n 5 16; placebo, n 5 8) between March 2011 and
March 2012, and acceptable—only 3 patients declined to participate. All patients
received the correct randomized treatment; 1 patient in the TA group did not complete the infusion because of neurologic deterioration. There were no significant differences in secondary outcomes including adverse events, HE, death, and
dependency. One patient in the TA group had a deep vein thrombosis . Conclusions:
This, the first randomized controlled trial of TA in ICH, found that the protocol could
be delivered on schedule (2 patients/mo) and was feasible. Larger studies are
needed to assess safety and efficacy of TA in ICH. Key Words: Acute stroke—
intracerebral hemorrhage—tranexamic acid—randomized controlled trials.

Introduction
Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a
common cause of death and disability worldwide.
Outcome after ICH is closely related to both hematoma
size and hematoma expansion (HE), which is associated
with a bad outcome (death and disability).1 Extravasation of arterial blood can be visualized as a white
‘‘spot’’ using contrast-enhanced computed tomography
(CT) and/or CT angiography (CTA); the presence of

spot-positive hematoma predicts HE and a poor
outcome.2-5
Hematoma volume can be reduced surgically although whether this improves outcome was unclear in
the STICH6 and STICH-27 trials. Acute blood pressure
lowering appears to be safe and may improve outcome
in ICH although this was not conclusively demonstrated
in the INTERACT studies.8,9 This study focuses on a
hemostatic approach to ICH.
Hemostatic drug therapies have been tested in spontaneous ICH, with recombinant factor VIIa (FVIIa) being
the most widely studied agent. Although phase II study
of FVIIa appeared promising,10 the subsequent and larger FAST trial was neutral with respect to functional
outcome.11 A meta-analysis of these and other trials of hemostatic therapies was similarly neutral.12 In a small case
series, platelet infusion therapy for patients with ICH
while on antiplatelet therapy did not prevent death or
improve outcome13; a larger study, PATCH,14 is ongoing.
Tranexamic acid is a licensed antifibrinolytic drug
that can be administered intravenously or orally and is
used to reduce bleeding in several conditions including
menorrhagia and during cardiac surgery.15,16 In a recent
megatrial (CRASH-2) in 20,000 patients with major
bleeding after trauma, tranexamic acid (TA) significantly
reduced mortality, with no increase in vascular occlusive
events.17 Treatment was most effective when given
rapidly; delayed administration was associated with lack
of efficacy and potential harm.18 In a subgroup analysis
of patients with traumatic ICH, TA showed a nonsignificant trend to reduce mortality and death or dependency.19
However, patients in CRASH-2 were younger and had less
comorbidities than those with spontaneous ICH. In
another randomized controlled trial in traumatic ICH, TA
nonsignificantly reduced death and death or dependency,
without increased thromboembolic events.20
Tranexamic acid has been tested in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, where it reduced the risk of rebleeding at
the expense of increased risk of cerebral ischemia.21 However, administration was prolonged, conferring prolonged
exposure to risk of ischemic events. A trial of immediate
short-term (72 hours) TA treatment showed a trend to
improved outcome,22 and a trial of ultra-acute (within
6 hours) administration is currently ongoing.23
Additionally, TA has been found to restrict HE in several
small case series involving patients with spontaneous
ICH.24,25 There have been recent calls in the literature for
large clinical trials to examine the use of TA in ICH.26
The aim of the present study was to test the feasibility of
performing a randomized controlled trial of TA in ICH
and assess initial safety, ahead of a definitive study.
Methods
We performed a prospective, randomized, placebocontrolled, blinded end point single-center phase IIa trial
of TA in patients with acute spontaneous ICH. The study
was approved by Cambridgeshire 2 Research Ethics Committee (November 1, 2010, ref: 10/H0308/80), had a Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency
Clinical Trial Authorization (03057/0044/0010001, October
4, 2010), was registered with a trial number (ISRCTN
50867461), and performed according to the Declaration of
Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice.
Subjects
Adult patients with acute (,24 hours after ictus)
spontaneous ICH were identified and enrolled from the
stroke service at Nottingham University Hospital NHS
Trust. The principal exclusion criteria included secondary
ICH (anticoagulation, known vascular malformations),
previous venous thromboembolic disease (VTE), recent
(,12 months) ischemic events (ischemic stroke [IS],
myocardial infarction, peripheral artery disease [PAD]),
renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate
,50 mmol), and pregnancy or breast feeding.
Full written informed consent was obtained from patients before randomization, or proxy consent was taken
from a relative/carer if the patient lacked capacity
because of being obtunded, confused, or dysphasic.
Intervention
Patients were randomized to receive either intravenous
TA (Cyklokapron; Phamacia Limited, Kent, UK) administered as a 1-g loading dose infusion for 10 minutes followed by a 1-g infusion for a period of 8 hours or
matching placebo (.9% saline) administered by identical
regime. This regime has been used in other studies17
and has been shown to inhibit fibrinolysis in vitro.27
Computerized randomization was performed 2:1 (TA:-
placebo) with minimization on age, sex, baseline severity
(National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS]), and
time from stroke onset.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was trial feasibility (surrogate for
trial acceptability:number of patients screened who are
eligible for enrollment and who gave informed consent).
Secondary outcomes included tolerability (adverse
events occurring during or after administration of TA)
and safety (clinical information on ischemic events [IS,
transient ischemic attack, acute coronary syndrome,
PAD] and VTE were also recorded). The Data Safety
Monitoring Committee reviewed unblinded safety data
after 6, 12, and 18 patients have been recruited and followed for 7 days.
Clinical measures: impairment (NIHSS) at day 7 (or
discharge from hospital) and day 90 (end of follow-up);
dependency (modified Rankin Scale shift), disability (Barthel Index), quality of life (EuroQoL), mood (Short Zung
2 N. SPRIGG ET AL.
Depression Scale score), and cognition (telephone MMSE)
at day 90.
Radiological measures: percentage hematoma volume
change on brain imaging day 1 to day 2 and HE (defined
as greater than 6-mL absolute increase in hematoma volume28). All image analyses were performed blinded to
clinical status and treatment allocation. CT scan data
were exported from the Nottingham University Hospitals
Picture Archiving and Communication System in DICOM
format to an offline image analysis workstation. The data
were converted to analyze format before volumetric analysis using 3DSlicer software.29
Manual outlining of ICH, IVH, and edema was performed as described previously30 by a single investigator
(Y.K.) in all cases. In a subset of 8 cases, the ICH volume
on the baseline and follow-up scans (hence 16 scans) was
measured by a second experienced observer (R.A.D.) allowing interobserver variability measurement for ICH volumes and for the calculated change in ICH volume
between the 2 scans. Additionally, difference in ICH volume measurement between the 2 readers was calculated
as a type A intraclass correlation using an absolute agreement definition.
Statistical Methods
Data were analyzed using Fisher exact test, t test, and
Mann–Whitney U test, as appropriate. All analyses were

performed using SPSS (Apple Mac, version 11; SPSS Inc.,
Chicago, IL). Analysis was by intention-to-treat; significance was taken at P less than .05. As this was a feasibility
study, no formal sample size calculation was performed.
Results
Of 107 patients who were screened between March 2011
and April 2012, 24 were enrolled (Fig 1). The commonest
reason for non-enrollment was inability to randomize
within 24 hours of onset because of unknown time of
onset. Other reasons included need for immediate neurosurgery (10) and deep coma (6). Of eligible patients, 3
declined to consent.
The baseline characteristics were matched for age, sex,
systolic blood pressure, and baseline stroke severity
(Table 1); patients randomized to TA had a trend to larger
hematoma volumes, earlier randomization, and were
more likely to have had previous stroke and be on antiplatelet therapy.
All patients received all their bolus injection, and 1 patient in the tranexamic group did not receive their infusion because of rapid deterioration, which initially was
thought to be an allergic reaction but was later confirmed
as because of HE.
No patients were lost to follow-up; however, cognition,
mood, and quality of life data were missing in a number
of participants who were unable to answer questions
because of communication problems. There were no significant differences in functional outcomes between the
groups (Table 2); point estimates variably favored TA or
placebo but with no apparent trends.
Six patients in the TA group and 2 in the control group
had SAEs (Table 3). One patient had a deep vein thrombosis 8 days after treatment with TA; there were no other
episodes of VTE or arterial thrombosis (IS, transient
ischemic attack, acute coronary syndrome, or PAD); 5 patients in the TA group and 2 in the control group had
neurologic deterioration (NIHSS score .1).
Basal ganglia hematoma were more common than lobar
hematoma in both groups (Table 4). Only 4 patients had
CTA before randomization, and none of these were positive for contrast extravasation (ie, all ‘‘spot negative’’).
The intraclass correlation coefficients of .997 (95% confidence interval .989-.999, P , .0005) and .953 (95% confidence interval .803-.990, P , .0005) were obtained for
absolute ICH volume and for the calculated change in
ICH volume. The mean difference in absolute ICH volume measurement between the 2 readers was 1.75 mL
(range .01-4.91 mL).

Four patients had radiological HE, 3 in the TA group
and 1 in the control group. There was a trend to greater
percent HV increase in the control group (9.7%) versus
the TA group (5.4%).
Discussion
There is an urgent need for effective treatments for
ICH. We have shown here that administration and testing
of the prohemostatic agent TA in ICH is feasible. However, the numbers enrolled in this study are too small to
draw any conclusions on safety or efficacy, and as expected, no trends were seen for or against TA.
Twenty-four patients were recruited over 2 years (2
patients/mo), the intended rate. All patients bar 1
received the full dose of TA/placebo. With respect to
safety, no significant differences between TA and placebo were seen for rates of death, serious adverse events,
neurologic deterioration, or VTE. The commonest
adverse event was neurologic deterioration, often associated with HE, although in a number of patients, it was
associated with a systemic cause, such as aspiration
pneumonia or atrial fibrillation. With respect to VTE, a
potential complication with TA, 1 patient had a deep
vein thrombosis 8 days after treatment with TA; larger
numbers are needed to assess safety; however, no increase in VTE was seen in CRASH-2.17
We used a definition of HE of greater than 6-mL absolute increase. Five patients had more than 33% increase
in hematoma volume, but in only 3 of these, the volume
increase was greater than the 3-mL absolute increase.
Again, there was no difference between TA and placebo.
Patients in the treatment group were more likely (nonsignificant) to have been taking antiplatelet therapy, a risk
factor for HE.31
Recent studies have suggested that clinical trials of prohemostatic agents should enroll patients who are more
likely to be prone to HE,28 for example, using the CTA
‘‘spot sign.’’5 We did not include patients on the basis of
CTA; first, CTA is not a standard of care in stroke patients
in the United Kingdom (in our study, only 4 patients had
a CTA), and second, spot-negative patients can still go on
to suffer HE.32
There was no increase in cerebral edema, an important
finding, as an experimental model of warfarin-induced
ICH demonstrated that TA-treated animals had increased
cerebral edema. This warrants further investigation in a
larger study.33
The limitations of this study are 3-fold. First, it was a
very small pilot study, designed only to test the feasibility
of performing a randomized control trial of TA in ICH.
Second, patients were recruited at an average time of
10-15 hours postonset, that is, in the acute rather than hyperacute phase after ICH. The window for recruitment of
up to 24 hours was deliberately chosen because this was a
feasibility study. Nevertheless, it is likely that any prohemostatic agent will need to be given much earlier if it is to
be effective by reducing HE because expansion occurs
early after onset.34 All the patients who underwent HE

TICH: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED PILOT TRIAL 5
were enrolled greater than 4 hours after stroke onset, and
5 of 6 received treatment more than 12 hours after ictus.
Patients in the treatment group were enrolled somewhat
earlier and had somewhat larger baseline hematoma volumes although both observations were nonsignificant;
these findings are not surprising because earlier randomization is expected to be associated with more severe
stroke presentations.35 The feasibility of recruiting patients to a hyperacute (short time window), multicenter
trial was not addressed by this pilot study; however, other
studies suggest that this will be feasible.9 Third, although
we did not confirm that fibrinolysis was inhibited in vitro,
the dose regime used for administering TA here has been
demonstrated to have antifibrinolytic action in other
studies.27
In conclusion, we found it was feasible to administer
TA in acute ICH. Larger studies, recruiting patients
much earlier, are now needed to determine safety and efficacy. A number of such studies are in preparation with 2
studies currently recruiting patients. One such phase III
trial, TICH-2,36 started in March 2013 and aims to recruit
2000 patients. In parallel, the STOP-AUST37 phase II trial
will assess the effect of TA on hematoma expansion in
‘‘spot-positive’’ patients.
