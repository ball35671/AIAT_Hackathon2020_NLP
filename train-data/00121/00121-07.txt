Background and Purpose—Hematoma growth occurs in 38% of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) patients scanned by
computed tomography (CT) within 3 hours of onset. Activated recombinant factor VII (rFVIIa) promotes hemostasis at
sites of vascular injury and may minimize hematoma growth after ICH.
Methods—In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation trial, 48 subjects with ICH diagnosed
within 3 hours of onset were treated with placebo (n12) or rFVIIa (10, 20, 40, 80, 120, or 160 g/kg; n6 per group).
The primary endpoint was the frequency of adverse events (AEs). Safety assessments included serial electrocardiography (ECG), troponin I and coagulation testing, lower extremity Doppler ultrasonography, and calculation of
edema:ICH volume ratios.
Results—Mean age was 61 years (range, 30 to 93) and 57% were male. At admission, mean National Institutes of Health
Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was 14 (range, 1 to 26), median Glasgow Coma Scale score was 14 (range, 6 to 15), and
mean ICH volume was 21 mL (range, 1 to 151). Mean time from onset to treatment was 181 minutes (range, 120 to 265).
Twelve serious AEs occurred, including 5 deaths (mortality 11%). Six AEs were considered possibly treatment-related,
including rash, vomiting, fever, ECG T-wave inversion, and 2 cases of deep vein thrombosis (placebo and 20-g/kg
groups). No myocardial ischemia, consumption coagulopathy, or dose-related increase in edema:ICH volume occurred.
Conclusion—This small phase II trial evaluated a wide range of rFVIIa doses in acute ICH and raised no major safety
concerns. Larger studies are justified to determine whether rFVIIa can safely and effectively limit ICH growth. (Stroke.

ntracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is the deadliest, most disabling, and least treatable form of stroke. Approximately
40% of patients die within 1 month of ICH onset, and
two-thirds of survivors never regain functional independence.1 Although guidelines for supportive care exist,1 there
is currently no treatment that has been shown in a randomized
controlled trial to improve outcome after ICH.
Hematoma volume is a critical determinant of mortality
and functional outcome after ICH,2,3 and early hematoma
growth may be an important cause of early neurological
deterioration. Prospective and retrospective studies indicate
that substantial hematoma enlargement occurs in up to 38%
of ICH patients initially scanned within 3 hours of onset, and
in 16% of those scanned between 3 and 6 hours, even in the
absence of coagulopathy.4 –7 The only prospective study of
this phenomenon revealed a 33% increase in ICH volume
in 26% of patients at 1 hour, and in an additional 12%
between 1 and 20 hours.4 Early hematoma growth appears to
be a dynamic process, with continued bleeding or rebleeding
occurring at multiple sites over several hours.8
Intervention with ultra-early hemostatic therapy in the
emergency setting could potentially improve outcome after
ICH by arresting ongoing bleeding and minimizing hematoma growth. Recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa) is currently
approved to treat bleeding in hemophilia patients with inhibitors to factors VIII or IX, and is approved in Europe for the

treatment of factor VII deficiency and Glanzmann thrombasthenia. After vascular damage and local initiation of the
coagulation cascade, rFVIIa enhances thrombin generation on
the surface of activated platelets, leading to the formation of
a stable, lysis-resistant plug at the site of vessel injury.9
rFVIIa has been successfully used to control intracranial
hemorrhage in patients with hemophilia or other coagulation
disorders,10,11 and can arrest intraoperative bleeding and
reverse coagulopathies in patients undergoing neurosurgical
procedures.12 rFVIIa has also been reported to prevent or
minimize refractory bleeding in noncoagulopathic patients.13,14 Although thromboembolic complications related to
rFVIIa administration have occurred, with 400 000 doses
administered for a growing number of clinical uses, the
frequency of serious adverse events (SAEs) remains 1%.15
We report data from a randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled, dose-escalation study designed to evaluate the
safety and feasibility of rFVIIa treatment for acute ICH.
Subjects and Methods
Subjects
Adult patients (18 years and older) with spontaneous ICH documented by computed tomography (CT) scan within 3 hours of
symptom onset were eligible for enrollment. Exclusion criteria
included: deep coma (Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] 3 to 5) at time of
admission; surgical hematoma evacuation planned or performed
within 24 hours of admission; secondary ICH related to aneurysm,
arteriovenous malformations, trauma, tumor, infarction, dural sinus
thrombosis, known oral anticoagulant use, coagulopathy, or thrombocytopenia; any history or acute evidence of thrombotic, hypercoagulable, or vaso-occlusive disease; acute sepsis or crush injury;
pregnancy; known malignant disease or alcohol abuse; previous
disability (baseline modified Rankin Scale [mRS] score 2); known
or suspected allergy to the trial product; and participation in
another trial.
Informed Consent
The study protocol was approved by local ethics committees in
participating countries. Informed consent was obtained before any
study-related activity. In accordance with local regulations, consent
could be waived or obtained from a legally acceptable representative
if the patient lacked capacity to provide consent. Patients were
required to provide consent on regaining consciousness; those
declining were withdrawn.
Study Design and Procedures
The study was conducted between August 2001 and October 2002 at
14 trial centers in Australia,2 Germany,1 Italy,1 Singapore,3 Spain,4
Taiwan,2 and the United Kingdom.1 Forty-eight patients were
enrolled in 6 sequential dose tiers (n8 per tier) and randomly
allocated to receive placebo or rFVIIa (NovoSeven; Novo Nordisk
A/S, Bagsvaerd, Denmark). A randomization schedule was generated and as patients were recruited, they were allocated to the next
available randomization number within the dose tier, which indicated
whether the patient was to receive placebo or rFVIIa. Within each
dose tier, 2 subjects received placebo and 6 received rFVIIa (10, 20,
40, 80, 120, or 160 g/kg). On completion of each dose tier,
enrollment was stopped until an independent data and safety monitoring board reviewed all SAEs, CT images, and other clinical and
laboratory data, and approved progression to the next dose.
rFVIIa or placebo (a freeze-dried powder in single-use vials) was
reconstituted with sterile water and administered as a single intravenous slow bolus injection within 1 hour of the baseline CT scan, and
not later than 4 hours after symptom onset. Follow-up CT scans were
performed 1 hour after the baseline scan, and 24 and 72 hours after
dosing. Blood samples drawn at admission and 1 and 24 hours after
dosing were centrally analyzed for coagulation parameters (International Normalized Ratio [INR], activated partial thromboplastin time
[aPTT], D-dimers, antithrombin III [AT-III], fibrinogen, prothrombin fragments 12, and factor VII coagulant activity [FVII:C]) and
standard hematology and blood chemistry measurements. Clinical

assessments were performed daily until day 5, at day 15 (or
discharge if earlier), and at day 90. Neurological deterioration was
assessed using the GCS and National Institute of Health Stroke
Scale; day 15 and day 90 assessments included the mRS, Extended
Glasgow Outcome Scale, and Barthel Index.
CT Image Analysis
CT data were transmitted to a centralized imaging laboratory
(Bio-Imaging Technologies Inc) and analyzed in random sequence
using Analyze software (Mayo Clinic) by 2 independent, neuroradiologists blinded to treatment. ICH, intraventricular hemorrhage
(IVH), and edema volumes were calculated using a semi-automated
process by tracing the perimeter of appropriate high- and lowattenuation zones and calculating lesion areas for each slice multiplied by slice thickness to yield lesion volumes. Edema volumes
were calculated by subtracting ICH volume from the combined ICH
plus edema volume.
Endpoints
The primary endpoint was the frequency of adverse events (AEs) that
were possibly or probably related to treatment. AEs were assessed
until day 15 or discharge if earlier, and SAEs until completion of the
trial (day 90). Predefined safety endpoints included evidence of: (1)
myocardial ischemia; (2) deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary
embolism (PE); (3) cerebral artery or vein thrombosis; (4) consumption coagulopathy; and (5) excessive or unusual perihematomal brain
edema (edema:ICH volume ratio 2.5 at 72 hours). Planned safety
assessments included electrocardiography and measurements of
serum troponin I levels at baseline and 24 hours, coagulation testing
at baseline, 1 hour, and 24 hours, and lower extremity Doppler
ultrasonography at 72 hours.
Secondary endpoints included percent and absolute changes in
ICH, IVH, and total hemorrhage (ICHIVH) volume between
baseline and 24 hours; the proportion of patients with ICH growth
(33% or 12.5 mL increase from baseline); in-hospital neurological
deterioration (decrease of 2 points in the GCS, or increase of 4
points in the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale) between day
0 and 5; and the proportion of patients who were dead, alive with
minimal or no disability (Barthel Index, 95 to 100; Extended
Glasgow Outcome Scale, 8; mRS, 0 to 2), or alive and functionally
independent (Barthel Index, 60 to 100; Extended Glasgow Outcome
Scale, 5 to 8; mRS, 0 to 3) at 90 days.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses were performed according to the principle of
intention-to-treat. The safety evaluation included all patients who
received the trial product and did not withdraw consent. Interobserver reliability of ICH and edema volume measurements was
assessed by calculating mean differences and intraclass correlation
coefficients between the 2 blinded readers. Differences in ICH
volume and coagulation parameters were compared between different rFVIIa dose groups and placebo using analysis of covariance
(ANCOVA). Point estimates and 2-sided 95% confidence intervals
for mean differences between the dose groups were calculated as
appropriate. Significance was set at P0.05 for all analyses.

Results
Forty-eight patients were randomized to treatment. One
patient originally included with waiver of informed consent
subsequently withdrew and was excluded from the analysis.
Mean age was 6115 years (range, 30 to 93); 57% were
male; 60% were white; and 40% were Asian. At admission,
mean National Institute of Health Stroke Scale score was
147 (range, 1 to 26), median GCS score was 14 (range, 6 to
15), and mean blood pressure was 175/95 mm Hg.
Mean time from symptom onset to baseline CT was
11232 minutes (range, 57 to 173); in 57% (27/47) the
baseline CT was performed within 2 hours of onset. Mean
time from baseline CT to trial product administration was
6928 minutes (range, 17 to 166); the target interval of
CT-to-treatment of 1 hour was attained in 49% (23/47) of
cases. Mean time from ICH onset to treatment was 18136
minutes (range, 120 to 265); the target interval of treatment
within 4 hours of onset was attained in 96% (45/47) of cases.
Mean ICH volume at baseline was 2124 mL (range, 1 to
151). Hemorrhages were located in the putamen (40% of
patients), thalamus (32%), lobar regions (19%), pons or
midbrain (6%), and cerebellum (2%). Twenty-one patients
(45%) had IVH. Although there was considerable variability
in baseline ICH volume between the treatment groups, these
differences were not significant (Table I, available online
only at http://www.strokeaha.org).
The overall frequency of ICH growth was 17% at 1 hour
and 19% at 24 hours (Table II, available online only at
http://www.strokeaha.org). Percent changes in ICH volume
between baseline and 24 hours did not differ between groups
(Figure 1). Analysis of total hemorrhage volumes
(ICHIVH) yielded similar results (data not shown). Overall,
the neurological scales showed nonsignificant trends toward
improvement between baseline and 90 days, with no significant differences between groups (Table II). Mean difference
(and SD) of paired reader measurements was 1.57 mL
(3.83) for all measurements (intraclass correlation coefficient,
0.99).
Forty-seven patients experienced 252 AEs, of which 12
were SAEs (Table 1). No noticeable differences in the types,
frequency, or severity of AEs were observed between dose
groups. The most common AEs were fever (n19), headache
(n14), urinary tract infection (n12), hypertension (n11),
and constipation (n11). There were 5 thromboembolic or
ischemic and 6 potentially treatment-related AEs (Table 2).
Among the prespecified safety endpoints, there were 2 cases
of DVT detected at 72 hours, and 2 instances of clinically
significant new-onset electrocardiography changes without
troponin I elevation; there were no instances of PE, cerebral
infarction, venous thrombosis, consumption coagulopathy, or
clinical deterioration caused by unusual or excessive brain
edema.
Ten patients experienced 12 SAEs, including ICH-related
neurological deterioration (n6), subsequent detection of an
arteriovenous malformation that required surgery, delayed
unstable angina, pneumonia, urosepsis, dyspnea, and aforementioned DVT (each n1). Two of the 11 placebo-treated
patients and 3 of 36 rFVIIa-treated patients died during the
90-day trial period (11% mortality). All deaths occurred
within 7 days of admission; in each case, ICH was identified
as the primary cause of death.
No significant differences in coagulation parameters were
observed in patients given rFVIIa compared with placebo
(data not shown), with 2 exceptions: at 1 hour, INR values
were suppressed 0.6 at all doses (P0.003, ANCOVA),
and FVII:C activity showed an appropriate dose-related
increase (P0.0005, ANCOVA; Figure 2). These changes
had fully resolved at 24 hours. There was no significant
dose-related effect of rFVIIa on edema:ICH volume ratio
(Figure 3). Four patients were rated as having excessive brain
edema (edema:ICH ratio 2.5) at 72 hours; none of these
cases was associated with symptomatic deterioration.
Discussion
In this study, we administered a wide range of doses of
rFVIIa to 48 patients with acute ICH. Although rFVIIa has a
good safety profile in patients with hemophilia and other
bleeding disorders, experience with this agent in older,
noncoagulopathic patients with risk factors for cardiovascular
disease has been limited. Accordingly, our main concern was
detection of treatment-related thromboembolic or
coagulation-related AEs. rFVIIa was generally well-tolerated,
and only 6 possible treatment-related AEs occurred, including
2 cases of DVT (in the placebo and 20-g/kg groups). A
parallel study of 40 ICH patients that tested a lower range of
doses has demonstrated a similar safety profile.16
For hemostatic therapy to effectively inhibit ongoing
bleeding, early treatment is essential.8 In the prospective
study by Brott et al that demonstrated a 38% frequency of
ICH growth in patients initially scanned within 3 hours,
enlargement had already occurred 1 hour after the baseline
scan in two-thirds of cases.4 By extrapolating Brott’s data,
even if a hemostatic agent works perfectly, one might expect
a growth rate as high as 26% with a mean CT-to-needle time
of 60 minutes, or 17% if this interval is 30 minutes.8 In the
current study, mean time from symptom onset to treatment
was 181 minutes, and the mean “CT-to-needle” time was 69
minutes. In ongoing studies, we have modified the trial
protocol to minimize unnecessary treatment delays related to
the baseline assessment and randomization process.
A wide range of rFVIIa doses have been found to effectively inhibit bleeding in a variety of conditions, emphasizing
the need for dose-finding studies in ICH.17 In this study,
patients were enrolled in dose tiers in an ascending manner.
The lowest dose in this study of 10 g/kg was used because
the first signs of effect of rFVIIa on measured laboratory
parameters occur at this dose in healthy volunteers.18 The
highest dose used was 160 g/kg because this dose has been
shown to be safe in healthy volunteers and hemophilic
patients.17,18
Only 6 of 252 AEs (2.4%) were considered possibly or
probably treatment-related by the local investigator. Of these,
3 were potentially thromboembolic: 2 instances of DVT
detected at 72 hours (placebo, 20 g/kg), and 1 instance of
T-wave inversion on electrocardiography at 24 hours, which
did not meet enzyme criteria for myocardial infarction. There
were 12 SAEs overall, including one of the aforementioned
cases of DVT, and a patient in the 20-g/kg dose group in
Mayer et al Safety and Feasibility of Factor VIIa for ICH 77

whom unstable angina developed 29 days after randomization, which was judged as unlikely to be related to treatment.
The other 10 SAEs were nonthromboembolic in nature,
consistent with the natural history of ICH, and deemed
unlikely to be related to treatment.
Thrombin has been hypothesized as edema-generating.19
To evaluate whether rFVIIa exacerbated perihematoma
edema, edema-to-ICH volume ratios were compared between
dose groups. Although visual inspection suggests a trend
toward lower edema-to-ICH ratios at higher doses, we found
no significant differences (Figure 3). We also found no
evidence of subclinical activation of systemic coagulation,
which is in accordance with findings in patients with hemophilia15,20 and in warfarin-treated normal volunteers.18
FVII:C activity, which measures in vivo biological activity
of rFVIIa, showed a dose-response effect at 1 hour that
completely resolved by 24 hours, consistent with the 2.6-hour
half-life of rFVIIa.21 The magnitude of these elevations were
equivalent to those observed in patients with hemophilia20
and anticoagulated normal subjects18 given similar doses.
The overall frequency of ICH growth in our study, defined
as a 33% or 12.5-mL increase from baseline, was 20% at 24
hours, which is lower than the 38% frequency found in
Brott’s prospective study. Two retrospective studies of ICH
patients scanned within 3 hours of onset reported frequencies
of ICH growth of 18% and 36%.5,7 The comparatively low
rate of ICH growth observed in our study might be related to
random sample variation, as suggested by the fact that ICH
growth occurred in only 1 of 11 placebo-treated patients.
There were no significant differences in percent change in
ICH volume between placebo and the dose groups tested, but
the number of patients in each group was too small to allow
meaningful comparisons.
In summary, acute treatment of ICH patients with rFVIIa is
feasible and in this small phase II study was safe across a
wide range of doses. A large (n400) multicenter trial of
similar design comparing 40, 80, and 160 g/kg rFVIIa with
placebo is currently underway to determine whether this
treatment can effectively limit ICH growth. Given the current
lack of effective medical and surgical therapies for ICH, our
findings indicate that larger studies investigating the potential
efficacy of rFVIIa for limiting early expansion are justified.
