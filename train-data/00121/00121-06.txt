Obejective:To explore the clinical value of recombinant activated factor Ⅶa(rFⅦa) in depressing early hematoma extensions of cerebral hemorrhage.Methods: Sixty-four patients with cerebral hemorrhage which were imaged with CT within 6 hours after symptom onset were divided into therapy group(rFⅦa group) and control group randomly.The patients in therapy group were treated with intravenous rFⅦa 40 μg·kg-1,and those in control group received conventional therapy.The two groups were compared in hematoma size variation,GCS and NIHSS scores at pre-therapy and 24 hours after therapy,and mRS score at 3 months after onset.Results: All patients undertook CT check over 24 hours after onset.Four patients(12.5%) and 11 patients(34.4%) in the therapy and control group showed hematoma increment greater than 33%,respectively(P0.05).Twenty-four hours after therapy,the GCS scores of therapy group were higher than those of control group(P0.05),while the NIHSS scores of therapy group were lower than those of control group(P0.05).Evaluation with mRS scores between 0~3 3 months after onset showed the efficacy rates were 84% and 59% for the therapy and control group respectively.No adverse reactions occurred clinically.Conclusion: rFⅦa can depress the expansion of the hematoma in early cerebral hemorrhage.
