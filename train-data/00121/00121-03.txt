OBJECTIVE: Anticoagulation-treated patients presenting with intracranial hemorrhage, including subdural hematoma, epidural hematoma, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and intracerebral hemorrhage, require urgent correction
of their coagulopathy to prevent worsening hemorrhage and to facilitate surgical intervention when necessary.
In this study, we compared the use of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) with that of Factor IX complex concentrate
(FIXCC) to achieve rapid correction of warfarin anticoagulation.
METFIODS: Patients admitted to a tertiary care center with computed tomography-proven intracranial hemorrhage
and a prothrombin time of more than 17 seconds were considered for inclusion in the study protocol. Complete
data sets were obtained for eight patients randomized to treatment with FFP and five patients randomized to
treatment with FFP supplemented with FIXCC. The prothrombin time and International Normalized Ratio were
measured every 2 hours for 14 hours. Correction of anticoagulation was defined as an International Normalized
Ratio of ^1.3.
RESULTS: A difference in repeated International Normalized Ratio measurements during the first 6 hours of
correction was observed between the FIXCC and FFP groups ( P < 0.03). The rate of correction was greater (P < 0.01)
and the time to correction was shorter (P < 0.01) for the FIXCC-treated group. No difference in neurological outcomes
was detected between groups, but a higher complication rate was observed for the FFP-treated group.
CONCLUSION: The use of FIXCC accelerated correction of warfarin-related anticoagulation in the presence of
intracranial hemorrhage. (Neurosurgery 45:1 1 13-1 1 19, 1999)

traumatic intracranial h em o rrh ag e are reported to be 76 and
79%, respectively (9). The outcom es for patients w h o experience aneurysm al su b a ra c h n o id h e m o rrh a g e w hile receiving
w arfarin are w orse than those for the general p o pu latio n (12).
O ne series of 200 patients w ith spo n tan eo us ICH found 14%
to be related to therapeutic anticoagulation (11).
Anticoagulation therapy for patients with intracranial hem orrhage requires rapid correction, for two reasons. First, persistent
anticoagulation m ay involve a risk of h em atom a enlargem ent
and, therefore, increases in m orbidity and mortality rates. Figure
1 provides an example of such a case. These scans dem onstrate
the expansion of thalamic hem orrhage with intraventricular extension during 3 hours of uncorrected warfarin coagulopathy.
Second, the risks of intraoperative and postoperative hem orrhagic complications posed by anticoagulation m ay delay urgent
operations.
S tandard treatm ent of w arfarin anticoagulation has involved ad m in istratio n of vitam in K a n d fresh frozen p lasm a
(FFP). H ow ever, because the concentrations of vitam in
K -dependent clotting factors in FFP m ay vary considerably,

Rapid Warfarin Correction 1115
Patients random ized to the FFP g ro u p u n d e rw e n t urgent
placement of an internal jugular central venous pressure
(CVP) m onitor. CVP m on ito rin g w as perform ed for this
group to reduce the risk of fluid overload w ith higher-volum e
plasma in fu sio n s. S im u lta n e o u s ly , v ita m in K w a s injected
subcutaneously and FFP infusion w as begun. FFP w as infused
as quickly as possible w ith o u t causing clinical fluid overload.
Fluid status w as evaluated using p aram eters such as oxygen
saturation, chest x-ray, chest auscultation, and jugular venous
distention results. F urosem ide w as adm inistered intravenously to m aintain the CV P below 12 m m H g th ro u g h o u t

PTs and INRs w ere tested at regular intervals (2, 4, 6, 8, 10,
and 14 h) for 14 h o u rs after the enrollm ent of each patient in
the study. Patients in the FIXCC g ro u p also u n d e rw e n t PT
and INR checks im m ediately before and after FIXCC a d m in ­
istration, to assess the m axim al rate of correction achieved
with the concentrate. D em og raph ic data, including patient
weight, age, and indications for w arfarin anticoagulation,
were recorded. G lasgow C o m a Scale scores at the time of the
initial evaluation a n d at d isch arg e w ere reco rd ed , as w ere any

The time point at w hich each patient m et all criteria for
inclusion w as considered the starting point for correction. The
time to correction w as defined as the elapsed tim e from the
initiation of the protocol to the tim e of the blood sam ple that
documented correction (IN R of < 1 .3 ). The rate of correction
for each g r o u p w a s c a lc u la te d as th e c h a n g e in IN R (A IN R ),
from protocol initiation to correction, divided by the time to
correction. A second rate of correction w as also calculated for
the FIXCC g ro u p , to describe the rate of change in PT d u rin g
FIXCC infusion. T his ra te w a s c a lc u la te d as th e A IN R b e tw e e n
initiation and term ination of FIXCC infusion divided by the
time of infusion. The total AINR d u rin g correction w as calculated by subtracting the IN R at the p o in t of correction (INR of
<1.3) from the INR at presentation. The change in the G lasgow Coma Scale score d u rin g hospitalization w as calculated
by subtracting the value at adm ission from the value at
discharge.
The rate of correction, tim e to correction, and total AINR

eight patients treated w ith o u t FIXCC d u rin g the treatm ent
protocol and the six treated before protocol initiation. Data
analysis used single-factor A N O V A . All prospective and retrospective data collection w as conducted u n d e r guidelines
ap p ro v ed by the U niversity of M ichigan Institutional Review
Board.
RESULTS
For the 13 patients included in the data analysis, no significant differences in patient age (P = 0.19) or w eight (P = 0.24)
w ere noted. There w as no difference in the total AINR d u rin g
correction betw een the tw o groups. The m ean AINR w as 1.7 ±
0.37 for the FIXCC group, com pared w ith 1.45 ± 0.27 for the
stan d ard treatm ent gro up (P = 0.58). The tw o g ro u p s w ere
therefore balanced w ith respect to age, w eight, and extent of
w arfarin anticoagulation.
Significant differences w ere found in the tim e to correction,
rate of correction, a n d v o lu m e of FFP re q u ire d for co rrection. The tim e to correction w as 2 .9 5 ± 0 .4 6 h o u rs for the
FIXCC group and 8.9 ± 1.51 hours for the standard treatm ent
group (P < 0.01). The rate of correction w as 0.63 ± 0.18 A IN R /h
for the FIXCC group and 0.18 ± 0.03 A IN R /h for the standard
treatm ent group (P < 0.01). The volum e of FFP required w as
399 ± 271 ml for the FIXCC group and 2712 ± 346 ml for the
standard treatm ent group (P < 0.0007). The rate of correction
during FIXCC infusion w as calculated by com paring the INRs
im mediately before and after infusion. This rate w as 4.70 ± 1.49
AINR/h, com pared w ith 0.63 ± 0.18 A IN R /h during the entire
period from patient presentation to correction for the FIXCC
group. Finally, com parison of repeated INR m easurem ents
during the first 6 hours of the protocol revealed a significant
difference betw een groups (P < 0.03) (Fig. 2).
The tim e to correction w ith FFP alone w as 25.4 ± 7 hours
for the retrospective g ro u p (n = 6), com pared w ith 8.9 ± 1 . 3
hours for the protocol g ro u p (n = 8) an d 11.2 ± 4.2 hours for
the post-protocol g ro u p (n = 6). C om parison of these times
revealed a significant g ro u p effect (P < 0.02). H ow ever, su b analysis revealed no difference betw een patients treated w ith ­
out FIXCC d u rin g the protocol and after the protocol (Fig. 3).
A lthough no com plications w ere observed for the FIXCC
group, five of the eight patients treated w ith o u t FIXCC experienced significant com plications of fluid overload (Table 1).

group (W ilcoxon rank-sum test, P = 0.29). Therefore, no im ­
p ro v em en t in outcom es could be attributed to the use of
FIXCC. For the total of 21 patients w h o m et the inclusion
criteria, tw o deaths occurred am o n g the 8 patients in the
FIXCC stu d y arm (7 5 % survival rate), w hereas five deaths
occurred am on g the 13 patients in the FFP arm (6 2 % survival
rate). Four of the five patients in the FIXCC arm u n d e rw e n t

DISCUSSION
The present stud y dem onstrates that FIXCC can be used to
effectively correct anticoagulation, in the presence of either
traum atic or nontraum atic intracranial hem orrhage, for p a ­
tients u n d erg o in g w arfarin anticoagulation therapy. A nticoagulation correction w as achieved substantially faster for p a ­
tients treated w ith FIXCC than for their counterparts treated
w ith FFP alone. A dm inistration of FIXCC required sm aller
volum es and no additional invasive m onitoring. A ccordingly,
few er volum e-related com plications w ere encountered in this
group.

affected by h em o rrh ag e characteristics, the use of surgery,
and the rate of anticoagulation correction. N evertheless, the
present study has justified future investigation. Objective
measures of im p ro v ed clinical courses m ight include the interval from arrival in the em ergency w a rd to the beginning of
clot evacuation, the le n g th of th e in ten siv e care u n it stay, a n d
the cost of care, in ad d itio n to obvious survival and functional
outcome data. G iven the cu rren t incidence of w arfarin-related
hem orrhaging ep iso d es at o u r institution (1 / m o ), such a
study of outcom es w o u ld require the participation of m ultiple
centers.
Makris et al. (8) co m p ared the effects of 25 to 50 IU /k g
doses of the vitam in K -d ep en d en t clotting factor concentrates
prothrombin com plex concentrate (BPL, Elstree, U nited K ingdom) and P rothrom plex T (Im m u n o , Vienna, A ustria) w ith
those of 800 ml of FFP for patients requiring em ergency
correction of w arfarin anticoagulation. Those investigators
did not report the tim e necessary for correction or patient
outcom es, b u t th e y d o c u m e n t e d th e IN R s a n d F a c to r IX lev els
measured before an d 15 m in u tes after treatm ent. The patient
population in that stu d y w as not restricted to individuals w ith
intracranial hem orrhage. C lotting concentrates provided correction to a m ed ian INR of 1.3, w hereas 800 ml of FFP p ro ­
vided correction to an INR of 2.3. These results agree w ith
those of the present study. The m ean volum e of FFP necessary

that 800 ml greatly u n d erestim ated the volum e necessary for
correction. A lthough different concentrates w ere used in the
two stu d ie s, s im ila r d o s i n g w a s u s e d for F acto r IX. M a k r is et

trate adm inistration, in co m p ariso n w ith the value of 3 hours
reported in the present study. H ow ever, M akris et al. (8) did
not m easure tim e after arrival in the em ergency room , nor did
they achieve correction for all patients. INRs after concentrate
adm inistration for the cohort in that stu d y ranged from 0.9 to
3.8. As in the present study, no throm botic com plications
w ere noted am o n g the 29 patients w h o received vitam in
K -dependent factor concentrates.
A lthough no acute com plications w ere observed in our
g ro u p treated w ith FIXCC, side effects and toxicity have been
reported for this pooled blood product. Patients infrequently
experience an allergic skin reaction. Throm botic com plications, including deep venous throm bosis, p u lm o n a ry em b o ­
lisms, and diffuse intravascular coagulation, have been reported (7). These com plications are observed p red o m in an tly
in patients undergoing surgical procedures involving extensive
muscle dissection (orthopedic procedures), patients with m u scular crush injuries, and patients with liver disease. In the latter
case, throm bosis is th o u g h t to result from an inability to clear
activated clotting factors. For m any of the reported patients,
multiple doses of FIXCC w ere adm inistered for a single hem orrhagic diathesis episode (7). Acute myocardial infarction after
FIXCC adm inistration has also been reported (1), usually in
association with large and repeated doses. For this reason, we
chose to correct vitamin K -dependent factors to 50% , a value
sufficient for norm al hemostasis but low enough to minim ize the
risks of thrombosis. The fact that the rate of correction during
FIXCC adm inistration (4.7 ± 1.487 A IN R/hr) far exceeded the
overall rate of 0.63 ± 0.18 A IN R/h suggests that the rate of
correction could be im proved with either larger or repeated
FIXCC doses. H ow ever, such a change w ould likely increase the
rate of thrombotic complications.
The risk of viral transm ission associated w ith ad m in istration of a pooled blood p ro d u ct also requires consideration.
Neurosurgery, Vol. 45, No. 5, November 1999

Cases of hepatitis transm ission to recipients of coagulation
factor com plex have been reported (2). To inactivate viral
agents, FIXCC is currently treated w ith exposure to 80°C for
72 hours. O ne stu d y show ed that adm inistration of FIXCC
experim entally tainted w ith 2 500 tim es the m inim al infectious
titer of n o n -A /n on -B hepatitis failed to transm it infection to
chim panzees after heat inactivation at 68°C for 72 h o u rs (10).
In addition, the screening of blood com po n en ts for hepatitis
has im proved in the last decade, m arkedly low ering hepatitispositive plasm a specim ens in pooled h u m a n m aterial. D espite
these im provem ents, the adm inistration of pooled blood
prod u cts continues to involve infectious risk. The ap p ro x im ate risk of acquiring h u m a n im m unodeficiency virus infection from a transfusion is n o w less th an 1 / 4 0 ,0 0 0 units of
blood tran sfu sed , an d the risk of acq u irin g hepatitis C is
1 / 1 0 ,0 0 0 units (3, 4).
A lthough the present stu d y w as ran d o m ized , it w as not
blinded. The authors involved in seru m sam pling and o rganization of the delivery of plasm a w ere aw are of the stud y
group of the patients. The clinical laboratories w ere blinded
w ith respect to patient status w h en determ ining PT and INR
values. The need to deliver large volum es of plasm a, w ith the
accom panying requirem ent for m onitoring, renders blinded
com parison of FFP and FIXCC im practical. Therefore, the bias
that accom panies all u nb lin d ed studies m u st be considered
w h en the present data are analyzed.
The expansion of m edical indications for the use of w arfarin
is likely to increase the incidence of h em o rrh ag ic com plications. Patients experiencing these hem orrhagic com plications
often benefit from volum e adm inistration d u rin g correction
because they are hypovolem ic. C onversely, patients w ith ICH
are typically not hypovolem ic; therefore, fluid adm inistration
presents a risk for this patient population. The high incidence
of cardiac disease am o n g patients u n d erg o in g anticoagulation
w ith w arfarin renders these patients particularly vulnerable
to fluid overload. In addition, hypervolem ia m ay involve the
risk of intracranial pressure elevation. The need to limit volum e adm inistration m ay justify the use of FIXCC. Until virusfree preparations of vitam in K -d ep en den t factors are available, clinicians m u st w eigh infectious and prothrom botic risks
against the risks of delayed coagulopathy correction and fluid
overload. W e recom m end the use of FIXCC for patients w ith
life-threatening intracranial h em o rrh ag e or for patients w ho
are unlikely to tolerate the 2 to 3 liters of colloid necessary for
FFP correction.

involve a higher risk of throm boem bolic complications than do
nonactivated preparations such as Prothrom plex (Baxter, Vienna, Austria). A new developm ent in this field involves the use
of recom binant an tico ag u latio n factors. T hese factors w o u ld
eliminate the risk of virus contam ination. Some prom ising results with recom binant factor VIIA concentrate (NovoSeven;
Novo Nordisk AS, C openhagen, D enm ark) have been published
(1). It is n e c e ssa ry to s t u d y this p r e p a r a tio n in n e u ro s u rg ic a l
settings. Finally, all physicians should rem em b er that the best
way to m anage anticoagulation-related hem o rrh ag in g episodes is to p re v e n t th em . T herefore, the in d icatio ns for a n ticoagulation should be review ed for all patients receiving a n ­
ticoagulation treatm ent. Studies have sh o w n that the highest
risks of w arfarin-related h e m o rrh a g in g are associated w ith
insufficient indications for anticoagulation treatm ent, insufficient duration of anticoagulation, and inad eq uate control of
anticoagulation treatm en t (2).

This is an interesting a n d clinically relevant rep o rt that
demonstrates the rap id an d effective reversal of w arfarin
anticoagulation using a com bination of FIXCC w ith FFP and
vitamin K. T he a d v a n ta g e s of th is a p p r o a c h a re n o t o n ly in
accelerating the norm alization of the p ro th ro m b in tim e but
also in avoiding the fluid o v erload com plications that result
from the large volum es of FFP that are necessary in the absence
of FIXCC. The m a in d r a w b a c k of this a p p r o a c h is in the u se of
pooled blood products to provide sufficient am ounts of FIXCC,
with the inherent risk of viral transmission.
The ultim ate benefit of such an ap p ro ach , h o w ev er, is in
improving the outcom es for patients experiencing w arfarininduced intracranial h em orrh ag e. A lthough this series does
not dem onstrate clear neurological benefits, it is quite possible
that a larger series m i g h t d o so. It is also critical to e v a lu a te th e
timing of the therapy in relation to the onset of hem orrhage,
because referral to tertiary care centers involves an associated
risk of delays in the initiation of the therapy.

of the use of FIXCC for the treatm ent of patients w ith intracranial hem o rrh ag e com plicating w arfarin anticoagulation
therapy. As the authors point out, the use of w arfarin seem s
to be increasing, because other random ized studies have d e m ­
onstrated the overall benefits of such treatm ent for patients
w ith certain cardiovascular conditions. This has led to an
increase in the n u m b er of patients w ith w arfarin-related intracranial h em o rrh age treated by neurosurgeons. As the a u ­
thors correctly point out, one of the m ajor d angers of FFP
ad m in istratio n is the precipitation of v o lu m e overload in p a ­
tients w h o m ight have significant cardiac disease.
This stu d y is rem arkable because the au th o rs have cond u cted a very effective stu d y w ith a relatively sm all g ro u p of

analysis of clinical results, even w ith a relatively sm all n u m ­

The authors have conducted a clinical trial to test the efficacy of FIXCC in correcting w arfarin-induced coagulopathy.
In one arm of the trial, patients received FFP infusions and
s u b c u ta n e o u s ly a d m in is te re d v ita m in K. In th e o th e r a rm of
the trial, the patients received an a m o u n t of FIXCC that w as
e x p e c te d to co rrect F actor IX levels to 5 0 % of n o r m a l, in
ad d itio n to FFP an d vitam in K. Both treatm en t g ro u p s received continuous treatm ent until the International N o rm a lized Ratio w as corrected to 1.3 or less. The patients w h o
received FIXCC experienced correction 3 tim es m ore rapidly
(3 versus 9 h) and required less than one-quarter of the FFP
n eeded by patients in the other g ro u p (630 versus 2 9 0 0 ml).
These differences are dram atic an d, intuitively, they could be
considered clinically im portant. Flow ever, there are potential
risks associated w ith the use of FIXCC, including transm ission
of viral diseases and throm botic com plications, in addition to
the a d d ed cost of the product. In this small trial (n = 13), the
authors did not encounter any com plications w ith the use of
FIXCC. C onversely, they w ere unable to show any difference
in n e u r o lo g ic a l o u t c o m e s b e t w e e n th e t w o g r o u p s . I s u s p e c t ,
h o w ev er, that future risk /b en efit analyses will d e m o n stra te a
role for FIXCC in the treatm ent of patients w ith intracranial
hem orrhag e associated w ith w arfarin-induced coagulopathy.
In th e m e a n t i m e , I t h i n k it is r e a s o n a b l e to c o n s i d e r th e u s e of
FIXCC or similar products for individuals w ith life-threatening
hem orrhaging a n d /o r congestive failure, for w h o m rapid correction and low infusion volum es are likely to be of som e benefit.
