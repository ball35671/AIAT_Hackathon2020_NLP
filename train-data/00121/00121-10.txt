Background
Intracerebral hemorrhage is the least treatable form of stroke. We performed this
phase 3 trial to confirm a previous study in which recombinant activated factor VII
(rFVIIa) reduced growth of the hematoma and improved survival and functional
outcomes.
Methods
We randomly assigned 841 patients with intracerebral hemorrhage to receive placebo (268 patients), 20 μg of rFVIIa per kilogram of body weight (276 patients), or
80 μg of rFVIIa per kilogram (297 patients) within 4 hours after the onset of stroke.
The primary end point was poor outcome, defined as severe disability or death according to the modified Rankin scale 90 days after the stroke.
Results
Treatment with 80 μg of rFVIIa per kilogram resulted in a significant reduction in
growth in volume of the hemorrhage. The mean estimated increase in volume of the
intracerebral hemorrhage at 24 hours was 26% in the placebo group, as compared
with 18% in the group receiving 20 μg of rFVIIa per kilogram (P=0.09) and 11% in
the group receiving 80 μg (P<0.001). The growth in volume of intracerebral hemorrhage was reduced by 2.6 ml (95% confidence interval [CI], −0.3 to 5.5; P=0.08) in
the group receiving 20 μg of rFVIIa per kilogram and by 3.8 ml (95% CI, 0.9 to 6.7;
P=0.009) in the group receiving 80 μg, as compared with the placebo group. Despite
this reduction in bleeding, there was no significant difference among the three
groups in the proportion of patients with poor clinical outcome (24% in the placebo group, 26% in the group receiving 20 μg of rFVIIa per kilogram, and 29% in
the group receiving 80 μg). The overall frequency of thromboembolic serious adverse
events was similar in the three groups; however, arterial events were more frequent
in the group receiving 80 μg of rFVIIa than in the placebo group (9% vs. 4%,
P=0.04).
Conclusions
Hemostatic therapy with rFVIIa reduced growth of the hematoma but did not improve survival or functional outcome after intracerebral hemorrhage. (ClinicalTrials.

I
ntracerebral hemorrhage is the most
devastating form of stroke. Approximately
40% of patients with intracerebral hemorrhage die within 30 days, and the majority of survivors are left with severe disability.1,2 Hematoma
growth occurs in up to 70% of patients who have
intracerebral hemorrhage documented by computed tomographic (CT) scanning performed within
3 hours after the onset of symptoms.3,4 Furthermore, hemorrhage expansion is an independent
determinant of death and disability.4 In addition
to intracerebral-hemorrhage growth, other predictors of poor outcome include age, baseline volume of the hemorrhage, Glasgow Coma Scale
score, intraventricular hemorrhage, and infratentorial location.5
There is no proven treatment for intracerebral
hemorrhage.6 Given its prognostic significance,
hematoma expansion is an attractive therapeutic
target.7 Factor VIIa acts locally at sites of tissue
injury and vascular-wall disruption by binding to
tissue factor and thus generating small amounts
of thrombin sufficient to activate platelets. At
pharmacologic doses, recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) directly activates factor X on the
surface of activated platelets, resulting in a thrombin burst and acceleration of coagulation.8
We previously found that rFVIIa reduced the
growth of intracerebral hemorrhage when administered within 4 hours after the onset of symptoms.9 In addition, rFVIIa resulted in improved
survival and functional outcome at 90 days. In the
current study, we evaluated the effects of 20 μg
and 80 μg of rFVIIa per kilogram of body weight
on rates of death and severe disability after intracerebral hemorrhage.
Me thods
The Factor Seven for Acute Hemorrhagic Stroke
(FAST) trial was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted between May 2005 and February 2007 at 122 sites
in 22 countries. Written informed consent was
obtained from each patient or a legally acceptable surrogate, and the trial was approved by local
institutional review boards and national regulatory authorities, as applicable. The authors designed the trial protocol, directed the data analysis, and wrote the manuscript, whereas the sponsor
was responsible for trial operations, including data
analysis. The principal investigator (Dr. Mayer)
assumes full responsibility for the veracity and
completeness of the reported data.
PATIENTS
Patients 18 years of age or older with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage documented by CT
scan within 3 hours after the onset of symptoms
were eligible for enrollment. The exclusion criteria were a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 5 or less;
surgical evacuation of hematoma planned within
24 hours; secondary intracerebral hemorrhage resulting from trauma, arteriovenous malformation,
or other causes; known use of oral anticoagulant
therapy, thrombocytopenia, or coagulopathy; acute
sepsis, crush injury, or disseminated intravascular coagulation; pregnancy; previous disability
(prestroke modified Rankin scale score >2); and
known recent (<30 days before enrollment) thromboembolic disease (angina, claudication, deep-vein
thrombosis, cerebral infarction, or myocardial
infarction).
TREATMENT
The patients underwent block randomization according to site to receive a single intravenous dose
of placebo or of rFVIIa (NovoSeven, Novo Nordisk)
at a dose of 20 μg or 80 μg per kilogram. Treatment was administered within 1 hour after the
baseline CT scan and no later than 4 hours after
the onset of symptoms. The study drug was supplied as a freeze-dried powder and was reconstituted in sterile water before being administered
intravenously over a period of 2 minutes. Dosing
was based on estimated body weight. It was recommended that medical management conform
with the 1999 American Stroke Association guidelines for intracerebral hemorrhage.10
CT SCANNING
Follow-up CT scans were performed at target intervals of 24 hours (range, 21 to 27) and 72 hours
(range, 66 to 78) after drug administration. When
a 24-hour scan was not available within the specified time period, the first follow-up scan performed within 48 hours was analyzed. Digital CT
data were analyzed with the use of Analyze software (Mayo Clinic) by two neuroradiologists who
were unaware of the treatment assignment. The
volumes of intracerebral hemorrhage, intraventricular hemorrhage, and edema were calculated
with the use of computerized planimetric techniques and were evaluated as secondary end points.

We have previously shown that the inter­observer
reliability of this method is excellent.11
CLINICAL ASSESSMENTS
Clinical assessments were performed at enrollment; at 1 hour and 24 hours after drug administration; on days 2, 3, and 15 of hospitalization
(or at discharge if earlier); and on day 90 after the
stroke. Neurologic deficit was assessed according to scores on the Glasgow Coma Scale, which
range from 15 (normal) to 3 (deep coma),12 and
the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale
(NIHSS), which range from 0 (normal) to 42 (coma
with quadriplegia).13 The primary outcome measure was the score on the modified Rankin scale
at day 90.14 The modified Rankin scale evaluates
global disability and handicap; scores range from
0 (no symptoms or disability) to 6 (death). Secondary end points at day 90 included the Barthel index
(ranging from 100 [independent in all activities
of daily living] to 0 [completely dependent]),15 the
Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale,16 the NIHSS,
the EuroQol scale,17 and the Revised Hamilton
Rating Scale for Depression.18 At the 90-day follow-up, patients who had died were assigned a
Barthel index score of 0, and the last recorded
NIHSS score was carried forward.
SAFETY ASSESSMENTS
We recorded all adverse events until discharge and
all serious adverse events until day 90. Medical
events of special interest, defined as myocardial
infarction, ischemic stroke, deep-vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism, were subject to detailed reporting and expedited review. All medical events of special interest and serious adverse
events identified by local investigators were reported to an independent data and safety monitoring committee. In addition, all electrocardiograms,
centrally analyzed cardiac troponin I values, and
72-hour CT scans were reviewed by the data and
safety monitoring committee in order to identify
unreported cases of myocardial or cerebral is­chemia. The data and safety monitoring committee
compared the results for death, serious adverse
events, and medical events of special interest in
the three treatment groups after the enrollment
of every 75 patients.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
All analyses were based on the intention-to-treat
principle. The primary efficacy end point was severe disability or death, defined as a modified
Rankin scale score of 5 or 6 at day 90. The study
was powered to detect an odds ratio of poor outcome of 0.53 or less with active treatment as compared with placebo (on the assumption of a frequency of poor outcome of 45% in the placebo
groups and 30% in the treatment groups) on the
basis of a one-sided chi-square test, with a beta
level of 0.10 and an alpha level of 0.025. After a
planned sample-size review midway through the
trial that evaluated the proportion with poor
90-day outcomes in the pooled group of patients
receiving placebo and those receiving 80 μg of
rFVIIa per kilogram, the study population was
increased by 123 patients to a new target of 816.
The primary outcome measure was analyzed by
logistic regression, with treatment, age, sex, baseline volume of intracerebral hemorrhage, prestroke modified Rankin scale score, and location
(supratentorial or infratentorial) as covariates according to a prespecified statistical-analysis plan.
For surviving patients with missing outcome data,
the last observation was carried forward. The
scores on the Barthel index and the NIHSS were
analyzed with the use of an analysis-of-variance
model with the same covariates, with the baseline score on the Glasgow Coma Scale used instead of the modified Rankin scale score.
Lesion volumes on CT were analyzed with the
use of linear mixed models to yield estimated
mean values. The patient and the two scan readers were included as random effects, and treatment, baseline volume of intracerebral hemorrhage, time from onset of symptoms to baseline
CT scan, and time from baseline CT scan to treatment were included as fixed-effect covariates.
Percentage increases were log-transformed to obtain normality after the addition of 100 to eliminate negative values. The chi-square test was
used to compare the frequencies of arterial, venous, and all thromboembolic serious adverse
events in the three treatment groups at day 90.
Exploratory post hoc analyses were performed to
determine how the timing of treatment influenced the hemostatic effect of rFVIIa; whether
stratification according to age, baseline volume
of the hemorrhage, or timing of treatment influenced the clinical response to rFVIIa treatment;
and whether baseline predictors of thromboembolic serious adverse events could be identified.
All analyses were performed with SAS software,
version 8.2, on a UNIX platform.

BASELINE CHARACTERISTICS
A total of 8886 patients with intracerebral hemorrhage were screened; 841 were enrolled and underwent randomization, and 821 received the
study drug (Fig. 1). Baseline data from 20 patients who did not receive the study drug were
included in the intention-to-treat analysis; no data
for 90 days after the stroke were available for
these patients. The mean age was 65 years (range,
23 to 97), and 62% of the patients were male,
69% were white, 19% were Asian, and 9% were
black. The median Glasgow Coma Scale score
was 14 (range, 6 to 15), and the mean NIHSS
score was 13 (range, 0 to 38). The deep gray matter was involved in 78% of cases, and the lobar
regions were involved in 22%. The baseline characteristics of the three treatment groups were
similar, except that intraventricular hemorrhage
and, to a lesser extent, left ventricular hypertrophy (according to electrocardiographic criteria)
and coma (Glasgow Coma Scale score, 6 to 8)
occurred more frequently in the two groups receiving rFVIIa (Table 1). The mean volume of the

tients was 23.2 ml (range, 0.3 to 153.4) and was
similar in the three groups (Table 2).
The mean time from onset of symptoms to
baseline CT scan was 109±39 minutes, the mean
time from baseline CT scan to treatment was
51±17 minutes, and the mean time from onset
of symptoms to treatment was 160±37 minutes.
Seventeen percent of patients were treated within 2 hours after the onset of symptoms and 72%
within 3 hours; only one patient was treated outside the 4-hour time window. The timing of treatment was similar in the three groups (Table 1).
RADIOGRAPHIC OUTCOMES
A total of 819 CT scans performed at baseline and
794 performed at 24 hours were available for
analysis. The estimated mean increase in the volume of intracerebral hemorrhage was 26% in the
placebo group and 11% in the group receiving
80 μg of rFVIIa per kilogram; the increase in the
volume of hematoma was 3.8 ml less in the group
receiving 80 μg of rFVIIa than in the placebo
group (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.7 to 0.9;
P=0.009) (Table 2). The increase in the volume of
intracerebral hemorrhage in patients receiving
20 μg of rFVIIa per kilogram was 2.6 ml less than
that in patients receiving placebo (95% CI, 5.5 to
−0.3; P=0.08). In a post hoc analysis, the absolute reduction in the growth of intracerebralhemorrhage volume in patients receiving 80 μg
of rFVIIa per kilogram as compared with those
receiving placebo was even greater among patients

treated within 3 hours after the onset of symptoms (−4.5 ml; 95% CI, −8.0 to −1.0) and was
greater still among those treated within 2 hours
after onset (−5.6 ml; 95% CI, −13.1 to −2.0). However, there was no significant interaction between
treatment effect and the time from onset of symptoms to treatment.
Although the intraventricular-hemorrhage volume at 24 hours doubled in the placebo group
and was essentially unchanged in the group receiving 80 μg of rFVIIa per kilogram, the difference between the groups was not statistically
significant. Growth in volume of the total lesion
(intracerebral hemorrhage, intraventricular hemorrhage, and edema) was 7 ml less in the group
receiving 80 μg of rFVIIa per kilogram than in
the placebo group (P=0.06). However, the final
total lesion volumes at 72 hours were similar in
the three groups (Table 2). There were no significant differences among the three groups in
edema volume at 72 hours.
CLINICAL OUTCOMES
Mortality at 3 months was approximately 20% in
the three groups (Table 3 and Fig. 2). The primary
outcome measure (the proportion of patients
who died or were severely disabled) did not differ
significantly among the three groups (Table 3).
Similarly, the distribution of outcomes on the
modified Rankin scale (Fig. 3) and the median
scores on the Barthel index were similar among
the three groups. The NIHSS scores were significantly lower in the group receiving 80 μg of
rFVIIa per kilogram than in the placebo group,
but the magnitude of this difference was small
(Table 3).
In a series of exploratory post hoc analyses,
we tested the hypothesis that rFVIIa at a dose of
80 μg per kilogram may have benefited a subgroup of younger patients with smaller hemorrhages treated within an earlier time window.

* The numbers of patients at the top of the columns represent the intention-to-treat population. Percentages of patients with a poor outcome
(modified Rankin scale score of 5 or 6) were calculated on the basis of the number of patients with nonmissing day 90 values (264 in the
20-µg/kg group, 293 in the 80-µg/kg group, and 262 in the placebo group). Percentages of patients with one or more thromboembolic serious adverse events are based on the safety population (patients exposed to a study agent): 265 patients in the 20-µg/kg group, 293 in the
80-µg/kg group, and 263 in the placebo group. NIHSS denotes National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, and rFVIIa recombinant activated
factor VII.
† The modified Rankin scale evaluates global disability and handicap; scores range from 0 to 6. A score of 0 indicates no symptoms or disability, a score of 5 indicates bed-bound and incontinent, and a score of 6 indicates death. Outcome scores at day 15 were used according to
the principle of the last observation carried forward for 9 patients receiving placebo, 9 patients receiving 20 µg of rFVIIa per kilogram, and
13 patients receiving 80 µg of rFVIIa per kilogram (3.7% of patients overall) for whom scores at day 90 were missing. Modified Rankin
scale scores were not available for one patient receiving placebo and one patient receiving 20 µg of rFVIIa per kilogram.
‡ Odds ratios were adjusted for prestroke modified Rankin scale score, baseline volume of intracerebral hemorrhage, location of intracerebral
hemorrhage (infratentorial or supratentorial), age, and sex. The primary analysis used a one-sided chi-square test, under the hypothesis
that rFVIIa was superior to placebo. Since the estimated effect of rFVIIa went in the opposite direction, the one-sided P value was greater
than 0.50 and could not be determined exactly in the logistic-regression analysis because of the nonsymmetry of the chi-square distribution.
§ A score of 100 indicates complete independence in activities of daily living, and 0 indicates total dependence; patients who died before day
90 were assigned a score of 0. The treatment groups were compared with the placebo group by an analysis of variance on the ranks. Scores
for day 15 were analyzed when scores for day 90 were missing (3.9% of patients overall).
¶ A score of 0 indicates no neurologic deficit, and a score of 42 indicates coma with quadriplegia. Treatment groups were compared with the
placebo group by an analysis of variance on the ranks. For patients who died before day 90 (24.3% of patients overall), the last recorded
NIHSS score was carried forward.

** Arterial events include one case each of renal-artery thrombosis, intracardiac thrombus, and retinal-artery occlusion, all in the group receiving 80 µg of rFVIIa per kilogram. The frequency of arterial events was significantly increased in the group receiving 80 µg of rFVIIa per
kilogram as compared with the placebo group (P=0.04 by the chi-square test).

less (19% of the original study population), the
adjusted odds ratio for poor 90-day outcome with
rFVIIa was 0.28 (95% CI, 0.08 to 1.06; P=0.03).
ADVERSE EVENTS
The frequency of thromboembolic serious adverse
events reported by the investigators was similar
in the three groups (Table 3). There was no increase in the frequency of venous complications
with rFVIIa treatment; there was an absolute increase of 5% in the frequency of arterial thromboembolic serious adverse events in the group
receiving 80 μg of rFVIIa per kilogram as compared with the placebo group (P=0.04) (Table 3).
The frequency of elevated troponin I values was
15%, 13%, and 22%, and the frequency of STsegment elevation myocardial infarction was 1.5%,
0.4%, and 2.0% in the placebo group and the
groups receiving 20 μg and 80 μg of rFVIIa per
kilogram, respectively. CT evidence of acute cerebral infarction was identified by the data and
safety monitoring committee in 2.2%, 3.3%, and
4.7% of patients in the placebo group and the
groups receiving 20 μg and 80 μg of rFVIIa per
kilogram, respectively. Also identified as risk factors for thromboembolic serious adverse events
in a post hoc analysis were age (odds ratio per
5-year increase, 1.1; 95% CI, 1.0 to 1.2; P=0.02)
and previous use of an antiplatelet agent (odds
ratio, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.1 to 3.0; P=0.01), but not
rFVIIa treatment.
Discussion
In this study, rFVIIa given within 4 hours after
the onset of symptoms of intracerebral hemorrhage significantly reduced growth of the hematoma but failed to improve survival or functional
outcome at 90 days. This result contrasts with
the clinical benefit demonstrated in our phase 2b
trial, in which rFVIIa treatment produced a relative reduction in mortality of 38%.9 Possible explanations for these discrepant findings include
randomization imbalances, an increase in arterial thromboembolic events with rFVIIa treatment,
the inclusion of very elderly patients at high risk
for non-neurologic causes of death, and substantially better outcomes in the placebo group as
compared with our previous trial.
Our phase 2b trial compared doses of 40, 80,
and 160 μg of rFVIIa per kilogram with placebo
in 399 patients.9 All three rFVIIa doses produced
a reduction in intracerebral-hemorrhage growth
at 24 hours, from 29% in the placebo group to
14% in patients who received rFVIIa. We found
a similar hemostatic effect with the 80 μg per
kilogram dose in the present trial, with a reduction in the mean estimated increase in the volume of intracerebral hemorrhage from 26% to
11%. The dose of 20 μg per kilogram was associated with an 18% increase in the volume of bleeding, a result consistent with the dose-related
hemostatic effect observed in the phase 2b study.
Earlier treatment with 80 μg of rFVIIa per kilogram was associated with larger reductions in
the growth of intracerebral-hemorrhage volume,
which probably reflects the diminishing proportion of patients with active bleeding as time
elapses after the onset of symptoms. This finding suggests that rFVIIa might be more likely to
have clinical benefits if it were given earlier.
Patients with intracerebral hemorrhage who
are treated with rFVIIa are at increased risk for
arterial thromboembolic complications, most
commonly cerebral infarction and myocardial ischemia, as indicated by elevated troponin I concentrations.19 In our phase 2b trial, 5% of the
patients who were treated with rFVIIa had an arterial thromboembolic serious adverse event, as
compared with none of those who received placebo, and there was no increase in venous thromboembolic events. In the FAST trial, we found an
identical absolute increase of 5% in arterial throm22p3

boembolic serious adverse events in the group
receiving 80 μg of rFVIIa per kilogram as compared with the placebo group (9% vs. 4%), with
a higher overall frequency of events that was most
likely due to centralized screening of cardiac troponin levels. In a pooled analysis of 371 patients
with intracerebral hemorrhage treated with rFVIIa
at doses ranging from 5 to 160 μg per kilogram,
doses of 120 μg per kilogram or more were associated with a greater risk of arterial thromboembolic events.19 This finding had an important
role in our decision in the FAST trial to select
80 μg per kilogram as the optimal dose for balancing the hemostatic effect of rFVIIa against the
risk of thromboembolic complications. We included patients with a history (>30 days previously)
of thromboembolic disease; this group was excluded midway through our phase 2b trial. In the
present study, a post hoc analysis identified age
and previous use of antiplatelet agents, but not
rFVIIa treatment or a history of thromboembolic disease, as risk factors for a thromboembolic
serious adverse event. Since the safety profile of
rFVIIa in the present trial is similar to that in
our phase 2b trial, it seems unlikely that rFVIIarelated complications can explain the lack of a
beneficial treatment effect.
The patients enrolled in our two trials were
similar and were typical of patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage. In the present
trial, however, potentially important randomization imbalances were present. The most conspicuous of these is the proportion of patients with
intraventricular hemorrhage at baseline, which
varied from 29% in the placebo group to 41% in
the group receiving 80 μg of rFVIIa per kilogram. Intraventricular hemorrhage is a well-established determinant of poor outcome after intracerebral hemorrhage,20,21 and we previously found
that intraventricular hemorrhage blunts the clinical benefits of rFVIIa treatment.21 Other imbalances include the greater frequency of coma, the
greater frequency of left ventricular hypertrophy
according to baseline electrocardiography (Table 1), and the greater total lesion volume (intracerebral hemorrhage, intraventricular hemorrhage,
and edema) at baseline (Table 2) in the group
receiving 80 μg of rFVIIa per kilogram as compared with the placebo group. The imbalance in
total lesion volume may explain in part why the
present trial did not reproduce the significant
reduction in 72-hour total lesion volume demonstrated in our phase 2b study (53 ml for all rFVIIa
groups combined vs. 69 ml in the placebo group).
Although these randomization imbalances may
have contributed to the lack of clinical benefit
with rFVIIa treatment that we observed in this
trial, they are most likely only a minor part of
the explanation.
The placebo group in the FAST trial had much
more favorable outcomes than the placebo group
in the phase 2b trial. In the placebo group of the
FAST trial, the mortality rate was 19% and the
frequency of severe disability or death (modified
Rankin scale score of 5 or 6) was 24%, as compared with a 29% mortality rate and a 45% frequency of severe disability or death in the phase
2b trial.9 This discrepancy may reflect the higher
proportion of patients receiving placebo who
had intraventricular hemorrhage in the phase 2b
trial as compared with the FAST trial (44% vs.
29%). Other possible explanations include practice variations in the phase 3 trial resulting from
expansion to more sites, improvements in neurointensive care, or greater reluctance to withdraw
support from severely injured patients. The poor
outcome of the placebo group in the phase 2b
study may have also been a chance result, a possibility supported by the 20% overall mortality
rate in two trials of neuroprotective treatment
for intracerebral hemorrhage with study popu22p3

lations similar to ours that yielded negative results.22,23 As the outcome of intracerebral hemorrhage continues to improve, trial end points may
need to evaluate the full range of functional outcome, rather than focus specifically on mortality
and severe disability.
In summary, rFVIIa reduced hematoma growth
but did not reduce the rate of death or severe
disability after intracerebral hemorrhage. Whether this hemostatic effect can translate to clinical
benefit in a subgroup of patients at high risk for
active bleeding, either by treatment within an
earlier time window or by demonstration of intrahematomal contrast extravasation after CT angiography,24,25 deserves further study.
