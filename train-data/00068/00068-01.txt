Abstract : All cases diagnosed as tonsillitis were admitted to a penicillin ward or a control ward in Blegdam, on alternate days. The standard treatment was 150, 000 units of water soluble penicillin given intra-muscularly twice daily. For children aged 5 to 15, 120, 000 U., those from 1 to 5 had 90, 000 U. and infants under 1 year 60, 000 U. dosage. Criteria were temperature, exúdate, soreness of the throat and duration of the disease. Of the 174 penicillin-treated cases of acute tonsillitis 36 per cent, had positive cultures for streptococci, mainly of group A while among 175 controls the percentage was 31. In two-thirds of the treated cases streptococci disappeared in the first 24 hours, and only two had positive throat cultures on discharge whereas 29 (17 per cent.) of the controls were carriers.
The more favourable course of treated cases and the lessening of concurrent complications are noted, though there is no diminution of relapse rate. [Probably larger doses would have reduced this.]
In cases with peritonsillar suppuration incision could sometimes be avoided. There are no contra-indications to the use of penicillin whereas the sulphonamides are of little value and may do harm. C. C. Chesterman.
