Summary. The aim of the study was to explore whether
penicillin was superior to placebo in altering the clinical
course of proven streptococcal pharyngitis. A randomised, parallel, double blind placebo controlled trial of
10 days duration was undertaken in 42 general practices
in the Gent region (Flemish part of Belgium). Phenoxymethytpenicillin (adults 250 mg t.i.d, and children 125 mg
t. i. d.) or placebo were administrated to 173 patients, aged
5 to 50 y, with acute sore throat and a positive culture for
Group A ]3-haemotytic streptococci. Penicillin and placebo tablets were identical. Patient compliance was monitored by assay of penicillin in urine (Sarcina lutea
method).
The primary outcome variable was sore throat as recorded by the physician on Day 3. The experiences of the
patients themselves over the 10 day period were also assessed. Secondary outcome variables were other local and
general symptoms and signs of streptococcal throat infection.
In the penicillin group on Day 3, 23.2 % of the patients
still complained of sore throat versus 65.9 % in the placebo group: difference 42.7% (C.I. 29.4%, 56.1%). This
finding was confirmed by survival analysis of the symptom
'sore throat', as recorded by the patients. The physicians
recorded on Day 3 a significant positive effect on another
symptom (malaise: P < 0.04) and certain clinical signs (abnormal throat: P < 0.07; and redness of throat: P < 0.003).
Penicillin had more adverse effects than placebo
(P < 0.007). It also inhibited the rise in ASLO (P < 0.001).
In this study in general practice, penicillin had a slight
but definitive positive effect on the clinical evolution of
streptococcal pharyngitis. The clinical importance of this
finding is not certain, as the physician in the community
may lack the means to distinguish between viral and bacterial pharyngitis.
Key words: Penicillin, Pharyngitis; clinical trial
Penicillin has been administrated for streptococcal pharyngitis to prevent acute rheumatic fever ever since antibiotics became available. This management is based on
the Fort Warren studies [1].
It is remarkable that for many years no methodologically sound studies were done to investigate the influence
of antibiotics on the clinical course of streptococcal pharyngitis. Some authors have concluded therefore, that 'the
administration of antibiotics cannot be justified on the assumption that they relieve symptoms' [2].
In the past six years, two randomised, double blind, placebo controlled investigations have been done in children,
both of which demonstrated a beneficial effect of antibiotic therapy on the clinical course of Group A fl-haemolytic streptococcal (GABHS) pharyngitis [3, 4].
A randomised, double blind, placebo controlled trial
has now been undertaken to see whether in general practice, in children as well as in adults, penicillin had a favoutable effect on the clinical course of proven streptococcal
pharyngitis.
Patients and methods
In the Gent region (Flemish part of Belgium), in 1989, 42 general
practitioners were asked to perform a study in all male and female
patients, aged between 5 and 50 y, who presented an acute sore
throat for less than 5 days.
The exclusion criteria were: previous history of acute rheumatic
fever or poststreptococcal acute glomerutonephritis, use of antibiotics during the previous 14 days, allergy to beta-lactam antibiotics, and any high risk situation (as judged by the physician).
All patients were allocated to one of the two therapeutic regimens. The target population was retrospectively identified by means
of the results of a throat culture. Material for the throat culture was
collected before the therapy was installed. In this paper, only the outcome in the GABHS-positives is presented.
Culture
Two different media were inoculated for isolation: an SBA plate
(tryptic soy agar with 5 % sheep blood), and an ssA plate (5 % sheep
blood agar containing crystal violet, colistin, and trimethoprim sulphamethoxazote), all supplied by Becton Dickinson [5]. All plates

Abnormal throat: abnormalities of colour or form of the pharynx

were incubated at 36 °C in a 5 % CO2 atmosphere for 48 h, with a first
reading after 24 h. Growth was expressed semiquantitatively: 1 + if
fl-haemolytic streptococci were present in the first inoculation zone,
2 + when they were seen in the second zone too, and 3 + when they
were detected in all streaked areas.
All GABHS-positive patients were tested on Day 3 and
Day 20.
On Day 3, an urine specimen was obtained in the physician's office for assay for the presence of antimicrobial
activity by the method of Charney [6]. The absence of Sarcina lutea in cultures from the placebo group, and the
growth of this bacteria in the penicillin group were interpreted as violation of compliance.
Statistical methods
Statistical analyses were done on a PC with the
SPSSPC + statistical program, except for the survival analysis, which was performed on SPSS-X, and the use of
SAS for the logistic regression. Appropriate tests were selected for comparison of patient characteristics (Fisher's
exact test and Wilcoxon rank test, Z 2, Pearson r correlation) and outcomes on Day 3 (Fisher exact test). Correction of the treatment effect for differences in covariates
was done by logistic regression, as the outcome variable is
a nominal dependent variable. Survival analysis (LeeDesu statistics) was performed for the data ~om the diary
cards.
P < 0.05 was accepted as significant. Bonferroni's correction for multiple measures was applied.
Intervention
Patients were randomised to receive penicillin or placebo.
Identical tablets of phenoxymethylpenicillin (250 mg for
adults and 125 mg for children up to 10 years) and placebo
were prepared by the Laboratory for Pharmaceutical Technology, University of Gent (Director Prof. Dr.
J. E Remon). Quality control was performed on weight,
friability, hardness and disintegration time, and was satisfactory. Medication was delivered in a double-blind manner.
Penicillin and placebo were administered three times a
day. Patients (or their relatives) were instructed in the use
of aspirin or acetaminophen as needed to control fever
and pain. The use of these medications was noted on the
diary card and on the checklist. Topical preparations (gargles, tablets, sprays) were allowed.
Outcome measures
On Day 1, baseline symptoms and signs were recorded on
a checklist by the physician (Table 1). All patients were
asked to attend again on Day 3 for a second evaluation.
The main outcome measure was the difference between
Days 1 and 3 in sore throat, as the primary outcome variable, and in the other, secondary variables (Table 1).
Patients were asked to complete a diary card twice daily for 10 consecutive days. Information was obtained
about sore throat, body temperature, malaise, the use of
analgesics and whether the patient was able to perform
normal daily activities.
The ASLO was measured on Days 3 and 20, using the
NA Latex ASL-Reagent (Behring) and nephelometry.
Results
As the prevalence of GABHS infection was 27 %, 181 patients were admitted to the treatment groups: 87 who received penicillin and 94 on placebo. Because 8 patients

Fig, 1. Differences between placebo (n = 91) and penicillin (n = 82)
on Days 1 and 3 in symptoms and clinical signs (Physicians records)
(4.4 % ) dropped out (5 on penicillin and 3 on placebo), the
real penicillin group consisted of 82 patients and the placebo group of 91 patients (flom the physicians'records).
The treatment groups were comparable for most variables (Table 2) and no significant differences were found.
The percentage of patients in relation to the time of recruitment was: tO.6% in January, 9.3% in February,
10.4% in March, 11.2% in April, 8.4 % in May, 10.3 % in
June, 7.2 % in July, 5.1% in August, 6.1% in September,
11.3 % in October, 5.8 % in November, and 4.3 % in December.
As evaluated by the physician, 23.2 % of the penicillin
group had a sore throat versus 65.9% of the placebo
group: the difference was 42.7 % in favour of penicillin
(95% CI 29.4-56.1%; P<0.0001 Fisher's exact test;
Fig 1).
To obtain a clearer idea about the evolution of the sore
throat, data from patients' diary cards were analysed.
There was a response rate of 74.3 % (n = 136) and valid
data from73.5 % (n = 131); suitable records were available
from 61 patients in the penicillin group and 70 of those on
placebo. As for treatment groups according to the physicians' records, the two groups were comparable in allvariables. The mean duration of sore throat was 2.8 days (penicillin) versus 3.7 days (placebo), i. e. a gain of about one day in
symptom resolution (P < 0.001). The clinical importance
of this finding was checked by survival analysis (10 day
period), which confirmed the different evolution of sore
throat in the two groups (P < 0.001). The evolution of sore
throat in the two treatment groups is shown in Fig. 2.
For other symptoms and signs, as recorded by the physicians, differences between Days 1 and 3 were found in
malaise (P < 0.04), abnormal throat (P < 0.007), redness
of the throat (P < 0.001); see Fig. 1. Malaise was also noted
in the patient diary. The mean duration of malaise was
2.52 d (penicillin) and 2.28 d (placebo); P by survival
analysis was 0.04.
Although randomisation was succesful and no significant differences between the two treatment groups could
be detected (Table 2), it was decided to adjust the treatment effect with respect to the primary outcome variable
(difference in sore throat on Day 3). The baseline covariates and certain other intervening variables, such as the
concomitant use of analgesics, absenteeism and complicance, were analysed by a logistic regression.
The logistic regression showed a significant effect of
the type of treatment (P < 0.0001), while other variables
did not have any influence. This result provides strong
confirmation that the observed difference in treatment effect can be attributed to the difference in therapy (placebo
or penicillin).
A major point in the trial was the measurement of compliance. The overall violation of compliance measured on
Day 3 was 8.2 %: 4.8 % (penicillin) and 3.4 % (placebo). A
second analysis of the data, whit assignment of the patients to the group to which they really belonged, gave the
same treatment effect as in the original analysis.
The overall incidence of adverse effects was 14 % in the
treated patients, 20.8 % in patients treated with penicillin
and 5 % in the placebo group (P < 0.007). Subjective symptoms, such as itching, dysphagia and nausea, were more
frequent in the penicillin group. Penicillin inhibited the
rise in ASLO (P < 0.0009). No suppurative complications
were observed.
There was no effect at all of penicillin on the symptoms
or clinical findings in the GABHS-negative patients.
Discussion
Since penicillin became available, many studies have been
done to investigate its effect on the clinical evolution of
streptococcal pharyngitis, most in selected populations.
Several decades ago, studies were done in hospitalised
patients [7, 8] and in a military population [9, 10,11], none
of which were double blind or randomised. In the
Eighties, 5 clinical trials were done in children. The study
of Gerber et al [12] was not compliance controlled; Nelson's work [13] was not double blind; and the study by
Krober [14] has occasioned considerable comment because of its very small size (26 GABHS-positives).

Only the studies of Randolph et al (1985) and Pichichero et al (1987) fulfill most of the important methodological
criteria. Yet, in the trial of Randolph et al (1985), the placebo did not physically ressemble the antibiotics used (penicillin and cefadroxyl) [3]. "Furthermore, all patients
were instructed to avoid aspirin and acetaminophen
(28 %), but were non compliant in this regard. Therefore,
the study did not answer the more clinically practical question whether penicillin improves symptoms of streptococcal pharyngitis better than ad libitum use of antipyretic/analgetic drugs" [3].
The conclusions even of valid studies in a selected population of children, cannot be universally generalised to
the population in general practice.
In general practice, four clinical trials have been done.
Two studies were not controlled for compliance or antibody titre [15, 16]. The others were not double blind, nor
were they controlled for compliance or antibody titre [17,
18].
Thus, the present study appears to be the first in general practice, which has fullfilled the 10 methodological criteria mentioned above [3, 4]: prospective, randomised,
double blind, placebo controlled, compliance controlled
on urine, controlled on a 'gold standard', representative
population, comparable treatment group and direct observation.
The most important conclusion is that penicillin has a
positive effect on the clinical evolution of GABHS-pharyngitis. This was evident in our primary outcome variable
assessed by the physician (Fig. 1), and was confirmed by
the patients themselves (Fig. 2).
According to the physicians' records on Day 3, the difference between placebo and penicillin was 42,7 %. Secondary analyses confirmed the positive effect of penicillin
on other signs and symptoms: malaise and inflammed appearance of the throat. This result was obtained when
treatment was started, on average, 1-5 d after the onset of
the symptoms.
Body temperature here was not influenced, although it
was in other recent trials of penicillin. This was probably
due to the fact that only 62.5 % of the present patients had
fever on Day 1. In the study of Pichichero et al [3], fever
was one of the five signs or symptoms of which three had
to be present to gain entry to the study. In the trial of Randolph et al [4], all patients had fever on Day 1.
Analysis of the patients' diaries made it clear that the
difference between placebo and penicillin remained
significant on Day 4, up to 24 h after the administration of
penicillin ceased. The difference had disappeared from
Day 5. As many have stated, and as our results confirm,
the acute symptoms and signs of GABHS-pharyngitis are
selflimiting [15, 16, 19, 20].
The incidence of suppurative complications was too
low for measurement of a difference between the two
treatment strategies. This was also true in the study of
Pichichero et al [3].
In order to make an evaluation of the risk/benefit ratio
of penicillin, the adverse effects were evaluated; penicillin
produced more adverse effects than placebo. There is uncertainty about the long-term effects of antibiotic treatment of GABHS-pharyngitis. As in other trials [3], there
was a decrease in the immunological response in the penicillin-treated group. Randolph et al [4] did not find a significant difference in the rise in ASLO in the treated
groups. Some reselwation must be expressed about the
possibility of a promoting influence on recurrence of the
infection [3].
The conclusions of the study are important for the clinical management of sore throat and especially of GABHSpharyngitis in general practice.
If administreted within a short period after the onset of
symptoms, penicillin is helpful for patients with proven
streptococcal pharyngitis.
A delay in initiating penicillin therapy will result in persistent acute symptoms and clinical findings for 24 h. This
negative effect will be only seen in GABHS-positive patients (27 % here). Some of these patients will be carriers.
It seems very difficult to identify the latter group. To
obtain the beneficial effect of penicillin on the clinical
evolution of GABHS sore throat, the diagnosis must be
made immediately. The results of GABHS culture and
antibody titres take several days to obtain. Clinical diagnosis is no better than "flipping a coin" [21] and the sensitivity of Streptests is too low ( < 0.90) to replace culture
[22, 23].
On the other hand, postponement of treatment will
avoid the adverse effects of penicillin, it would not influence the rise in ASLO, and it might reduce the frequency
of reinfection by GABHS.
Like Pichichero et al (1987), we can finish with a question: "Is the immediate price worth the long term benefit?"
