Abstract
The effects of penicillin, aureomycin and terramycin on the clinical course of streptococcal tonsillitis and pharyngitis were compared in a controlled study. Under therapy with these agents most of the symptoms and signs subsided somewhat more rapidly than in control patients, leucocytosis was reduced and antibody formation was diminished; but in the dosage used no one drug was consistently most beneficial. Penicillin was the most effective drug in eradicating streptococci from the throat. Nausea and vomiting occurred frequently among the patients receiving aureomycin, and diarrhea was common in both the aureomycin and terramycin treated groups. Final determination of the drug of choice should await comparison of the effects on suppurative and nonsuppurative complications in larger groups of patients.
