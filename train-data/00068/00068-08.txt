Summary. The aim of the study was to explore whether
penicillin was superior to placebo in altering the clinical
course of proven streptococcal pharyngitis. A randomised, parallel, double blind placebo controlled trial of
10 days duration was undertaken in 42 general practices
in the Gent region (Flemish part of Belgium). Phenoxymethytpenicillin (adults 250 mg t.i.d, and children 125 mg
t. i. d.) or placebo were administrated to 173 patients, aged
5 to 50 y, with acute sore throat and a positive culture for
Group A ]3-haemotytic streptococci. Penicillin and placebo tablets were identical. Patient compliance was monitored by assay of penicillin in urine (Sarcina lutea
method).
The primary outcome variable was sore throat as recorded by the physician on Day 3. The experiences of the
patients themselves over the 10 day period were also assessed. Secondary outcome variables were other local and
general symptoms and signs of streptococcal throat infection.
In the penicillin group on Day 3, 23.2 % of the patients
still complained of sore throat versus 65.9 % in the placebo group: difference 42.7% (C.I. 29.4%, 56.1%). This
finding was confirmed by survival analysis of the symptom
'sore throat', as recorded by the patients. The physicians
recorded on Day 3 a significant positive effect on another
symptom (malaise: P < 0.04) and certain clinical signs (abnormal throat: P < 0.07; and redness of throat: P < 0.003).
Penicillin had more adverse effects than placebo
(P < 0.007). It also inhibited the rise in ASLO (P < 0.001).
In this study in general practice, penicillin had a slight
but definitive positive effect on the clinical evolution of
streptococcal pharyngitis. The clinical importance of this
finding is not certain, as the physician in the community
may lack the means to distinguish between viral and bacterial pharyngitis.
Key words: Penicillin, Pharyngitis; clinical trial
Penicillin has been administrated for streptococcal pharyngitis to prevent acute rheumatic fever ever since antibiotics became available. This management is based on
the Fort Warren studies [1].
It is remarkable that for many years no methodologically sound studies were done to investigate the influence
of antibiotics on the clinical course of streptococcal pharyngitis. Some authors have concluded therefore, that 'the
administration of antibiotics cannot be justified on the assumption that they relieve symptoms' [2].
In the past six years, two randomised, double blind, placebo controlled investigations have been done in children,
both of which demonstrated a beneficial effect of antibiotic therapy on the clinical course of Group A fl-haemolytic streptococcal (GABHS) pharyngitis [3, 4].
A randomised, double blind, placebo controlled trial
has now been undertaken to see whether in general practice, in children as well as in adults, penicillin had a favoutable effect on the clinical course of proven streptococcal
pharyngitis.
Patients and methods
In the Gent region (Flemish part of Belgium), in 1989, 42 general
practitioners were asked to perform a study in all male and female
patients, aged between 5 and 50 y, who presented an acute sore
throat for less than 5 days.
The exclusion criteria were: previous history of acute rheumatic
fever or poststreptococcal acute glomerutonephritis, use of antibiotics during the previous 14 days, allergy to beta-lactam antibiotics, and any high risk situation (as judged by the physician).
All patients were allocated to one of the two therapeutic regimens. The target population was retrospectively identified by means
of the results of a throat culture. Material for the throat culture was
collected before the therapy was installed. In this paper, only the outcome in the GABHS-positives is presented.
Culture
Two different media were inoculated for isolation: an SBA plate
(tryptic soy agar with 5 % sheep blood), and an ssA plate (5 % sheep
blood agar containing crystal violet, colistin, and trimethoprim sulphamethoxazote), all supplied by Becton Dickinson [5]. All plates

Abnormal throat: abnormalities of colour or form of the pharynx
and tonsils; presence of exudate or petechiae
were incubated at 36 °C in a 5 % CO2 atmosphere for 48 h, with a first
reading after 24 h. Growth was expressed semiquantitatively: 1 + if
fl-haemolytic streptococci were present in the first inoculation zone,
2 + when they were seen in the second zone too, and 3 + when they
were detected in all streaked areas.
All GABHS-positive patients were tested on Day 3 and
Day 20.
On Day 3, an urine specimen was obtained in the physician's office for assay for the presence of antimicrobial
activity by the method of Charney [6]. The absence of Sarcina lutea in cultures from the placebo group, and the
growth of this bacteria in the penicillin group were interpreted as violation of compliance.
Statistical methods
Statistical analyses were done on a PC with the
SPSSPC + statistical program, except for the survival analysis, which was performed on SPSS-X, and the use of
SAS for the logistic regression. Appropriate tests were selected for comparison of patient characteristics (Fisher's
exact test and Wilcoxon rank test, Z 2, Pearson r correlation) and outcomes on Day 3 (Fisher exact test). Correction of the treatment effect for differences in covariates
was done by logistic regression, as the outcome variable is
a nominal dependent variable. Survival analysis (LeeDesu statistics) was performed for the data ~om the diary
cards.
P < 0.05 was accepted as significant. Bonferroni's correction for multiple measures was applied.
Intervention
Patients were randomised to receive penicillin or placebo.
Identical tablets of phenoxymethylpenicillin (250 mg for
adults and 125 mg for children up to 10 years) and placebo
were prepared by the Laboratory for Pharmaceutical Technology, University of Gent (Director Prof. Dr.
J. E Remon). Quality control was performed on weight,
friability, hardness and disintegration time, and was satisfactory. Medication was delivered in a double-blind manner.
Penicillin and placebo were administered three times a
day. Patients (or their relatives) were instructed in the use
of aspirin or acetaminophen as needed to control fever
and pain. The use of these medications was noted on the
diary card and on the checklist. Topical preparations (gargles, tablets, sprays) were allowed.
Outcome measures
On Day 1, baseline symptoms and signs were recorded on
a checklist by the physician (Table 1). All patients were
asked to attend again on Day 3 for a second evaluation.
The main outcome measure was the difference between
Days 1 and 3 in sore throat, as the primary outcome variable, and in the other, secondary variables (Table 1).
Patients were asked to complete a diary card twice daily for 10 consecutive days. Information was obtained
about sore throat, body temperature, malaise, the use of
analgesics and whether the patient was able to perform
normal daily activities.
The ASLO was measured on Days 3 and 20, using the
NA Latex ASL-Reagent (Behring) and nephelometry.
Results
As the prevalence of GABHS infection was 27 %, 181 patients were admitted to the treatment groups: 87 who received penicillin and 94 on placebo. Because 8 patients
