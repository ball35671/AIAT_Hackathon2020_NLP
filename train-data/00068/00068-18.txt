A multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was conducted to determine whether the addition of penicillin was superior to patient
education and anti-inflammatory drug therapy for relief of the acutediscomforts of pharyngitis caused by grouP A E-hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS).
One hundred seventy-eight patients, aged 4 to 29 years, received appropriate
symptomatic therapy, including Specific doses of aspirin or acetaminophen,
plus penicillin (91 patients) or placebo (87) for the initial 48 hours of illness. All
had 24-hour office and 48-hour telephone reevaluations/In 123 patients (57 w!th
clinically severe.pharyngitis), throat cultures yielded GABHS. Penicillin provided a margin of 20% improvement over anti'inflammatory therapy for the
complaiht of sore throat only after 48 hours of treatment (for the 123 patients
with GABHS, p = 0.01; for the 57 with both severe pharyngitis and GABHS,
p = 0:05). No significant improvement was noted for fever, malaise, odynophagia, exudate, adenitiS, or pharyngitis. The failure of penicillin to provide
much additional benefit makes its routine early prescription specifically for
symptomatic relief questionable. (J PEDIATR 1988;113:1089-94)
Over the past 35 years, clinical trials have established the
efficacy of antibiotics, particularly penici!lin, in modifying
the natural course of pharyngitis caused by group A
/3-hem01ytic streptococcus? -8 Little debate persists that
penicillin reduces the complication rate and Drgcly eliminates pharyngeal streptococci, at least when cultures are
repeated while patients are receiving antibiotic therapy. 2,9
Until the late 1970s, many authorities espoused the view
that antibiotic treatment did not appreciably alter the
symptomatic course of acote infection? ,~~ However, a
survey published in 1984 revealed that 74% to 88% of
primary care clinicians believed that early antibiotic therapy offered overall acute symptomatic relief, t~ a position

Still, some authorities debate the clinical relevance of the
results supporting early initiation of antibiotic therapy and
the wisdom of antibiotic use to truncate a self-limited
illhess. ~3-~5 The adverse effects and costs of penicillin, and

of potential GABHS pharyngitis. 1 As stated by PantelP3:
"Even if... studies had shown indisputably the advantage
of early treatment with penicillin, the clinical implications
would be questionable, since no study has been done
comparing ofher symptomatic regimens. Gargles, cold
liquids, aspirin or acetaminophen may be more effective
and certainly safer than penicillin."
The current study was a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the effects of
penicillin on the early clinical course of streptococcal

pharyngitis managed with symptomatic therapy and patient education.
METHODS
From January 1982 to April 1985, a total of 371
patients with a chief complaint of sore throat enrolled in
this study. Qualifications for entry included an age of 4 to
29 years, symptom duration of less than 4 days, no
antibiotic use over the previous 4 days, and no allergy to
penicillin. Three private practitioners' offices, the University of Pittsburgh Student Health Center, and the St.
Margaret Memorial Hospital Family Health Center
served as study sites.
Patients with certain clinical criteria were judged to
have more severe illness. These criteria were (1) moderate
to severe sore throat, (2) beefy red or exudative pharyngitis, (3) oral temperature >38 ~ C (100.4 ~ F), and (4)
anterior cervical lymph node tenderness and palpable
enlargement. Patients with all four of these findings are
more likely to be infected by GABHS and more likely to
show measurable differences~ between appropriate and
468 inappropriate early treatment.. " The intensity of the sore
throat was reported by the patient as mild, moderate, or
severe. For patients younger than 13 years of age, parents
eomfirmed the severity of sore throat.
Because of the number of study sites used, a designated
nurse from each of the five offices was formally instructed
in the project protocol. A single study coordinator conducted periodic reviews of each site to ensure compliance
with the study protocol and made all telephone calls to
patients, parents, and physicians.
At the initial office visit, all patients or parents were
queried about prior medication and absence from school or
work. Any potentially interfering medications, especially
anti-inflammatory drugs and cold remedies, were discontinued. Symptoms evaluated included fever, degree of sore
throat, odynophagia, malaise, anorexia, cough, and other
pain (headache, abdominal pain, or other). Signs assessed
by the physician included temperature, degree of exudate,
intensity of pharyngeal injection and edema ("pharyngitis"), palatal petechiae, anterior cervical adenitis (enlarged
or tender), drooling, breath odor, rhinorrhea, and rash.
Explicit definitions were distributed to all sites to ensure a
uniform basis by which to judge the severity of initial
findings and the degree of improvement on follow-up.
At random, each patient blindly received either eight
individual doses of penicillin V, 250 mg, taken orally four
times a day for 2 days, or unmedicated placebo with
matched appearance and taste, on a like dosage regimen.
The first dose was given during the initial office visit. In
addition, each person received eight age- or weightadjusted (10 to 15 mg/kg per dose) doses of either aspirin
or acetaminophen (choice made by patient or parent),
accompanied by a written dosage schedule and a detailed
instruction sheet recommending frequent use of nonmedicared therapy such as saltwater gargles and warm fluids.
All patients or their parents were informed of the project
goals and given basic information about the recognized use
of penicillin to prevent nonsuppurative sequelae such as
rheumatic fever, but they were told that the effectiveness
of penicillin in providing acute symptomatic relief was in
debate. The importance of anti-inflammatory drug treatment was stressed.
Twenty-four hours (+4 hours) later, the physicians
reexamined all Patients to determine whether improvement
had occurred for each sign and symptom. The remaining
"medication" doses and anti-inflammatory drugs were
counted. Patients or their parents also made a subjective
assessment of overall improvement ("general assessment")
and reported whether the patient had returned to work or
school. At 48 + 4 hours after the initial visit, the study
coordinator questioned the patients or parents by tele-

phone about the individual symptoms, overall general
assessment, and change in size and tenderness of "neck
glands." The coordinator also asked how the medication
tasted, whether patients had used other medicines, about
return to work or school, and when improvement began.
The diagnosis of GABHS pharyngitis was based on a
positive throat culture. All patients had throat secretions
cultured according to the method of the American Heart
Association. 16 Specimens were immediately streaked onto
sheep blood agar plates, a 0.04 U bacitracin disk (A disk)
was applied, and cultures were incubated for 24 hours at
37 ~ C in air. For the first year, culture results were
tabulated independently by two of the study physicians and
a duplicate throat swab was sent to the Allegheny County
Health Department laboratory for confirmation. During
the final 2 years, the state-qualified laboratory of the
Russellton Medical Group read and reported all throat
cultures. For 48 hours, throat culture results were unknown to patients, parents, evaluating physicians, and the
study coordinator. After the 48-hour telephone call, throat
culture results were revealed to the patient or parent and to
the patient's physician, who could then prescribe a full
10-day course of antibiotic. Two-week follow-up telephone
calls were used to uncover any sequelae from the infection
or study "medication." Neither personal physicians nor
any participants were informed whether or not penicillin
had been given during the 48 hours of the study.
Statistical analysis. In patients with both severe illness
and throat culture positive for GABHS, significance tests
were performed by means of the one-tailed Student t test,
because previous studies of similar patients had reported
penicillin to be more effective than placebo. 4, 7, 8,12,15 For the
two groups with severe illness or with GABHS-positive
culture, the Mantel-Haenszel chi-square test was used to
test the differences. Analysis of variance was used to test
for differences between the penicillin- or placebo-treated
patients with respect to the initial level of illness.
RESULTS
Of the 371 patients entering the study, 123 (33%) had
positive throat cultures and 112 (30%) met the clinical
criteria for severe illness. Fifty-seven patients (15%) had
both the clinical criteria and positive throat cultures.
Ninety-five percent of patients were first evaluated within
48 hours of the onset of their illnesses, 57% within 24
hours. The level of illness on entry into the study was
equivalent between those treated with placebo and those
treated with penicillin. The male/female ratio approximated 1:1 for all groups. Of the 123 patients with positive
throat cultures, 71 (58%) were in the 6- to 12-year age
range (Table I). Of the 49 persons in this age bracket who
had severe illness, 34 (69%) had a positive throat culture.
At the 24-hour recheck, all patients had taken four doses
of either placebo or penicillin. The telephone check at 48
hours revealed an overall average of 7.3 doses of "medication" taken, with no significant difference in any of the
study groups. At 24 hours, all patients had taken three or
four doses of aspirin or acetaminophen. Over the 48 hours
of the study, all patients took six or more doses of
anti-inflammatory drug. A few patients (2 to 10 in each
group) also took various over-the-counter cold, cough, or
sore throat remedies, but none reported using antibiotics
from another source. Patients could not accurately identify
whether they had received penicillinn or placebo.
The improvement rates for representative signs and
symptoms for patients with both GABHS pharyngitis and
severe illness are depicted in Table lI. No statistically
significant difference (p <--0.05) was evident for any sign
or symptom, except for the complaint of sore throat at 48

hours (p = 0.05). Initially, the average high oral temperature was 38.5 + 0.5 ~ C for both the penicillin-treated and
the placebo-treated patients. At 24 hours the penicillin
grofip had a temperature of 37.1 _+ 0.7 ~ C, and the
placebo group had a temperature of 37.1 _+ 0.5 ~ C. These
results are not statistically different.
The 112 patients with severe illness underwent similar
analysis. After 24 hours, sore throat improved in 67%
(38/57) of penicillin-treated patients versus 44% (24/55)
of placebo-treated patients (p = 0.01). This significant
difference remained at 48 hours: 85% (49/57) versus 67%
(37/55) (p = 0.025). Resolution of cervical node tenderness was also more rapid in the penicillin group (27% or
15/56) versus the placebo group (13%, or 7/54) at 24
hours only (p = 0.05). No other differences were found.
When the 123 GABHS-positive patients were compared, the only statistically significant differences in rate
of improvement for all signs and symptoms were in the
complaint of sore throat and in the general assessment
after 48 hours. For sore throat, 93% (62/67) of patients
treated with penicillin improved, in comparison with 73%
(41/56) of patients treated with placebo (p = 0.01). For
general assessment, 85% (55/65) of patients improved
with penicillin versus 67% (35/52) of patients with placebo
(p = 0.025).
Neither of the latter two groups showed any difference
in fever reduction. Across all groups, 89% of those who
initially missed school or work did not return in 24 hours
regardless of treatment. None of the stated results was
affected by adjusting for age, site, or year of entrance into
the study.
In addition to the analysis presented above, we developed a model similar to the scoring system used by Krober
et al., 4 which gave each participant a point score reflecting
overall severity of pharyngitis, with later reduction of that
score reflecting improvement. The results obtained with
this scoring system failed to show any significant improvement favoring penicillin use.
We were unable to achieve the anticipated sample sizes.
Thus the power of analysis for those with both GABHS
pharyngitis and severe illness was 0.78, but for the two
groups with either GABHS pharyngitis or severe illness, it
was above 0.90.
DISCUSSION
In this study, patients with GABHS pharyngitis and
clinically severe pharyngitis were comparable to those
reported in other studies. 4,7,8,~2 However, except for the
complaint of sore throat after 48 hours, there were no
significant differences between the penicillin group and the
placebo group in the response of our patients to therapy.
Differences in fever reduction and in the general sense of
well-being, found in other reports, were not confirmed. The
fact that patients receiving penicillin in this study had
similar response rates to those in other studies, but that our
placebo patients fared better, indicates that the important
difference was probably the added regimen of symptomatic treatment and patient instruction.
For patients with severe illness (culture positive or
negative), penicillin produced greater improvement in sore
throat at 48 hours. The increment of improvement was
23% (67% for penicillin minus 44% for placebo) at 24
hours. With no other symptom showing a significant
difference, and no quicker return to school or work, we
question whether the early use of penicillin is justified by
this 23%. The use of an anti-inflammatory agent with a

longer duration of action or more frequent ingestion of
aspirin or acetaminophen might have eliminated this single
statistically significant finding.
Our results support the contention that aspirin or
acetaminophen coupled with nonmedicated pain relief
measures is nearly as effective as penicillin ['or the relief of
the symptoms and signs of acute severe GABHS pharyngitis. The discomforts of inflammation and the systemic
effects of otherwise localized bacterial infection should be
responsive to anti-inflammatory drugs, especially active
prostaglandin inhibitors. In the best possible situation, the
latent period between initiation of antibiotic and clinical
improvement is rarely less than 6 hours, whereas improvement with acetaminophen would be expected in 20 to 30
minutes, especially for symptoms such as fever. When
comparing penicillin to placebo, Pichichero et al. s showed
that penicillin provided no reduction in fever for at least
the first 9 hours of the study. The benefits of penicillin tend
to be evident at a later time (48 hours), when the effects of
the reduction of bacterial load are maximized.
This study was designed to match current office practice
and to avoid the criticisms of inadequate placebo, limited
age range, single study setting, and limited number of
participants. However, the imperfections that plague all
GABHS clinical studies, especially strict definition of
subjective "improvement," false-negative throat cultures,
and the inability to separate out GABHS carriers, exist
here has well. Other limitations include the use of telephone calls for 48-hour rechecks and the small sample size,
which reduced the power of analysis. However, none of
these problems explains the difference between our study
and other studies that purport to prove the effectiveness of
penicillin over placebo (Table III). These earlier studies
also have imperfections. For example, Randolph et al. 7
provided a placebo that did not look or taste like penicillin.
Pichichero et al. 8 gave credence to the statistical difference
between a temperature of 98.6 ~ F and 99.4 ~ F and to a 0.4
difference on a scale of 0 to 3 in the intensity of sore throat.
Their conclusion that these results are "irrefutable" fails to
consider that these large statistical differences mean little
on a clinical basis. However, all other studies, including
ours, showed that approximately three fourths of the
patients treated with penicillin improved in 24 hours. Our
results differ only in that just as many treated with the
symptomatic regimen alone were also better at 24 hours.
We believe that these differences can be explained only by
our provision of a prescribed anti-inflammatory drug and
precise patient instruction.
Two recent developments affect the decision to prescribe
antibiotic: the possible resurgence of acute' rheumatic
fever ~7 and the development of new rapid streptococcal
antigen detection tests? 8-~~ In the past, the prevention of
rheumatic fever has been the unquestioned reason for
treating GABHS pharyngitis. If rheumatic fever has
disappeared, the risk of antibiotic treatment may be
greater than that of nontreatment] 0 and adequate symptomatic therapy would be preferred to early penicillin
therapy for all patients with sore throat. If acute rheumatic
fever continues to become more prevalent, early initiation
of penicillin therapy might be more prudent if it limited
GAHBS spread, although previous reports have not confirmed limitation of GAHBS spread under endemic conditions.Z, 8. ~5, 16
Rapid GAI3HS antigen detection tests could clarify the
situation regarding early treatment, but these tests may
have a 10% false negative rate, are relatively expensive,
and are time-consuming?9.2o if one is concerned about
prevention of rheumatic fever, the throat culture appears
to remain the gold standard for diagnosis. While awaiting
culture results, the clinician must choose between antibiotic treatment or symptomatic therapy. Pichichero et al)
suggested that early initiation of antibiotic treatment may
lead to an increased incidence of GABHS recurrences.
This possibility, coupled with our findings, supports the
decision to use symptomatic therapy. We conclude that
regardless of whether one treats all GABHS-positive
patients, or all clinically ill patients, or requires both
circumstances to be present, penicillin adds little to an
adequate symptomatic regimen while awaiting culture
results. Perhaps the issue of whether to prescribe penicillin
on the first office visit has been best summarized by Dr.
Floyd Denny:
The question remains if the issue is really settled. If the issue
was whether or not the treatment shortened the course of
streptococcal pharyngitis, then this issue was settled over 30 years
ago. If instead the issue is whether or not to use penicillin in an
individual patient with pharyngitis in 1985 [or 1988], then the
issue is far from settled. I believe the only answer at the present
time is for the clinician to examine carefully the epidemiologic and
clinical aspects of each child [or adult] who presents with
pharyngitis and then to decide which ones need a culture and
possible treatment.~4
