P RELIMINARY studies from two groups of
investigators iv2 indicate that the treatment
of acute streptococcal respiratory infections with penicillin will prevent the subsequent
development of rheumatic fever. The investigations on the prophylaxis of rheumatic fever at
the Streptococcal Disease Laboratory2 have
been extended to include the evaluation of three
different dosage schedules of depot penicillin in
a controlled series of 2,340 patients with exudative tonsillitis and pharyngitis. The purpose of
the present report is to describe the effects of
such treatment on the incidence of acute rheumatic fever, the strcptococcal carrier state and
the immunologic response of the host.
was an average turnover of 1,000 men per
month, it is estimated that a total of 21,000 airmen were stationed at this air force base during
the period of study.
METHODS
The study was conducted between January
24, 1949, and February 22, 1950, at Francis E.
Warren Air Force Base in southeastern Wyoming. This installation is composed of technical
training schools which receive as students enlisted men who have just completed twelve
weeks of basic training at a southwestern base
and a few seasoned airmen from other installations. The duration of the courses of instruction
varies from eight to thirty-four weeks. Students
registered in the schools comprise about 60 per
cent of the population; the remainder consists
of the permanent party which includes instructors and maintenance personnel.
Selection of Cuse.r and Routine Stu&es. All
soldiers reporting to sick call with respiratory
symptoms who showed either exudative tonsillitis or pharyngitis or an oral temperature of
100”~. or greater were admitted to the hospital.
Within a few hours after admission each patient
was examined by a member of the professional
staff of the laboratory. In addition to identifying
data a standardized history and physical examination were recorded. A total leukocyte
count, culture of the tonsils and oropharynx,
and specimen of serum were obtained.
The strength of the base during the period of
the study. was approximately 8,000. Since there
Only those patients who exhibited exudative
lesions on the tonsils or oropharynx were included in the study group. Five patients with
exudative tonsillitis and concomitant rheumatic
fever were excluded. Treatment was determined
by air force serial number; those patients whose
serial number ended in an even digit received
intramuscular injection of crystalline procaine
penicillin G in peanut or sesame oil containing
2 per cent aluminum monostearate. All injections of penicillin were administered by a member of the professional staff. Patients whose serial
number ended in an odd digit received no

t In addition to the cases recorded there were fifty-five patients with
exudative lesions who were given penicillin (either crystalline penicillin
or a combination of crystalline and depot penicillin) in miscellaneous
dosages by the attending ward physician. These cases were excluded
from the analysis since the dosage and dwation of therapy varied considerably, treatment was usually delayed and most of the patients were
treated because of the severity r_t rk ~llnesa or the presence of a suppurarive corn&cation. Of the fiftv-five casw r’le serial number was odd in
forty-thrk instances, even in twelve. One case of rheumatic fever
developed in this group. In this instance treatment was instituted thirtytwo hours after the onset of exudative tonsillitis and otitis media:

doses of 100,000 units every six hours for a total dose of 1,500,OOO units.
treated and control patients to an active duty
status was usually effected on the fifth or sixth
hospital day.
A follow-up observation was made twenty-one
to thirty-five days after admission to the hospital.
For various reasons a few examinations were
conducted before the twenty-first or after the
thirty-fifth day. At this time a throat culture
and a convalescent serum specimen were obtained. Without knowledge of the serial number
or therapy administered, a member of the
professional staff recorded symptoms of pain or
swelling of the joints, feverishness, skin rash or
sore throat. Those patients presenting symptoms were examined and an electrocardiogram
and sedimentation rate obtained. All patients
suspected of having acute rheumatic fever were
hospitalized on a special study ward.
Patients admitted to the rheumatic fever
study ward remained until a diagnosis was
established. In addition to the routine history
and physical examination, symptoms and physical signs were recorded daily for the first week
and at weekly intervals thereafter. Pulse and
rectal temperatures were recorded every four
hours. Sedimentation rates were obtained three
times each week and total leukocyte counts
twice each week. Electrocardiograms were recorded daily during the first week of hospitalization or during the febrile period and at least
weekly thereafter. Cultures of the throat and
blood specimens were taken at ten-day intervals
until the patient was discharged.
Laboratory Methods. Laboratory studies at the
time of the acute infection, at the time of followup examination and at the time of hospitalization for suspected rheumatic fever were performed in a standard manner. Throat swabs
were returned immediately to the laboratory
and streaked within one hour on the surface
of an agar plate containing horse blood. A stab
was made into the agar through the streaks to
determine the type of sub-surface hemolysis3
After incubation at 37”~. for eighteen hours the
plates were examined for colonies exhibiting
beta-hemolysis. Selected colonies were then
transferred to sheep blood agar plates for isolation in pure culture. Streptococci producing
beta-hemolysis on the surface or in the stab on
sheep blood agar plates were classified according to the methods of Maxted, Fuller,5 and
Swift, Wilson and Lancefield. 6
Sera were stored at -20”~. Antistreptolysin
“0” titers on all sera from each patient were
performed simultaneously according to a modification of the method of Hodge and Swift.l A
difference of two dilution increments was considered to be beyond the technical error of the
test and diagnostic of a streptococcal infection.
Sedimentation rates were performed according
to the method of Westergren.8
Diagnosis of Rheumatic Fever. The diagnosis
of the non-suppurative complication, * rheumatic fever, was according to a modification of
the classification of Jones.g With few unavoidable exceptions the final classification of each
patient was made without knowledge of treatment during the preceding illness of exudative
tonsillitis or pharyngitis.
An illness was classified as acute rheumatic
fever if there were two major manifestations or
one major and two minor manifestations.
(Table II.) The diagnosis of possible rheumatic
fever was made when there were one major and
one minor, one major or two minor manifesta-

ETIOLOGIC NATURE OF OBSERVED INFECTIONS
Pit the time these studies were instituted
streptococcal infections were epidemic. However, the data were examined to determine
whether in this particular study the presence of
exudate on the tonsils or pharynx could be
considered a reliable indication of a streptococcal infection. The history and physical findings
were in most instances typical of streptococcal
infection as reported in a more detailed analysis
of the clinical course of a sample from this
study. lo The isolation of group A streptococci.
from the admission throat culture of 75.7 per
cent and a total leukocyte count of 12,000 or
higher in 63.8 per cent of patients lend further
support to the streptococcal etiology of these
infections. Finally, a diagnostic increase in the

streptococcal infections to non-streptococcal
infections changed during the course of the
study.
COMPARABILITY OF TREATED AND CONTROL
GROUPS
The treated and control groups of patients
during each particular treatment schedule were
comparable with certain minor exceptions.
(Table III.) In each schedule the number of
patients who gave a history of rheumatic fever
in the past was slightly greater in the control
than in the treated groups. In schedules II and
III there was also a somewhat higher incidence
of a history of a previous heart murmur in the
control group.

that during the course of these studies there was
a change in the population as well as in the type

From all the available evidence, which includes isolation of group A streptococci on admission to the hospital and elevated leukocyte
counts, it appears that while schedule I was
used most of the infections were caused by
group A streptococci. This was confirmed by
the fact that 76 per cent of the control patients
in this schedule developed an increased titer of
antistreptolysin. In contrast, an increase in
antibodies was demonstrated in the paired sera
of 63.5 per cent of the controls in schedule II,
and 59.5 per cent of the controls in schedule III.
These antibody studies, along with the decreased
number of isolations of group A streptococci and
low leukocyte counts: indicate that an appreciable number of patients studied during schedules
II and III had non-streptococcal exudative
pharyngitis or tonsillitis. *
of 1,216 patients with exudative tonsillitis or
pharyngitis. Of this group 634 were treated and
582 served as controls. (Table I.) Follow-up
examinations were obtained in 82.5 per cent of
the total group, indicating that at least this
proportion of the total group remained on this
base during the period that non-suppurative
complications usually develop. In a total of
twenty-eight patients an illness classified as
rheumatic fever or possible rheumatic fever
developed. In addition there were twenty-seven
patients who at follow-up examination gave a
history of joint pains (with or without other
symptoms) but were found to have no other
* Since in approximately 80 per cent of patients with
streptococcal infections antistreptolysin develops during
convalescence, it may be estimated that 4, 17 and 21 per
cent of patients studied in schedules I, II and m, respectively, did not have streptococcal exudative tonsillitis
or pharyngitis.

stigmas of rheumatic fever. The distribution
between treated and control groups of the aforementioned patients who exhibited symptoms or
signs of a non-suppurative complication of the
observed attack of tonsillitis or pharyngitis is
shown in Table IV.
The data in Table IV show that definite
rheumatic fever occurred seven times more
frequently in the untreated patients than in
those who received penicillin. Furthermore,
there appeared to be a significant difference
between the incidence of joint symptoms in the
two groups since eight patients had joint pains
in the treated group while nineteen complained
of joint pains in the control group.
The characteristics of the acute respiratory
illness and the subsequent attack of rheumatic
fever or possible rheumatic fever are tabulated
in Table v. The cases are arranged according
to the time interval between the observed attack
of exudative tonsillitis or pharyngitis and the
onset of rheumatic fever. During schedule I the
time interval varied from eight to 110 days.
Because of the wide variation in the time
interval before the onset of symptoms of rheumatic fever the data were analyzed to determine
whether there was any difference in those patients with a short and those with a long time
interval. A difference was demonstrated when
a comparison was made between the type of
streptococcus isolated at the onset of the observed respiratory infection and the type isolated on admission for the rheumatic fever
episode. No change in type was observed in
seventeen patients in whom the interval between
the onset of the two diseases was twenty-eight
days or less. In contrast, of eleven patients whose
first symptom of rheumatic fever began twentynine days or later after the onset of the respirator)- infection, a change in type was definitely
established in six instances. From an additional
case in this group, P-2457, a type 23 streptococcus was isolated at follow-up examination on
the twenty-fifth day, whereas a type 14 organism
was isolated at the time of admission for the observed respiratory infection and again thirtyfive days later at the time of admission for
rheumatic fever.
In twenty-three of the twenty-eight patients
there is little doubt that the observed respiratory
infection was caused by the streptococcus since
a diagnostic increase in the antistreptolysin titer
was demonstrated in the convalescent blood
specimen. The details of the four cases (P-1932,
,,‘TNti, 1951

and one case (H-338) in which an acute titer was

discrete exudate on the tonsils and the lymph
nodes were enlarged and tender. The leukocyte
count was 14,200. The throat culture on admission showed no beta-hemolytic colonies, but on
the subsequent two days numerous type 14
streptococci were isolated. The acute phase antistreptolysin titer was 200 and thirteen days
later it was 250. The symptoms of rheumatic
fever developed twelve days after the onset of
the observed respiratory illness.
From the laboratory and clinical evidence
this illness should be considered a streptococcal
infection. The small rise in antistreptolysin titer
may have been due to the short interval between
the two serum specimens.
In case P-2461 there was no increase in the
antistreptolysin titer but the initial titer of 400
was elevated. In this instance a rise of at least
100 units was required before an increase in
antibody could be detected. The acute illness
was characterized by discrete exudate on the
tonsils and by enlarged, tender cervical lymph 
Penicillin Prophylaxis of Rheumatic Fever-JVWannamaker et al.
nodes. The total leukocyte count was 12,000 and
a profuse growth of type 14 streptococci was
obtained on culture. These data indicate that this
infection was caused by group A streptococci.
In case H-338 the leukocyte count was 9,000
and type 14 streptococci were isolated from the
culture in small numbers. An acute phase blood
was not available for antibody determinations
but there was an increase in the antistreptolysin
titer from 317 on the thirty-second day to 400 on
the forty-fifth day after the onset of exudative
tonsillitis. It appears possible that this attack of
exudative tonsillitis was not caused by the streptococcus and that there was an intervening
infection caused by type 24 streptococci since
this organism was isolated on admission for
rheumatic fever. This patient was thought to
have rheumatoid arthritis but because of multiple joint pains, fever and an increased sedimentation rate the illness was classified as possible
rheumatic fever.
The last two (P-2311 and P-2371) of the five
illnesses about which there was some doubt as
to the streptococcal etiology of the observed
attack of exudative tonsillitis are discussed later.
Since penicillin was demonstrated to be an
effective drug in preventing rheumatic fever,
a detailed history is presented of the four patients
(P-2311, P-2371, P-2457 and H-499) in whom
the disease developed following such therapy.
Case P-2311, aged eighteen, entered the
hospital on March 30, 1949, giving a history of
onset at 6:00 A.M., March 26th, of malaise,
headache, feverishness and sore throat. Examination showed a small amount of exudate on the
superior pole of the right tonsil and some redness
of the surrounding tissues. The cervical nodes
were enlarged and tender bilaterally. The temperature was 100.6”~. The patient was started
on penicillin therapy four days after the onset
of the infection.* The only complaint on the
second hospital day was sore throat, and two
small ulcers measuring 4 mm. in diameter were
observed on the right anterior pillar. On the
third day the patient was symptomatically well.
No fever was demonstrated after the initial
temperature of 100.6”~.
The total leukocyte count was 10,500 on admission and 9,700 on the second day. Throat
cultures taken on the first two hospital days
failed to show beta-hemolytic streptococci.
* Through error this patient was reported previously2
as having received penicillin seventy-two hours after the
onset of the illness.
This patient had chorea and acute rheumatic fever at the age of seventeen. He had been
told that he had a heart murmur.
Following discharge from the hospital and
about twenty-one days from onset of tonsillitis,
he began to notice vague pains in the feet, knees,
elbows and shoulders, and complained of chest
pain on the right side. The culture taken on
follow-up examination on April 21st showed
group A streptococci which were classified as
questionable type 5. The antistreptolysin titers
of the blood taken on the third and twentyfourth day after onset of the respiratory illness
were 159 and 200, respectively. The patient
entered the hospital on the thirty-fourth day
because of arthralgia and fever. The throat
culture on the next day showed a predominant
growth of group A, type 5 streptococci and the
antistreptolysin titer was now 250. By the fortyseventh day the titer was 500. He remained in
the hospital nine months and showed type 5
streptococci on most cultures. The illness was
characterized by fever of 100” to 102°F. throughout. A mitral systolic murmur was heard at all
examinations and after two months aortic and
mitral diastolic murmurs developed.
In summary then this patient’s acute respiratory illness on the first admission may not have
been caused by the streptococcus. The ulcerations were unusual and the degree of rise in
antibody during the first twenty-four days was
slight. Treatment with penicillin was not instituted until the fourth day of illness. The fact
that a possible type 5 streptococcus was isolated
on the twenty-fourth day and a type 5 was subsequently found throughout the rheumatic fever
episode suggests that the initiating streptococcal
infection was acquired after penicillin therapy
of the observed attack of exudative tonsillitis
had been discontinued.
Case P-2371 was cla&ied as possible rheumatic fever. The initial infection was characterized by discrete exudate on the pharynx.
There was a moderate growth of type 14 streptococci on culture. The leukocyte count was
14,000. Penicillin therapy was started fortyeight hours after the first symptom. Clinically,
this was a streptococcal infection although
there was no immediate antibody response.
Twenty-two days after the onset of the sore
throat a urticaria-like rash developed over the
hands and feet which was associated with stiffness of the underlying joints. The maximum
fever was 100.4”F. rectally and after the first day
AMERICAN JOURNAL OF MEDICINE 
Penicillin Prophylaxis of Rheumatic Fever- WWannamaker et al. 679
there was no fever. There was a systolic murmur
at the apex which did not vary while under
observation. The sedimentation rate and leukocyte count were normal.
The clinical impression in this case was a
penicillin reaction but because of fever, questionable arthralgia and skin rash possible rheumatic
fever could not be excluded.
Patient P-2457 entered the hospital on April
Ii, 1949, giving a history of onset of sore throat
at 6:00 A.M. Physical examination showed pinhead size exudate on the lymphoid tissue of the
pharynx. The total leukocyte count was 12,300
and numerous streptococci of type 14 grew on
culture of the throat. Treatment with penicillin
was instituted nine hours after the onset of the
infection. The initial antistreptolysin titer was
125 and twenty-six days later it was 625. Type
23 streptococci were present on the twenty-sixth
day. On the fortieth day the antistreptolysin
titer was 1,250 and a type 14 streptococcus was
again isolated. The characteristics of the rheumatic fever episode, which began thirty-five days
after the initial illness, are outlined in Table v.
In summary, acute rheumatic fever developed
in this patient thirty-five days after a typica
attack of acute streptococcal exudative pharyngitis. Penicillin therapy did not effectively inhibit
antibody production. There is some evidence of
an intervening infection as indicated by the new
ty’pe of streptococcus isolated prior to the onset
of rheumatic fever and by the continued increase
of the antibody titer from 625 to 1,250. Other
than the possibility of a second infection due
to type 23 streptococcus there is no explanation for the failure of penicillin to prevent this
complication.
Patient H-499 became ill March 3, 1949, with
exudative pharyngitis. The leukocyte count was
23,500 and no streptococci were isolated on
culture. Treatment with depot penicillin began
thirteen hours after the onset of the illness. The
antistreptolysin titer increased from <50 to
200 thirty-three days after the onset of the
illness.
There was a history of acute rheumatic fever
at the age of six and subsequently he was told
that he had “leakage” of the heart.
Eighty-three days after the observed onset of
exudative tonsillitis the symptoms of classic
rheumatic fever began. (Table v.) On admission a history of sore throat, fever and chills two
weeks before the onset of rheumatic symptoms
was obtained. A type 14 streptococcus was
,,“NF,, 1951
isolated and the antistreptolysin titer eighty-six
days after the first attack of tonsillitis was 625.
To summarize, this patient probably had
streptococcal exudative tonsillitis although the
causative organism was not isolated. When he
entered the hospital with acute rheumatic fever,
he gave a history of an intervening streptococcal
infection. It seems highly probable that the illness, eighty-three days before, for which he
received penicillin was not the primary precipitating infection. The fact that there was an
increase in the antibody titer from 200 to 625
confirms the history of a second streptococcal
infection. In conclusion, this patient should
probably not be classified as a penicillin failure
since there is good evidence of a subsequent
untreated streptococcal infection.
Treatment According to Schedule II. .4 total of
542 patients with exudative tonsillitis or pharyngitis were studied during the period that two
doses of 300,000 units each of depot penicillin
were employed. (Table I.) There were 254 patients who received penicillin on admission and
again seventy-two hours later: 288 served as
controls.
The distribution according to therapy of the
thirteen cases classified as acute rheumatic fever
and possible rheumatic fever, and ten patients
with joint manifestations obtained by history,
is shown in Table VI. Including both rheumatic
fever categories there were ten cases in the control group and only three in the penicillin group.
This is in contrast to the even distribution of
patients with joint symptoms without other
manifestations of rheumatic fever.
The details of each of the thirteen illnesses
classified as rheumatic fever or possible rheumatic fever are presented in Table VII. This nonsuppurative sequela developed six to 128 days
following the onset of the observed attack of
exudative tonsillitis or pharyngitis.
In this group of thirteen patients five showed
bacteriologic evidence of an additional streptococcal infection between the observed exudative
tonsillitis or pharyngitis and the rheumatic fever
episode. One of these occurred in a group of
seven cases in which the interval between the
exudative tonsillitis and rheumatic fever was

was an immediate rise in the antistreptolysin
titer. There were four cases (P-1295, P-1261,
P-1922 and H-589) in which the serologic tests
were not diagnostic of a streptococcal infection
and one patient (P-2596) * from whom no conTABLE VI

valescent blood was available. The details of
these illnesses follow:
Patient P-1295 showed a small amount of
exudate on the tonsils, the leukocyte count was
11,500 and the throat culture showed a predominant growth of type 5 streptococci. In
eighteen days numerous type 5 streptococci were
still isolated on culture and the titer of antistreptolysin had increased from 159 to 200; by
the thirty-fourth day, however, the antistreptolysin titer was 250. These data indicate that the
illness was caused by type 5 streptococci.
Case P-1261 had an initial antistreptolysin
titer of 625. Fifteen days and twenty-four days
from onset the titer was still 625. Type 14 streptococci were isolated on admission, and the leukocyte count was 15,200. The failure to show a rise
in the antistreptolysin titer may have been due
to the fact that the initial titer was elevated.
The illness in Case P-l 922 began on February
20, 1949, and did not appear to be due to the
streptococcus. Examination showed pinhead
size exudate on the tonsils; the cervical lymph
nodes were not enlarged or tender. Rales were
present over the right lower lung. No streptococci were isolated on culture and the antistreptolysin titer fell from 250 to 159 thirty-two
days after the onset. Symptoms of rheumatic
fever began forty-three days after the onset of

tonsillitis and three days later the antibody titer
was 250. On the fifty-eighth day a type 24
streptococcus was isolated. It seems probable
that the observed illness was non-streptococcal
and that prior to the onset of rheumatic fever
the patient had an intervening streptococcal
infection which failed to produce a recognizable
illness.
In patient H-589 an illness characterized by
discrete exudate on the tonsils and tender and
enlarged cervical lymph nodes was observed
128 days before the onset of rheumatic fever.
The leukocyte count was 19,700; and although
streptococci were not isolated, the antistreptolysin titer increased from 317 to 400 by the
thirty-fifth day. On the same day a non-typeable
group A streptococcus was isolated. Twentythree days after the onset of exudative tonsillitis
he was readmitted with an acute respiratory
infection without exudative tonsillitis or pharyngitis. Numerous type 5 streptococci were isolated
from the culture at this time and the leukocyte
count was 14,000. By the fifty-sixth day from the
original illness the antistreptolysin titer was
500. These data indicate that one, if not both,
of these illnesses was caused by the streptococcus.
In addition, one week after admission for acute
rheumatic fever a type 14 streptococcus was
identified in several cultures and the antistreptolysin titer became 833. It appears likely that the
patient had experienced another streptococcal
infection at about the time acute rheumatic
fever developed.
There were three patients in whom a nonsuppurative sequela developed after having
received two injections of penicillin.
In patient P-1930 a disease classified as possible rheumatic fever developed twenty-five days
after the onset of a type 24 streptococcal infection complicated by peritonsillar cellulitis.
(Table VII.) This patient had an odd serial number and was given depot penicillin in the prescribed dosage 106 hours after the onset at the
request of the ward physician. Since only depot
penicillin was administered, this case was not
excluded from the study. Streptococci were
eradicated from the oropharynx but penicillin
apparently did not prevent the formation of
antibody.
Patient P-2596 had a questionable streptococcal illness sixty-eight days before the onset of
rheumatic fever. There was pinhead size exudate on the pharynx, the cervical lymph nodes
were tender but not enlarged and the leukocyte
count was 9,600. Streptococci were not isolated

from the cultures of the throat. Treatment of
this questionable case of streptococcal exudative
pharyngitis was instituted 3 days after the onset
of the illness. No convalescent blood was ohtained but at the time of admission for rheumatic fever a type 23 streptococcus was isolated
and the antibody titer was elevated.

* Exclusive of the first two categories.
In case P-2711 a typical streptococcal infection developed 100 days before the first symptom
of rheumatic fever. The infection was caused by
type 5 streptococci. Treatment was instituted
thirty-four hours after the onset of the disease
and cultures taken four and eleven days later
showed no streptococci. The convalescent antistreptolysin titer measured on blood taken eleven
days after onset was 200, compared to an initial
titer of 125, which established the streptococcal
etiology of this infection. At the time of onset
of the rheumatic fever the antibody titer was
625 and a non-typeable group A streptococcus
was isolated subsequently. With a history of a
respiratory infection two weeks before the attack
of rheumatic fever, it appears highly probable
that the observed infection characterized by
exudate and treated with penicillin was not the
primary initiating infection.
In summary, then, the two patients with
definite rheumatic fever probably had an intervening streptococcal infection and therefore
may not necessarily represent true penicillin
failures. Patient P-1930 was treated late in the
course of the illness because of a complication
and subsequently possible rheumatic fever
developed. In this case late treatment may have
been responsible for the failure.
7>mtmmt According to .Fhedule III, The
prophylactic effect of a single injection of 600,000
units of depot penicillin was studied in 290 patients with exudative tonsillitis or pharyngitis
while 292 patients served as controls. (Table I.)
There were eleven patients in whom a nonsuppurative sequela developed and eighteen
who complained of joint symptoms without
other signs of rheumatic fever during the several
weeks following the streptococcal infection. The
distribution of these cases between the treated
and control groups is presented in Table VIII.
There were seven instances of acute rheumatic fever in the control group and two in the
treated group, a difference that is probably not
due to chance alone. The number of patients
with joint symptoms is greater in the treated
than in the control group.
The details of the illnesses in patients in whom
rheumatic fever subsequently developed are
presented in Table IX. In this group of eleven
patients acute rheumatic fever developed seventeen to 171 days following the observed attack
of exudative tonsillitis or pharyngitis. There
was a total of five patients who had definite
bacteriologic evidence of two infections by
different types of streptococci, all among the
eight patients in whom the interval was over
thirty-three days. In addition, in patients R-67
and R-48 there was a history of an intervening
streptococcal infection before the onset of
rheumatic fever.
The antistreptolysin titers on the acute and
convalescent sera establish the streptococcal
etiology of all but four (R-36, R-63, R-67 and
R-48*) of the observed attacks of exudative
tonsillitis or pharyngitis in this group of eleven
patients. (Table IX.)
Patient R-36 had discrete exudate on the
pharynx, tender cervical lymph nodes and
numerous type 14 streptococci on culture of the
throat. The leukocyte count was 14,000. There
was only a one dilution increase in antistreptolysin but it appears highly probable that this
infection was streptococcal in origin.
Case R-63 had enlarged, tender cervical
lymph nodes and discrete exudate on the tonsils.
There were numerous type 28 streptococci on
culture and the leukocyte count was 6,000. The
antistreptolysin titer increased slightly from
62.5 on admission to 83.3 four weeks later. It is

Penicillin Prophylaxis of Rheumatic Fever- WWannamaker et al.
somewhat doubtful whether this illness was a
streptococcal infection. Nineteen days before the
onset of rheumatic fever and after this study
was completed, a typical streptococcal illness
was observed caused by type 14 streptococci.
This illness was not treated. There was an immediate increase in antibody and rheumatic
fever developed sixty days after the original
infection observed during the study of schedule
III. It appears highly probable that the acute
attack of tonsillitis nineteen days before the
onset of rheumatic fever was the precipitating
illness.
Case R-67 had discrete exudate on the tonsil
with peritonsillar cellulitis. The lymph nodes
were enlarged and tender; the leukocyte count
was 11,000 but no streptococci were isolated on
culture. Whether this illness was streptococcal
or not cannot be determined. Acute rheumatic
fever developed 171 days later; the patient gave
a history of a sore throat one month previously;
a type 14 streptococcus was isolated and the
antistreptolysin titer increased markedly. It is
definite that this patient had an intervening
streptococcal infection.
There were three patients who received a
single injection of penicillin and subsequently
possible or definite rheumatic fever developed
thirty-four to seventy-two days later. The details
of these illnesses are presented below.
Patient R-73 became ill on February 3,
1950. On examination discrete exudate was
found on the pharyngeal lymphoid tissue and
the cervical lymph nodes were enlarged and
tender. Cultures showed a predominant growth
of type 14 streptococci. A single injection of
600,000 units of penicillin was given seventytwo hours after onset. Twenty-five days after
onset the culture showed no streptococci and
the antistreptolysin titer was 159 compared to a
titer of 100 on admission to the hospital. On the
thirty-fourth day the left knee became painful
on motion. The next day the pain was gone but
now the left shoulder and a day later the right
shoulder became painful for a day. There were
no other symptoms. On the thirty-ninth day
he was hospitalized and numerous type 5
streptococci were isolated.
During a two-week period of observation the
rectal temperatures were normal and no further
symptoms developed. The electrocardiograms
were normal and the maximum sedimentation
rate was 74. The antistreptolysin titer was now
250.
This patient probably had a type 14 streptococcal exudative pharyngitis for which he
received penicillin. A cross infection with type 5
streptococci occurred and may have been responsible for the development of the poststreptococcal reaction which was of minor
degree.
Patient R-37 had a sore throat on December
2, 1949. Small areas of exudate were observed
on the pharyngeal tissues and the lymph nodes
were not enlarged or tender. The total leukocyte count was 10,000. Numerous type 24
streptococci were isolated from the throat
culture. A single injection of penicillin was
given nine hours after the onset of the illness.
The acute phase serum and a serum taken on
the thirty-third day showed 62.5 and 100 units
of antistreptolysin, respectively.
During the fifty-two-day interval between the
observed illness and acute rheumatic fever, he
had two attacks of severe sore throat for which
he reported to the dispensary for therapy. Fiftyfour days after the original infection type 24
streptococci were again isolated and the antistreptolysin titer was now 250. Signs of active
rheumatic fever were present for nine weeks.
(Table IX.)
In summary this patient was treated nine
hours after the onset of an attack of exudative
pharyngitis. Although the clinical features were
not those usually observed in streptococcal sore
throat, there was a diagnostic increase in the
antistreptolysin titer thirty-four days later.
Because of the long interval between the attack
of pharyngitis and rheumatic fever and since
there was historical evidence of new infections,
it was thought that this patient had an intervening streptococcal infection. The increase in
antistreptolysin from 100 to 250 confirms this
impression but a new type of streptococcus was
not isolated. It is entirely possible that penicillin
treatment inhibited type-specific antibodies
sufficiently so that immunity was not acquired
and that this patient acquired a second infection
due to the same type of streptococcus causing
the original disease.
Patient R-48 entered the hospital on December 23, 1949, stating that he had developed a
sore throat twenty-four hours previously. There
was discrete exudate on the tonsils with little
associated redness of the surrounding tissues.
The cervical lymph nodes were not tender.
Treatment was administered twenty-three hours
after onset. The antistreptolysin titers were 62.5

was elevated to 12,000 and the throat cultures
showed a profuse growth of type 14 streptococci.

rheumatic fever began seventy-two days after
the initial illness and twenty days after the

was not administered at this time because he
was included in another study. It is clear, then,
that this instance of rheumatic fever cannot br
ascribed to the failure of penicillin.
E&t of Penicillin on Group A Streptococci. The
effects of the various dosage schedules of penicillin used in this study on group A streptococci
are summarized in Tables x and XI. In Table x 
Penicillin Prophylaxis of Rheumatic Fever-W’Wannamaker et al.
the group A carrier rates at time of hospitalization and at the time of the follow-up examination are presented.
As mentioned previously, the group A carrier
rate at time of hospitalization varied from 66.5
to 85.6 per cent which was due to the inclusion
of varying numbers of patients with nonstreptococcal exudative tonsillitis. Likewise, at
the time of re-examination the carrier rates of
group A streptococci in the control groups
varied. There are numerous factors which may
be responsible for this variation such as the
opportunity to acquire new types of streptococci
and differences in the times that the cultures
were obtained. During schedule III, for example,
approximately 25 per cent of the cultures were
taken before the twenty-eighth day, whereas in
schedules I and II only 14 and 12 per cent,
respectively, of the cultures were taken by this
time.
In spite of the variation in the carrier rates
during the course of the study it is apparent from
the data presented in Table x that penicillin
therapy resulted in a reduction of group A
streptococci when compared to the results obtained in control groups. Furthermore, there
was a definite relationship between the effectiveness of such treatment and the dosage schedule
of penicillin. The carrier rates were decreased
most by the penicillin dosage schedule I and least
by schedule III.
In order to determine more specifically the
effect of penicillin on the infecting organism an
analysis was made of the cultures from all individuals found to harbor a typeable strain on
admission to the hospital. If this strain was still
present at the time of follow-up examination,
it is reasonable to assume that the individual
harbored the organism throughout the period
between the two positive cultures. * A change
of type between the two cultures would then
indicate the acquisition of a new organism.
The analysis of the effect of therapy on the
streptococcus responsible for the infection as
well as the effect on new acquisitions is presented in Table XI.
The convalescent carrier rates for the infecting
type in the control groups of schedules I, II and
III were 34.6, 29.5 and 60 per cent, respectively.
The explanation for the high convalescent
carrier rate in the untreated patients in the

third group is not known but it may be due in
part to the fact that cultures were taken at an
earlier date than during the other two schedule
periods. Although the type distribution was
different in schedule. III compared to schedules I
and II, no evidence was found to indicate that the
convalescent carrier rate is a function of the
serologic type of streptococcus.
The data in Table XI establish that penicillin
treatment effects a reduction of both the infecting strain of streptococcus as well as new types
of organisms. The per cent reduction in the
carrier rates for the specific infecting serologic
type of streptococcus by therapy with depot
penicillin was greatest in schedule I and least in
schedule III. The reduction in the group A carrier
rates was due primarily to eradication of the
infecting type.
Although the number of airmen who acquired
a new ,organism was not great, from 4.4 to 10.4
per cent of the control groups were known to
harbor a new type. In each instance there was a
reduction in the number acquiring a new type
in the treated groups as compared to the controls. This reduction may have resulted from the
protection afforded by antibiotic therapy against
cross infections in the hospital.
Since penicillin therapy prevented the subsequent occurrence of rheumatic fever, the data
were reviewed to determine whether this was
related to the eradication of the streptococcus
from the oropharynx. Of those rheumatic subjects who harbored streptococci on admission
for the observed attack of exudative tonsillitis or
pharyngitis and received no treatment, 66 per
cent still harbored a group A streptococcus at
the time of follow-up examination, whereas
51 per cent of all the control patients in whom
rheumatic fever failed to develop still carried a
group A streptococcus. In the treated patients
who had group A streptococci on admission for
the observed respiratory infection and who
subsequently developed definite or possible
rheumatic fever, one of seven still harbored
group A streptococci at the time of follow-up
examination. These results fail to show any
relationship of the carrier state to the development of rheumatic fever.

true streptococcal infections varied somewhat
during the study, the degree of inhibition of
antibody by penicillin is best expressed as the
per cent reduction in the antibody increase as
compared to the untreated patients in the same

penicillin in schedule I was 51 per cent, in
schedule II, 38 per cent and in schedule III, 26 per

early in the course of the illness. This is best
shown by the average dilution increase during
schedule III and less so during schedule II. In
schedule I there was apparently more inhibition
of antibody in patients treated forty-eight to
seventy-one hours after the onset than in those
treated earlier. The explanation for this observation is not apparent.
COMMENTS
For the purposes of this study a rapid method
of selection of patients with streptococcal disease
was required. Since exudate on the tonsils or
oropharynx is observed in 70 to 90 per cent of
patients admitted to army hospitals with streptococcal tonsillitis or pharyngitis,13-l5 this single
criterion was used in the selection of cases for
study. Exudative lesions of the oropharynx are
also associated with other respiratory diseases so
that cultures of the throat and antistreptolysin
titers on acute and convalescent phase sera were
obtained to confirm the streptococcal etiology
of the observed illnesses. These studies established
the fact that the majority of the infections in
treatment schedule I were caused by group A

streptococci. While treatment schedules II and
III were being used, a number of patients with
non-streptococcal exudative tonsillitis and pharyngitis’l were included in the study groups. In
concurrence with observations of others15s16
these non-streptococcal exudative infections
were observed at the same time that outbreaks
of acute undifferentiated respiratory diseases
were occurring.
The variation in the number of group A
streptococcal infections observed during the
course of these studies is reflected also in the
incidence of rheumatic fever. Thus rheumatic
fever and possible rheumatic fever occurred in
4.93, 4.18 and 2.96 per cent of the untreated
patients followed for at least three weeks after
the observed infection during the study of treatment schedules I, II and III, respectively.

with penicillin results in a decreased incidence
of acute rheumatic fever is established by the

Penicillin Prophylaxis of Rheumatic Fever-Wunnamaker et al.
distribution of cases between the control and
treated patients. There was a total of forty-two
patients in the control groups and only ten
patients in the treated groups who developed
rheumatic fever or possible rheumatic fever
following the observed illness.
A detailed analysis of the collected data on
rheumatic subjects in both the treated and untreated groups was made in an attempt to explain the failure of penicillin to prevent rheumatic fever in all cases. It was found that when
the time interval between the onset of exudative
tonsillitis or pharyngitis and the onset of rheumatic fever was prolonged, there was bacteriologic, serologic or historical evidence of an
intervening untreated streptococcal infection
in many instances. This is in contrast to the
almost complete lack of such evidence of a
second infection in those patients where the
interval was short. The average interval between the two illnesses was fifty-one days in the
ten treated patients and thirty-six days in the
forty-two control patients. In five of the ten
cases of rheumatic fever or possible rheumatic
fever in the treated groups the interval was over
forty-five days whereas in only seven of fortytwo cases in the control group was the interval
this long. These data indicate that penicillin
therapy of acute streptococcal infections exerts
litlIe effect on rheumatic fever developing after
a long latent period.
In view of the fact that penicillin therapy
could not be expected to prevent rheumatic
fcvcr when an intervening streptococcal infection is not treated with the drug, all patients in
whom this sequela developed after forty-five
days from the onset of the observed illness are
excluded for the purpose of discussion. In Table
XII the distribution of cases of definite and
possible rheumatic fever between the treated
and control groups is presented. There were a
total of 978 treated patients who remained at the
.4ir Base at least until the time of the follow-up
examination and only two developed definite
rheumatic fever. This is in contrast to twentyeight patients with rheumatic fever in the control group of 996 patients who were known to
reside at this Air Force Base for at least three or
rnore weeks. The difference between the incidence of rheumatic fever in the treated and
control groups is highly significant. The attack
rate was reduced from 2.81 per cent in the
controls to 0.2 per cent in the treated patients.
Examination of the data (Table XIII) shows
,UNL., 1951
that during the period when three injections of
penicillin were administered (schedule I) the
incidence of rheumatic fever was definitely
decreased by treatment. This was true not only
for the disease readily recognized as rheumatic
fever but penicillin also decreased the incidence

of joint pains without other evidence of rheumatic fever. These observations indicate that
perhaps the pathogenesis of post-streptococcal
arthralgia is similar to acute rheumatic fever
and varies only in degree.
Since the number of patients studied during
schedules II and III was relatively few, it is
impossible to conclude with certainty that
either two injections of 300,000 units of depot
penicillin given seventy-two hours apart or a
single injection of 600,000 units is as effective
in preventing rheumatic fever as the larger dose
(schedule I). There were four instances of acute
rheumatic fever in each of the control groups of
treatment schedules II and III and no cases in
the treated groups. (Table XIII.) These diffcrences may have occurred by chance twelve
times in 100 observations; but if the two series
are combined, this distribution of cases would
have occurred only eight times in 1,000 observations. It would appear, therefore, that on
the basis of this evidence alone, a single injection
of 600,000 units or two injections of 300,000
units of depot penicillin is effective in decreasing
the incidence of rheumatic fever.
In contrast to the decreased incidencr of joint 
Penicillin Prophylaxis of Rheumatic Fever- Wunnamaker et al.
pains in the absence of other objective criteria
of rheumatic fever in the patients treated with
three injections of penicillin, there was no decrease in the incidence of these complaints in
the treated patients during the study of penicillin schedules II and III. This may be due to the
possibility that penicillin in the dosage used in
schedules II and III was not maximally effective.
There is little doubt that penicillin in the
dosage used eradicated the group A streptococcus from the throat in many instances and
also inhibited antibody formation. There was
a definite correlation between elimination of the
carrier state and the penicillin dosage schedule
used. The data indicate that the duration of
treatment is an important factor in this regard.
Thus a total of 600,000 units given in two injections seventy-two hours apart was more effective
in the eradication of streptococci than a single
injection of 600,000 units. Furthermore, during
treatment according to schedule I, the carrier
state was decreased to a greater degree than by
penicillin administered according to either
schedule II or III.
The eradication of the carrier state itself may
not be essential in the prevention of a subsequent attack of rheumatic fever. Thus in a
preliminary study no instance of rheumatic
fever was observed among eighty cases of streptococcal exudative tonsillitis or pharyngitis treated
with aureomycin,rO and treatment with this
drug did not result in the eradication of the
organism from the throat.* Furthermore, as
shown in the data on the control groups the
incidence of positive cultures for group A
streptococci taken approximately four weeks
after the observed initiating infection is about
50 to 60 per cent in both those who develop
rheumatic fever and those who do not develop
this sequela. This evidence suggests but does not
establish that eradication of the organism itself
is not necessarily related to the prevention of
rheumatic fever.
It is now well established that the antistreptolysin titers of sera from patients with
acute rheumatic fever are elevated.r7Js Furthermore, the antibody titer of sera collected during
the convalescent period following a streptococcal
infection is higher in those patients who develop
rheumatic fever than in those who do not develop
this complication. 12,1g Since the attack rate of
*Subsequent studies have shown that aureomycin

rheumatic fever in any population with acute
streptococcal infections may be correlated with
the magnitude of the antibody response,20 it
would appear that the ideal form of preventive
therapy would be that which inhibited antibody
production to the maximum degree.
The various drugs which have been used for
therapy of streptococcal infections vary in their
ability to suppress antibody production. Presumably the inhibition of antibody formation
is related in some degree to inhibition of the
streptococcus (antigen). The exhibition of the
sulfonamide drugs to patients with streptococcal
tonsillitis results in decreased numbers of streptococci and only a very slight suppression of antibody.r3 Treatment with these drugs does not
prevent rheumatic fever.t3 Aureomycin therapy
results in a marked decrease in the number of
organisms that can be isolated on culture.21 The
degree of antibody inhibition is rather marked
and preliminary studies indicate aureomycin
therapy may result in a decreased incidence of
rheumatic fever.rO Penicillin administration,
as has been recorded by a number of observers,2Jg,23 results in the eradication of the
streptococcus, a reduction in antibody production and a decrease in the incidence of rheumatic fever.
There is a relationship between the dosage of
penicillin and the degree of inhibition of antistreptolysin formation. A single injection of
600,000 units was less effective in this regard
than two injections of 300,000 units seventy-two
hours apart. Most effective was treatment
schedule I in which therapy was continued for
ninety-six hours. Kilbourne and Logez3 observed significant increases in the antistreptolysin titer in the sera of 84 per cent of untreated
patients, 64 per cent in patients treated with
300,000 units of aqueous penicillin once daily
for six or seven days, and 14 per cent in patients
treated with 20,000 to 50,000 units every three
hours for four to seven days. The later dosage
plan assured continuous levels of penicillin
throughout the treatment period.
The time of institution of penicillin therapy
would appear to be important in relation to
inhibition of antibody. The data obtained, however, do not show that delay in therapy up to
seventy-two hours after the onset of the illness
results in a marked decrease in the degree of
antibody inhibition. Further study is required
to determine the relationship of the time of
institution of therapy and the dose and duration 
Penicillin Prophylaxis of Rheumatic Fever - W’unnumaker pt (11. tiy y
of treatment to the inhibition of antibody and
to the prevention of rheumatic fever.
The decreased incidence of acute rheumatic
fever following penicillin treatment of acute
streptococcal infections observed in this study
confirms previous studies1*“r23 and is in disagreement with others.24-26 Kilbourne and Logez3
observed no rheumatic fever among twentynine patients treated with 20,000 to 50,000 units
of penicillin every three hours for four to seven
days. There were three cases of rheumatic
fever among forty-seven patients treated with
injections of 300,000 units of aqueous penicillin
once daily for seven days and two cases among
fifty-one untreated control patients. Massell,
Sturgis, Knobloch, Streeper, Hall and Norcross
in a recent report2? observed only two cases of
acute rheumatic fever following penicillin
therapy of thirty-four streptococcal infections
in rheumatic subjects. This is a marked reduction in the incidence of recurrent rheumatic
fever since approximately 40 to 50 per cent of
rheumatic subjects develop a recurrence following
an untreated group A streptococcal infection.27
In contrast to the aforementioned favorable
reports are the preliminary studies of Spink,
Rantz, Boisvert and Coggeshall.24 A total of
fifty-nine soldiers with streptococcal tonsillitis or
scarlet fever received varying dosages of aqueous
penicillin in combination, in some patients, with
sulfadiazine therapy. In this group six patients
developed acute rheumatic fever. Analysis of
the data on these six patients shows that the
dose of penicillin was small, therapy was administered less than thirty-two hours in four of
the patients and bacteriologic relapse or reinfection was observed in four patients.
Weinstein, Backrach and Boye? treated 167
patients with scarlet fever with either intramuscular or oral penicillin for a period of ten
days. In this group acute rheumatic fever was
diagnosed in twelve instances, an incidence of
7.17 per cent. The authors conclude that treatment of scarlet fever with penicillin does not
prevent rheumatic fever.
The outstanding differences between the
studies of WeinsteinZ6 and those from the
Streptococcal Disease Laboratory2 have been
detailed elsewhere. 27.28 The striking differences
include the time interval from the onset of the
observed infection to the onset of rheumatic
fever and the criteria used in diagnosis. In the
present study the average interval from onset
of the acute respiratory illness to the onset of
rheumatic fever for all patients was fifty-one
days in those that received penicillin and thirtysix days in the control group. This is in contrast
to an average interval of 9.2 days observed 1))
Weinstein.“6 This difference in the time interval
may be due to the criteria used for dating the
onset of rheumatic fever. Thus in Weinstein’s
studiesZ6 the criteria for onset included electrocardiographic abnormalities; those in the Wyoming study included only historical cvidencc.
The criteria used at the Strcptococcal Disease
Laboratory for the diagnosis of rheumatic fever
were essentially those of Jones9 Weinstein et
a1.,26 with more frequent electrocardiograms
available, secured evidence of early electrocardiographic changes in many of their patients
who failed to exhibit other symptoms or signs
commonly associated with acute rheumatic
fever. From the available evidence it is now
possible to state only that penicillin therapy of
acute streptococcal infections prevents the manifestations of rheumatic fever as defined in this
study. Whether such therapy prevents the
development of permanent cardiac damage
was not determined, but the assumption should
be that it may until otherwise established.
Whether penicillin therapy will prevent early
electrocardiographic changes in patients with
streptococcal and other bacteriologic infections
will have to be determined bv further stud&.
The importance of recognizing strcptococcal
infections is apparent for many cases of rheumatic fever should be prevented if adequate
treatment is instituted. Streptococcal respiratory infections may be readily rccognizcd without the employment of complicated laboratory
procedures. The illnesses are characterized by
the sudden onset of sore throat (soreness on
swallowing) which is usually. associated with
constitutional reactions. Streptococcal respiratory infections in contrast to many’ non-bacterial
respiratory infections are attended t)y a marked
rise in temperature. The development of symptoms and fever usually reach a maximum degree
about twenty-four hours after the onset.
The physical sign especially helpful in diagnosis is the presence of enlarged and tender
cervical lymph nodes. The pharynx is diffusely
injected, the lymphoid tissues and soft palate
appear edematous, and exudative lesions are
common. In those cases in which the diagnosis
is doubtful a total leukocyte count should be
obtained. If the leukocytes are increased to
10,000 or above, it is advisable to consider the 
Penicillin Prophylaxis of Rheumatic Fever- W~nnamaker et al.
infection streptococcal in origin until proven
otherwise. Occasionally cultures of the throat
are required in the diagnosis of streptococcal
respiratory infections when the previously
described criteria are followed.
At the present time depot penicillin in dosages
employed in this study may be used as outlined
in schedule I, or perhaps two injections of 600,000
units of depot penicillin administered seventytwo hours apart. The use of the sodium salt in
doses of 15,000 to 25,000 units every three hours
for eight to ten days might be employed for
individuals who give a past history of rheumatic
fever, because the incidence of recurrent rheumatic fever in such groups is high and such a
schedule of treatment appears to be most effective in inhibiting antibody formation.23
SUMMARY
The prevention of acute rheumatic fever by
penicillin therapy of acute streptococcal respiratory infections was attempted in this study.
Procaine penicillin G in oil containing 2 per
cent aluminum monostearate was injected intramuscularly according to one of three dosage
schedules in 1,178 patients with exudative
tonsillitis or pharyngitis while 1,162 patients
remained untreated and served as controls.
There was a total of ten patients who had
received penicillin and forty-two patients who
received no treatment in whom an illness classified as definite or possible rheumatic fever
subsequently developed.
Data collected on rheumatic sub.jects showed
that reinfection with a new type of streptococcus
frequently occurred when the interval between
the onset of the observed attack of exudative
tonsillitis or pharyngitis and the onset of rheumatic fever was prolonged. Excluding those
cases of rheumatic fever developing after a
forty-five-day interval between the two diseases
results in two cases of rheumatic fever in the
treated group and twenty-eight in the control
patients. These data indicate that penicillin
therapy of acute streptococcal infections almost
completely prevents the subsequent occurrence
of acute rheumatic fever.
Penicillin therapy was also found to eradicate
the streptococcus from the oropharynx of the
majority of individuals and to inhibit the formation of antistreptolysin. The most marked inhibition of antibody was that obtained by three
injections of penicillin over a ninety-six-hour
period totaling 1,200,OOO units in comparison
to the suppression of antistreptolysin by either
a single injection of 600,000 units or two injections of 300,000 units each given seventy-two
hours apart.
