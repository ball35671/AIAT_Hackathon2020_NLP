A multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was conducted to determine whether the addition of penicillin was superior to patient education and anti-inflammatory drug therapy for relief of the acute discomforts of pharyngitis caused by group A β-hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS). One hundred seventy-eight patients, aged 4 to 29 years, received appropriate symptomatic therapy, including specific doses of aspirin or acetaminophen, plus penicillin (91 patients) or placebo (87) for the initial 48 hours of illness. All had 24-hour office and 48-hour telephone reevaluations. In 123 patients (57 with clinically severe pharyngitis), throat cultures yielded GABHS. Penicillin provided a margin of 20% improvement over anti-inflammatory therapy for the complaint of sore throat only after 48 hours of treatment (for the 123 patients with GABHS, p=0.01; for the 57 with both severe pharyngitis and GABHS, p=0.05). No significant improvement was noted for fever, malaise, odynophagia, exudate, adenitis, or pharyngitis. The failure of penicillin to provide much additional benefit makes its routine early prescription specifically for symptomatic relief questionable.
