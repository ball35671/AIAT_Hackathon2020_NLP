Abstract
Objectives: To determine duration of signs and symptoms and adverse reactions after treatment with amoxicillin of patients with fever and sore throat due to non-exudative pharyngotonsillitis.

Design: This was a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial. Outpatients at four medical centers were enrolled. Patients over 5 years of age presented with fever and sore throat for less than 10 days due to non-exudative pharyngotonsillitis. Cases with any of the following symptoms or illness were excluded: earache, nasal discharge with foul smell, rheumatic fever, valvular heart disease, renal disease, and penicillin hypersensitivity. Amoxicillin or identical placebo at the dosage of 50 mg/ kg per day was given three or four times daily for 7 days.

Results: There were 1217 patients enrolled in this study. Some were lost to follow-up, which is the reason for the variability in number of cases in these analyses. After therapy, duration of fever was 2.46 and 2.48 days (P = 0.78) and of sore throat 3.01 and 3.04 days (P = 0.80) in amoxicillin (n = 431) and placebo (n = 436) groups, respectively. Complications were clinically documented in 13 (2.5%) and 16 (3.0%) cases in amoxicillin (n = 527) and placebo (n = 524) groups (P = 0.56). Two cases (0.46% and 0.46%) from each group (n= 433 and 431) were positive by anti streptolysin O antibody determination. The history of carditis and abnormal urinalysis after treatment were not obtained.

Conclusions: Amoxicillin therapy for non-exudative pharyngotonsillitis conferred no beneficial or harmful effect.
