Abstract
Purpose This study aimed at comparing the efficacy of
medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) and tranexamic acid
(TA) for treating heavy menstrual bleeding of endometrial
origin (HMB).
Methods A randomized controlled trial was carried out in
three gynecology clinics in Tehran, Iran. Ninety women
with the HMB of endometrial origin were randomized into
the study: 44 patients took MPA for 21 days from day 5
and 46 patients took tranexamic acid for 5 days from day 1
of menses for three consecutive menstrual cycles. Blood
loss was measured using the pictorial blood loss assessment
chart (PBAC); hematological assessments were made
before intervention and after treatment. SF-36 and HMB
Questionnaire (MQ) were given to assess quality of life.
Statistical analysis was performed using t test, Paired t test,
v2
, Mann–Whitney, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, and repeated measure analysis.
Results PBLC mean score, duration of bleeding and Hb
values as well as quality of life were significantly improved
in both groups (P\0.05). But there was no significant
deference between groups. More drug complication and
less satisfaction were reported by MPA group (P = 0.003
and P = 0.002, respectively).
Conclusions Long-term use of MPA is as effective as
Tranexamic acid in treating HMB and increasing quality of
life. However, bleeding irregularity side effects of MPA
might limit its use.

Introduction
Heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) is a common clinical
problem among reproductive age women with approximately 5–10 % of women seeking medical attention
annually [1]. Social inconvenience and anemia, which may
be difficult to treat even with continuous iron therapy, are
the most common complications of HMB in women [2].
HMB of endometrial origin is clinically defined as regular
menstrual periods lasting more than 7 days and/or blood
loss greater than or equal to 80 ml in the absence of recognizable pelvic pathology, or a general bleeding disorder
[3]. The accuracy of this definition has been argued in
recent years because the effect of bleeding on physical
wellbeing and quality of life was not considered. However,
women may complain of excessive bleeding when their
blood loss is less than 80 ml [4, 5]. Subjectively, HMB
may be defined as a complaint of regular excessive menstrual blood loss occurring over several consecutive cycles
in a woman of reproductive age [5]. Since it has an adverse
impact on women’s physical, psychological, sexual, and
social life [6, 7], any intervention should aim to correct
these bleeding complications, which is of higher

importance, rather than treat blood loss. The optimal
management for women with HMB has not been determined. Despite the availability of several options for
medical management, lack of evidence-based practice,
poor compliance, and unpleasant side effects limit the
success of medical therapies and women are frequently
managed with surgery or other invasive procedures [1].
Antifibrinolytic drugs are the first-line treatment of
HMB and can effectively decrease blood loss by inhibiting
the binding of plasminogen to fibrin filaments, which prevents clot dissolution [8, 9].
Until recently luteal phase Progesterone was one of the
most common hormonal treatments for HMB [7, 10–12].
Small clinical studies have shown that Tranexamic acid
(TA) is more effective and acceptable than short-term
(5–10 days) use of MPA [2]. However, intermenstrual
bleeding and other progestin-related complications may be
unacceptable to some patients. Recently, some researchers
suggested that use of progestin for 21 days during the
menstrual cycle might result in more acceptable outcomes
[13].
Literature shows that both TA and luteal phase MPA
could control HMB. However, few studies investigate the
impact of long-term use of MPA on blood loss and quality
of life of these patients. Thus, aim of this trial was to
evaluate the effect of 21 days’ use of MPA on the blood
loss and quality of life of HMB patients. TA was used as
standard (control) treatment.
Materials and methods
Ethics
This trial was approved by the ethic committee of Tarbiat
Modares University, Tehran, Iran, and it was registered in
the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials at www.irct.ir (IRCT
138802131641N3). Informed consent for participation in a
randomized-controlled study was obtained from each
subject.
Participants
90 Patients aged 20–45 years, who complained of regular
heavy menstrual bleeding with BMI (19–29 kg/m2
), were
randomized into the study from January 2010 to December
2011; 71 women completed the study. Cases with organic
causes of HMB were studied and excluded from the study
by a gynecologist before the intervention. Moreover,
women with iron deficiency anemia (was defined as Hb of
\10.5 g/dl), previous thromboembolic disease, history of
chronic diseases or other diseases known to interfere with
menstrual bleeding like leiomyoma, history of
anticoagulant agents, oral contraceptive or other hormonal
drug use, and women with an IUD in situ were excluded
from the study.
Setting
The participants were from three gynecology clinics in
Tehran, Iran.
Design
This study was a randomized controlled trial, using
parallel technique. Block randomization was used [14]
and subjects were allocated to one of the two treatments.
Forty-four patients received MPA (Iran Hormone
Company, Tehran, Iran) 5 mg every 12 h, for 21 days
from day 5 of menses during three consecutive menstrual periods, and 46 patients were randomly selected
to take tranexamic acid (Amin Pharmaceutical Company, Isfahan, Iran) 500 mg every 6 h for 5 days from
day 1 of menses.
Measures
Data on clinical outcomes were obtained at the baseline
of one control menstrual cycle, and 1, 2, and 3 months
after treatment. For symptom change as a result of therapy, several measurement tools were used. One tool was
a pictorial blood loss assessment chart (PBAC), which
was adapted by Janssen et al. [15] as a simple visual
assessment technique and accurate tool for semi-objective menstrual blood loss [16] and included a series of
diagrams representing lightly, moderately, and heavily
soiled towels and tampons. The women choose appropriate box at the time each towel and/or tampon is discarded. Passage of clots (size equated with the size of
different coins) and episodes of flooding are recorded. In
addition, for the patients to use the same sanitary towels,
they were provided with medium-sized Panberes sanitary
towels. Moreover, the Iranian version [17] of HMB
Questionnaire (MQ), which was developed by Ruta et al.
[18] to estimate the effect of HMB on patients’ perceived
health status, was applied as HMB specific quality of life
measure. It consists of 13 questions and produces a final
transformed score that ranges from 0 to 100 where 0 is
the best possible and 100 the worst possible score. The
Iranian version of SF-36 Questionnaire [19] was used to
measure the physical and mental components of healthrelated quality of life from baseline to after the completion of treatment.
In addition, hematological assessments (Hb and serumFerritin) were made in one control menstrual period before
treatment and after the third month of treatment. During
Arch Gynecol Obstet
123
these periods, the participants were requested to record
adverse effects in a form.
Drop-outs
After the first cycle of treatment, from the MPA group five
patients were excluded (three cases of spotting and two of
increased blood loss) and from the TA group five patients
were excluded (three cases of nausea with vomiting and
two of headache).
After the second cycle, in MPA group, six patients
discontinued the treatment (one case of breast fibrocystic
change, and five of irregular bleeding) and in TA group
three patients did not follow the treatment (two cases of
vertigo and one of headache).
Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 11.5 for Windows. (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
The results were presented as mean ± SD. Comparisons
between groups were performed using t test, Paired t test,
v2
, Mann–Whitney, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, and
repeated measure analysis. Statistical significance level
was set at 0.05.
Results
A total of 90 women were recruited and randomly placed
into two groups of 44 and 46 subjects. In the TA group 38
(82.6 %) and in the MPA group 33 (71.7 %) patients
completed the 3-month follow-up. Characteristics of these
women were not statistically different from others
(P[0.05). The reasons for discontinuation of treatment in
time are given in Fig. 1.
An intention to treat analysis was performed and baseline data of people who had not completed the study were
used as final data for them [20]. Present statistics are based
on the number of recruited patients.
The socio-demographic and obstetric characteristics of
the studied women are shown in Table 1. There were no
significant differences between the two groups with regard
to age, parity, education, and occupation. The mean age of
women in TA and MPA groups were 35.71 (5.88), 33.65
(7.99) years, respectively.

Menstrual blood loss determined with the PBAC,
duration of bleeding, and hematological assessment
decreased significantly in both groups over the follow-up
period. There was a significant statistical difference in
duration of bleeding between TA group compared with
MPA group (7.8 days decreased to 6.68 days vs. 8.4 to
8.06 days, respectively, P = 0.05), but in other criteria we
did not find any difference between the two groups
(Table 2).
In addition, a patient’s baseline PBAC score had a statistically significant effect on the change in PBAC from
baseline. Other variables yielded minimal differences.
Use of both TA and MPA improved the quality of life
(QOL) of women with HMB in general. HMB Questionnaire (MQ) and SF-36 questionnaire (in most physical and
mental components) significantly improved after treatment
in both groups, but there were no differences between the
after treatment scores in the two groups (Table 3).
Of the 90 patients who used study medication for at least
one cycle, 25.5 % (n = 23) experienced adverse effects in
both groups; nausea with vomiting, headaches, vertigo,
spotting, increase blood loss, and breast tenderness.
Discussion
HMB is a major health care issue and can have a detrimental effect on the physical and psychological health of
woman. In the present study, we compared the efficacy and
acceptability of 21 days’ medroxyprogesterone acetate
with tranexamic acid as first choice treatment for treating
HMB of endometrial origin. Furthermore, we used the
Iranian version of the MQ and SF-36 questionnaires for
assessing women’s quality of life. Limited studies have
addressed both aspects of the outcomes: objective clinical
outcomes and subjective quality of life.
The results of our study clearly demonstrated that both
treatments (long-term MPA and Tranexamic acid) reduced
HMB, improved women’s quality of life, and increased Hb
concentrations. There were no statistical differences
between outcomes of TA and MPA. However, TA was
better tolerated and had a higher level of patient satisfaction. This may be due to the decline in duration of bleeding, lower side-effects, and significant improvement in
general health, and shorter period of using drug in a cycle.
However, the follow-up period in our study was relatively
short. The unpleasant side-effects of MPA may be seen to
reduce in a longer follow-up period [11].
Measuring quality of life has been increasingly obtaining attention from researchers as a reliable outcome in
comparing medical treatments of HMB. While SF-36 is
still a valuable measurement tool in clinical trials, its
limitations in assessing some problems HMB patients are

struggling with makes its use limited. Therefore, many
scholars have suggested that disease-specific measures can
evaluate the impact of treatment more concisely. In this
study both instruments showed that long-term use of progesterone enhances quality of life in HMB patients.
It should be mentioned that although hysterectomy and
less invasive surgical treatments are acclaimed as highly
effective methods of treating HMB [7], especially in
refractory cases, high and long-term morbidities make
them the last treatment modality to be offered. Therefore,
long-term MPA could be an effective and low-cost alternative treatment to invasive hysterectomy, particularly in
women in their late reproductive period who have a normal
uterus and no significant pathology. There are few studies
that have investigated the efficacy of MPA for 21 days in
reduction of HMB and in promoting women’s quality of
life. In 2006, Kriplani et al. [13] studied 94 women with
HMB for three menstrual periods with TA 500 mg
administered every 6 h for 5 days from day 1 of menses
and MPA 5 mg every 12 h for 21 days from day 5 of
menses. Comparable to our finding, they found that MPA
and TA could significantly decrease the heavy menstrual
bleeding of endometrial origin; their results demonstrated
that the women were more satisfied with TA. However,
they did not monitor the ferritin level and quality of life.
Srinil et al. [2] used TA 1 g TDS a day for 5 days from
day 1 of menses for treating 40 women with Heavy Menstrual Bleeding of endometrial origin. Therefore, after three
cycles, the mean PBAC score decreased by 49 % (similar
to the decrease we noted) but the level of Hb and ferritin
did not differ significantly. This may be due to the lower
dosage of drug in comparison with our study. Also they
reported that TA could improve the women’s quality of
life.
Preston et al. [21] compared TA 1 gq6h for 4 days from
day 1 of menses with luteal phase progestogen. The studied
subjects were 46 women with HMB. The mean reduction
of menstrual blood loss, with TA, was 65 % (P\0.0001).
But luteal phase progestogen could not decrease it. This
result supports the finding that luteal phase progesterone
might not be a preferable choice for HMB treatment.
However, the present study has shown the effectiveness of
MPA for 21 days.
The main limitations of the present study might be small
sample size and high rate of dropouts. However, to prevent
a type II error, we used intention-to-treat analysis, and the
patients in the MPA group who stopped treatment were
included in the final analysis; consequently, the effect of
MPA on HMB has not been overestimated. Most complications that caused patients not to continue the study were
minor and longer follow-ups could determine their effect
on 21 days MPA acceptability. A few studies examined the
effects of TA and MPA on quality of life [22]. The results
of present study showed that TA and long-term PMA have
comparable effects on quality of life outcomes. Furthermore, this study used both generic and disease-specific
quality of life measures and the consistency of both
objective and subjective outcomes showed that long-term
MPA might be a safe and highly effective treatment in
women with HMB of endometrial origin, particularly in

premenopausal women who might also benefit from its
down regulation effect on endometrial proliferation. Longterm MPA can also be an appropriate alternative to TA in
patients who cannot use TA because of medical contraindications. However, future studies with longer follow-up
time to compare 21 days MPA with other pharmacological
treatments, especially levonorgestrel-releasing IUDs, can
prove its acceptability and efficiency in HMB treatment.
