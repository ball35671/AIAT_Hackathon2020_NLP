OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and safety of an oral
formulation of tranexamic acid for the treatment of heavy
menstrual bleeding.
METHODS: Adult women with heavy menstrual bleeding (mean menstrual blood loss 80 mL or more per cycle)
were enrolled in a double-blind, placebo-controlled
study. After two pretreatment menstrual cycles, women
were randomized to receive tranexamic acid 3.9 g/d or
placebo for up to 5 days per menstrual cycle through six
cycles. To meet the prespecified three-component primary efficacy end point, mean reduction in menstrual
blood loss from baseline with tranexamic acid treatment
needed to be 1) significantly greater than placebo, 2)
greater than 50 mL, and 3) greater than a predetermined
meaningful threshold (36 mL or higher). Health-related
quality of life was measured using a validated patientreported outcome instrument.
RESULTS: Women who received tranexamic acid
(n115) met all three primary efficacy end points: first, a
significantly greater reduction in menstrual blood loss of
69.6 mL (40.4%) compared with 12.6 mL (8.2%) in the
72 women who received placebo (P<.001); reduction of
menstrual blood loss exceeding a prespecified 50 mL;
and last, reduction of menstrual blood loss considered
meaningful to women. Compared with women receiving
placebo, women treated with tranexamic acid experienced significant improvements in limitations in social or
leisure and physical activities, work inside and outside
the home, and self-perceived menstrual blood loss
(P<.01). The majority of adverse events were mild to

LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: I
Heavy menstrual bleeding is described as a condition that “interferes with the woman’s physical,
social, emotional, and/or material quality of life.”1
Although quantitatively defined as menstrual blood
loss of 80 mL or more per menstrual cycle,2– 4 the
diagnosis of heavy menstrual bleeding is typically
based on personal perception of menstrual blood loss
and its effect on daily life. The negative effects of
heavy menstrual bleeding on health-related quality of
life (eg, limitations in daily activities, work functions,
and social interactions) are what often lead women to
seek medical treatment.5–9 Hormonal medications,
nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, and surgical
procedures can effectively reduce menstrual blood
loss; however, relative contraindications, variable efficacy, potential adverse effects, or undesired effects
on fertility can limit the use of these therapies.10
Evidence of increased fibrinolytic activity in the
menstrual blood of women with heavy menstrual
bleeding prompted evaluation of hemostatic agents as
potential therapeutic options.11,12 Having established
efficacy in reducing menstrual blood loss, tranexamic
acid, a competitive plasminogen inhibitor, has been
used for treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding outside of the United States for several decades.13,14 Oral,
immediate-release tranexamic acid is generally well
tolerated; however, gastrointestinal adverse effects
may limit its use.13 A unique oral formulation of
tranexamic acid (LYSTEDA) that provides a higher
per-tablet dose and increases drug absorption time
has been designed to maintain efficacy while minimizing gastrointestinal adverse effects and was recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of cyclic heavy menstrual
bleeding. In this report, we describe quantitative and
qualitative results from a phase 3 clinical trial of this
novel tranexamic acid formulation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
In this multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group
study, women with heavy menstrual bleeding were
randomized to receive tranexamic acid (LYSTEDA)
1.3 g per dose (two tablets, 650 mg each) or matching
placebo. Women were instructed to begin treatment
at the onset of heavy menstrual bleeding and to take
the study medication three times daily at least 6 hours
apart for up to 5 days per cycle over the course of six
menstrual cycles. The maximum daily dose of tranexamic acid was 3.9 g.
Adult women (age 18 to 49 years) with heavy
menstrual bleeding were enrolled at 40 clinical sites in
the United States. Participants were required to have
a history of three or more consecutive days of heavy
menstrual bleeding over at least four of their last six
menstrual periods. During a two-cycle pretreatment
baseline phase, menstrual blood loss had to be at least
60 mL during the first menstrual period and had to
average at least 80 mL over both pretreatment cycles.
Participants were required to have normal findings on
pelvic examination, no clinically important cervical
cytology abnormalities, and no clinically important
uterine pathologic findings by transvaginal ultrasonography. The transvaginal ultrasonogram was
considered abnormal if the endometrial thickness was
greater than 12 mm or if the endometrial thickness
was 5 to 12 mm and the patient’s clinical history
suggested long-term unopposed estrogen exposure (1
year or longer). If the transvaginal ultrasonogram was
considered abnormal, normal results on endometrial
biopsy were required. Presence of leiomyomas was
not considered an abnormal finding unless the
leiomyomas were of a sufficient number and size to
warrant surgical management. In addition, participants had to have a history of regularly occurring
menstrual periods of no more than 10 days in duration and 21 to 35 days from the start of one period
until the start of the next menstrual period. Women of
childbearing potential were required to use an acceptable nonhormonal method of birth control.
Women were excluded from the study if they had
a history or presence of significant medical problems
(eg, thromboembolic disease, coagulopathy, subarachnoid hemorrhage, endocrinopathy, or ocular
disease); had severe anemia (hemoglobin less than 8
g/dL); were pregnant or lactating; had a history or
presence of endometrial abnormalities or cervical
carcinoma; or had anovulatory dysfunctional uterine
bleeding, metrorrhagia, menometrorrhagia, or polymenorrhea. Participants were required to have normal color vision and could not have glaucoma, ocular
hypertension, macular degeneration, or retinopathies
(see Discussion for rationale).
Participants were not permitted to use anticoagulants, aspirin, dong quai, aminocaproic acid, or hy866 Lukes et al Oral Tranexamic Acid for Heavy Menstrual Bleeding OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY
droxychloroquine during the study. Cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory
drugs were not allowed during menstrual periods, but
were permitted during the intermenstrual phase of the
cycle. Use of acetaminophen, analgesic opioids, oral
iron therapy, and vitamins was permitted throughout
the study. Oral iron therapy was prescribed at the
investigator’s discretion for women with hemoglobin
levels between 11 g/dL and 12 g/dL at baseline. Oral
iron therapy was required for women with baseline
hemoglobin levels lower than 11 g/dL and for those
individuals whose hemoglobin levels declined to less
than 11 g/dL during the study.
The protocol received approval from each site’s
Institutional Review Board and was conducted in
compliance with the principles of the Declaration of
Helsinki and guidelines for Good Clinical Practice.
All participants provided signed informed consent.
The prespecified three-component primary efficacy end point was mean reduction in menstrual
blood loss with tranexamic acid treatment that was 1)
significantly greater than that of the placebo group, 2)
greater than 50 mL from baseline, and 3) greater than a
reduction in menstrual blood loss previously established
to be perceived as meaningful to women (36 mL or
higher; unpublished data). The change in menstrual
blood loss was calculated by subtracting the mean blood
loss during the two pretreatment cycles from the mean
blood loss during four of the on-treatment cycles (first,
second, third, and sixth cycles). Quantification of a
“meaningful” change was performed by constructing a
receiver operating characteristic curve based on change
in menstrual blood loss from baseline data and responses to Menorrhagia Impact Questionnaire (MIQ)
question 6 (see Table 1) in a separate, double-blind,
placebo-controlled heavy menstrual bleeding study.
Sensitivity and specificity were computed by dichotomizing the change in menstrual blood loss from baseline
values as above and below various thresholds (cutoff
points) in 1-mL increments and the MIQ question 6
responses as meaningful or not meaningful. The optimum balance of sensitivity and specificity was used as
the minimum value for a meaningful improvement in
menstrual blood loss.
Participants were instructed to collect and return
all menses captured on sponsor-provided sanitary
products for analysis; emphasis was placed on preventing loss of menstrual fluid. Individually labeled
bags containing each woman’s daily used sanitary
products were shipped by the study sites to a central
laboratory for quantification of menstrual blood loss.
The volume of menstrual blood was objectively measured using a validated alkaline hematin method.15
Secondary end points included change from
baseline in health-related quality-of-life parameters,
the occurrence of large blood stains, and hemoglobin
and ferritin concentrations. Qualitative health-related
quality-of-life assessments were based on responses to
the MIQ, a disease-specific, validated patient-reported outcome instrument (Table 1) that was completed by participants after all screening and treatment cycles. Among the parameters measured by the
MIQ were limitations on social or leisure activities,
limitations on physical activities, limitation in work
outside or inside the home, and patient perception of
treatment-induced changes in menstrual blood loss.
The number and size of blood stains were recorded
by participants in menstrual bleeding diaries. Hemoglobin and ferritin concentrations were determined
from routine laboratory evaluations. Normal hemoglobin concentrations were defined as more than 12
g/dL and normal ferritin levels were defined as more
than 10 ng/mL. Data for all prespecified secondary
end points and additional secondary end points (with
the exception of hemoglobin and ferritin levels) were
collected during all study menstrual cycles. Blood
samples for determining hemoglobin and ferritin concentrations were collected at baseline and treatment
menstrual periods 3 and 6.
Medication safety was assessed by evaluating laboratory data, performing physical examinations, measuring vital signs, evaluating data from 12-lead electrocardiography, performing ophthalmologic examinations,
and monitoring adverse events. Medication adherence
was assessed by study personnel who reviewed participant study diaries and counted returned tablets.
The sample size was calculated using a two-to-one
allocation and a 90% chance of detecting a 50-mL
difference in the mean change in menstrual blood loss
from baseline to end of study between groups. The
standard deviation of 85 mL used in the calculation was derived from previous tranexamic acid studies.16 –18 The sample size was based on a two-sided
0.05 level of significance and assumed normal
distribution of the data. An interim analysis by the
Data Safety Monitoring Board resulted in an increase
in the planned sample size by 28 participants (total
120 participants) in the tranexamic acid treatment
group and 18 participants (total 64 participants) in the
placebo treatment group to achieve appropriate
power for detecting between-group differences in the
prespecified secondary variables.
A randomization schedule was generated for
packaging, labeling, and treatment group assignment
using a permuted block randomization scheme. The
randomization block size was eight, with five particiVOL. 116, NO. 4, OCTOBER 2010 Lukes et al Oral Tranexamic Acid for Heavy Menstrual Bleeding 867
pants assigned to tranexamic acid and three participants assigned to placebo per block. Fisher Clinical
Services was responsible for generating the randomization and allocation sequence and enrolling and
assigning blinded study medication to individuals.
Participants, investigators, sponsor, statisticians, clinical data management staff, and clinical monitors were
blinded to study group allocation. Study drug was
individually packaged for each visit and labeled with
the study code. The tranexamic acid and placebo
tablets were identical in appearance.
Efficacy analyses were conducted using data
from the modified intent-to-treat population, which
included participants who had sufficient data at
baseline and for at least one treatment cycle. The
primary efficacy analysis included a between-treatment group comparison using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model and a within-treatment difference assessment using paired t tests for the mean
change from baseline in menstrual blood loss. To
address differences in baseline characteristics, baseline menstrual blood loss was used as a covariate in
the ANCOVA analysis. The calculations of leastsquares mean changes from baseline did not include
adjustment for baseline menstrual blood loss. Treatment effect was confirmed using a linear regression

analysis of menstrual blood loss over time by statistical testing of the significance and direction of the
regression slope. Additional comparative treatment
analyses included the percentage of menstrual cycles
with 1) menstrual blood loss of 80 mL or less, 2)
decrease of 36 mL or more in menstrual blood loss from
baseline (calculated by receiver operating characteristic
analysis to be the threshold for a meaningful reduction in menstrual blood loss), 3) 50-mL or more
decrease in menstrual blood loss from baseline, and
4) 50% or more decrease in menstrual blood loss
from baseline.
Prespecified secondary end-point analyses were
performed under a sequential step-down procedure in
the following order of importance: 1) changes in
limitations on social or leisure activities scores, 2)
changes in limitations on physical activities scores,
and 3) large stain responder (percentage of participants with a decrease from baseline in the number of
large stains). The sequence was fixed before unblinding. The hypotheses were to be tested at 0.05 level
of significance. If at any point of the testing sequence
results were not statistically significant, then any
remaining prespecified analyses were to be exploratory in nature. All secondary end points were comparisons of the mean of the two baseline cycles and
the mean of the six treatment cycles. Between-treatment differences in the prespecified and other secondary end points were evaluated using ANCOVA, with
the study group treatment cycle value and the baseline value included as covariates in their respective
analyses. Using general linear models, least-squares
means change (adjusted mean) was computed with
the respective baseline health-related quality-of-life
score as the covariate and reported as a positive value.
The within-treatment test was conducted using a
paired difference t test. The intraparticipant differences for the number of large stains were calculated as
the average number of stains recorded during treatment minus the baseline average. The percentage of
participants with a reduction from baseline in the
number of large stains was compared between treatment groups using a two-tailed Fisher exact test.
Demographic and safety data were described
using summary statistics. Analysis of variance was
used to assess between-group differences in these
parameters. Safety evaluations were conducted using
data from the intent-to-treat population, which included all randomized participants who took at least
one dose of study drug. All statistical analyses were
performed using SAS 9.1.3.
RESULTS
A total of 196 participants were randomized to receive tranexamic acid (n123) or placebo (n73;
Fig. 1). The intent-to-treat population consisted of 189
women, 117 in the tranexamic acid group and 72 in
the placebo group. Six participants in the tranexamic
acid group and 1 in the placebo group were excluded
from the intent-to-treat analyses because they did not
ingest at least one dose of study drug. The modified
intent-to-treat population consisted of 187 women,
115 in the tranexamic acid group and 72 in the
placebo group. Two individuals in the tranexamic
acid group were excluded from the modified intentto-treat analyses because posttreatment data were
unavailable. In all, 148 women completed the study,
94 in the tranexamic acid group and 54 in the placebo
group. Forty-eight participants withdrew from the
study; the majority were lost to follow-up (16 individuals). Two participants in the placebo group and no
individuals in the tranexamic acid group discontinued
because of unsatisfactory efficacy response. The first
participant was screened on October 16, 2006, and
the last study visit was May 8, 2008.
Both groups had comparable baseline and demographic characteristics, with the exception of baseline
menstrual blood loss (Table 2). Participants in the
modified intent-to-treat population randomized to
receive tranexamic acid (n115) had a slightly higher
baseline menstrual blood loss compared with the 72
women randomized to receive placebo (172.395.6
and 153.066.6 mL/cycle, respectively); however,
the difference was not statistically significant (P.11).
The mean number of treatment days per cycle was 3.4
days for tranexamic acid and 3.3 days for participants
taking placebo. Among the 188 individuals with
treatment compliance data, 96.3% of tablets were
taken in both treatment groups.
Women with heavy menstrual bleeding treated
with tranexamic acid achieved the prespecified threepart primary efficacy outcome. A statistically significant reduction in mean menstrual blood loss occurred
among women in the modified intent-to-treat population receiving tranexamic acid compared with those
receiving placebo (69.6 mL [40.4% reduction] compared with 12.6 mL [8.2% reduction]; P.001), and
the reduction in menstrual blood loss from baseline
for those receiving tranexamic acid was greater than
50 mL and also exceeded the threshold of menstrual
blood loss reduction (36 mL and greater) considered
meaningful to women. Least-squares mean change in
menstrual blood loss was also significantly greater in
the tranexamic acid group (66.3 mL [38.5% reducVOL. 116, NO. 4, OCTOBER 2010 Lukes et al Oral Tranexamic Acid for Heavy Menstrual Bleeding 869
tion]) compared with placebo group (17.8 mL
[11.6% reduction]; P.001).
The reduction in menstrual blood loss from baseline with tranexamic acid use was reported by women
after the first treatment cycle (Fig. 2) and this reduction was maintained in each measured treatment
cycle (confirmed by linear regression analyses). Treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding with tranexamic
acid was effective in reducing menstrual bleeding
regardless of presence of leiomyomas or baseline
menstrual blood loss (Fig. 3). The blood loss on
treatment declined to less than 80 mL (standard
definition of heavy menstrual bleeding) in 43% (181/
426) of menstrual cycles in women receiving tranexamic acid, compared with 17% (43/254) of cycles in
women receiving placebo (P.001).
The percentage of cycles with clinically meaningful reduction in menstrual blood loss of at least 36 mL
was greater with tranexamic acid treatment (69%)
compared with placebo use (29%; P.001). Further, a
significantly greater percentage of menstrual cycles
had a reduction of at least 50 mL in the tranexamic
acid group (56%) compared with the placebo group
(19%; P.001). In terms of the percentage of menstrual blood loss reduction, the proportion of women
with at least a 50% reduction of menstrual blood loss
from baseline was greater in the tranexamic acid
group (35%) compared with placebo (7%; P.001).
Two of the three prespecified secondary end
points were met by women receiving tranexamic acid.
Mean improvements in scores for limitations on
social or leisure activities and limitations on physical
activities were significantly greater in the tranexamic
acid group compared with the placebo group, respectively (P.001; Fig. 4A). The change in least-squares
means in scores for limitations on social or leisure
activities (0.850.13 compared with 0.440.12;
P.001) and limitations on physical activities
(0.870.13 compared with 0.400.14; P.001) was
significantly greater in the tranexamic acid group
compared with placebo group, respectively. The

in the number of large stains reported from baseline
(large stain responder) was slightly higher among
women treated with tranexamic acid than with
placebo; however, the difference was not statistically significant (P.45; Fig. 4B). Improvements in
scores for limitations on social or leisure activities
and limitations on physical activities were evident
during the first treatment cycle and were maintained throughout the study (Fig. 5A and 5B). For
women receiving tranexamic acid, scores for limitations on social or leisure activities and limitations
on physical activities improved from “moderate
impairment” at baseline to “slight impairment”
after treatment.
Secondary end-point analyses revealed that participants in the tranexamic acid treatment group
experienced a larger reduction (indicating improvement) in mean scores for limitation in work outside or
inside the home compared with women taking placebo (0.710.85 compared with 0.160.87, respectively; P.001); improvements were evident during the first treatment cycle and were maintained
throughout the study (Fig. 5C). Statistically significant
between-group treatment differences were observed
for mean changes in perceived menstrual blood loss
scores from baseline (0.470.59 and 0.150.67 for
tranexamic acid and placebo participants, respectively, P.001; Fig. 5D).
Anemia was more prevalent at baseline in the
tranexamic acid group (33.9% [39/115]) than in the
placebo group (18.1% [13/72]). Mean hemoglobin
levels did not appreciably increase from baseline in

g/dL); a slight but statistically significant increase was
observed in the placebo group (0.340.66 g/dL;
P.001); this change is not considered clinically
significant. Mean changes from baseline ferritin concentrations were not significant in either group
(1.2112.70 and 2.6816.15 ng/mL for tranexamic acid and placebo groups, respectively).
This formulation of tranexamic acid was generally well tolerated, and the majority of adverse events
in the intent-to-treat population were mild to moderate in severity. The most common adverse events
reported were menstrual discomfort or cramps, headache, and back pain (Table 3). Sinus headache and
anemia were reported more often with tranexamic
acid use than with placebo. The frequency of gastrointestinal-related adverse events was similar between
groups. Six serious adverse events were reported
during the study: in the tranexamic acid group, one
incident each of tachycardia, acute bronchitis, hypoglycemia, posttraumatic stress disorder, and urticaria;
in the placebo group, one incident of deep vein
thrombosis. All of these events were judged to be
unrelated to study treatment. No thrombotic events
were reported in the participants treated with tranexamic acid and no deaths occurred during the study.
Seven study participants reported or experienced an
ocular-related adverse effect that was considered possibly or probably treatment related; two of these
individuals were receiving tranexamic acid and five
were receiving placebo. In the tranexamic acid group,
a woman missed one blue-yellow color vision plate
(right eye) during an eye examination and another
woman complained of a nonspecific visual disturbance; these conditions were not considered clinically
significant. No clinically significant changes in blood
pressure, pulse rate, physical or gynecologic findings,

DISCUSSION
In this phase 3 trial, a new oral tranexamic acid
formulation provided quantitative and qualitative relief for women with heavy menstrual bleeding. In
terms of menstrual blood loss, the three-part primary
efficacy end point was achieved in significantly more
women treated with tranexamic acid than with placebo, and tranexamic acid treatment resulted in consistent improvement irrespective of baseline menstrual blood loss or the presence of uterine
leiomyomas. More than two thirds of women treated
with tranexamic acid experienced clinically meaningful reductions in menstrual blood loss (36 mL and
greater), with a significantly greater proportion of
tranexamic acid–treated menstrual cycles reaching
menstrual blood loss volumes within the normal
range (less than 80 mL) compared with placebo.
Moreover, women receiving tranexamic acid reported statistically and, most likely, clinically significant improvements in health-related quality-of-life
parameters compared with those receiving placebo.
Improvements in both menstrual blood loss and
health-related quality-of-life parameters were observed during the first treatment cycle and were
maintained throughout the 6-month study duration.
Quantitative measurements of menstrual blood
loss used in clinical trials are typically not practical in
routine clinical care, as women are required to collect
and return all menses captured on sanitary products
for laboratory analysis. Previous studies had suggested that tranexamic acid improves health-related
quality of life in women with heavy menstrual bleeding, although limitations in study design (eg, openlabel, nonspecific health-related quality-of-life assessment tool, lack of a placebo group) hindered
interpretation of clinical relevance.19 –21 By using a
validated patient-reported outcomes tool in a placebo-controlled, double-blind study, we feel that the
statistically significant improvements in health-related
quality of life with tranexamic acid compared with
placebo in our study represent a clinically significant
and meaningful finding for women with heavy menstrual bleeding.

acid treatment group and were not significantly different from the placebo group. These findings may be
due in part to the use of oral iron therapy in individuals with low baseline hemoglobin and ferritin levels,
the greater number of participants in the tranexamic
acid group with anemia at baseline, and the higher
mean baseline menstrual blood loss measured in the
placebo group. In addition, changes in hemoglobin
and ferritin concentrations are more likely to be
observed over the long term (more than 6 months) in
a population with chronic cyclic heavy menstrual
bleeding such as ours (mean duration of heavy menstrual bleeding, 10 years). Future studies should assess
the long-term efficacy of tranexamic acid.
The formulation of tranexamic acid used in this
study was well tolerated. Previous studies of an immediate-release tranexamic acid formulation indicate
that therapy-limiting gastrointestinal adverse effects
occurred.16,22 The novel, oral formulation of tranexamic acid studied here was designed to decrease the
rate of drug delivery to the gastric mucosa and
therefore facilitate gastrointestinal tolerability. In the
current study, the frequency of gastrointestinal-related
adverse events was comparable between tranexamic
acid and placebo groups. Eye examinations were
included in our evaluation of safety because focal
areas of retinal degeneration have been observed in
animal studies of intravenous tranexamic acid and
visual abnormalities have been noted in postmarketing surveys. Treatment-related ocular findings in this
study were not considered clinically significant.
In women with heavy menstrual bleeding, tranexamic acid appears to stabilize the deposition of
endometrial vascular wall fibrin that occurs with
menstruation,13 but is unlikely to increase thrombosis. Thrombosis has not been observed in men or
women receiving tranexamic acid for the management of bleeding secondary to cardiac or oral
surgery, acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding, or
ocular trauma,13,14,23 and the use of tranexamic acid is
not associated with an increased risk or incidence of
thromboembolic events compared with the background rate of thrombotic events in women of childbearing age.14,24,25 The results from the tranexamic
acid clinical program, including a long-term, openlabel safety study in women treated with tranexamic
acid for up to 27 months (data not shown), support
these studies and retrospective evaluations. Although
one thrombotic event was reported in this clinical
study, it occurred in a participant receiving placebo.
One limitation of the study was the prohibition of
certain medications during the entire study period (eg,
hormonal contraceptives) or during the women’s
menstrual cycle (eg, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory
drugs, cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors) to avoid potential
confounding effects on menstrual blood loss or adverse events12 (Mirena package insert, Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals, Wayne, NJ, October 2009).
Additional data are needed to determine whether
concomitant use of these medications with tranexamic acid would influence the risk of certain adverse
events.
In the current study, use of tranexamic acid
significantly reduced menstrual blood loss from baseline and improved health-related quality of life while
maintaining safety and tolerability. The adverse
events were predominantly mild to moderate, with an
incidence of gastrointestinal events that was comparable with placebo. Tranexamic acid offers a first-line,
nonhormonal, nonsurgical treatment option for
women with cyclic heavy menstrual bleeding that
may become an important alternative to surgical
procedures and medical treatments.
