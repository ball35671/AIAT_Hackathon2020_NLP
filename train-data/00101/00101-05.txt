OBJECTIVE: We sought to assess the efficacy and safety of 2 dosing
regimens of a novel, oral tranexamic acid formulation (Lysteda; Ferring
Pharmaceuticals Inc, Parsippany, NJ) in women with cyclic heavy menstrual bleeding.
STUDY DESIGN: This was a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, parallel-group trial for 3 menstrual cycles (n  304).
Women with mean menstrual blood loss (MBL) of 80 mL/cycle were randomized to receive either 1.95 g/d or 3.9 g/d of tranexamic acid or placebo
for up to 5 days of menstrual bleeding. Primary efficacy endpoints were
mean MBL reduction from baseline, mean MBL reductions that were considered “meaningful” by subjects, and mean MBL reductions from baseline
50 mL/cycle. Adverse events (AEs) were also assessed.
RESULTS: Only the 3.9 g/d group met all 3 primary efficacy endpoints.
AEs did not significantly differ among the 3 groups. There were no serious study-related AEs.
CONCLUSION: The 3.9-g/d dose met all 3 primary efficacy endpoints,
whereas the 1.95 g/d dose met 2 primary efficacy endpoints. Both
doses were well tolerated.

Heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) associated with menorrhagia is quantitatively defined as menstrual blood loss
(MBL) 80 mL/cycle.1 Up to 30% of
women will consult with a physician regarding HMB during their reproductive
years.2 HMB creates a clinically significant
burden for affected women by interfering
with daily activities and negatively impacting health-related quality of life (HRQL).3
The impact of HMB on HRQL derives
from both the mechanics of managing
bleeding and the consequences of excessive
blood loss, such as fatigue and iron deficiency anemia.4
Tranexamic acid has been shown to
reduce the increased fibrinolytic activity
observed in the endometrial tissue of
women with HMB.5Tranexamic acid is a
nonhormonal, antifibrinolytic, competitive plasmin inhibitor that is administered only during HMB for up to 5 days.
It has a well-established safety profile,
and does not appear to affect fertility.6,7
For 4 decades, an immediate-release
formulation of tranexamic acid has been
used outside the United States to treat
HMB.8 Gastrointestinal (GI) adverse
events (AEs) have limited patients’ tolerability of previously studied immediateFrom the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Pennsylvania School of

release tranexamic acid; however, a
novel, orally administered, modified-release formulation of tranexamic acid
(TA, Lysteda; Ferring Pharmaceuticals,
Inc, Parsippany, NJ) was recently approved in the United States for the treatment of cyclic HMB. TA was developed
to effectively treat HMB with increased
tolerability via a modified-release formulation. In phase I studies, TA was
shown to be bioequivalent to immediate-release tranexamic acid and was well
tolerated.9 In a previous phase III study,
TA was shown to be effective and safe for
women with HMB.10 This phase III
study was conducted in an independent
population from the previous report,10
to assess the efficacy and safety of 2-dosage regimens of TA (1.95 g/d and 3.9 g/d)
for the reduction of MBL in women with
HMB.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Women aged 18-49 years with a history
of cyclic HMB were eligible to participate
in the study if they met a minimum MBL
requirement during 2 pretreatment cycles (average MBL 80 mL/cycle as assessed by a validated alkaline hematin
method), had at least 6 months of regularly occurring menstrual cycles (21-35
days apart) with menstrual periods lasting not 10 days, had normal findings
on pelvic examination, had no abnormal
findings at cervical cytology screening,
and had normal findings on transvaginal
ultrasonograms. Though it is noted that
fibroids are not a normal finding during
pelvic examinations or transvaginal ultrasounds, for the purpose of this study,
women with fibroids were not excluded
unless, based on the opinion of the investigator of the size and number, the fibroids required surgical management.
Subjects were excluded from the study
based on history or presence of clinically
significant disease, anovulatory dysfunctional uterine bleeding, metrorrhagia,
menometrorrhagia, polymenorrhea, endometrial polyps, endometrial hyperplasia, endometrial carcinoma, cervical carcinoma, myocardial infarction, ischemic
disease, cerebrovascular accident, stroke,
transient ischemic attack, thrombosis,
thromboembolic disease, or coagulopathy. Additional exclusion criteria consisted
of clinically significant abnormalities that
could confound the study or be detrimental to the subject noted at physical examination such as abnormalities noted on
electrocardiograms, and laboratory test
results indicating a potential pituitaryprolactin secreting or producing tumor
(prolactin 30g/L), uncontrolled hypothyroidism, or severe anemia (hemoglobin
8 g/dL). Women with a history of bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy, or
who were pregnant, breast-feeding, planning to become pregnant during the study,
or became pregnant during the study were
also excluded.
Except for the use of acetaminophen
and opioids (permitted at any time during the study), nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, and cyclooxygenase-2
inhibitors (permitted only during the intermenstrual phase of the cycle), subjects
using medications to relieve symptoms associated with HMB before screening were
allowed to enter the study after a washout
period of up to 8 weeks. Anticoagulants;
aspirin; dong quai; aminocaproic acid; hydroxychloroquine; and oral, transdermal,
injectable, and vaginal hormonal contraceptives were not allowed at any time during the study.Womenmust have been surgically sterile or must have been using a
copper intrauterine device or another acceptable barrier method (eg, condom or
diaphragm) with spermicide for the duration of the study.
Study design
This was an outpatient, multicenter,
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. The study
consisted of a screening phase of 2 menstrual periods (no treatment) to determine eligibility. Eligible subjects had an
average MBL of 80 mL across both cycles. The treatment phase spanned 3
menstrual periods to assess the efficacy
and safety of TA at oral doses of 0.65 g or
1.3 g administered 3 times daily for total
doses of 1.95 g/d or 3.9 g/d. Either TA
dose or placebo was administered for up
to 5 consecutive days (maximum of 15
doses) during menstruation. Soiled sanitary products were collected at each
study site visit. A follow-up telephone
call occurred approximately 30 days
(range, 25–35 days) after the last day the
study drug was administered to remind
subjects to mail completed diaries to
their study sites, review medication use,
and review any AEs.
The protocol was approved by the institutional review board at each of the 63 participating US study sites before screening
began. The study was conducted from December 4, 2006, through May 29, 2008.
This study was conducted in accordance
with the ethical principles that have their
origin in the Declaration of Helsinki and
that are consistent with Good Clinical
Practice and the applicable regulatory
requirements.
Assessments
Efficacy
The 3 primary efficacy endpoints were
achieved if: (1) mean MBL reduction
from baseline with TA treatment was significantly greater than placebo; (2) MBL
reduction from baseline exceeded a
threshold (36 mL/cycle) that was perceived as “meaningful” to subjects as determined by a receiver operator characteristic analysis11; and (3) mean reduction in
MBL with TA treatment exceeded 50 mL/
cycle. Reductions in MBL were assessed by
a validated alkaline hematin method that
involves using mechanical agitation to
extract the blood from soiled sanitary
products using 5% sodium hydroxide.The
hemoglobin captured in the sanitary products is converted to alkaline hematin
(standardized to the subject’s venous
blood provided) and measured spectrophotometrically. The prespecified secondary efficacy outcomes measured subjective
improvement using items from the Menorrhagia Impact Questionnaire (MIQ) regarding limitations in physical activities
and limitations in social or leisure activities, and the proportion of subjects with a
decrease from baseline in the number of
large stains reported in diaries.
Safety
Safety was assessed via AE monitoring
(conducted at each study visit), physical
examinations, 12-lead electrocardiograms, vital sign measurements, and
laboratory evaluations. Ophthalmologic
acuity, color blindness, intraocular presResearch General Gynecology www.AJOG.org

sure, and dilated fundus examinations
were performed at baseline and at study
endpoint or at an early termination
study visit. The causal relationship between an AE and the study drug was determined by the investigator based on his
or her clinical judgment.
Statistical methods
To have a 90% chance of detecting a
50-mL difference between the mean
change from pretreatment MBL in the
active treatment and placebo groups (2:1
allocation), at least 92 subjects in the active treatment group and 46 subjects in
the placebo group were required. This
sample size calculation assumed a 65-mL
reduction in MBL in the active treatment
group, a 15-mL reduction in MBL in the
placebo group, and the SD of the change
from baseline data to be   85 mL. The
SD of   85 mL used in the calculations
was based on observed SDs from previous MBL studies.12-14 The sample size
was based on a 2-sided   .05 level of
significance and the assumption that the
response data were normally distributed.
Efficacy
Efficacy data are reported for the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population.
The mITT population included all randomized subjects who received at least 1
dose of study drug and had sufficient
daily primary efficacy data to construct 1
period of data after the first dose of study
drug. For the primary efficacy endpoints,
change in MBL was calculated by subtracting the mean on-treatment MBL
(average of MBL from all 3 cycles) from
the mean pretreatment MBL (average of
MBL from 2 baseline cycles). The percent reduction from baseline in MBL was
calculated by dividing the mean change
in MBL during treatment by the mean
MBL pretreatment and multiplying by
100. Between-group comparisons of primary or secondary endpoint changes
from baseline were conducted using an
analysis of covariance with treatment
group and baseline values from the endpoint as covariates. Within-group assessments of the changes from baseline were
performed using paired difference t tests.
All secondary analyses were considered
strictly supportive to the primary analysis.
Safety
Safety data are reported for the intent-totreat (ITT) population. The ITT population included all randomized subjects who
received atleast1 dose of study drug. Safety
data were summarized by the evaluation
time point. Summaries for quantitative
variables included appropriate descriptive
statistics. Frequency countswere compiled
for classification of qualitative variables.
Analyses for safety parameters were not
adjusted for multiplicity.
RESULTS
Patients
Of the 304 subjects randomized, 297
subjects received at least 1 dose of study
drug and were included in the ITT population used for safety analyses. Of the
297 subjects in the ITT population, 3 did
not have any efficacy data. Thus 294 subjects were included in the mITT population for efficacy analyses; 115 subjects in
the 1.95 g/d TA group, 112 subjects in
the 3.9 g/d TA group, and 67 subjects
in the placebo group. The percentage of
women who withdrew from the study
was low (10.5%) and consistent across
groups (Table 1 and Figure 1). Failure to
return was the predominant reason for
study withdrawal.
There were no statistically significant
differences among the 1.95 g/d TA, 3.9
g/d TA, or placebo groups in demographics or baseline characteristics (Table 2). Most subjects had long-standing
HMB, with a mean duration ranging
from 10 –12 years. Baseline MBL was
slightly lower in the placebo group compared with 1.95 g/d and 3.9 g/d TA

groups, but this difference was not statistically significant.
Within the ITT population, the reported
treatment use was less than the maximum
of 15 doses per cycle, largely because the
duration of HMB in most subjects was 5
days. Mean number of exposure days per
subjects per cycle was 3.3 days in the 1.95
g/dTA group and3.4 daysin the3.9 g/dTA
and placebo groups. The total number of
exposure cycles was 327, 323, and 193 cycles for 1.95 g/d TA, 3.9 g/d TA, and placebo groups, respectively.
Efficacy
Primary efficacy endpoints
Improvementsfrom baseline inMBL were
significantly greater with both TA doses,
1.95 g/d and 3.9 g/d, compared with placebo (P  .0001) (Figure 2). Percent reductions from baseline in MBL were
26.1%, 38.6%, and 1.9% for the 1.95 g/d
TA, 3.9 g/d TA, and placebo groups, respectively. Reductions in MBL with TA
treatment were evident during the first
treatment cycle and were maintained
throughout the study (Figure 3). No MBL
data were collected posttreatment. All of
the primary efficacy endpoints were met
by the 3.9 g/d TA group, whereas 2 of the 3
efficacy criteria were met by the 1.95 g/d
TA group. The 1.95 g/d TA group had a
mean reduction from baseline in MBL of

46.45 mL, which did not reach the 50 mL/
cycle threshold.
Secondary efficacy endpoints
Subjects in both the 3.9 g/d and 1.95 g/d
TA groups experienced a significant reduction from baseline in mean (SD) MIQ
scoresfor limitationsin social or leisure activities (1.01 [1.1], P  .0001; and 0.74
[0.92], P  .0055, respectively) compared
with the placebo group. Furthermore, subjects in both the 3.9 g/d and 1.95 g/d TA
groups experienced a significant reduction
from baseline in mean (SD) MIQ scores
for limitations in physical activities (0.97
[1.0], P  .0001; and 0.69 [0.89], P 
.0030, respectively) compared with the
placebo group. The proportion of subjects
with a decrease in the number of large
stains reported was greater in the 1.95 g/d
and 3.9 g/d TA groups compared with placebo; however, the difference between active treatment and placebo groups did not
achieve statistical significance.
Safety
Treatment with TA was generally well tolerated; the majority of treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) were mild to moderate
in severity. A total of 257 subjects (86.5%)
reported TEAEs with no significant difference among the 3 treatment groups.
No deaths or life-threatening, treatmentemergent serious AEs (SAEs) occurred
among randomized subjects. The most
frequently reported TEAEs, occurring in
5% of TA-treated women and at twice
the percentage of placebo-treated women,
are included in Table 3.
No thrombotic or thromboembolic
TEAEs were reported during the study.
The incidence of GI and ocular events
was low. Only 4 subjects (1.4%) experienced a total of 5 GI-related AEs. These
were classified as probably related to
study treatment. Nausea occurred in 1
subject in each of the 3 treatment groups
and diarrhea and upper abdominal pain
occurred in the same subject in the 1.95
g/d TA group. Three subjects experienced ocular events that were considered
possibly related to study drug. Lenticular
opacities occurred in 1 subject in the 3.9
g/d TA group; blurred vision occurred in
1 subject each in the 3.9 g/d TA group
and the placebo group. All 3 subjects
completed the study.
Five subjects withdrew from the study
due to AEs, which were considered definitely not or probably not related to
study treatment. The AEs leading to
withdrawal were mild myalgia (1 subject
in the 3.9 g/d TA group); moderate anemia, moderate menorrhagia, and severe
anemia (1 subject each in the 1.95 g/d TA
group); and moderate headache (1 subject in the placebo group). All AEs leading to withdrawal had resolved at subjects’ follow-up visits, except for the AE

of severe anemia in 1 subject, which was
ongoing at the follow-up visit.
Two subjects reported 4 SAEs; none
were considered related to treatment. One
subject experienced severe dyspepsia, gastritis, and chest pain that were considered
probably not related to treatment while receiving 3.9 g/d TA; all these SAEs resolved.
The other subject experienced severe ovarian torsion on day 56 of the study while
receiving 1.95 g/d TA. The subjectwas hospitalized, received appropriate treatments
for ovarian torsion, and the SAE resolved
that same day. The SAE was considered
unrelated to treatment.
Most subjects in each treatment group
had normal baseline values and normal
findings at physical and gynecologic examination with no abnormal vital sign measures identified during the final clinical examination. For all study subjects, mean
changes from baseline and shifts from the
normal range for laboratory parameters
were not considered clinically significant.
COMMENT
This study provides further evidence of
the efficacy and safety of TA for the treatment of HMB. The findings confirm the
results reported in a previous study that
demonstrated the efficacy of 3.9 g/d TA
in treating women with cyclic HMB and
significant improvement in HRQL.10
The present study adds new information
about the efficacy of a lower TA dose.
Women in both the 1.95 g/d and 3.9 g/d
TA groups experienced significant reductions in HMB and also perceived the
mean MBL reduction from baseline as
“meaningful.” The 3.9 g/d TA group exceeded the prespecified 50 mL/cycle
MBL reduction criteria (65.3 mL), but
the 1.95 g/d TA group was not as effective
as the higher dose in reducing MBL 50

mL/cycle (46.5 mL), demonstrating a
dose-response relationship. Reductions
in MBL were apparent during the first
treatment cycle and were maintained
over 3 cycles.
Statistically significant improvements
in HRQL were seen in both the 3.9 g/d
and 1.95 g/d TA groups. This improvement is consistent with improvements in
HRQL observed in subjects in previous
TA studies,15 and is particularly noteworthy because the effect of HMB on
physical, social, emotional, and/or material quality of life is the impetus for many
women to seek treatment.4,16
Although subjects were allowed 5 consecutive days of treatment per cycle, mean
exposure to TA was 3.4, 3.3, and 3.4 days
for the 3.9 g/d TA, 1.95 g/d TA, and placebo groups, respectively. These findings
are consistent with the prior observation
that themajority ofMBL occurs during the
first 3 days of menstruation.17
TA was well tolerated among subjects
with HMB with no significant difference
in reports of AEs among the 3 treatment
groups. Although concern has been
raised about the potential for thromboembolic events to occur in patients undergoing antifibrinolytic therapy, the absence of thromboembolic events in
subjects in this study is consistent with
data presented in previous studies that
show no increased risk with tranexamic
acid treatment.7 The incidence of treatment-related GI and ophthalmic AEs
was low across treatment groups.
Limitations
Patients were not permitted to use nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, a common therapy for menstrual discomfort,
during the treatment phase of each cycle.
They were also not permitted to use concomitant oral contraceptives at any time
during the study. This decision was made
based on evaluation of efficacy of TA in
combination with the known thrombotic
risks associated with oral contraceptives.
Therefore, the results reportedin this study
are not generalizable to women who remain on hormonal treatmentwhile receiving TA treatment.
Conclusion
The novel, nonhormonal TA formulation evaluated in this study was well tolerated and provided a dose-proportional
reduction in MBL that was evident with
the first treatment cycle and sustained
over the duration of the study in women
with HMB. f
