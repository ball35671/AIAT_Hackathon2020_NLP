 Introduction
 Menstrual irregularities are one of the most common
complaints heard in daily gynecology practice. Heavy
menstrual bleeding (HMB) is defined as blood loss of 80
ml or more or a condition when the duration of menses
exceeds 7 days [1] . A recent modification of the definition
based on patients’ complaints has been carried out by the
National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence; the
modified definition is excessive menstrual blood loss
(MBL) interfering with a woman’s physical, emotional,
social or material quality of life (QOL) [2] . HMB accounts
for 12% of all gynecology referrals, and the psychosocial

 Abstract
Background: Our aim was to compare the therapeutic efficacies of norethisterone acid (NETA), tranexamic acid and
levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) in
treating idiopathic heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB). Methods: Women with heavy uterine bleeding were randomized
to receive NETA, tranexamic acid or LNG-IUS for 6 months.
The primary outcome was a decrease in menstrual bleeding
as assessed by pictorial blood loss assessment charts and hematological parameters analyzed at the 1st, 3rd and 6th
months. Health-related quality of life (QOL) variables were
also recorded and analyzed. Results: Twenty-eight patients
were enrolled in each treatment group, but the results of
only 62 were evaluated. NETA, tranexamic acid, and LNG-IUS
reduced menstrual blood loss (MBL) by 53.1, 60.8, and 85.8%,
respectively, at the 6th month. LNG-IUS was more effective
than NETA and tranexamic acid in decreasing MBL. LNG-IUS
was also more efficient than tranexamic acid in correcting
anemia related to menorrhagia. Satisfaction rates were comparable among the NETA (70%), tranexamic acid (63%) and

factors possibly have an impact on their seeking health
care [1, 3] . Regarding the etiology, a new PALM-COEIN
(polyp; adenomyosis; leiomyoma; malignancy and hyperplasia; coagulopathy; ovulatory dysfunction; endometrial; iatrogenic; and not yet classified) classification of
HMB has recently been developed [4] . A small proportion of women of reproductive age presenting with HMB
have intrauterine pathologies such as endometrial hyperplasia and malignancy [5] .
 The first choice of treatment in idiopathic HMB
should be the least invasive and the least expensive medical therapy available among the wide variety of medications in use, including hormonal and non-hormonal
agents [6] . Levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system
(LNG-IUS) has recently been proven to be very effective.
LNG-IUS can be used as a first-line treatment but this can
have some unpleasant side effects such as unscheduled
spotting, pain and systemic progestogenic effects, resulting in discontinuation of therapy [7] . It is also not convenient for patients who are not sexually active. Among the
most popular progestogens, norethisterone (NETA) is
widely accepted for treatment of HMB in Europe.
Tranexamic acid acts by a different mechanism than do
hormonal agents and has been prescribed less often by
physicians.
 One of the determining factors for treatment success
is patient compliance with the treatment. Women suffering from HMB also have psychosocial problems, and so
patient satisfaction and effect on QOL play a major role
in the assessment of therapeutic efficacy of treatment options [8] . Therefore, we aimed at comparing the efficacy
of LNG-IUS with that of other treatments. The primary
outcome was the decrease in menstrual bleeding and improvement in anemia, and the secondary outcome was
patient satisfaction, including QOL.
 Materials and Methods
 Women who were admitted to outpatient clinics of a training
and research hospital and who suffered from HMB were asked to
participate in this randomized comparative study. The study was
approved by the Institutional Review Board and Local Ethics Committee.
 Menstrual flow was graded by the self-assessment of amount of
blood loss using pictorial blood loss assessment charts (PBAC) designed by Higham et al. [9] . A score was computed by multiplying
the number of lightly, moderately and heavily soiled pads and tampons with fixed absorption factors. A score of 100 refers to a blood
loss of 80 ml, which corresponds to HMB. Premenopausal patients
(18–45 years) with complaints of regular but heavy periods and
who had mean PBAC scores of ≥ 100 during 2 consecutive periods
were included in the study. The exclusion criteria were malign cervicovaginal cytology; severe anemia; contraindications to current
therapies; systemic diseases like hypertension, diabetes, thyroid
diseases or coronary artery diseases; and history of previous medication for menorrhagia. Patients with fibroids smaller than 2 cm
and not distorting the endometrial cavity were accepted.
 After a thorough physical examination and ultrasonographic
evaluation, all women underwent endometrial biopsy before the
study, either using a Pipelle endometrial suction curette or using a
Karman cannula to rule out any organic endometrial pathology.
Coagulation tests, such as tests for prothrombin time and activated
partial thromboplastin time, were performed. Blood samples were
taken to test for hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (Hct), ferritin, serum iron and iron-binding capacity analyses. Suspicious patients
with irregular endometrial thickness were assessed by saline infusion sonography to preclude endometrial polyps or submucosal
fibroids.
 After they gave written informed consent, patients who fulfilled
eligibility criteria were recruited to one of the following 3 groups:
oral NETA (5 mg 3 times daily, total dose 15 mg/day) for 10 days
between the 14th and 23rd day of menstrual cycle, oral tranexamic acid (1 g 4 times daily, total dose of 4 g/day) for the first 4 days
of the cycle, and LNG-IUS releasing 20 μg levonorgestrel per day,
which was applied during the first few days of menstruation. Oral
tranexamic acid and NETA were given for 6 menstrual cycles. Randomization was performed with computer-generated codes. None
of the recruited patients were symptomatic because of anemia (Hb
>10 g/dl), and oral iron preparations were not prescribed. Patients
were examined in the first, third and sixth months of the treatment.
Side effects of the medications were recorded. Additionally, patients were asked to respond ‘yes’ or ‘no’ if they were satisfied or
not satisfied with the treatment. The first month of treatment was
defined as the period of 1 month beginning from the application
of LNG-IUS.
 QOL evaluation was performed according to the World Health
Organization Quality of Life-Short Form, Turkish version
 (WHOQOL-BREF TR), which consists of 26 questions. The participants were asked 7 questions regarding their physical health, 6
about their psychological status, 3 about their social support and 8
relating to their environment. The Turkish version has an additional national item contributing the environmental domain of the
scale. Each facet of the WHOQOL-BREF TR is measured using a
5-point Likert scale about the respondents’ feelings over the previous 2 weeks. The range of scores was between 1 and 100, with
higher scores indicating better QOL. Forms were filled out by the
patients privately, with the assistance of trained research assistants
before treatment and after 6 months. Neither patients nor researchers were blinded to treatment.
 The primary outcome for the study was the difference in PBAC
scores, which are an accurate predictor of HMB [10] , between
groups. A total sample size of 60 (at least 20 per group) was required to detect at least a 57.0 difference in PBAC scores between
any of the 2 groups with a power of 95% at the 5% significance
level. The difference of 57.0 for PBAC scores was taken from the
literature [11] . Sample size estimation was performed using NCSS
and PASS 2000 software.
 Data analysis was performed using SPSS for Windows, version
11.5 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Ill., USA). Whether the continuous variables were normally distributed was determined by the Shapiro–
Wilk test. The Levene test was used to evaluate the homogeneity of
variances. Continuous data were shown as mean ± SD or median

and interquartile range; the number of cases and percentages were
used for nominal variables.
 The mean differences between groups were compared by oneway analysis of variance (ANOVA), while the median values were
compared by the Kruskal–Wallis test. For the pairs of groups that
had statistically significant Kruskal–Wallis test statistics, multiple
comparisons were done by Conover’s non-parametric multiple
comparison tests. Nominal data were analyzed by Pearson’s chisquare test. Repeated measures of ANOVA was used to analyze the
QOL measurements, while the pre- and post-treatment values of
QOL measurements were compared by paired sample t tests.
PBAC scores were evaluated by the Friedman test. For the statistically significant Friedman test statistics, paired comparisons were
done by Bonferroni adjusted Wilcoxon signed rank test. A p value
of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. The Bonferroni
correction was applied for all possible multiple comparisons to reduce the occurrence of type I errors.
 Results
 Eighty-four patients with eligible criteria were recruited
in the study and were randomized into 3 treatment groups.
Twelve patients (3 patients in group 1 (NETA), 4 patients
in group 2 (tranexamic acid) and 5 patients in group 3
(LNG-IUS)) were lost to follow-up. Five patients in group
1 and 2 patients in group 2 used the medications inappropriately. One patient reported that the intrauterine device
had dropped in the fifth month and 2 patients asked for
removal of the LNG-IUS because of intolerable pelvic pain
and heavy bleeding in the second month. Results of 62
women (20 patients in the NETA group, 22 patients in the
tranexamic acid group, and 20 patients in LNG-IUS group)
who were completing the study were assessed.
 Demographic data and basal values of Hb, ferritin,
iron, iron binding capacity and PBAC scores are shown
in table 1 . The 3 groups were similar in age, body weight
and duration of complaint ( table  1 ). In all 3 treatment
groups, PBAC scores were reduced by the third and sixth
months (p < 0.001, p < 0.001, p < 0.001; table 2 ). The difference between the third and sixth month of treatment
was significant only in the LNG-IUS group (p < 0.001).
Changes in PBAC scores in the 6th month of treatment
differed between the groups in a statistically significant
manner (–160, –126.5, and –252 in the NETA, tranexamic acid, and LNG-IUS groups, respectively, p  = 0.002),
whereas changes in the 3rd month were not different in a
statistically significant manner (p = 0.115; fig. 1 ).

 By the 3rd month, LNG-IUS reduced MBL by 66.2%,
whereas NETA reduced MBL by 47.4% and tranexamic
acid reduced MBL by 49.3%. By the 6th month, the decrease was 85.8, 53.1 and 60.8% for LNG-IUS, NETA, and
tranexamic acid, respectively. LNG-IUS was more effective in decreasing MBL than NETA and tranexamic acid
(p < 0.001, p < 0.001) after 6 months of therapy. There was
no significant difference in efficacy between NETA and
tranexamic acid (p = 0.692). When the patients were classified according to the 6th month PBAC scores, a total of
31 patients had PBAC scores of ≤ 100. More patients with
scores less than 100 were in the LNG-IUS group (17/31,
54.8%) than in the NETA group (6/31, 19.4%) or the
tranexamic group (8/31, 25.8%).
 In the NETA group, a statistically significant increase in
Hb and Hct levels was found in the sixth month (p < 0.001,
p  < 0.001), whereas the increase in the tranexamic acid
group was not so prominent (p = 0.114, p = 0.062). LNGIUS significantly increased the Hb and Hct levels both in
the third and the sixth months of therapy compared with
basal levels (p < 0.001, p < 0.001). LNG-IUS was found to
be more successful in treating anemia when compared with
tranexamic acid (p < 0.001), but there was no significant
difference between NETA and LNG-IUS (p = 0.028) or between NETA and tranexamic acid (p = 0.561). Serum iron,
ferritin and iron-binding capacity levels were measured in
44 patients (70.9%). Patients in the NETA and LNG-IUS
groups had significant increases in serum iron and ferritin
levels and significant decreases in iron-binding capacity.
Tranexamic acid also increased serum iron and ferritin levels but did not change the iron-binding capacity. LNG-IUS
had significantly more serum iron and ferritin and a lower
iron-binding capacity than did NETA and tranexamic acid.
 Fourteen patients in the NETA group, 14 patients in
the tranexamic acid group and 17 patients in the LNGIUS group reported that they were satisfied with the treatment at the end of 6 months. Satisfaction rates were comparable between groups (70.0, 63.6, 77.2%, respectively).
The manner in which side effects were prevalent was also
similar between the groups (p = 0.617). Of the patients
using NETA, 3 reported headache, 2 reported bloating, 1
reported nausea and 1 reported weight gain. In the
tranexamic acid group, headache was reported by 5 patients, nausea by 3 patients, weight gain by 1 patient, and
rash by 1 patient. The side effects seen in the LNG-IUS
group were spotting, headache, excess hair growth, breast
tenderness, and depression (3, 3, 1, 1, and 1 patient(s),
respectively). One patient reported both hair growth and
spotting and 1 patient had headache, spotting and depression. Two patients requested removal of the device because of pelvic pain and bleeding. No patient discontinued therapy because of side effects in the NETA and
tranexamic acid groups. The satisfaction rates and the
prevalence patterns of side effects are described in table 3 .
 The mean scores of the patients for the 5 domains of
the WHOQOL-BREF TR questionnaire were evaluated
( table  4 ). When pre- and post-treatment scores of the
groups were compared, the QOL in physical aspects increased significantly in the tranexamic acid and LNG-IUS
groups (p = 0.013, p = 0.013), whereas it did not change
in patients taking NETA (p = 0.151). There were no statistically significant differences between the increases in
scores for the physical aspects of QOL in the tranexamic

with any of the treatments.
 Discussion
 Of the different types of medical treatments, it is still
unclear which should be used as the first line of treatment
in HMB. Also, there is controversy regarding the outcome measures used in studies addressing this issue because menstrual bleeding is subjective and difficult to assess objectively. Heavy bleeding does interfere with social
life, disturbing and limiting sexual life, personal relations
and daily activities. But according to Shapley et al., the
consultation rates change according to the perception of
women, interference in life and impact of HMB on women [12] . Recently, the importance of effect on health-related QOL in the studies, as a primary outcome measure
has been highlighted. Also there are many literatures
about HMB that emphasize this negative effect of HMB
on domains of QOL [2] .
 There is no strict guideline with regard to the dose,
duration and beginning day of treatment with oral progesterone preparations. Progestogens are useful in anovulatory patients, but their efficacy is questionable in
ovulatory patients [13–15] . A systematic review concluded that progestogens offer no advantage over tranexamic
acid, danazol and LNG-IUS in the luteal phase [16] . Also,
in a recent study, tranexamic acid at a dose of 3 g/day was
found to be more effective and tolerable than 10 mg of
NETA administered daily on days 19–26 of a cycle for
patients with ovulatory menorrhagia [17] . Regarding administering over a longer duration with a higher dose,
Irvine et al. [18] found an 87% decrease in MBL when
NETA was used at a daily dose of 15 mg on days 5–26 of
the cycle. They compared NETA and LNG-IUS and
found their effects similar; moreover, women using
LNG-IUS had higher satisfaction and continuation rates
[18] . We found comparable effects of NETA and
tranexamic acid; this strengthens the idea that higher
doses of NETA (15 mg/day) could be more effective in
treating ovulatory menorrhagia than lower doses (10
mg/day).

 Tranexamic acid is not prescribed by most of the physicians because of a perceived risk of thrombogenic complications, but most studies demonstrated no increase in
the incidence of these events [19, 20] . Treatment with
tranexamic acid was found to reduce MBL by 34–54%
compared to a placebo in different studies [21–23] . Our
results (60.8% decrease in blood loss) were slightly more
successful and were similar to the results of a phase 3,
open prospective trial by Gultekin et al. [24] , who reported a 65.9% success rate in 2009.
 LNG-IUS is becoming more widely used as new studies
favoring its use are published. It has been shown to decrease
MBL by 86% after 3 months and by 97% at after 6 months
and was approved by the FDA for HMB in 2009 [25] . The
progressive reduction from the 3rd to 6th month of treatment is probably due to the increasing suppressive effect of
progesterone over time. However, amenorrhea rates could
not be determined because of the limited follow-up time.
We found excellent reductions in MBL that were significantly greater than the reductions observed with NETA
and tranexamic acid in both the 3rd and 6th months. Comparative studies of LNG-IUS with other medical treatments
also favored LNG-IUS as a first-line choice [18, 26–29] .
 Regarding the correction of iron deficiency anemia,
the results for LNG-IUS are conflicting [30, 31] . In our
study, LNG-IUS, as well as NETA, was found effective in
restoring iron levels. Surprisingly, tranexamic acid did
not show the same efficacy, similar to the results of a comparative study by Milsom et al. [26] .
 The WHOQOL Group defined QOL as ‘an individual’s
perception of his/her position in life in the context of the
culture and value systems in which he/she lives and in relation to his/her goals, expectations, standards and concerns’. Studies on medical treatments for menorrhagia that
involve assessments of QOL are limited in number and
mostly compare LNG-IUS treatment with hysterectomy or
other surgical methods. We found that LNG-IUS as well as
tranexamic acid increased physical aspects of QOL, whereas NETA did not. The other domains of QOL did not
change with any of the 3 treatments. Similar to the results
of our study, Preston et al. [14] found that QOL measures,
flooding, leakage and sex life were significantly improved
in the tranexamic acid group compared with the oral progesterone group. It has also been reported that LNG-IUS
treatment resulted in QOL measures comparable to that of
hysterectomy [32] . In an open randomized study, two
thirds of women with menorrhagia who were on the list for
surgery and who were given LNG-IUS treatment cancelled
their decision to undergo hysterectomy after 6 months due
to high satisfaction with the LNG-IUS treatment [28] .
 The task of comparing the different types of therapies
is difficult because of the subjective and variable nature of
the presenting symptoms in dysfunctional uterine bleeding [33] . The importance of each outcome measure was
graded on a scale designed by the GRADE (Grading of
Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) working group [34] . According to that scale, our
study has 1 ‘critical’ and 2 ‘important’ outcomes for clinical decision making, including PBAC scores, QOL questionnaire, and patient satisfaction. However, intention to
treat analysis could not be performed due to the patients
lost to follow-up with only basal data at the beginning and
a possible foresight cannot be interpreted. The strength
of our study would increase if pain related to bleeding and
sexual health in addition to cost-analysis was also evaluated. Other limitations of our study include the limited
number of patients and the high rate of patients lost to
follow-up.
 In conclusion, the effectiveness of tranexamic acid and
NETA cannot be disregarded, but because of the positive
effect of LNG-IUS on QOL parameters as well as its high
efficiency, LNG-IUS may be considered a first-line option
for HMB in patients not intending to conceive a child in
the near future. Further studies evaluating the long-term
effects with longer follow-up observations are needed to
investigate the different medical treatment choices.
