Summary
Currently, tranexamic acid (TXA) is used as 4 g/day in menorrhagia This prospective randomised study included 100 cases
to assess efficacy and safety of 2 g/day TXA in dysfunctional uterine bleeding (DUB) vs cyclical 10 mg twice-daily
medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) for 3 cycles. Follow-ups were made monthly for 3 months during therapy, then 3
months after. Mean pictorial blood loss assessment chart (PBAC) score decreased from 356.9 to 141.6 in the TXA group and
from the pre-treatment 370.9 to 156.6 with MPA and mean reduction of blood loss was 60.3% with TXA and 57.7% with
MPA after 3 months (p 5 0.005 in both groups). Lack of response during treatment was seen in three patients (6.1%) TXA
and in 13 patients (28.9%) with MPA (p ¼ 0.003). In patients who reported 3 months after stopping the treatment, 66.7% in
TXA group and 50% in MPA had recurrence of menorrhagia, (p ¼ 0.155). During the 6 months study period more
hysterectomies were performed in the MPA than in the TXA group (17.8% vs 4%; p ¼ 0.002). We conclude that TXA in 2 g/
day dosage is an effective and safe option in DUB.
Introduction
Approximately 35% of women with dysfunctional uterine
bleeding will subsequently undergo a hysterectomy, which is
the definitive cure for menorrhagia (Liu 1995) but
associated operative and long-term morbidity and rarely
mortality for essentially a benign condition cannot be
considered insignificant, especially in younger women
where hysterectomy is inappropriate, in women who wish
to preserve their reproductive function and in women
nearing menopause, as menorrhagia will rectify itself with
the onset of the menopause. Thus, drug therapy should be
the first line treatment before recourse to surgery (Dicker
et al. 1982; Macdonald 1990). Properly deployed medical
therapy has the potential to eliminate a large number of these
operative procedures (Munro 2000).
Progesterones are the most widely prescribed drugs in
the treatment of DUB. Data support their use in
anovulatory women given as luteal phase replacement
(Fraser 1990) but an overall reduction in blood loss of
only 20% is achieved in ovulatory women (Cameron et al.
1990).
Increased dissolution of clots (fibrinolysis) is one of
the causes of DUB (Bonnar et al. 1983; Lethaby et al.
2001). Tranexamic acid (TXA), an antifibrinolytic,
reversibly blocks lysine binding sites on plasminogen
and thus fibrin degradation and can be promoted as
treatment for DUB (Nilsson and Rybo 1967). There are
few side-effects reported with TXA. Since side-effects
are dose related, and expecting fewer side-effects with
2 g/day, we conducted a trial to find the efficacy and
safety of TXA in 2 g/day dosage in women with DUB
and compared it with medroxyprogesterone acetate
(MPA).
Material and methods
After ethical approval, a prospective randomised study was
conducted in the department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi
from November 2002 to November 2004. In patients
presenting with heavy menstrual bleeding, a detailed
menstrual, obstetric and medical history was taken. The
patients’ pictorial blood loss assessment score was taken to
diagnose menorrhagia (score 4100). General and gynaecological examinations were done. Ultrasound evaluation
was done to rule out any pelvic pathology and to measure
endometrial thickness. Hysteroscopy was performed in
selected cases. Endometrial aspirations were performed in
all cases except those who were unmarried. Patients with
fibroids, adenomyosis, endometriosis, atypia on endometrial histopathology, thyroid disease, history of hormone
therapy in previous 3 months and unwilling for medical
management were excluded.
After diagnosing menorrhagia as DUB, a total of 100
women were eventually enrolled in the study after taking
informed consent. Clinical profile and symptomatology,
cycle length and duration of bleeding were noted. Pretreatment menstrual blood loss was assessed on the basis of
scoring by the pictorial blood loss assessment chart (PBAC;
Higham et al. 1990). Haemoglobin was estimated at the
start of study period.
On the basis of a computerised randomisation table,
subjects were divided into two groups. One group was given
TXA at 500 mg four times daily (2 g/day) from day 1 of the
cycle, for 5 days, and the other group was given MPA at
10 mg twice daily from day 5 to day 25 of the cycle.
Treatment was stopped after 3 months. No additional
medication was allowed and iron supplementation was

given only when the haemoglobin level was 58 g%.
Patients were followed monthly during the treatment period
when duration of bleeding, cycle length, PBAC scoring and
any adverse effects were noted to assess the patients’
response to treatment.
Women’s satisfaction with their treatment was also noted
based on subjective symptomatic relief as assessed by visual
analogue scale. Haemoglobin was repeated after 3 months
treatment. The last follow-up was done 3 months after
stopping the therapy, to assess the rate of recurrence of
symptoms, if any.
Analysis of patients on above parameters was done for
each group of patients separately. Data were analysed
using the Student t-test, Student paired t-test and two
way ANOVA test, with posthoc analysis, and significance
was defined as p 50.05. To assess the efficacy of
two drugs in comparison with each other, the area under
the curve was calculated and analysed by an independent
t-test.
Results
A total of 164 cases of menorrhagia, defined as menstrual
blood loss with 4100 score obtained from the pictorial
chart, were screened. Of these, 64 women were excluded:
28 cases were due to presence of fibroids, six with
suspected adenomyosis, six cases of endometriosis, atypia
on endometrial histopathology was found in two, nine
cases had thyroid disease, seven patients were on hormone
therapy in the previous 3 months and six patients were
unwilling to accept medical management.
Out of the 100 women recruited, six women (one
from the TXA group and five from the MPA group) did
not follow the schedule and hence were excluded from
the analysis. Thus there were 49 patients in the
tranexamic acid group and 45 in the medroxyprogesterone group.
Patient profile
In the TXA group, the mean age was 36.43 +8.25 years
(range 15 – 50 years) and mean parity was 3.06 + 1.38
(range 0 – 8). Mean age and parity in the MPA group was
36.67 + 7.54 years (range 19 – 49 years) and 2.84 + 1.26
(range 0 – 6), respectively. The mean duration of menorrhagia was 26 and 24 months, mean duration of bleeding
was 7.08 and 8.36 days and mean cycle length was 26.9
and 26.6 days in the TXA and MPA groups, respectively.
Mean pre-treatment haemoglobin was 10.71 and 10.83 g%
and mean endometrial thickness was 7.40 and 7.46 mm,
respectively in the TXA and MPA groups. The profile of
patients was comparable in the two groups.
Histopathology
In the 94 patients, endometrial aspiration revealed secretory endometrium in 61.7% (TXA: 69.4%; MPA: 53.3%),
proliferative in 29.8% (TXA: 26.6%; MPA: 33.4%),
endometrial hyperplasia without atypia in 5.3% (TXA:
2%; MPA: 8.9%), interval endometrium in 2.1% (TXA:
2%; MPA: 2.2%) and pill endometrium in 1.1% (TXA: nil;
MPA: 2.2%) patients. Differences were insignificant in the
two groups. Two unmarried patients (2.1%), one each in
the TXA and MPA groups, did not undergo endometrial
aspiration.
Compliance
A total of 93 patients (48 in the TXA group and 45 in the
MPA group) completed one course of therapy; 89 cases (48
in the TXA group and 41 in the MPA group) completed
two courses, whereas 80 cases (47 in the TXA group and 33
in the MPA group) completed three courses of treatment.
Adverse effects
Side-effects were noted in eight (16.3%) cases with TXA
and in 15 (33.3%) cases with MPA. Apparently adverse
effects were more with MPA but this was insignificant
statistically (p ¼ 0.09). With TXA, one (2%) patient had an
allergic reaction and had to discontinue treatment during
the first cycle; three (6.1%) had headaches; three (6.1%)
had gastrointestinal upsets and one (2%) patient complained of giddiness. With MPA, five (11.1%) patients had
intermenstrual bleeding; three (6.7%) had giddiness; two
(4.4%) patients had headaches; two (4.4%) complained of
breast tenderness; two (4.4%) had gastrointestinal upsets
and one patient (2.2%) had mood changes.
Lack of response
Out of the 49 patients on TXA, only three patients (6.1%)
showed a lack of response during treatment, whereas 13
(28.9%) out of 45 cases on MPA did not respond to the
treatment (p ¼ 0.003).
Discontinuation
Two patients (4.1%) in the TXA group discontinued the
treatment without completing 3 months of treatment: one
due to allergic reactions and another discontinued after 2
months due to no relief in the menstrual blood loss. In the
MPA group, treatment was discontinued by 12 patients
(26.7%): four patients discontinued after the first cycle and
eight patients after the second cycle. Of these, 10 patients
(22.2%) discontinued due to treatment failure: six had
continuous bleeding and four had heavy bleeding. Two
patients discontinued because of adverse effects (intermenstrual bleeding, diarrhoea). The discontinuation rate
was significantly more in the MPA group (p ¼ 0.002).
Response on duration of bleeding and menstrual
blood loss
The duration of bleeding and amount of bleeding (PBAC
score) were analysed in each group. The effect of therapy
on duration of bleeding in both the groups on each followup is depicted in Figure 1. In our study, the mean blood
loss with TXA (PBAC score) was 149.17, 138.92, 141.64
at 1st, 2nd and 3rd months of treatment, which was
significantly less than the initial score of 356.94
(p 50.005). The PBAC score with MPA reduced from
the initial 370.24 to 167.93, 179.51 and 156.67 at the three
follow-ups during treatment, which again was significant
(p 50.005). The mean reduction in PBAC with TXA was
58.2%, 61.0% and 60.3% at 1st, 2nd and 3rd months of
treatment, respectively. Reduction with MPA was 54.6%,
51.5% and 57.7% at the three follow-ups during treatment.
PBAC scoring for assessment of menstrual blood loss
before treatment and on different follow-up visits during
treatment has been depicted in Figure 2. The percentage

reduction in PBAC score in the follow-ups is shown
in Table I. A total of 19 (38.8%) patients of TXA and 15
(33.3%) patients of MPA had a PBAC score of 5100 at
the third follow-up. At the fourth follow-up, 3 months
after stopping treatment, mean blood loss with both the
drugs, though increased from that during the treatment,
was still less than the initial level (p 50.005) as shown
in Figure 2.
Haemoglobin level
The mean haemoglobin level at the end of 3 months
treatment was 11.2 and 11.4 g% compared with the pretreatment level of 10.7 and 10.9 g%, respectively in the two
groups. Haemoglobin rise at the end of 3 months treatment
was significant in both the groups (TXA group: p ¼ 0.003
and in the MPA group: p ¼ 0.019).
Follow-up and recurrence
Totals of 42 and 30 cases came for last follow-up after
stopping of therapy in the TXA and MPA groups,
respectively. Among these, 28 patients (66.7%) of TXA
and 15 patients (50%) of MPA had recurrence of
menorrhagia of the same severity as before treatment,
though this difference was not found significant statistically
(p ¼ 0.155).
In 14 (33.3%) patients of TXA and 15 patients (50%) of
MPA, improvement persisted as compared with the initial
severity including four (9.5%) and six (20%) patients in
TXA and MPA, respectively who had normal periods with
a PBAC score of 5100.
Surgical intervention
During the total study period of 6 months, two patients
(4%) out of the 49 recruited into the TXA group
underwent hysterectomy: one during 3 months of the
treatment period and another one after stopping treatment
before the fourth follow-up. In the MPA group, eight out of
the 45 patients recruited (17.8%) underwent hysterectomy:
seven patients during the treatment period and one before
the fourth follow-up (p ¼ 0.002).
A total of 30 patients in the TXA group and 25 patients
in the MPA group reported 1 year after stopping the
treatment in our study. During this period, eight more
patients of TXA and one patient of MPA underwent
hysterectomy. Thus overall, 20% of the initially recruited
patients in each of the two groups had surgery. Three
patients (6.1%) of TXA passed into the menopause.
Acceptance
In our study, in the TXA group, 78.7% of women reported
that they liked the treatment ‘well’ or ‘very well’ and 63.8%
(n ¼ 47) elected to continue with the treatment at the end
of the 3 month study. In the MPA group, 69.7% of women
liked the treatment and 48.5% of women (n ¼ 33) wished
to continue the treatment.
Discussion
The efficacy of tranexamic acid (TXA) in the treatment of
idiopathic menorrhagia has been evaluated in several small
(n ¼ 15 – 76) studies of variable designs. The recommended dose of tranexamic acid differs from region to
region. In Europe, recommended oral dose in menorrhagia
is 1 – 1.5 g 3 – 4 times a day (i.e. 4 – 4.5 g/day). Most of the
studies are undertaken with this dose, which reports
effective reduction of MBL by 34 – 54% over 2 – 3 cycles
in women, compared with either placebo or baseline
(Bonnar and Sheppard 1996; Callender et al. 1970;
Coulter et al. 1995; Milsom et al. 1991).
It is reported that adverse effects of tranexamic acid are
dose dependent (Irvine and Cameron 1999). To our
knowledge, there is only one small non-comparative trial
in 15 cases, with 2 g/day TXA, where 59% reduction in
MBL was found that was comparable with the reduction
achieved by 4 – 4.5 g/day dosages in other studies (Gleeson
et al. 1994). We conducted a comparative randomised trial
in a large number of patients with 2 g/day dosage of TXA
with progesterone therapy, which is the most widely
prescribed drug for menorrhagia in the UK, forming 38 –
55% of prescriptions (Coulter et al. 1995; Intercontinental
Medical Statistics Ltd. 1994).
Most of the studies have been done with luteal phase
progesterone where it is seen that they are less effective than
TXA (Coulter et al. 1995; Lethaby et al. 2000; Preston et al.
1995) and in one study MBL rather increased by 20% with
progesterone (Preston et al. 1995). However, in studies with
cyclical progesterones given for 21 days, marked reduction
in MBL by 32 – 87% has been found (Fraser 1990; Irvine
et al. 1998). But none of the studies compared TXA with
cyclical progesterones, which was done in this study.
If it is established that TXA is effective even at half the
conventional dosage and that progesterones are no better,
then TXA is definitely a better choice because side-effects
are going to be less.
Mean blood loss with TXA reduced significantly starting
from the first month (p5 0.005) and was found comparable with other studies (Bonnar and Sheppard 1996;
Callender et al. 1970; Coulter et al. 1995; Milsom et al.
1991). Menstrual blood loss with MPA also reduced
(p 50.005) and was also found comparable with other
studies with cyclical progestogens (Fraser 1990; Irvine
et al. 1998). The effect of both TXA and MPA in reducing
menstrual blood loss in our study was found comparable
with each other with no significant difference as determined by calculating the area under the curve (p ¼ 0.78). In
both the groups, we noticed significant reduction in the
very first cycle itself compared with the pre-treatment
menstrual blood loss. The effect plateaued at the same level
and no further significant reduction was noticed in

subsequent cycles. Reduction in menstrual blood loss is
comparable with others drugs used in menorrhagia.
There is documentation of achieving mean menstrual
blood loss of less than 80 ml/cycle in 56 – 100% patients
with tranexamic acid (Bonnar and Sheppard 1996; Gleeson
et al. 1994; Preston et al. 1995) and in 9.5% patients with
luteal phase progesterone (Preston et al. 1995). In our
study, 19 patients (38.8%) of TXA and 15 patients
(33.3%) of MPA achieved a PBAC score of less than 100
at the third follow-up. In past studies, no effect was found
on the duration of menses with TXA, but in our study, we
found a decrease in the average duration of menstrual
bleeding in both the groups. This reduction in relation to
baseline was significant (p 50.005), but there was no
significant difference among the three treatment cycles.
Lack of response was found more (4.5 fold) with MPA
than with TXA (28.9% vs 6.1%) and more patients of
MPA discontinued the treatment compared with TXA
(26.7% vs 4.1%) in our study and this was found
statistically significant.
Side-effects are reported by approximately one-third of
patients with 4 g/day of TXA. These are mainly gastrointestinal-nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and are dose dependent. Limiting the number of days on which the drug is
taken and reducing the dosage can reduce adverse effects
(Wellington and Wagstaff 2003). Adverse effects of
progesterone include bloating, fluid retention, weight gain,
headache, insomnia, nausea, dizziness, drowsiness, acne
and rash. We found adverse effects in 16.3% of patients with
2 g/day TXA and 33.3% with 21 days cyclical MPA
therapy, though this difference is insignificant statistically.
The prolonged use of high dose progestogens is sometimes
associated with irregular bleeding (Lethaby et al. 2000). In
our study, we found that three (6.7%) patients had adequate
reduction in MBL in the first two cycles with MPA but in
the third cycle, they had heavy bleeding with continuous
spotting. Except for the allergy with tranexamic acid, which
occurred in one patient, none of the side-effects of TXA
were severe enough to warrant additional treatment or
discontinuation of therapy. Allergic reactions with TXA are
also reported in other studies (Gleeson et al. 1994; Nilsson
and Rybo 1967). Except for two patients in the MPA group
who discontinued the treatment for diarrhoea and intermenstrual bleeding, the rest had only transient ailments and
continued with the treatment. Although there is concern of
thrombotic episodes with antifibrinolytics (Rydin and
Lundberg 1976), long-term studies in Scandinavia on
238,000 women have shown that the incidence of thrombosis in women treated with TXA is similar to that in the
general population of women (Rybo 1991).
In our study, we found a hangover effect, i.e. some
beneficial effect persisted after stopping the treatment.
Many times, DUB is a transient and self-curable condition
and treatment is needed to tide over that period of time. It
is estimated that 5 – 20% of women are affected by
menorrhagia at some point during their premenopausal
years (Kadir et al. 1998). Moreover it was found in one
study that menstrual blood plasmin activity and endometrial t-PA levels were significantly lower after three
treatment cycles than before treatment (Gleeson et al.
1994). The reduction in plasminogen binding to fibrin
appears to result in either a decrease in the production of
t-PA by endothelial cells or an increase in the rate of
clearance from the endometrium. Thus, it is also possible
that some local effect of drug remains in the endometrium
after stopping treatment. The hangover effect in the MPA
group might have been due to endometrial suppression.
A large number of patients in both groups (half in the
MPA and two-thirds in the TXA group) had recurrence of
symptoms after stopping treatment. Thus, improvement in
symptoms persisted in only one-third of the patients of
TXA and half of the patients of MPA after stopping the
drug. However, this difference was insignificant statistically
(p ¼ 0.155) when the two drugs were compared. More
patients wished to continue treatment with TXA as
compared with MPA patients. This may be due to more
side-effects and a poor response with MPA. In our study,
hysterectomy could be avoided up to 1 year in as many as
80% of the patients with medical management in both the
groups. Other studies report that 35% of women with DUB
will subsequently undergo a hysterectomy, which is the
definitive cure of menorrhagia (Fraser and McCarron
1991). As far as surgical intervention during treatment is
concerned, while only one patient (2%) of TXA had
hysterectomy, in the MPA group, seven patients (15.5%)
underwent hysterectomy without completing the treatment
period. These results show that response of therapy is very
satisfactory with TXA but the carry-over effect is better
with MPA because 1 year after stopping the treatment, the
incidence of hysterectomy was the same in the two groups.
To conclude, tranexamic acid in a 2 g/day dosage as well
as 21 days cyclical progesterone therapy are efficacious in
the management of dysfunctional uterine bleeding. The
reduction in menstrual blood loss by both the drugs is
comparable. But long cyclical treatment has problems of
compliance. Tranexamic acid on the other hand is nonhormonal, causes no major or persistent side-effects, is well
tolerated and needs to be taken only during periods,
thereby avoiding long courses throughout the cycle.
Thus, 2 g/day tranexamic acid may be considered as a
first line treatment for the initial management of idiopathic
menorrhagia, especially for patients who prefer nonhormonal treatment, want to conceive and in whom
hormonal treatment is either not recommended or not
wanted. It is also a good option for adolescents and the
perimenopausal age group.
