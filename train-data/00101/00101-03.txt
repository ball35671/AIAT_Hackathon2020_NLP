ABSTRACT
Objective To compare the effect of Kabi 2161 (a prodrug of tranexamic acid) and placebo on the
reduction of menstrual blood loss in women suffering from idiopathic menorrhagia and to
evaluate tolerance and effectiveness in a two-dose regimen.
Design A randomised, double blind parallel group study using double dummy technique.
Setting The departments of gynaecology at three medical centres in Sweden.
Subjects Ninety-one outpatients visiting the gynaecological clinics from March 1991 to May 1992
were randomised into the study; 68 women fulfilled the study.
Interventions Two run-in cycles, followed by administrations of Kabi 2161 (600 mg) tablets (1 four
times daily or 2 twice daily) or placebo for the first five days of three menstrual cycles.
Main outcome measures Objective measurement of the change in menstrual blood loss during the
treatment periods compared with menstrual blood loss during the run-in periods.
Results A statistically significant reduction of menstrual blood loss was found for each treatment
group, compared with the placebo group (P < 0001). The mean reduction with 95%
confidence interval (CI) was 33 Yo (24-40) in the group treated with 1 four times daily and 41 YO
(33-49) in the group treated 2 twice daily. The difference between the treated groups in
reduction of menstrual blood loss is not significant. No significant differences were found in the
frequencies of reported unwanted events during run-in and during treatment between the
different treatment groups. There were also no significant differences between the treatment
groups and the placebo group.
Conclusion Kabi 2161 in a dosage of 2.4 g per day gave a statistically significant reduction in
objectively measured menstrual blood loss in a two (41 %) as well as in a four (33 %) dosage
regimen compared with placebo. Frequency of unwanted events did not differ from those
during run-in or from those in the placebo group. The optimal daily dosage needs to be further
evaluated in a dose titration study.
Approximately 10 % of women of reproductive age suffer
from excessive menstrual blood loss (MBL) (van Eijkeren
et al. 1992). In a Swedish population of healthy women of
reproductive age, the average blood loss was 43 ml per
period. Most women were not able to replace the iron
deficit if MBL exceeded 80 ml per period, therefore blood
loss above this limit has been defined as menorrhagia
(Hallberg et al. 1966; Cole el al. 1971). Menorrhagia is a

disabling condition in many women with social, economic
and physical consequences; excessive MBL is the most
common cause of iron deficiency in fertile women (Rybo
1966,1973). Menorrhagia is a common reason for invasive
surgical procedures, such as hysterectomy and endometrial
resection, although medical treatment remains the first line
therapy. In the Scandinavian countries tranexamic acid, a
synthetic fibrinolytic inhibitor, is widely used (Okamoto &
Okamoto 1962). Its use in menorrhagia is based on the
locally increased fibrinolysis due to an increased concentration of plasminogen activator in the endometrium
913 
914 M. EDLUND ET AL.
(Rybo 1966). Antifibrinolytic compounds block the lysinebinding sites of the plasminogen and plasmin molecules,
thereby preventing the binding of plasminogen and
Qlasmin to the fibrin substrate (Hoylaerts et al. 1981;
Astedt 1987). Treatment with tranexamic acid (3 to 6g
daily) during bleeding days has been shown to reduce
MBL effectively (Haynes et al. 1979; Ylikorkola &
Viinikka 1983; Andersch et al. 1988; Milsom et al. 1991).
The oral bioavailability of tranexamic acid is only about
35% (Pihlbrant et al. 1981). This makes frequent
administration-four doses per day or more-necessary,
and this is a major disadvantage.
Frequent administrations of high doses can also be
associated with gastrointestinal side effects and low compliance. Kabi 2161 is an ester prodrug of tranexamic acid,
developed to reduce these disadvantages by increasing the
gastrointestinal absorption of the drug. The principle is to
obtain a complete absorption of the prodrug combined
with a fast generation of the parent drug in the plasma.
The ester is rapidly converted to the active drug, with a
half life in whole blood of 1-5 min. The bioavailability
after oral administration of the prodrug has been reported
to be approximately 90% (Svahn et al. 1988).
The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of
Kabi 2161 in the treatment of excessive MBL in women
suffering from menorrhagia and to compare the efficacy of
two dosage regimens.
Subjects and methods
A multi-centre study was performed at the department of
obstetrics and gynaecology at three university hospitals in
Sweden. The study design was approved by the local ethics
committee of each centre.
Subjects
Women 18 years of age or older with regular menstrual
cycles, menorrhagia (defined as MBL > 80 ml per cycle)
and a normal-sized uterus were admitted to the study after
receiving information and giving informed consent. Exclusion criteria were the following:
1. Creatinine > 120 pmol/l or pathological liver values.
2. Clinically evident pelvic pathology or CIN in cervical
smear.
3. Concomitant disease which may affect menstruation or
compliance.
4. Concomitant medication which may affect menstruation, e.g. hormonal preparations, anticoagulants or
NSAIDs.
5. Previous history of thromboembolic disease, haemorrhagic or fibrinolytic disorder.
6. Diagnostic curettage less than two months previously.
7. Suspected inability to comply with the study according
to the protocol.
A total of 126 women over 18 years of age with a history
of heavy menstrual bleeding accepted the invitation to
participate in the study. After two run-in periods, 35 of the
screened patients said they were not able to comply with
the protocol or did not fulfill inclusion/exclusion criteria.
In 12 of these 35 women MBL was below 80 ml. Thus 91
patients were randomised. Four were withdrawn because
of incomplete collection of sanitary wear during the run-in
time, uterine carcinoma, abdominal pain or pelvic
inflammatory disease. Nineteen women were excluded
from the statistical analysis presented in this paper because
they did not complete blood loss measurement or did not
take the prescribed doses. The remaining 68 women were
comparable with respect to the demographic variables of
age, height and weight.
Design of the study
The study was designed as a randomised, double blind,
parallel group study using the double dummy technique.
An immediate release tablet, containing 600 mg of
tranexamic acid prodrug, Kabi 2161, (1-(etoxycarbony1oxy)ethyl trans-4-aminomethyl-cyclohexanecarboxylate hydrochloride) was used as the study drug.
Treatment was preceded by a run-in phase. During two
menstrual periods, the women used a diary card to record
MBL and for self-assessment. Women with a MBL of
greater than 80ml were randomised to either of three
groups and were treated during three menstrual cycles. A
2:2: 1 randomisation was used to achieve greater information on the active treatments. Data suggest
(Ylikorkola & Viinikka 1983) that 15 assessable patients in
the placebo group would be sufficient to have at least 80 YO
power for a two-sided t test at the 5% level.
Each tablet contained 600 mg of active substance. Group
A (n = 26) was given treatment with 1200 mg active
substance twice a day during the first five days of the
menstrual cycle. Group B (n = 28) was given one 600 mg
active tablet four times a day during the first five days of
the menstrual cycle. Group C (n = 14) was given placebo:
two tablets four times a day during the first five days of the
menstrual bleeding. Using the double dummy technique,
all patients were supplied with some placebo tablets so
that each patient received two tablets four times a day
during the first five days of the menstrual period during
three cycles.
Compliance was considered satisfactory if the patient
had taken at least 75% of the prescribed dose. A
compliance rate of 75% was chosen because in many
countries where tranexamic acid is used for menorrhagia,
75 Yo (3 g) of the normally recommended daily dose 4 g is
the recommended minimal dose. In the present study,
eight patients were excluded because of poor compliance.
The reduction of objectively measured blood loss was
the main efficacy variable and was calculated both as
absolute (ml) and relative (percentage) change compared
with baseline. For each patient the mean blood loss during
control periods of the run-in phase was compared with the
mean blood loss during treatment periods. During treatment all women completed a diary card with data on
bleeding days, number of towels and tampons used and
estimated blood loss rated as “less”, “the same” or
“more than usual”. Symptoms and signs of unwanted
events during the menstrual periods were recorded. 
REDUCTION OF MENSTRUAL BLOOD LOSS 915
Laboratory methods
The women were instructed to collect all sanitary towels
and tampons during the study period. Blood loss was
measured as described by Hallberg & Nilsson (1964) and
modified by Newton et al. (1977): menstrual blood is
extracted from sanitary material with 5% sodium hydroxide, and haemoglobin is thus transformed to alkaline
haematin, which is measured spectrophotometrically at
540 nm. Blood loss can therefore be calculated from
individual blood haemoglobin concentration. Blood
samples were collected and analysed according to routine
hospital methods at run-in; laboratory tests included
blood haemoglobin, haematocrit, platelet count,
differential count, total bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase
(ALAT), aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT), alkaline
phosphatase (ALP), serum creatinine and serum ferritin.
Statistical analyses
All data processing and statistical analysis were carried
out using SAS@ (Version 6.06, SAS Institute Inc, 1988),
run on a VAX 6320 computer system and StatXacP
(Version 2.04 CYTEL Software Corp 1991). For each
efficacy variable the arithmetic mean of the two pretreatment periods, as well as of the three treatment
periods, were calculated. A linear ANOVA model was
then fitted to the difference in mean values. A rank
transformation was carried out when appropriate. If the
overall F-test was significant, tests for differences between
treatment groups were carried out.
Results
Menstrual blood loss
A statistically significant reduction in MBL was found for
each of the two treatment groups compared with the
placebo group. In group A (1200 mg twice daily) the mean
reduction during the three months of treatment was
104 ml (41 %), ranging from an increase of 16 ml to a
decrease of 280 ml (P < 0.001). In group B (600 mg four
times a day) the mean reduction was 73 ml(33 %), ranging
from an increase of 31 ml to a decrease of 220 ml
(P -= 0.001). The difference between the two groups was
not significant. In the placebo group mean MBL remained
unchanged at around 250 ml during the study ranging
from an increase of 88 to a decrease of 67 ml (Table 1). For
the two groups given active treatment the change in MBL
remained stable during the treatment. The significance and
the level of blood loss reduction is the same if no patients
are excluded after randomisation (intention to treat
analysis).

Consumption of sanitary wear
Before treatment the mean usage of tampons and towels
was 31 per menstrual period. Both groups treated with
Kabi 2161 showed a statistically significant decrease is use
of sanitary wear (P < 0.001) when compared to the placebo
group (Table 2).
Duration of menstruation
For each woman, the mean duration of bleeding during
the control periods was compared with the mean duration
of bleeding during the treatment periods. There was no
statistically significant decrease in duration of menstruation in the treated groups (Table 3).
Women's estimation of blood loss
In group A (1200 mg twice daily) there was a significant
reduction in estimated blood loss compared with placebo
(P < 0.05) (Table 4). Although 20% of the women in the
placebo group considered their bleeding to be less than
usual there were more women in the treated groups who
experienced reduction in bleeding.
Safety variables
Blood pressure and clinical chemistry variables were
checked at inclusion and after completion of the trial. No
clinically relevant changes of mean values before and after
treatment were found.
Adverse events

period. Of these eight women reported symptoms possibly
related to the study drug, such as nausea and diarrhoea
while most symptoms seemed unrelated to the treatment
such as vaginal dryness and dysmenorrhoea. Of the 23
women who did not complete the study one woman
expressly named a probable side effect of the study drug
(abdominal pain). When the relative frequencies of
reported symptoms during run-in periods, as well as
clinical adverse events during treatment periods were
compared, no significant differences were found between
the groups.
Discussion
Excessive menstrual bleeding is the most common cause of
iron deficiency in fertile women. However, of women
reporting excessive menstrual bleeding, only 50 % will
have objectively verifiable menorrhagia (Chimbira et al.
1980; Fraser et al. 1981; Fraser et al. 1984; Granleese
1990). The perception of the blood loss and its variations
is affected by concomitant symptoms, such as pain and
depression, and by social disturbances such as interference
with work and sexual activities. Thus the efficacy of
different treatments can be evaluated only by a reliable
method of objective measurement of the menstrual blood
loss. All 68 women in the present study had fulfilled the
objective criteria of menorrhagia during two measurements. Before treatment the mean blood loss was
250 ml, with individual extreme values exceeding 700 ml
per menstruation-certainly a monthly blood loss of this
magnitude should be regarded as a social handicap.
Hysterectomy is an effective alternative to medical
treatment, varying from 190 per 100,000 women per year
in Sweden to 530 per 100,000 women per year in the United
States. This variation reflects differences in the opinion
about conservative treatment and traditions in therapy.
Since operative morbidity, mortality and long term
morbidity are not insignificant (Dicker et af. 1982),
medical treatment should remain the first line therapy.
Despite this, it is reported that more than 18,000 hysterectomies are performed in England each year because of
menorrhagia (Rees 1989).
Antifibrinolytics are a major therapeutic tool in the
treatment of menorrhagia, and in the Scandinavian
countries are often tried as a first line treatment. Synthetic
fibrinolytic inhibitors have been reported to reduce the
MBL by about 50% (Nilsson & Rybo 1967; Callender et
al. 1970; Ylikorkola & Viinikka 1983; Milsom et al. 1991).
One advantage in comparison to other medical treatments,
mainly hormones, is that medication is only necessary
during menstrual bleeding and side effects are also
relatively mild. However, an important disadvantage with
tranexamic acid has been the low bioavailability necessitating frequent intakes of high doses. This causes
relatively harmless but nevertheless annoying side effects
such as nausea that have hampered its widespread use. The
present study shows that these disadvantages may be
overcome by the new prodrug of tranexamic acid.
The results show a significant reduction of MBL in the
group treated with Kabi 2161 1200 mg twice a day (41 %)

as well as in the group treated with Kabi 2161 600 mg four
times a day (33 YO). No significant differences between
dosage regimens were found, but there was a tendency
towards a larger reduction in mean blood loss for
1200 mg x 2 (estimated to be around 10 percent units). The
sample size, however, was not large enough to reveal a
statistically significant difference of this small magnitude.
The treatment with antifibrinolytic agents should not be
expected to reduce the number of bleeding days, a point
which is illustrated here.
It is of note that both subjective estimation and the
reduced consumption of sanitary wear supports the
objective measurements. In clinical practice it is, of
course, the woman’s subjective experience of the menstruation that guides the treatment, as it is her subjective
estimation of the bleeding that brings her to our clinic and
her subjective relief that is our primary goal and the best
guarantee for compliance with the treatment.
The total daily dosage of tranexamic acid in the
treatment of menorrhagia is three to six grams divided
four to six times per day (Nilsson & Rybo 1967; Callender
et af. 1970). The total daily dosage used in this study was
2.4 grams, divided into four doses for one treatment group
and two for the other. It is likely to favour compliance if
the patient can take tablets only twice a day, and Kabi
2161 seems suited for this. The optimal daily dosage needs
to be further evaluated in a dose titration study.
The number of reported adverse events did not differ
between the treatment and the placebo groups. Reported
adverse events included gastrointestinal symptoms, headache, and dry mouth-symptoms commonly associated
with tranexamic acid.
The new synthesised compound-a derivative of
tranexamic acid-appeared to be well tolerated and was
found to reduce objectively measured blood loss by 33 YO
to 41 %. It also reduced the number of sanitary wear used,
and the subjectively estimated MBL compared with
placebo. Comparison between the two dosage regimens
did not show any difference regarding measured efficacy.
Thus Kabi 2161 should be well suited for a twice daily
regimen.
