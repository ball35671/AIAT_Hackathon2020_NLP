ABSTRACT
Objective To compare the efficacy and safety of tranexamic acid and norethisterone in the
Design A randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled study.
Setting University Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Addenbrooke’s Hospital, Cambridge.
Subjects One hundred and three women complaining of heavy periods with a regular cycle
recruited directly from general practitioners within the hospital catchment area and from
consultants’ gynaecology clinics.
Interventions There were forty-six women on placebo with confirmed ovulatory menorrhagia,
defined as menstrual blood loss greater than 80 ml/cycle and mid-luteal serum progesterone
concentration greater than 9 nmol/l). Twenty-one received norethisterone (5 mg twice a day
on days 19 to 26) and 25 received tranexamic acid (1 g four times daily on days 1 to 4) for two
cycles.
Main outcome measures Menstrual blood loss was measured using the alkaline haematin method.
Haematological assessments were made both at the beginning and at the end of the study,
questionnaires were given to assess subjective endpoints, and patients were asked to report any
adverse events during all cycles.
Results Tranexamic acid reduced mean menstrual blood loss by 45 %, from 175 ml to 97 ml
(95% CI for the difference in menstrual blood loss 52 to 108, P < 0-OOOl), norethisterone
increased mean blood loss by 20 % from 173 ml to 208 ml (95 % CI for the difference in
menstrual blood loss -64 to 2, P = 0-26). Fourteen (56%) women who received tranexamic
acid achieved a mean menstrual loss of less than 80 ml per cycle during treatment, but only two
(9.5 YO) who received norethisterone achieved this mean menstrual loss. There were no serious
adverse events reported for either drug.
Conclusions Tranexamic acid is a safe and effective form of medical therapy in women with
menorrhaga and is highly likely to normalise blood loss in women losing 80 to 200 ml prior
to treatment. Norethisterone at this dose is not effective therapy for ovulatory menorrhagia.
treatment of ovulatory menorrhagia.
Menorrhagia, defined as menstrual blood loss of greater
than 80 ml/cycle, is experienced by around 9 to 14% of
the female population of reproductive age (Van Eijkeren et
al. 1989), although many women who complain of heavy
periods have measured blood loss below this level (Fraser

Gynaecology, Norfolk and Norwich Hospital, Brunswick Road,

1989; Cameron et al. 1990). The correct management of
both of these groups of women, those with true menorrhagia and those complaining of heavy periods but with
blood losses less than 80 ml per cycle, is important as there
is much physical, personal and social morbidity associated
with these conditions. Both under- and over-treatment
should be avoided.
Treatment options fall into three main categories :
medical therapy, transcervical endometrial resection or

hysterectomy. Statistics for the morbidity and mortality
associated with surgical treatment are known (Dicker et al.
1982; Wingo et al. 1985; Magos et al. 1991). Medical
treatments are generally well tolerated, yet many patients
complaining of heavy periods are treated surgically, often
without knowing the true magnitude of the blood loss and
sometimes without a trial of medical therapy. As the
results of double-blind and randomised controlled studies
of medical treatments for ovulatory menorrhagia are now
available (Dockeray er al. 1989; Cameron et al. 1990;
Chamberlain et al. 1991; Milsom et al. 1991; Nilsson &
Rybo 1991), it should be possible to give patients whose
menstrual blood loss is known a choice of options with
the likely blood loss reductions to be expected, with each
form of treatment, thus enabling women to make informed
decisions.
The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and
safety of norethisterone and tranexamic acid. Norethisterone is the most frequently prescribed drug for menorrhagia
in the United Kingdom, despite limited information on its
effectiveness from controlled studies (Cameron et al.
1990). Tranexamic acid, on the other hand, has been
widely used in Scandinavia where it is used as first line
therapy and has been investigated by several controlled
studies (Callender et al. 1970; Milsom et al. 1991 ; Nilsson
& Rybo 1991).
Subjects and methods
This study was randomised, double-blind and placebo
controlled, with patients acting as their own controls in the
first two placebo-treated cycles. Randomisation was by
computer-generated numbers, the results of which were
placed in opaque, sealed, consecutively numbered envelopes. The sample size calculation of the study was based on
the assumption of an analysis of logged data with a mean
log difference between treatment means of 25% units
(50 %-25 %) in the treatment cycle of blood loss. Further
assumptions were based on a standard deviation between
groups of 0.45, a power of 80 YO and calculations based on
a two sided t test at the 5% level. This resulted in a
minimum of 20 patients per treatment arm. From previous
studies, it was assumed that at least 50 % of women would
be excluded by the inclusion-exclusion criteria during the
placebo phase; 50 women per arm were therefore chosen
to be screened initially.
Women complaining of regular heavy periods (n = 103)
were recruited into the study, either from gynaecology
outpatient clinics (n = 90) or directly via their general
practitioners (n = 13). The study was accepted by the
Cambridge District Health Authority Ethics Committee;
all women gave their written, informed consent and agreed
to collect their menstrual loss for a total of four months.
Patients were supplied with sanitary protection (Dr White’s
Shapes@, Tampax@ Super or Super-plus), a plastic bag in
which to collect it, and were advised regarding methods to
ensure collection of as much menstrual loss as possible.
Inclusion criteria were as follows :
1. A minimum of 18 years of age.
2. A cycle length 28+7 days.
3.
4.
5.
6.
7.
8.
No hormone therapy within the previous three months.
Not taking any medication which might affect the
menstrual blood loss.
No contraindication to either drug.
Normal renal function (serum creatinine < 125 pmol/l).
Normal pelvic examination.
Negative cervical cytology.
Women were eventually included in the treatment phase if
their average menstrual loss over two cycles was greater
than 80 ml per cycle, if they were shown to be ovulating
(mid-luteal phase serum progesterone concentration
greater than 9 nmol/l), and if they had complied with the
protocol during the two months of placebo treatment. The
women recorded in a study diary the days of bleeding, the
numbers of sanitary pads and tampons used, the presence
of abdominal pain and any other symptoms experienced
around the time of the period (adverse events), and any
additional drugs taken. At the end of each period the
women were seen and assessed. Tablet bottles were
returned to assess patient compliance. At the end of both
the placebo and treatment phases, the women completed a
questionnaire on a five-point scale to assess for the
previous two cycles :
1. Their general health.
2. The amount of flooding and leakage experienced.
3. Abdominal pain.
4. The degree of limitation of their social activities.
5. How the excess menstrual loss affected their sex life.
Blood was taken at the beginning and end of the study
to measure haemoglobin, serum ferritin, transferrin and
creatinine. Serum progesterone was assessed in the midluteal phase during placebo cycles. Thyroid function tests
were performed if indicated.
Menstrual blood loss was measured using the alkaline
haematin method (Hallberg & Nilsson, 1964). Briefly,
sanitary protection was soaked in the bag in which it was
collected in a known volume of 1 M sodium hydroxide
(NaOH) was 48 h (approximately 2 1 NaOH per 10 to 20
pads or tampons). The resulting elute was centrifuged at
5000 rpm for 10 min. A duplicate sample was then assayed
using absorption spectrophotometry at 540 nm. This
reading was compared with that of 1 ml of the patient’s
venous blood in 100 ml of 1 M sodium hydroxide, using the
formula :
optical density of elute volume NaOH Iml)
optical density of venous blood ‘\ 100 ml
Allowance was then made for the effect of any colour
change resulting from the sanitary protection itself.
Women with objectively diagnosed menorrhagia were
treated for two months with either norethisterone (5 mg
twice daily) on days 19 to 26 or tranexamic acid (1 g four
times daily) on days 1 to 4, in a double-blind, placebocontrolled fashion. Tablets were taken both from days 19
to 26 and days 1 to 4 of each cycle, but only one of these
contained the active drug; the other was placebo of

identical appearance to the active drug. Oral iron therapy
was given where indicated for anaemia, and women were
asked to use paracetamol-based analgesia, if required, for
dysmenorrhoea.
Results are expressed as observed mean values and
standard deviation (SD) with 95 % confidence intervals
(CI) for the estimated difference; P values are given where
appropriate. Comparisons of changes over time between
the treatment groups were performed with a three-factor
analysis of variance model, including factors for treatment
group, patient (nested within group), visit, and the group
to visit interaction. These comparisons, as well as withingroup tests, were tested by specifying contrasts in PROC
GLM in the SAS package. Variables from the patient
questionnaire, measured on ordinal scale, were analysed
with a x2 test using PROC FREQ.
Results
Of the 103 women initially recruited to the study, 46
(45 %) with proven ovulatory menorrhagia proceeded to
the treatment phase of the study. Of these, four patients
did not complete both treatment cycles: one because of a
bleeding duodenal ulcer requiring admission to hospital
during the second month of treatment (tranexamic acid
group), two because of failure to collect one month's
menstrual loss in the treatment phase (one from each
treatment group), and one because of taking her medication incorrectly in the second month of treatment
(norethisterone group). All four were included in the
intention-to-treat analyses. Of the 57 not included in the
treatment phase, 33 (32% of the total number recruited)
were withdrawn as menstrual blood loss was less than
80 ml per cycle, eight (8 YO) for anovulation, ten (10 %) for
protocol violations and ten (10 %) for other reasons, such
as not wishing to continue with randomised treatment.
The characteristics of the women who were included in
the treatment phase (n = 46) are shown in Table 1. There
were no significant differences in their age, parity or blood
pressure. However, there was a significant difference in
body weight between the two groups: the group who
received tranexamic acid was heavier than the group
receiving norethisterone.

changes in blood loss after treatment are shown in Fig. 1.
Tranexamic acid resulted in an average menstrual blood
loss reduction of 45 YO (+ 23 'YO to - 93 YO, P < 0.0001).
The mean menstrual blood loss increased by 20 YO ( + 114 %
to -62%, P = 0.26) in women receiving norethisterone.
The comparison of changes over time resulted in an
estimated difference of 113 ml (95 % CI 71 to 155,
P < 0.0001). Fourteen out of 25 women in the tranexamic
acid-treated group and two out of 21 women in the
norethisterone group achieved mean menstrual blood
losses of less than 80 ml per cycle on treatment. Of patients
whose initial blood loss was less than 200 ml, 12 out of 13
treated with tranexamic acid and two out of 16 treated
with norethisterone achieved blood losses on treatment of
less than 80ml. The greatest mean blood loss reduction
over two cycles was from 243 ml to 17 ml in the tranexamic
acid group and from 138 ml to 52 ml in the norethisterone
group. There was no significant difference in the number
of sanitary towels/tampons used with either form of
treatment.

Biochemical analyses are recorded in Table 3. The only
significant difference noted was a reduction in transferrin
concentration in the group treated with tranexamic acid
compared with the group treated with norethisterone;
when compared with control cycles this did not reach
significance. Oral iron was taken by 15/25 in the
tranexamic acid group and by 11/21 in the norethisterone
group. All women had serum creatinine levels within the
normal range (c 125 pmol/l), and there were no significant
differences either between the groups or before and after
treatment.
The results of the patient questionnaires (Table 4) have
been expressed as change during treatment compared with
the two placebo cycles, with symptoms scored either as
better or as the same or worse. These categories were
chosen so that a clear benefit as a result of treatment could
be compared with no patient benefit. There was no
significant difference in the two groups between the effect
of treatment on general health or the amount of abdominal
pain experienced ; however, there were significant differences in treatments with respect to the amount of flooding
or leakage and the limitation of social activities, and the
effect on sex life : tranexamic acid had a beneficial effect on
both, compared with norethisterone. For both the flooding
or leakage and the limitation of social activities variables,
the comparisons over time between treatment groups
resulted in significant differences. When asked to assess
their blood loss during the treatment cycles, compared
with placebo cycles, as the same or worse versus better,
patients treated with tranexamic acid were significantly
better than those treated with norethisterone (P = -0.002).

enced by the patient from day 19 onwards, were
experienced by a large percentage of women both in the
placebo cycles (n = 40, 85%) and in the treated cycles:
tranexamic acid group (n = 22, 88 %) versus the norethisterone groups (n = 20, 95%). There was no statistical
significance in the number or severity of any of these
symptoms in the treated compared with the placebo cycles.
The most common symptoms were dysmenorrhoea (80 %
in those treated with tranexamic acid and 85% in those
treated with norethisterone), headache (32 % in those
treated with tranexamic acid and 48% in those treated
with norethisterone), and gastrointestinal symptoms including diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting and dyspepsia (1 2 %
in those treated with tranexamic acid and 33% in those
treated with norethisterone). Only two patients mentioned
weight gain, and they were both in the tranexamic acidtreated group.
Discussion
Although norethsterone continues to be the most widely
prescribed drug for the medical treatment of menorrhagia
in the United Kingdom, the present data confirm the
findings of previous objectively based studies that the
administration of the gestogen in the late luteal phase
is not an effective treatment option for ovulatory
dysfunctional uterine bleeding (Cameron et al. 1990;
Higham & Shaw, 1993). On the other hand, the present
work does confirm the effectiveness of tranexamic acid
given at a dose of 1 gram four times a day for the first four
days of menstruation. The results for the blood loss
reductions achieved by tranexamic acid in this study are
comparable with those found by other investigations
(Callender et al. 1970; Milsom et al. 1991; Nilsson &
Rybo, 1991). The blood loss results, however, for
norethisterone, a mean increase of 20 %, are not as good
than previously reported. One reason for this may be the
time for which norethisterone was administered. In the
study by Fraser (1990) in which norethisterone was
given for 21 days (from days 5 to 26), menstrual blood
loss reductions of 30 YO were achieved; treatment, however, was neither randomised nor blind. Cameron et al.
(1990) studied norethisterone administered for seven days
(from days 19-26), and found reductions in menstrual
blood loss of 20%. Although this study was not placebo
controlled, Rydin and Lundberg (1976) and Chimbira et
al. (1980) have suggested that the placebo effect on
menstrual blood loss is small. Higham & Shaw (1993)
showed no significant reductions in patients treated with
norethindrone from days 19 to 26. The other available
literature on oral norethisterone for the treatment of
ovulatory menorrhagia is described by uncontrolled
studies or studies in which blood loss was not objectively
measured (Bishop & Cabral de Almeida, 1960). It is
possible that if given for a longer time (for example, for 21
days each cycle rather than the seven days of treatment
used in this and in the studies of Cameron et al. 1990 and
Higham & Shaw, 19931, better blood loss reductions might
be achieved. The use of norethisterone in the treatment of
anovulatory menorrhagia appears to be effective (Fraser
1990) and is not addressed in this paper.
The lack of any significant side effects with either drug
over placebo controlled cycles, highlighted by the fact that
there were no patient withdrawals as a result of side
effects, is very reassuring, especially in the case of
tranexamic acid. Isolated case reports of thrombotic
episodes in those taking tranexamic acid do exist (Rydin &
Lundberg, 1976; Agnelli et al. 1982). However, over a 19-
year time span and 238000 woman-years of treatment with
tranexamic acid from the late 1960s, no increased incidence
of thrombotic events over and above that of the general
population of the same age was observed in Scandinavia
(Rybo 1991).
Although tranexamic acid does not reduce the incidence
of dysmenorrhoea, it is suggested by this study that
because of the reductions in blood loss achieved, there is
reduced flooding and leakage and significant subjective
improvements in the quality of the women’s sex life. This
would be of major benefit to many women. This study, as
have many others, highlights once again, the benefits
which can be gained from assessment of the menstrual
blood loss. Only when this is formally done, ideally using
the alkaline haematin method, can the practitioner be sure
of the diagnosis and be able to give appropriate advice
regarding therapy. In this study of 103 patients with a
history strongly suggestive of menorrhagia complaining of
heavy periods, only 40 % had a measured menstrual blood
loss of greater than 80 ml per cycle. This is in keeping with
the finding of others (Cameron et al. 1990) and suggests
that women without proven menorrhagia are potentially
at risk of being overtreated by regimes which also have
risks. This is not to say that a hysterectomy for a complaint
of heavy periods where the blood loss is less than 80 ml is
overtreatment. Many women in this situation wish surgical
management and are happy with the result. It does,
however, provide women with more information on which
to base an important decision. Our data show that where
pre-treatment blood loss is less than 200 ml per cycle, 92 %
will have their blood loss reduced to less than 80 ml per
cycle when treated with tranexamic acid. To prevent
under-treatment, our study suggests that those with a
menstrual blood loss of greater than 250 ml per cycle will
be unlikely to achieve a normal blood loss (less than 80 ml 
406 .I. T. PRESTON ET AL.
per cycle) on treatment with tranexamic acid at this dose
and should be considered either for treatment with another
form of medical therapy or for early recourse to surgery.
It is important that we continually reappraise our
management, especially of older methods which have not
been subjected to randomised, double-blind, placebo
controlled studies. In conclusion, this study confirms the
safety and efficacy of tranexamic acid in ovulatory
menorrhagia but suggests that norethisterone at this dose
is not effective therapy for ovulatory menorrhagia.
