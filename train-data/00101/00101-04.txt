Abstract
Aim: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of Safoof Habis in Kasrate Tams (menorrhagia) with validated menstrual pictogram.
Materials and methods: A single blind, randomized, standard controlled trial was conducted in the gynaecological outpatient of National Institute
of Unani Medicine Hospital. Clinically diagnosed patients (n = 52) were randomized to the test (n = 35) and control (n = 17) groups. In the test
group, Safoof Habis (Ingredient are Silicate of alumina and Iron oxide, Hydrated magnesium silicate and Vateria indica L.) 5 g twice daily and in
the control group, tranexamic acid 500 mg, thrice daily were administered from day 1 to day 5 of menstrual cycle and Qurs Kushta Faulad, one
tablet twice daily was administered in both the groups for three consecutive months. The primary outcome measure was to assess the efficacy and
safety of this Unani formulation in menorrhagia with menstrual pictogram. The secondary outcome measures were to assess the effectiveness of
test drug formulation on dysmenorrhea and hemoglobin concentration. The results were analyzed by Student’s ‘t’ test and Fisher exact test.
Results: The groups were homogenous in the terms of age, parity, socioeconomic status, marital status and biochemical parameters (P > 0.05).
Post treatment when compared to baseline in same group showed significant reduction in menstrual blood loss in both the groups (P < 0.001). The
comparison between test and control group showed that both groups were equally effective (P = 0.265). There was improvement in hemoglobin
concentration in the test group (P = 0.04) and dysmenorrhea was reduced in both groups (P < 0.001).
Conclusion: Safoof Habis was found to be effective in reducing menstrual blood loss in menorrhagia.

Introduction
Menorrhagia is a major public health problem [1] for women
of reproductive age [2] and considered to be one of the most
significant causes of ill health [3]. It is clinically defined as
menstrual blood loss exceeding 80 ml per cycle [4] or duration lasting longer than 7 days or both [5]. Menorrhagia affects
up to 20–30% of women during their reproductive years [6].
Menstrual blood loss (MBL) studies are relevant for developing
world women as this could be an important cause of anemia and

has major impact on the health related quality of life. Conservative medical treatment for the management of menorrhagia may
result in a substantial reduction in menstrual blood loss thereby
reducing the incidence of anemia. But these therapies have their
own side effects including GIT disturbances, obesity, liver diseases, thromboembolic diseases, etc.[7].Unani Scholars were of
opinion that Kasrate Tams(menorrhagia) is caused by Sue Mizaj
Rehm wa Badan (abnormal temperament of uterus and body),
Amraz Rehm (diseases of uterus), Ghalbae Khilt Safra (dominance of bile humor), Imtilae Badan (congestion in the body),
Riqqat and Latafat Khoon (decreased viscosity and liquefaction
of blood), etc. They also said Zoafe Quwate Masika (weakness in
retentive power) and Qawi Quwate Dafiya (increase in expulsive
power) lead to this disease [8–10]. If not treated in time, leads
to complications such as indigestion, weakness, abortion, defect
in implantation, and intrauterine growth retardation. [8]. Thus,
treatment is necessary. Treatment objective in menorrhagia is to

improve quality of life as well as alleviating heavy menstrual
flow. In Kasrate Tams, Unani drugs that are having Qabiz and
Habis(astringent and styptic) properties are used. Hence, Safoof
Habis was selected as it contains Teen Ahmer, Sange Jarahat and
Raal Sufaid that are having above said properties.
Though, this formulation is in use since long time for Kasrate
Tams, but till date, no studies have been carried out to show the
efficacy of Safoof Habisin this disease. Hence, this study is of its
first kind to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Safoof Habis and
furthermore, menstrual blood loss was quantified objectively by
well validated menstrual pictogram [3].
Material and methods
The hypothesis of this study was to compare the effectiveness
of Unani drug formulation with standard drug and from baseline
in reducing the menstrual blood loss in menorrhagia.
Study design
A prospective, single center, pre and post treatment evaluation, and a single blind, randomized standard controlled trial
were conducted in the Gynaecological outpatient Department
of National Institute of Unani Medicine Hospital during the
year January 2008–January 2009. The study was started after
approval from institutional ethical committee. Random allocation was performed using lottery method onto two groups, the
test group (n = 35) and control group (n = 17) allowing 20% drop
out. Under lottery method, small and identical paper slips were
numbered, which were folded and mixed together in a drum thoroughly. A blindfold selection was then made of the number slips
that were required for this study. After drawing out one slip and
noting the number, the slip was again put back in the drum. The
drum was reshuffled and second slip was drawn. This process
was repeated till the sample size was completed. The slip that
was drawn for second time was rejected. As per recommendation of Ethical Committee Members the sample size in control
group was reduced to 15 patients since it was dissertation work.
The data were analyzed and compared after completion of the
trial.
Participants
Clinically diagnosed (n = 52) patients with history of menorrhagia were consented.
Only patients were blinded about the intervention. For this
purpose, patients of control and test group were called for the
follow-up at different occasion and all precautions were taken so
that these patients did not interrogate with each other. Patients
with hemoglobin above 8 g%, unmarried and married women
aged 18–45 years with pelvic pathology such as endometriosis,
pelvic inflammatory diseases, uterine fibroid, polyp and adenomyosis were included. Patients using oral contraceptive pills,
intrauterine contraceptive device, diseases such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, tuberculosis, severe anemia, ischemic heart
disease, thyroid dysfunction, blood dyscrasias, and malignancy
were excluded.
Patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria were evaluated
through complete history, physical examination and investigations. Menstrual blood loss was assessed with menstrual
pictogram. All information was recorded in specially designed
case record form. Baseline routine investigations such as complete hemogram, bleeding time, clotting time, platelet count,
blood grouping, Rh typing and random blood sugar were done
to exclude bleeding disorders and general diseases. Blood urea,
serum creatinine, uric acid, SGOT, SGPT, and alkaline phosphatase were done before and after treatment to assess the safety
of test and control drugs. Thyroid and hormone profile (FSH, LH,
and serum prolactin) were investigated to exclude thyroid dysfunction and hypothalamic pituitary dysfunction respectively.
Pelvic ultrasonography was done to find out pelvic pathology.
The venous concentration of hemoglobin was measured before
and at the end of the treatment.
Measurement of menstrual blood loss with menstrual pictogram during baseline cycle was compared to three consecutive
treatment cycles. The patients were requested to use kotex napkin and record the details of their menstrual cycle i.e., date of
start, duration of menstruation, subjective assessment of menstrual flow and any side effects. During revisit and at the final
visit, subjects were also asked about their menstrual blood loss,
whether increased or decreased by the treatment received. The
data registered during the baseline visit, the re-visits and the
final visit, focused primarily on the effect and safety of the treatment. After completion of three months of treatment, patients
were advised for three consecutive monthly visits of follow-up
to observe the progression or regression of symptoms.
Diagnostic criteria
Menstrual pictogram
To diagnose menorrhagia, menstrual pictogram that is a modification of the previous PBAC technique was used. It is a visual
representation of blood loss from which a numerical score in
milliliters is derived. The chart consists of five icons representing blood loss on towels and four icons representing blood loss
on tampons. Three icons demonstrate variation in the size of
blood clots and another three icons were included to represent
the volume of blood lost in the toilet when changing sanitary
wear. A numerical scoring system was devised to coincide with
the amount of blood lost. The score is calculated in milliliters and
is equivalent to the actual volume of blood lost [3]. A validation
study by Wyatt et al. suggested significant positive correlation
between women’s ability to estimate her blood loss on sanitary
wear using the menstrual pictogram and her actual blood loss
assessed using the alkaline hematin technique [4].
An additional advantage of the menstrual pictogram is the
estimation of the extraneous blood loss that cannot be assessed
by PBAC. Wyatt et al. reported that menorrhagia was confirmed
objectively in 36% of their study group presenting with menorrhagia when only the sanitary products were assessed. However,
when extraneous blood loss was taken into consideration this
figure increased to 74% [3,4].
A. Fathima, A. Sultana / European Journal of Integrative Medicine 4 (2012) e315–e322 e317
Sensitivity and specificity
The menstrual pictogram had a sensitivity of 86% and specificity of 88% in diagnosing menorrhagia (as defined by the
alkaline hematin method). The associated κ statistic for the comparison between the feminine hygiene product icons and the
alkaline hematin assessment was 0.8 [4].
Visual analog scale for pain in dysmenorrhea
The intensity of pain in dysmenorrhea was calculated by
visual analog scale for pain. It is a simple assessment tool of
10 cm line, ‘0’ on one end and 10 cm on the other end [11]. ‘0’
on one end indicates no pain and 10 cm on the other end represents the ‘worst pain’ ever experience that a patients mark to
indicate the severity of pain [12].
Intervention
The component of Safoof Habis [13] was Teen Ahmer (Silicate of alumina and Iron oxide), Sange Jarahat (Hydrated
magnesium silicate) and Raal Sufaid (Vateria indica Linn). The
ingredients of the test drug’s formulation were supplied by the
pharmacy of National Institute of Unani Medicine. Identification of these drugs was done by the Regional Research Institute
of Ayurveda (RRCBI/Mus.7-09), Bangalore. All the three drugs
were taken in equal quantity and ground well after cleaning them
to make fine powder. The powder was supplied in an individual
pack for each patient and its compliance was checked after each
course of treatment. No additional medication was allowed.
The standard drug, tranexamic acid (Clip-500 mg) was procured from the market. It was manufactured by FDC Limited,
B. No. TXG8061, Mfg date 06/2008, Expiry date 05/2010).
In the test group, Safoof Habis, 5 g twice daily and in the
standard control group, tranexamic acid 500 mg, thrice daily
were administered from day 1 to day 5 of the menstrual cycle for
three consecutive months. The test drug formulation has been
taken from the pharmacopeia where the prescribed dose was
twice a day and standard drug’s dose is thrice or four times a
day. Hence, it was given according.
Qurs Kushta Faulad (125 mg) 1 tablet twice daily was given
orally in both groups for three consecutive months as an iron
supplement. The ingredients of this qurs are Iron calx (31.25 mg)
and starch (q.s.).
Outcome measures
The primary outcome of this study was to compare the efficacy of Safoof Habis with tranexamic acid and from baseline
on menstrual blood loss in Kasrate Tams Safety of the test
drug formulation was evaluated with biochemical tests and by
observing the adverse drug effects clinically. The secondary outcomes were to evaluate the efficacy of test drug formulation on
dysmenorrhea, and hemoglobin concentration.
Statistical analysis
The Statistical software SPSS 15.0 was used for the analysis
of the data and Microsoft word and Excel have been used to
generate graphs, tables, etc.
The descriptive statistical analysis has been carried out in
the present study. Results on continuous measurements are presented on mean ± SD (Min–Max) and results on categorical
measurements are presented in number (%). P values lower
than 0.05 were regarded as significant. The Student ‘t’ test (two
tailed, independent) has been used to find the significance of
study parameters on continuous scale between two groups and
Student ‘t’ test (two tailed, dependent) has been used to find the
significance of study parameters on continuous scale within each
group. Student ‘t’ test has been also used to find the homogeneity
of parameters on continuous scale. Chi-square/Fisher exact test
has been used to find the homogeneity of samples on categorical
scale. Analysis of data was on intention to treat basis.
Results
A total no. of 81 patients were interrogated and screened for
Kasrate Tams during the study period. Out of them 17 patients
did not review and 64 were subjected to preliminary investigations in which 12 were excluded because of thyroid dysfunction,
diabetes and endometrial thickness of more than 14 mm. Fiftytwo patients were randomly allocated by lottery method to the
test and control group allowing 20% drop out. Statistical analysis for efficacy and safety was performed on 30 patients in the
test group and 15 patients in the control group to observe the
results (Fig. 1). The parameters were evaluated before and after
treatment.
Baseline characteristics and investigations of patients allocated to the test and control group:
It was observed that all parameters were statistically not
significant (P > 0.05) before treatment in both groups. Hence,
the groups were homogenous with respect to age, socioeconomic status, age of menarche, marital status and investigations.
(Table 1) The mean age with standard deviation in the test group
was 27.4 ± 7.3 years and 28.33 ± 7.08 years in the control group.
Primary outcome
The mean score (standard deviation) of menstrual blood loss
recorded in menstrual pictogram in control and test group was
154.13 (19.89) and 162.37 (13.38), respectively, which was statistically similar between two groups at base line (P = 0.107).
After treatment at last follow-up (F3), difference of mean score
(standard deviation) of menstrual blood loss from baseline in
control and test group was 80.17 (27.67) and 81.48 (17.38)
respectively (P < 0.868), which was statistically not significant
showing that both groups were effective (Table 2 and Fig. 2).
Comparative evaluation of safety parameters
In the study, it was found that all parameters were statistically not significant (P > 0.05) before and after treatment, except

Discussion
In this study, the primary outcome was to compare the therapeutic effect and safety of Safoof Habis and Tranexamic acid in
women with menorrhagia before and after treatment in same
group; and between test and control group. The comparison
between two groups after treatment showed that there was no
statistical significant difference between them (P = 0.265) proving that the test drug formulation was as effective as the standard
drug. Comparison between pre test and post test in same group
showed that there was significant reduction in menstrual blood
loss from the baseline (P < 0.001).
After treatment during follow-up, it was observed that the
effect of test drug formulation was long lasting than that of
standard drug.
Unani scholars hypothesized that Habisuddam (hemostatic)
drugs usually have Barid wa Yabis (cold and dry) temperament, hence helps to constrict the capillaries, blood vessels and
surrounding structures thereby helps in hemostasis [14]. Sange
jarahat and Teen Ahmer are havingBarid wa Yabistemperament,
and are able to help in hemostasis[15]. Moreover, Kasrate Tams
is caused due to weakness of Quwate masika (retentive power)
and increases force of Quwat dafiya (expulsive power) [9] and
it is assumed that Barid wa Yabis drugs tone up the Quwate
ghazia of Rehm (nutritive power of uterus) and ultimately rectify
the abnormality of Quwat masika and Quwate dafiya [8]. Raal
Sufaid contains tannin [16], which coagulates the cellular protein
and contracts or blanches capillary endothelium, thus reducing
the amount of menstrual blood loss [17]. Teen Ahmer and Raal
Sufaid also contain calcium that helps to maintain hemostatic

mechanism [16,18,19]. It is also hypothesized that Sange Jarahat enhances the coagulation (antifibrinolysis) of blood [14].
Thus, all these properties of the test drugs have caused reduction
in menstrual blood loss in menorrhagia.
It is known that Iron supplement and blood transfusion helps
to reduce bleeding in anemia. Here it also might contribute to
positive outcome, but in this study, it was given to prevent Iron
deficiency anemia that might be caused by menorrhagia and to
nullify the bias in the study it was given in both groups.
It validates the claim made by Unani physicians. However,
none of the interventional studies have been documented using
menstrual pictogram and test drug formulation in Unani system
of medicine; therefore, it is difficult to correlate the finding with
previous studies.
All the biochemical parameters that were assessed to observe
safety of test drug formulation on vital organs of the body were
within normal limits. Thus, the formulation was safe without
adverse effects.
Effect on secondary outcome variables
Dysmenorrhea
The pain reduction was 69.4% and 54.9% in the control
and test group respectively. This change was significant
(P < 0.001) indicating that both drugs were equally effective
in reducing dysmenorrhea. Though these drugs are not having
direct analgesic property but were able to reduced congestive
dysmenorrhea. It might be due to vasoconstricting action of
drugs on blood vessels of the uterus and related structures that
reduces congestion thereby decreasing pain.
Hb concentration
Both groups were given Qurs Kushta Faulad but patients
taking test drug formulation had improvement in the Hb concentration, most probably because of the effect of iron oxide
present in Teen Ahmer [20].
The patients follow-up for three months showed no recurrence of this disease in both groups.
The strength of this study
It was the first of its kind of research, where menstrual pictogram was used in the interventional study to evaluate the
efficacy of Unani drugs in menorrhagia. It was single blind randomized standard control trial. Compliance of the patients was
good. Pelvic pathology was included and this formulation is cost
effective and easily available.
The limitations of the study were unequal and of small sample
size, power of the study was not calculated and gold standard
alkaline hematin method was not used to quantify the menstrual
blood loss. Further, double blinding was not done in view of
small project, lack of manpower and infrastructure.
Further, clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy of the test drug
formulation where menstrual blood loss should be quantified
by gold standard alkaline hematin method are needed. It is also
recommended that double blind, randomized standard controlled
trial in large number of patients for longer duration is necessary
as it contain minerals.

Conclusion
Kasrate Tams is considered as a common gynaecological
complaint in women of reproductive age. Its effects range from
social embarrassment to significant morbidity requiring blood
transfusion and major operation. Hence, it should be treated. In
conventional medicine effective medical therapy is available but
proved to have many side effects.
We can conclude that Safoof Habis was efficacious, safe, well
tolerated, and cost effective in the management of menstrual
blood loss in Kasrate Tams. Despite a wide range of treatment
options, this Unani formulation has trended toward conservative therapy for controlling costs, the desire of many women to
preserve their uterus and replacing the hormonal therapy. Further, it is recommended that double blind, randomized standard
controlled trial is needed in large population.
