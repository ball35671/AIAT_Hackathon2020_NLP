214 24 October 1970 Clinical and Radiological Diagnosis-Sutherland MBEDICALIJOURNAL
The reasons for the low rate of lesion detection are not difficult to find. Firstly, most patients suffering from ill-defined
cranial symptoms such as headache, giddiness, vertigo, alterations of consciousness or concentration, or more clearly recognizable disturbances such as epilepsy or syncope have no
identifiable cause discovered in the absence of persisting
physical signs. Secondly, even in those patients where a mass
lesion is discovered (Bull and Zilkha, 1968) the skull x-ray
film may remain within normal limits. This is not altogether
surprising as most intracranial mass lesions will produce pronounced disturbance of function before the classical
radiological signs of raised intracranial pressure or displacement of calcified midline structures are recognized. Finally,
the pathological incidence of benign tumours or granulomata,
for example, tuberculomata, which have undergone partial calcification and would thus be readily observed on the x-ray
films-is so low that such a lesion is most unlikely to be
found as the cause of cranial symptoms.
Though it is not possible in the present series to measure
the clinical contribution to the low agreement percentages,
undoubtedly it is an important factor and, unlike those inherent in radiological methods of investigation, little attention
has been given to its improvement. At present the teaching of
radiology to undergraduates and medical and surgical postgraduates at most centres appears largely intended to give the
student a small degree of diagnostic ability. The progressive
refinement of radiological methods and interpretation makes
the value of this type of training increasingly doubtful.
Though interesting from an educational standpoint it contributes little to the understanding of the practical application,
value, and limitations of radiological investigations. If diagnostic radiology is to be used effectively then its application
rather than interpretation in the clinical situation must
become he main focus of attention in clinical training
programmes.

ummary: In a double-blind trial tranexamic acid (Cyclokapron) 1 g. four times a day for the first four days of
menstruation, significantly decreased menstrual blood loss
in women with menorrhagia for which no organic cause
had been found. No difference in side-effects was noted
between the active and placebo treatment.
Introduction
Apart from its social inconvenience menorrhagia can cause
anaemia, which may be difficult to combat even with continuous iron therapy. Hormone therapy may improve the symptom, but the recent adverse publicity given to the "pill"
makes such treatment unacceptable for some. An increase in
plasminogen activators in the endometrium has been found on
the first day of the menstrual period in women with
menorrhagia compared with those with normal menstrual loss
(Rybo, 1966); the use of an antifibrinolytic agent to reduce the
loss therefore seems logical. The present paper reports the
results of a double-blind trial with a new antifibrinolytic agent
tranexamic acid (Cyclokapron; trans-4-aminomethylcyclohexanecarboxylic acid) in the treatment of 16 women suffering
from excessive menstrual loss.
Patients and Methods
The patients had either presented to the medical clinic
with iron-deficiency anaemia which, from the history and
other negative investigations, appeared to be due to heavy
menstrual loss or they had been referred direct to the
gynaecologist with a complaint of menorrhagia. Before admission to the trial each had a gynaecological examination and
dilatation and curettage was performed. If no significant
clinical or histological abnormality was found the possibility
of treatment with tranexamic acid was discussed with the
patient and the purpose of the trial was explained fully.
Originally 20 patients agreed to take part in the investigation, but four did not complete the trial and are not included
in the analysis-two elected to have a hysterectomy rather
than continue with the trial, one was found to be losing blood
from an undefined source between the menstruations, and
one failed to return for follow-up.
Menstrual loss was measured with the Oxford total body
counter (Warner and Oliver, 1966). In each case the study
was started shortly after a menstrual period. About 2-4 uCi
59Fe ferric citrate was given intravenously, and two weeks
later the total body count was measured for the baseline
value. Thereafter each patient reported for a total body count
at two-weekly intervals, the activity on each occasion being
related to the previous count. The blood loss between each
visit was estimated by multiplying percentage loss of radioactivity by the estimated blood volume (Holt et al., 1967). The
blood volume was obtained from the weight and height of the
subject (Nadler et al., 1962).
For the first three menstrual periods (control blood loss) no
treatment was given; over the second three menstrual periods
each patient was given, at the visit before each menstruation was
due, a bottle containing 32 tablets labelled A, and she was
instructed to take two tablets four times a day for the first
four days of the menstruation. She was also given a supply of
sanitary pads (Dr. White's), and asked to keep a note of how
many pads she used each day. For the third three months she
was similarly instructed but tablets A were replaced by
tablets B.
The tablets were either tranexamic acid 0.5 g. per tablet or
a placebo of similar size and appearance. The order of treatments was randomized, and neither the patients nor those
conducting the study knew the identity of tablets A and B. A
slip was attached to each bottle on which the patient recorded

the date when menstruation started, the number of tablets
taken, and the number of pads used each day. At each attendance she was asked to record her impression of the treatment and whether she had noted any side-effects. At the
beginning of each three months of observation an additional
dose of about 2-4 ttCi of activity was given. A blood count
was done and the serum iron and total iron-binding capacity
were measured at the beginning and end of the trial.
Results
A subjective complaint of heavy menstrual loss had been
present in all patients for from five months to several years
(Table I). Four only of the 16 gave no history of ever having
been treated for anaemia, and in three of these the history
was relatively short-that is, one year or less-and in two
(Patients 8 and 12) the dietary history suggested an exceptionally high intake of meat, which might be an added factor
in the prevention of anaemia.
The other 12 patients either presented with anaemia or gave
a history of treatment with iron some time in the past. Three
continued iron therapy throughout the trial, and two of these
showed an increase of more than 1 g. of haemoglobin during
this time. In contrast four who stopped treatment with iron
showed a drop of more than 1 g. of haemoglobin per 100 ml.
during the nine months. Two patients had attempted to control the menorrhagia with hormone therapy, but this treatment
was stopped before the trial. One patient had been taking
megestrol as a contraceptive for eight years, and she continued
to do so throughout the observations.
The mean loss per menstruation for the no treatment and
placebo and tranexamic acid treatment in each subject is
shown in Table II; the means for the groups as a whole were
197, 185, and 122 ml. respectively. Patient 9 had presented to
the gynaecologist with a history of menorrhagia, but her mean
loss during the control and placebo periods was normal. In
the other patients the measurement of blood loss during the
three months of no treatment confirmed a loss of more than
80 ml. per menstruation, which has been defined by Hallberg
et al. (1966) as excessive. There was no significant difference
between the no treatment and placebo treatment, but comparison of the observations on the loss with no treatment and
with tranexamic acid showed a significant decrease in loss
produced by the therapy (t=3-44, P<0.02); for tranexamic
acid compared with the placebo t=2.37, P<0.05.
The duration of the menstrual periods, the number of pads
used, and the number of pills taken for the tranexamic acid
and placebo treatment are shown in Table III. There was no
significant difference in the duration of the menstrual loss for
the two treatments, but a significant reduction occurred in
the number of pads used in the treatment with tranexamic
acid (t=3.37, P<0.01). A possible 96 tablets should have

of those taking the placebo. In the active treatment group the
total dose of tranexamic acid per menstruation varied from 10 to
16 g., with a mean of 14 g. The patients admitted to not taking
all the tablets for various reasons not related to intolerance.
A few patients reported minor complaints which might be
attributed to the tablets. One said that both tablets A and B
made her feel "sickly." Two patients complained of "headache" or "feeling unwell" on taking tranexamic acid. Two
others taking the placebo complained of "light-headed
feelings" and "haziness." Several reported a striking

Discussion
The antifibrinolytic agent aminocaproic acid (epsilonaminocaproic acid, E.A.C.A.) has been used in the treatment of
menorrhagia and found to be effective (Nilsson and
Bj6rkman, 1965; Nilsson and Rybo, 1965). The mean menstrual loss in 26 patients with menorrhagia studied by a
double-blind trial was reduced with aminocaproic acid from
164-3 to 60 9 ml. To achieve this, however, the dose of
aminocaproic acid was up to 25 g./day, and at this level an
appreciable number of side-effects were noted, such as
nausea and faintness (Nilsson and Rybo, 1965).
Tranexamic acid is a more recently developed antifibrinolytic
agent. Its use has already been reported in women with
menorrhagia in Sweden and Belgium (Nilsson and Rybo,
1967; Vermylen et al., 1968). In these studies blood loss was
measured by extracting the haemoglobin from the towels
used by the women during menstruation. Vermylen et al.
(1968) found a reduction in loss of 35%/,. Nilsson and Rybo
(1967) obtained a reduction of 38%,', with a total dose of 12g.
per period, but by increasing the dose to 24 g. (6 g. for four
days) the mean reduction in loss was 51%. The total body
counter gives a relatively imprecise measurement of blood
loss; nevertheless, we obtained a mean reduction of menstrual
blood loss of about 36'', with doses of tranexamic acid varying from 10 to 16 g. per period.
Vermylen et al. (1968) did not find any reduction in the
number of towels used during the active treatment, but in
our observations this seemed to be the simplest and most
sensitive way to detect reduction of blood loss. When more
sophisticated methods are not available this would appear to
be a good method for assessing the results of treatment,
provided that a standard type of sanitary pad is used. There
is little if any correlation between the number of pads used
and the measured blood loss taking the patients as a whole
(Fig. 1), but for any individual patient the amount lost is
usually reflected by the number of pads she uses (Fig. 2).
In most cases tranexamic acid did not return the blood loss
to normal; nevertheless, it is likely to prove a helpful agent
where hormone therapy is not indicated and hysterectomy is
not desired. The experience of Nilsson and Rybo (1967) suggests that larger doses would be more effective. With the dosage schedule used in this trial the side-effects were insignificant and did not differ from those produced by the placebos.
One question, however, which will clearly need to be answered is whether tranexamic acid will show an advantage
over hormone therapy from the point of view of thrombosis.
On the basis of five years' clinical experience Nilsson et al.
(1965) considered that the other antifibrinolytic agent
aminocaproic acid could not be regarded as thrombogenic. It
seems reasonable to hope that the same will apply to tranexamic acid.
We are grateful to Miss M. Alcock and Miss S. Parker for
technical help and to Kabi Pharmaceuticals Limited for supplies of
Cyclokapron and a contribution towards the expenses of the
investigation.
