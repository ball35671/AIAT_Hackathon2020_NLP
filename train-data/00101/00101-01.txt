Summary
Abstract Tranexamic acid (Transamin®, Cyklokapron®, Exacyl®, Cyklo-f®) is a synthetic
lysine derivative that exerts its antifibrinolytic effect by reversibly blocking lysine
binding sites on plasminogen and thus preventing fibrin degradation.
In a number of small clinical studies in women with idiopathic menorrhagia,
tranexamic acid 2–4.5 g/day for 4–7 days reduced menstrual blood loss by
34–59% over 2–3 cycles, significantly more so than placebo, mefenamic acid,
flurbiprofen, etamsylate and oral luteal phase norethisterone at clinically relevant
dosages. Intrauterine administration of levonorgestrel 20 μg/day, however, produced the greatest reduction (96% after 12 months) in blood loss; 44% of patients
treated with levonorgestrel developed amenorrhoea. Tranexamic acid 1.5g three
times daily for 5 days also significantly reduced menstrual blood loss in women
with intrauterine contraceptive device-associated menorrhagia compared with
diclofenac sodium (150mg in three divided doses on day 1 followed by 25mg
three times daily on days 2–5) or placebo.
Tranexamic acid, mefenamic acid, etamsylate, flurbiprofen or diclofenac sodium had no effect on the duration of menses in the studies that reported such data.
In a large noncomparative, nonblind, quality-of-life study, 81% of women
were satisfied with tranexamic acid 3–6 g/day for 3–4 days/cycle for three cycles,
and 94% judged their menstrual blood loss to be ‘decreased’ or ‘strongly
decreased’ compared with untreated menstruations.
The most commonly reported drug-related adverse events are gastrointestinal
in nature. The total incidence of nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and dyspepsia in a
double-blind study was 12% in patients who received tranexamic acid 1g four
times daily for 4 days for two cycles (not significantly different to the incidence in
placebo recipients).
In conclusion, the oral antifibrinolytic drug tranexamic acid is an effective and
well tolerated treatment for idiopathic menorrhagia. In clinical trials, tranexamic
acid was more effective at reducing menstrual blood loss than mefenamic acid,
flurbiprofen, etamsylate and oral luteal phase norethisterone. Although it was not
as effective as intrauterine administration of levonorgestrel, the high incidence of
amenorrhoea and adverse events such as intermenstrual bleeding resulting from
such treatment may be unacceptable to some patients. Comparative studies of
tranexamic acid with ε-aminocaproic acid, danazol and combined oral contraceptives, as well as long-term tolerability studies, would help to further define the
place of the drug in the treatment of menorrhagia. Nevertheless, tranexamic acid
may be considered as a first-line treatment for the initial management of idiopathic menorrhagia, especially for patients in whom hormonal treatment is either not
recommended or not wanted.

Tranexamic Acid: A Review 1419
Tranexamic acid exerts its antifibrinolytic effect by reversibly blocking lysine Overview of
Pharmacodynamic binding sites on plasminogen, thus preventing plasmin (which is still formed via
Properties activation of plasminogen by a plasminogen activator) from interacting with
lysine residues on the fibrin polymer and subsequent fibrin degradation. The
reduction in plasminogen binding to fibrin appears to result in either a decrease in
the production of tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) by endothelial cells or an
increase in the rate of its clearance from the endometrium. Endometrial t-PA
levels were significantly lower after three treatment cycles than before treatment
in 12 menorrhagic women who received tranexamic acid 500mg four times daily
for 5 days.
In women with menorrhagia, fibrinolytic activity in utero is higher than in
women with normal menstrual blood loss; this increased fibrinolysis is most likely
due to higher levels of endometrium-derived plasmin and plasminogen activators.
Tranexamic acid 1g three times daily for 5 days significantly reduced tissue
plasminogen activator and plasmin activity in the menstrual and peripheral blood
of menorrhagic women, compared with pre-treatment values.
Tranexamic acid has no effect on overall blood coagulation parameters (e.g.
platelet counts, activated partial thromboplastin time and prothrombin times), as
determined from studies in patients undergoing a variety of surgical procedures.
The pharmacokinetics of tranexamic acid are unaffected by the presence of food Pharmacokinetic
Properties in the gastrointestinal tract; the oral bioavailability is approximately 34%. After
oral administration of a single 2g dose to ten fasting healthy male volunteers, the
mean maximum plasma concentration of tranexamic acid was 14.4 mg/L and was
achieved 2.8 hours postdose; the area under the concentration-time curve from
0–6 hours was 59.5 mg • h/L.
Tranexamic acid is minimally bound to plasma proteins (≈3%) at therapeutic
plasma concentrations (5–10 mg/L), and this appears to be fully accounted for by
binding to plasminogen.
The main route of elimination of tranexamic acid is via the kidneys. After oral
administration of tranexamic acid 250 or 500mg to healthy adults, between 40 and
70% of the administered dose was excreted unchanged in the urine within 24
hours. The terminal elimination half-life is ≈2 hours.
The efficacy of tranexamic acid in the treatment of idiopathic menorrhagia has Therapeutic Efficacy
been evaluated in several small (n = 15–76) studies of variable design.
Compared with either placebo or control groups, oral tranexamic acid 2–4.5 g/
day for 4–7 days (total doses of 10–21.5g) per cycle effectively reduced menstrual
blood loss by 34–59% over 2–3 cycles in women with menorrhagia. Tranexamic
acid was significantly more effective at reducing menstrual blood loss than
mefenamic acid 1.5 g/day for 5 days, flurbiprofen 200 mg/day for 5 days,
etamsylate 2 g/day for 5 days and oral luteal phase norethisterone 10 mg/day.
However, intrauterine administration of levonorgestrel 20 μg/day produced the

0.01 vs tranexamic acid); 7 of the 16 patients treated with levonorgestrel developed amenorrhoea after up to 12 months’ treatment.
In two nonblind studies, all patients achieved blood loss of <80 mL/cycle
during treatment with tranexamic acid; 56% of tranexamic acid recipients
achieved blood loss of <80 mL/cycle in a double-blind study.
In a crossover study, tranexamic acid 1.5g three times daily for 5 days
significantly reduced menstrual blood loss in women with intrauterine contraceptive device-associated menorrhagia compared with diclofenac sodium 150mg in
three divided doses on day 1 followed by 25mg three times daily on days 2–5 or
placebo. At the end of two cycles each of tranexamic acid and diclofenac sodium
and one cycle of placebo, 16, 10 and 5 of the 19 patients, respectively, had lost a
mean of <80mL of blood per cycle.
Tranexamic acid, mefenamic acid, etamsylate, flurbiprofen or diclofenac sodium had no effect on the duration of menses in the studies that reported such data.
The quality of life (social activity, work performance, productivity, cleanliness, action radius, overall functioning and tiredness) of patients with menorrhagia was significantly improved after three cycles of tranexamic acid 3–6 g/day for
3–4 days/cycle in a large noncomparative, nonblind quality-of-life study. After
the first and third treatment cycles, 58% and 81% of women were satisfied with
tranexamic acid treatment, and 87% and 94% judged their menstrual blood loss to
be ‘decreased’ or ‘strongly decreased’ compared with untreated menstruations.
Significantly more recipients of tranexamic acid 4 g/day for 4 days than
recipients of luteal-phase norethisterone 10 mg/day experienced improved flooding/leakage (83% vs 45%) and improved sex life (46% vs 15%) in a double-blind
study. However, there was no significant between-group difference in the effect of
treatment on general health.
Oral tranexamic acid is well tolerated by most patients with menorrhagia. With Tolerability
the exception of dysmenorrhoea, the most commonly reported drug-related
adverse events are gastrointestinal in nature. The total incidence of nausea,
vomiting, diarrhoea and dyspepsia in a double-blind study was 12% in patients
who received tranexamic acid 1g four times daily for 4 days for two cycles;
however, there were no statistically significant differences in the number or
severity of adverse events experienced by patients during either the placebo run-in
period or active treatment.
An improvement in symptoms of dysmenorrhoea was reported by 19%, 13%
and 4% of patients who received tranexamic acid, mefenamic acid or etamsylate
in a nonblind study, and 27%, 35% and 15% of patients rated their symptoms as
worse than those before treatment. Nonetheless, 77%, 74% and 33% of patients
expressed a desire to continue treatment at the end of the study. Tranexamic acid
had no significant effect on symptoms of dysmenorrhoea compared with baseline
or norethisterone in a double-blind study.

Tranexamic Acid: A Review 1421
The percentage of patients who discontinued treatment because of adverse
events while receiving tranexamic acid was 0–12% in six studies; in four of the
studies there were no discontinuations due to adverse events.
There were no thromboembolic events in patients with menorrhagia in clinical
studies. Furthermore, tranexamic acid has been widely used in Scandinavia as a
first-line treatment for menorrhagia since the early 1970s and there has been no
reported increase in the incidence of thromboembolic events.
Tranexamic acid is approved for the treatment of menorrhagia. Underlying Dosage and
Administration organic pathology as the cause of heavy menstrual bleeding (blood loss of >80mL
per cycle) should be ruled out before initiating treatment. The recommended
dosage differs from region to region. In Europe, however, the recommended oral
dosage for the treatment of patients with menorrhagia is 1–1.5g three to four times
daily for 3–4 days; the total daily oral dose should not exceed 4g, and treatment
should be initiated once heavy menstrual bleeding has started.
In the UK, tranexamic acid is contraindicated in patients with a history of
thromboembolic disease; in Japan and the rest of the EU, caution and supervision
is recommended in these patients. Active thromboembolic disease, however, is a
contraindication for tranexamic acid use in the EU, including the UK. The drug is
also contraindicated in most of the EU in patients with severe renal failure because
of the risk of accumulation. Dosage reductions are recommended in patients with
mild to moderate renal insufficiency.
