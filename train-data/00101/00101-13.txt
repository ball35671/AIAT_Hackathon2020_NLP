CONCLUSIONS: Oral DIM at 2 mg/kg/day is well tolerated with no significant toxicity. We observed a high rate of clinically significant improvement in confirmed CIN 2 or 3 lesions in this RCT. Current surgical
treatments may cause cervical stenosis, bleeding and preterm delivery with
approximately 10% recurring CIN. Medical therapy or observation may be
a reasonable alternative.

CAESAREAN SECTION AND TUBAL INFERTILITY: IS THERE AN
ASSOCIATION? L. Saraswat, M. Porter, S. Bhattacharya, S. Bhattacharya.
Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen, United Kingdom; Dugald Baird Centre for Research on Women’s
Health, University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen, United Kingdom.
OBJECTIVE: To explore the association between exposure to caesarean
section and subsequent tubal infertility.
DESIGN: A case control study.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cases for this study included all women
attending the Aberdeen Fertility Clinic between 1989 and 2005 with secondary infertility caused by tubal factor (presence of one or both blocked tubes
diagnosed by either hysterosalpingography or laparoscopy and dye test).
Women with history of previous tubal surgery or sterilization were excluded.
The cases were matched with controls from the Aberdeen Maternity and
Neonatal Databank by year of their first delivery. The controls included all
women who had one previous live-birth (index delivery) followed by another
and hence proven fertility. The incidence of caesarean section in the index
delivery was noted in both the cases and controls. The Statistical Package
for Social Scientists (SPSS version 14) for Windows was used to facilitate
data analysis. Cases and controls were first compared in terms of age,
smoking habits, history of appendectomy, ovarian surgery, PID, ectopic
pregnancy, miscarriage, termination and previous caesarean section by univariate analysis and crude Odds Ratios with 95% confidence intervals calculated. Normally distributed continuous variables were expressed as mean
with standard deviation and compared by independent samples t test. Categorical variables were compared using the Chi-square test. A probability
value of %0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistically significant variables on univariate analysis were entered into a binary logistic regression model to generate adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence
intervals.
RESULTS: A total of 220 women with secondary infertility due to a tubal
factor problem were compared with 18,376 fertile women (experienced a previous viable pregnancy followed by another live-birth during the same time
period when the infertile women were trying to conceive) in terms of exposure to caesarean section. After adjusting for confounding factors, there was
no difference in the incidence of exposure to caesarean section between the
two groups (adjusted odd’s ratio 1.27 (95% CI 0.90, 1.78) and P¼0.16).
However age (adjusted OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.2, 1.3), history of PID (adjusted
OR 17.3, 95% CI 10.9, 27.6) and previous ectopic pregnancy (adjusted OR
12.8, 95% CI 7.1, 23.1) were found to be predictive of future tubal infertility.
CONCLUSIONS: The risk of secondary infertility due to tubal disease is
not increased in women with previous caesarean section.

EXOGENOUS FOLLICLE STIMULATING HORMONE AND RISK
OF ANEUPLOIDY. L. K. Shahine, A. A. Milki, L. M. Westphal,
R. B. Lathi. Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility, Stanford University,
Palo Alto, CA.
OBJECTIVE: Exogenous FSH is frequently used in the treatment of infertility. High rates of aneuploidy are seen when preimplantation genetic diagnosis is performed after ovarian stimulation in all ages, however the etiology
is not clear. Animal studies have shown that exposure to exogenous FSH
leads to chromosome dysfunction in oocytes, thus providing a possible
link between elevated levels of FSH and increased risk of aneuploidy. We examine the rate of aneuploidy in missed abortions in relation to exposure to
exogenous FSH in the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle in which patients conceive.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with cytogenetic evaluation of
products of conception from a missed abortion at a University Infertility
practice from January 1999 through December 2006 were identified. Data
collected included patient age, obstetric history, method of conception, ovarian stimulation with FSH, and cytogenetic results from products of conception (POC). Rate of aneuploidy was compared between a control group of
patients with a history of infertility who conceived naturally and a study
group of patients with a history of infertility who conceived with FSH treatment, including intrauterine insemination (IUI) and in vitro fertilization
(IVF) cycles.
RESULTS: 219 patients met inclusion criteria. See Table 1 for results.
67% of all patients had an abnormal karyotype diagnosed on POC from
a missed abortion; the rate of aneuploidy was 78% in the control group
and 64% in the study group. This difference was not statistically significant
(P value >0.05). In the study group, 30 patients had an IUI with an average
age of 35.3 and a 57% aneuploidy rate, and 138 patients had an IVF cycle
with an average age of 37.6 and a 67% aneuploidy rate. Recurrent pregnancy
loss (RPL, 3 or more miscarriages) was seen in 9% of all patients, 24% in the
control group and 4% in the study group, however the rate of aneuploidy did
not change if these patients were excluded.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the incidence of abnormal results in the
cytogenetic analysis of POC was not higher in pregnancies conceived with
FSH stimulation compared to spontaneous conceptions in infertility patients.
This suggests that exogenous FSH exposure does not increase the risk of
aneuploidy. Further studies are still needed to examine this relationship.

A MULTICENTER, PROSPECTIVE, RANDOMIZED, OPEN COMPARATOR STUDY ON THE TREATMENT OF OVULATORY
MENORRHAGIA WITH TRANEXAMIC ACID AND NORETHISTERONE IN MAINLAND CHINA. Y. Zhang, F. He, S. Li, Z. Cao,
S. Lv, J. Lu. Obs/Gyn, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Beijing,
China; Obs/Gyn, Huaxi Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan,
China; Obs/Gyn, First Affiliated Hospital of Xi’an Communication University, Xi’an, Shanxi, China; Obs/Gyn, Beijing Chaoyang Hospital of Capital
Medical College, Beijing, China.
OBJECTIVE: To compare the safety and efficacy of tranexamic acid (TA)
and norethisterone (NET) for the treatment of ovulatory menorrhagia in
patients in mainland China.
DESIGN: Multicenter, prospective, randomized, open comparator study
of TA and NET in Chinese patients with ovulatory menorrhagia.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and six patients with
proven ovulatory menorrhagia from the gynecologic clinics of four teaching
hospitals located in three cities of mainland China were enrolled into the
study between July 2004 and March 2006. Patients were randomly allocated
into one of two therapeutic regimens: TA 1g tid during menstrual cycle day
(D) 1–5 (57 patients, aged 34.39  7.61 years), or NET 5 mg bid on D19–26
(49 patients, aged 36.41  6.60 years). The drugs were administered for two
consecutive cycles, after which the drugs were withdrawn and patients were
followed-up for one more cycle. Data on menstrual blood loss (estimated by
FERTILITY & STERILITY S17
pictorial blood assessment chart, PBAC), length of menstrual period, and a 6-
item health-related quality of life (QOL) questionnaire were collected in the
second week before, during each treatment cycle, follow-up cycle and were
compared.
RESULTS: Both treatments led to significant decreases in mean PBAC
scores, shorter durations of menstrual periods, and improved QOL rankings during both the first and second treatment cycles. The mean amplitude of PBAC decrement in the first cycle in the TA group was
significantly greater than that in the NET group (29.31% vs. 10.64%,
P¼0.011); however, the difference did not continue into the second treatment cycle (39.87% vs. 28.9%, P¼0.088). Improvement in four QOL
items during the first cycle in the TA group was also significantly greater
than that in the NET group (P¼0.0320.002). The incidence of adverse
effects between the two groups was similar (12.72% vs. 15.78%,
P¼0.530), and was mostly comprised of gastrointestinal symptoms. The
number of patients willing to continue the treatment in the second and follow-up cycles in the TA group, respectively, were significantly higher than
those in the corresponding cycles of the NET group (96.30% vs. 76.6%,
P¼0.003; 77.36% vs. 55.56%, P¼0.022, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: TA 3g daily during cycle D1–5 is a more effective and
tolerable treatment than NET on D19–26 in the first treatment cycle in
patients with ovulatory menorrhagia.

THE LEVEL OF SPERM VACUOLES IN THE FRESH POSTPROCESSED SPERM SAMPLE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTS IVF
CYCLE OUTCOMES. N. Bar-Chama, J. Schiff, M. Luna, B. Dann,
A. B. Copperman, J. Barritt. Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility,
Reproductive Medicine Associates of New York; Mount Sinai School of
Medicine, New York, NY.
OBJECTIVE: Impaired sperm morphology has been shown to correlate
with decreased fertilization in vitro. Numerous investigators have searched
for other diagnostic markers and assays to assess sperm competency. Recently, sperm vacuoles have been suggested as a prognostic factor in IVF
(1). We sought to determine whether the percentage of sperm with vacuoles
in the fresh post-processed sample was associated with IVF clinical outcomes.
DESIGN: Retrospective data analysis of fresh sperm samples and subsequent IVF outcomes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A series of 1295 IVF cycles using fresh
sperm samples from 11/2005- 03/2007 were included. Post-processed sperm
samples were analyzed for sperm morphology (Kruger method) by a trained
embryologist. The same samples were then used in the fresh IVF cycle. The
percentage of sperm with vacuoles was recorded and classified as 0%, 1–4%
and R5%. We investigated the correlation of vacuoles with fertilization, clinical pregnancy and loss rates. Chi-square and Student’s t-tests were used
where applicable.
RESULTS: Of the 1295 samples prepared for IVF, 1042 (80.5%) had no
vacuoles, 202 (15.6%) had 1–4% vacuoles, and 51 (3.9%) had R5% vacuoles. Results are included in table 1. The mean oocyte age, fertilization
and clinical pregnancy rates were not significantly different. Although the
pregnancy rate declined as the percentage of vacuoles increased, a significant
difference was not noted. A loss rate of 36.8% was found when the sperm
sample contained R5% vacuoles which was significantly higher than those
cases with <5% vacuoles (14.8%) (P<0.05).

CONCLUSIONS: Morphological analysis of the post-processed fresh
sperm used for IVF cycles may allow for a correlation to outcome. We
have described that the presence of vacuoles in R5% of the sperm used in
IVF cycles impaired later embryonic development and significantly increased pregnancy loss rate. The relationship between abnormal sperm parameters and IVF outcomes must continue to be refined, but our findings
demonstrate that a clinical pregnancy should not be the final outcome measure. Further investigation of the significance of sperm vacuoles is needed
to confirm this predictive parameter and elucidate the pathophysiology of
this observation. 1) Berkovitz, et al. Hum Reprod 2006.
