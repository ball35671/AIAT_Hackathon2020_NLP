ABSTRACT
Schizophrenia is a devastating psychiatric disorder. Clozapine has long been
the gold standard for treatment of patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia; however, some patients are only partially responsive to clozapine treatment. Augmentation of clozapine treatment might enhance its effectiveness in
partial responders, but only a few studies have investigated possible augmentation strategies. This study compared the effectiveness and tolerability of the
combination of amisulpride and clozapine with the combination of quetiapine
and clozapine in patients who were only partially responsive to clozapine
monotherapy. Fifty-six treatment-resistant patients who were partially responsive to clozapine were randomly assigned to receive amisulpride or quetiapine
along with an ongoing stable dose of clozapine. Fifty patients completed the
study. Patients were evaluated at baseline and at the first, third, sixth, and eighth
weeks. Efficacy measures consisted of the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS),
the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS), the Scale for the
Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS), and the Clinical Global Impression
(CGI) scale. Tolerability and adverse effects were assessed with the Udvalg for
Kliniske Undersogelser (UKU) Side Effect Rating Scale and the Simpson Angus
Scale (SAS). A substantial improvement occurred in both groups by the end of
the eighth week; however, the improvement associated with amisulpride was

significantly greater than that seen with quetiapine. This difference was noted as early as
the third week of follow-up in terms of CGI scores, and by the sixth week with regard to
BPRS, SANS, and SAPS scores. Both drugs were well tolerated, as measured by UKU and
SAS. Improvement favoring clozapine+amisulpride could be attributed to the selective
D2/D3 binding property of amisulpride, which had an additional effect in improving symptoms of schizophrenia. The authors concluded that amisulpride seems to be effective and
well tolerated for augmentation purposes in clozapine-resistant patients.

INTRODUCTION
Schizophrenia is a devastating psychiatric disorder. Its lifetime prevalence is known
to be 1% to 1.5%. Recurrent psychotic attacks may result in functional impairment and
a poor outcome. The aim of treatment, therefore, is to relieve these attacks and to prevent further attacks. This can only be achieved if patients take the prescribed medication, which should be effective and have tolerable adverse effects. Despite the
effectiveness of antipsychotic medications in the treatment of patients with schizophrenia, 30% to 50% of patients who receive adequate treatment with typical antipsychotic drugs have significant persistent symptoms.1-5 Of these treatment-resistant
individuals, 40% to 70% do respond to clozapine,6 but for the remaining patients,
treatment options are very limited. Thus, treatment-resistant psychosis is an important and difficult problem.
In many studies, criteria for treatment-resistant schizophrenia have included (1) resistant positive psychotic symptoms (at least 2 of 4 positive symptom items on the Brief
Psychiatric Rating Scale [BPRS] should be rated at >4 points; clinical severity of the
disorder should be at least moderate [>45 points on the 18-item BPRS; Clinical Global
Impression [CGI] score should be >4 points]), (2) poor social and occupational functioning over the past 5 y, and (3) inadequate response to at least 2 different treatment
options (lack of a ≥20% decrease in BPRS scores in spite of antipsychotic use for an
adequate time and at an appropriate dose).2,7,8
Clozapine has long been the gold standard in the treatment of schizophrenic
patients who are unresponsive to other psychopharmacologic treatment regimens.
It has a low affinity for dopamine D2, exhibits selective antagonism for 5-HT2, which
increases available dopamine, and demonstrates antagonism on adrenergic α1- and
muscarinic receptors; therefore, it decreases both positive and negative symptoms of
schizophrenia, thus improving patient quality of life.9 Good clinical improvement
has been attained by treatment-resistant patients who received clozapine. Yet, some
patients who are on clozapine treatment are only partially responsive. Augmentation
of clozapine treatment with another antipsychotic might offer improved effectiveness among partial responders.
For augmentation purposes, several clozapine adjunctive agents have been used
to enhance the antipsychotic efficacy of clozapine.10-12 Various antidepressants such
as fluoxetine and fluvoxamine,13,14 mood stabilizing agents like lithium,15 novel
anticonvulsants such as lamotrigine,16 and several other agents like glycine17 and
2

mazindol18 have been tried as clozapine adjuncts to address resistant positive, negative, or cognitive symptoms. For most of these compounds, evidence regarding
effectiveness has been derived from open-label trials and case studies; therefore,
the results are confounding.
Conventional or novel atypical antipsychotics are among the most commonly
used adjunctive agents. Augmentation with amisulpride in a controlled, randomized trial resulted in a 50% improvement in positive and negative symptoms among
clozapine partial responders within a few weeks.19 Risperidone has also been tried
for augmentation purposes, but the results have been controversial.20-22 Amisulpride,
which has a unique pharmacologic profile, is characterized by selective interaction
with dopamine D2/D3 receptors.23,24 Augmentation with amisulpride in an open,
nonrandomized study in 28 patients who were partially resistant to clozapine led to
substantial improvement in positive and negative symptoms without worsening of
the adverse effect burden.25 Other studies have shown the beneficial effects of
amisulpride and clozapine given in combination.26,27
To date, quetiapine, another atypical antipsychotic agent that is similar to clozapine in receptor profile but does not cause severe adverse effects, has not been studied
in clinical trials for augmentation purposes in clozapine-resistant patients. Its structural similarity to clozapine, however, warrants investigation of its potential augmentative action, at least in patients in whom clozapine cannot be titrated to
maximum doses because of its limiting adverse effects, including seizures and anticholinergic and cardiovascular adverse effects. To date, no study has compared the
efficacy of amisulpride with that of quetiapine when used as an adjunctive agent in
clozapine-resistant patients.
This study was conducted to compare the effectiveness and tolerability of the
combination of amisulpride and clozapine with the combination of quetiapine and
clozapine in patients who were only partially responsive to clozapine monotherapy.
METHODS
Patients
Inpatients and outpatients who continued to experience psychotic symptoms
despite adequate treatment with clozapine were eligible to participate in this trial.
Study participants were recruited from a large population of university hospital inpatients and outpatients from January 2004 to March 2005. Thorough records of psychiatric history and prior antipsychotic drug therapy for all patients were made available
to investigators. Inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) a DSM-IV (Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition)28 diagnosis of schizophrenia;
(2) age between 18 and 50 y; (3) partial response to at least a 12-wk trial of 400 to
600 mg/d of clozapine (partial response was defined as persistent psychotic symptoms, as evidenced by a total score >45 on the BPRS [on which each of 18 items is
scored from 1 to 7] or a rating of moderately ill [>4] on at least 2 of the 4 BPRS positive
symptom items [hallucinatory behavior, conceptual disorganization, unusual thought
content, and suspiciousness]); and (4) voluntary participation in the study with signed
informed consent.
Patients with comorbid substance abuse, organic mental disorders, epilepsy, mental retardation, and severe physical illness were excluded from the study.

Study Procedures
All patients who were partially responsive to clozapine treatment who were willing to participate in the study were assessed by the first author. Patients were studied by the second author for random assignment after inclusion criteria had been
met. To be included in the 8-wk follow-up study, patients had to have remained on a
stable dose of clozapine for at least 4 wk. Patients who were not on a stable clozapine dose for at least 4 wk were randomly assigned only after this period was completed. After completing 4 wk of stable clozapine treatment, patients were randomly
assigned by the second author to the clozapine and amisulpride group or the clozapine and quetiapine group. Drug follow-up was performed by the second author,
and all tests were administered by the first author. The first author, who was the rater,
remained blinded to the medication throughout the study. All patients were fully
informed about the benefits, risks, and potential adverse effects associated with participation in this study, and all signed an informed consent document. Patients
remained in their current living arrangements with no study-related modifications
made to their daily routines beyond regularly scheduled clinical rating sessions.
Patients were evaluated at baseline and at the first, third, sixth, and eighth weeks.
Baseline doses of clozapine were established by the second author and remained stable throughout the study. The final maximum doses to be titrated were 900 mg/d for
quetiapine and 600 mg/d for amisulpride at the end of the second week. Patients
judged by the second author to be unable to tolerate the dose escalation schedule
because of adverse effects (other than clinical symptoms of schizophrenia) were
maintained at their maximum tolerated dose for the remainder of the study.
Patient Assessments
Systematic evaluations of psychopathology and adverse events were completed
at baseline and at the first, third, sixth, and eighth weeks. Assessments were performed primarily by the first author—a senior research fellow who had been blinded to treatment assignment and was not directly involved in patient care.
Efficacy evaluations included (1) the BPRS29,30; (2) the Scale for the Assessment of
Negative Symptoms (SANS), which assessed negative symptoms of schizophrenia31;
(3) the Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS), which measured positive symptoms of schizophrenia31; and (4) the CGI.32 Tolerability and adverse effects
were assessed with the Udvalg for Kliniske Undersogelser (UKU) Side Effect Rating
Scale,33 a 52-item scale that measures adverse effects and tolerability related to psychotropic medication, and the Simpson Angus Scale (SAS),34 which measures movement disorders related to the use of psychotropic drugs. Results of a full biochemistry
test panel, a urinalysis, and hematologic studies were obtained before patients were
randomly assigned and again at the end of the study.
Statistical Analysis
The primary objective was to test the hypothesis of differential clinical efficacy
between the clozapine with amisulpride group and the clozapine with quetiapine
group. A priori planned comparisons used between-group repeated measures analysis of variance based on group (the 2 treatment groups) and time (first, third, sixth, and
eighth weeks) as main effects. Specific 2-group comparisons across time consisted of
4

BPRS total scores, SANS total scores, SAPS total scores, CGI improvement scores, SAS
scores, and UKU scores.
Within-group differences were computed with the use of paired sample t tests.
Between-group differences on baseline measures such as test scores and demographic variables were determined by independent sample t test or χ2 test, when
appropriate. All significance tests were performed, and 2-tailed probabilities with an
alpha level of .05 were used.
RESULTS
Fifty-six patients who were partially responsive to clozapine treatment entered the
trial and were randomly assigned in equal numbers to receive clozapine combined
with amisulpride or quetiapine. Six patients (5 from the clozapine+quetiapine group
and 1 from the clozapine+amisulpride group) discontinued the study protocol within
the first 2 wk. Reasons for discontinuation of combination treatment in the clozapine+
quetiapine group consisted of exacerbation of psychotic symptoms in 4 patients and
an unwillingness to continue treatment because of lack of efficacy in 1 patient. One
patient in the clozapine+amisulpride group was missed in follow-up after the second
week; therefore, this patient was also excluded from the analysis. A total of 50 patients
(23 from the clozapine+quetiapine group and 27 from the clozapine+amisulpride
group) who were able to complete the 8-wk follow-up were assessed for statistical
analysis. Background characteristics of patients in the 2 groups were similar (Table).

Demographic and Clinical Characteristics of Study Patients
Mean doses of the drugs added to clozapine were 437.03 mg/d (standard deviation [SD]=104.32) for amisulpride and 595.65 mg/d (SD=125.21) for quetiapine.
These doses are equivalent to 437.03 mg/d chlorpromazine for amisulpride and
446.73 mg/d chlorpromazine for quetiapine35; resultant test score values were similar in terms of chlorpromazine equivalent doses (t=0.357; df=48; P=.723).
A comparison of final test scores within groups with reference to baseline scores
yielded a significant reduction in BPRS (t=9.84; df=26; P=.0001), SAPS (t=7.694;
df=26; P=.0001), and SANS (t=7.214; df=26; P=.0001) scores and improvement in
CGI (t=9.603; df=26; P=.0001) scores by the end of the eighth week of follow-up in
the clozapine+amisulpride group. Adverse effects measured by the UKU (t=2.964;
df=26; P=.006) were significantly higher than baseline scores at the end of the eighth
week in the clozapine+amisulpride group; however, this significant increase in
adverse effects was not visible in SAS scores (t=1.586; df=26; P=.125) reported at the
end of the eighth week.
In the clozapine+quetiapine group, at the end of the eighth week, there were statistically significant reductions in BPRS (t=2.148; df=22; P=.043) and SANS (t=3.656;
df=22; P=.001) scores compared with baseline. In terms of SAPS scores, no change in
positive symptoms was seen by the end of the eighth week compared with baseline
scores (t=0.335; df=22; P=.741). Improvement as measured by CGI was statistically
significant at the end of the eighth week compared with baseline (t=2.554; df=22;
P=.018). No statistically significant difference in adverse effects was seen in UKU
(t=1.283; df=22; P=.213) and SAS (t=1.817; df=22; P=.083) scores at the end of the
eighth week compared with baseline.
A comparison of the reduction in BPRS, SANS, and SAPS scores between groups
favored the clozapine+amisulpride group. As seen in Figure 1, the reduction in BPRS
scores in the clozapine+amisulpride group was greater than that reported in the clozapine+quetiapine group (F=8.59; df=4; P<.001). This difference resulted from differences in measurements obtained during the sixth (t=2.157; P=.036) and eighth weeks
(t=3.046; P=.004).
The reduction in SAPS scores in the clozapine+amisulpride group was greater than
that observed in the clozapine+quetiapine group (F=7.79; df=4; P<.001) (Fig 2).
This difference resulted from differences in measures attained during the sixth
(t=2.032; P=.048) and eighth weeks (t=3.010; P=.004).
The reduction in SANS scores in the clozapine+amisulpride group was greater
than that noted in the clozapine+quetiapine group (F=4.74; df=4; P=.003) (Fig 3).
This difference resulted from differences in measures during the sixth (t=2.028;
P=.048) and eighth weeks (t=2.455; P=.018).
Improvement in CGI scores in the clozapine+amisulpride group was greater than
in the clozapine+quetiapine group (F=3.806; df=4; P=.01) (Fig 4). This difference
resulted from differences reported in measures taken during the third (t=3.213;
P=.002), sixth (t=3.958; P<.001), and eighth weeks (t=3.848; P<.001).
A comparison of total adverse effects between the 2 augmentation regimens measured by UKU (F=1.544; df=4; P=.206) and SAS (F=2.132; df=4; P=.092) revealed similar tolerability in the clozapine+amisulpride and clozapine+quetiapine groups.

DISCUSSION
The demographic and clinical characteristics of the 50 patients who were partially
responsive to clozapine reveal that the randomly constituted clozapine+amisulpride
and clozapine+quetiapine groups were homogenous in terms of baseline severity
scores, age, sex, duration of illness, and clozapine doses taken. The average clozapine
dose was 550 mg/d for the clozapine+amisulpride group and 536.95 mg/d for the
clozapine+quetiapine group. These doses of clozapine are similar to those used in
most augmentation studies in which clozapine was given.21,25 Chlorpromazine doses
were similar to those of the 2 adjuvant drugs, which reduced the confusion regarding
doses of adjuvant drugs.
There was a substantial improvement in both groups by the end of the eighth
week with regard to within-group changes in measures. Amisulpride, with its selective D2/D3 receptor binding property, has the potential to produce extrapyramidal
adverse effects, especially at higher doses. In the clozapine+amisulpride group, by
the end of the eighth week, total adverse effects measured by the UKU were greater
than baseline scores, but this increase in adverse effects was not related to emergence of extrapyramidal adverse effects because no significant change in SAS scores
was observed. Moreover, a between-group comparison of changes in scores revealed
similar tolerability and adverse effects with the 2 augmentation strategies. Also,
augmentation of clozapine with amisulpride did not result in a worsening of
adverse effects, although higher doses of amisulpride were used.25
The efficacy of clozapine augmented with amisulpride was superior to that of clozapine combined with quetiapine in this randomized, single-blind trial of 50 patients
with schizophrenia who were partially responsive to clozapine monotherapy.
The superior beneficial effects of clozapine+amisulpride treatment compared with the
clozapine+quetiapine combination were notable in mean BPRS, SANS, and SAPS total
scores; this outcome began during the sixth week and continued throughout the study.
In other words, amisulpride adjuvant to clozapine is an effective augmentation strategy that is superior to clozapine+quetiapine in improving both negative and positive
symptoms of schizophrenia. In addition, improvement as measured by CGI was
greater in the clozapine+amisulpride group than in the clozapine+quetiapine group.
This difference between the 2 augmentation groups began during the third week and
continued through the end of the study. Both augmentation strategies were well tolerated, as measured by UKU and SAS, and no differences between groups were
reported in terms of adverse effects and tolerability; however, 4 patients in the clozapine+quetiapine group discontinued combination treatment within the first 2 wk
because of worsening symptoms. These patients were excluded from the analysis
because they were unable to complete the study. The reason for the worsening symptoms is unknown and needs clarification. Although chance may be a factor in the exacerbation of symptoms noted in 4 patients in the clozapine+quetiapine group, beyond
its lesser efficacy, the reliability of the clozapine+quetiapine augmentation strategy is
questionable, unless and until it is proven otherwise.
Other important issues involve the causes of improvements observed.
Amisulpride selectively blocks dopamine D2 and dopamine D3 receptors and has
no affinity for any other known receptors. Clozapine and quetiapine share a similar
receptor binding profile with higher affinity for serotonin 5-HT2. Therefore,
the superior efficacy of amisulpride combined with clozapine may be attributed to
9
Advances in Therapy®
Volume 24 No. 1, January/February 2007
the complementary receptor profiles of the 2 drugs. The dopamine-specific, limbic
selective mode of action of amisulpride makes it a suitable and effective drug for
augmentation of clozapine in that the limited dopamine blockade achieved by clozapine is selectively enhanced by amisulpride. Augmentation with quetiapine, however, which has a receptor binding profile similar to that of clozapine, did not result
in improved symptoms of schizophrenia. Adjuvant quetiapine might be regarded
simply as an increase in the dose of clozapine. Some improvement was seen in the
clozapine+quetiapine group at the eighth week, compared with baseline (revealing
that some patients benefited from this augmentation), so this combination may be
used in patients for whom the dose of clozapine may not be titrated to higher doses
because of its adverse effects. The improvement seen in the quetiapine group, however, seems similar to that reported in the placebo group in placebocontrolled trials21; therefore, other factors, such as level of patient participation in the
study and the benefits of weekly clinic visits, may contribute to this improvement.
In addition, the time taken to respond to clozapine for some individuals was
reportedly as long as 2 y.3 Therefore, some late responders may not have been
included in this study. On the other hand, this improvement may have been an artifact of the fluctuating course of schizophrenia and the tendency of extreme observations to regress toward the mean over time.
To date, few trials, including randomized controlled trials and open-label studies,
have addressed the benefits of augmentation strategies in patients who were partially responsive to clozapine.21,25,36 To our knowledge, this is the first single-blind,
randomized trial of clozapine augmented with 2 different atypical antipsychotics.
Stern et al37 reviewed 13 published trials of antipsychotic augmentation and reported that the likelihood of a positive result occurring by chance was 63%. These
authors concluded that augmentation trials require 40 to 100 patients, depending on
the number and variability of outcome measures, effect size, and duration of followup (which ranges from 4 to 12 wk).
The study reported here had many strengths, including acceptable sample size,
an appropriate period of observation, and the use of efficacy measures that can be
used for comparison in future studies. Also, our finding of a significant treatment/time interaction suggests that studies based on a short (ie, 4-wk) period of
observation are likely to produce unreliable results.
The present study had some limitations, including the lack of a double-blind
design. Nevertheless, the findings reported here must be regarded as preliminary.
Although random assignment and single-blinding are important strengths of the
current study, definitive conclusions about the superior efficacy of clozapine combined with amisulpride over that of clozapine combined with quetiapine await
future investigation with larger sample sizes. The long-term effects of this combination remain unknown; therefore, although this treatment approach seems to be
effective and tolerable, it should be provided with caution.
The risks of antipsychotic polypharmacy have not been well studied, and information about long-term risks is particularly sparse. The short-term risks in this
study seem acceptable, however, and, considering the devastating nature of schizophrenia, augmentation strategies are essential for the treatment of patients who are
only partially responsive to clozapine. Future studies of antipsychotic combinations
should include long-term observation of patients for potential toxic effects, hemato10

logic effects, movement disorders, tardive dyskinesia, and pharmacodynamic interactions between drugs.
The observations reported here, although preliminary, suggest that augmentation
with amisulpride may benefit patients who are partially responsive or nonresponsive
to clozapine monotherapy. This study population represents both inpatients and those
who have recovered sufficiently to live in community settings, but it is not clear
whether the findings can be equally applied to both types of patients. Clozapine augmentation with amisulpride appears to be well tolerated and safe, at least over 8 wk
of treatment, and superior in efficacy to augmentation with quetiapine, but clinicians
should approach this augmentation strategy with caution because polypharmacy is
associated with potential risks that have not been systematically studied in prospective trials. Exacerbation of the symptoms of schizophrenia in the quetiapine group is
a complication of polypharmacy for which clarification is needed. Additional larger,
controlled trials must be completed before firm clinical recommendations can be made
about clozapine augmentation strategies.
