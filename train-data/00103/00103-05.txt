OBJECTIVE:To investigate the characteristics and regularity of adverse drug reaction(ADR) induced by olanzapine,and to provide reference for rational drug use in the clinic.METHODS:ADR induced by olanzapine reported by our center from Jan.2006 to Oct.2012 were investigated and analyzed retrospectively.RESULTS:The most common ADR induced by olanzapine were central and peripheral nervous system disorders(67 cases,32.21%),manifesting as extrapyramidal side effects,drowsiness,dizziness,etc.The second were liver and biliary system disorders(27 cases,12.98%),including abnormal liver function,elevated aminotransgerase,etc.There were 46 ADR cases within a week(24.34%),and 145 ADR cases within 2 months(76.72%).117 ADR cases occurred in olanzapine doses of 12.5-20 mg/day,accounting for 61.90%.After treatment,147 cases were recovered(77.78%),38 cases were cured(20.11%),and 4 cases had sequela.CONCLUSIONS:Although olanzapine is safer and more tolerable than antipsychotic drug,but olanzapine-induced ADR still need great attention and monitored.
