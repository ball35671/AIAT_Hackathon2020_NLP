Long-Term Effi cacy and Tolerability of Clozapine
Combined with Ziprasidone or Risperidone
were able to show superiority ofclozapine /
 risperidone augmentation over clozapine and
placebo on positive and negative symptoms in a
sample of altogether 40 patients over 12 weeks.
Freudenreich et al. [15] described an improvement of disorganized thinking in a 6-week trial
involving 24 outpatients. In contrast, Anil
Yağcioğlu et al. [5] performed a 6-week-trial with
30 patients partially responsive to clozapine and
found no amelioration of psychopathology, quality of life or cognition [3] in the risperidone-augmentation group. Finally, Honer et al. treated
groups of 34 patients over a period of eight weeks
and reported that the addition of risperidone did
not improve the symptoms in patients with
severe schizophrenia [20] .
 Ziprasidone has been added to clozapine in
attempts to reduce metabolic side eff ects [19, 25]
and to optimize antipsychotic effi cacy [39, 40] .
Recently, one head-to-head trial compared the
combination of clozapine with risperidone (CR)
versus ziprasidone (CZ) [45] . Both groups showed
comparable and favorable eff ects on psychotic
and aff ective symptoms, accompanied by
improved clinical and psychosocial functioning.

 Insuffi cient response to treatment often leads to
polypharmacy in schizophrenia [44] , in particular if clozapine, the atypical antipsychotic of
choice in treatment-resistant psychosis failed to
achieve complete remissions [23, 26] .
 The most common approaches involve olanzapine [42] and clozapine [9, 30, 43] . These strategies
rest upon the neurobiological strategy to specifi -
cally replenish the receptor interaction profi le,
for example, by means of a subsidiary dopamine
receptor interaction after add-on of sulpiride
 [32] , amisulpride [6, 27] or aripiprazole [10, 13] .
Aside from the dopaminergic system, the pharmacodynamic profi le of clozapine might be supplemented by serotonergic and noradrenergic
interactions, for instance, by adding risperidone
or ziprasidone.
 The combination of clozapine with risperidone is
in widespread clinical use, and several case
reports and open trials have reported on risks
and benefi ts of this approach [43] . Four randomized, placebo-controlled trials with confl icting results were performed without allowing
fi nal conclusions as detailed in a set of recent
meta-analyses [7, 11, 30, 35] . Josiassen et al. [22]

Abstract
▼
Introduction: Treatment resistance in schizophrenia often leads to add-on of atypical antipsychotics to clozapine.
Methods: In a randomized trial, we recently
obtained evidence for comparable effi cacy and
diff erential side eff ects of clozapine in combination with ziprasidone (CZ, N = 12) versus risperidone (CR, N = 12). Here, we present the open-label,
long-term evaluations of these patients after 26
and 52 weeks.
Results: Sustained improvements of psychopathology as assessed by PANSS (positive and
negative syndrome scale), SANS (scale for the
assessment of negative symptoms), and HAMD
(Hamilton depression scale) were documented
in both subsamples being treated according to
protocol, while dropouts reduced the study sample after 26 (CZ: reduced by − 4; CR: − 2) and 52
weeks (CZ: − 0; CR: − 5). We observed a slight
increase of akathisia in the CZ group whereas general clozapine-associated side eff ects improved.
Discussion: The combinations of clozapine with
ziprasidone or risperidone exhibit long-term effi -
cacy, but the level of evidence is limited. Further
head-to-head comparisons of atypical antipsychotics as add-on to clozapine are necessary.

marked prolactin increase in the CR group and a statistically signifi cant QTc elongation in the CZ group.
 Long-term observations turned out to be necessary to evaluate
benefi ts and risks of clozapine add-on strategies [30, 40, 41] . In
line with this suggestion, we performed follow-up investigations
after 26 and 52 weeks and assessed the eff ects on psychotic and
aff ective symptoms as well as psychosocial functioning over an
open treatment period of one year.
Patients and Methods

Patients
 This study has been approved by the ethical committee of the
University of Heidelberg (Code-number 0267. 1) and the protocol was registered at “ ClinicalTrials.gov ” (NCT 00224315) as a
randomized, open-label augmentation study with an acute
treatment period of 6 weeks [45] and two long-term follow-up
visits at weeks 26 and 52. The predefi ned criteria for inclusion
were: 1) Presence of schizophrenic or schizoaff ective psychosis
according to DSM IV. 2) Age between 18 and 70 years. 3) Ability
to give informed consent. 4) Oral contraception in women capable of conception in case of intercourse. 5) Documented treatment failures of at least two antipsychotic agents before being
switched to clozapine. 6) Treatment-resistant symptoms of psychosis under clozapine monotherapy with clinical signifi cance.
 We assumed incomplete effi cacy of clozapine monotherapy if a
treatment attempt with daily doses of ≥ 300 mg over a period
of ≥ 3 months with serum levels of ≥ 200 μ g / L had failed or, alternatively, in reaction to relevant and dose-limiting side eff ects of
clozapine. Treatment-resistant symptoms were refl ected by a
total score of ≥ 65 in the PANSS [24] , but the study sample had
signifi cantly longer periods of treatment and higher serum concentrations of clozapine as well as higher baseline PANSS scores
(see Results). Exclusion criteria – if not covered by inclusion criteria – were intolerability to risperidone or ziprasidone and substance abuse except for nicotine.
Study procedures
 After informed consent, the patients were randomized by the
biometrician B. K. who was not involved into any treatment decision using a random number generator (SAS). The physical and
psychopathological states including any adverse eff ects were
evaluated at preplanned long-term assessments, 26 and 52
weeks after inclusion. The raters (M. Z. and A. K.) attended regular training sessions of neuropsychological testing and psychometric rating scales as part of the general educational program
of the department. Antipsychotics were applied in an open manner; the doses were titrated according to clinical necessity and
clozapine was allowed to be tapered down to minimally suffi -
cient levels. Additional medication with benzodiazepines and
anticholinergic substances was allowed, but the de novo administration of antidepressants and mood stabilizers was precluded
by the study protocol. Any qualitative change of antipsychotic
combination treatments lead to exclusion from data analysis.
Patient assessments
 Effi cacy evaluations included the positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS, the scale for the assessment of negative
symptoms (SANS) [4] , the Hamilton depression scale (HAMD)
 [17] , the clinical global impression (CGI) [28] and the global
assessment of functioning (GAF) [12] . Movement disorders were
assessed by the extrapyramidal symptoms scale (EPS) [33] and
Hillside akathisia scale (HAS) [14] . Safety and tolerability evaluations included body weight, heart rate and blood pressure.
Clozapine side eff ects such as hypersalivation, sedation and
weight gain were evaluated on an observer-based visual analogous scale between 1 (no side eff ects) and 10 (severe and not
tolerable burden on the patient).
Statistical analysis
 Data analysis was performed using the software SPSS version 15
(statistical package for social studies). The data were analyzed
regarding normal distribution using histograms and the
 Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. All observations during treatment
according to protocol were included into the statistical analysis.
As a consequence, the number of measurements diff ers between
participants. For analysis of variance of the whole number of
observations at the respective time points, we applied a mixed
model ANOVA for testing hypotheses on group-diff erence, course
and the interaction between group and course. Within the mixed
model, the structure of covariance was specifi ed as AR (1) process.

after 26 weeks were 422.2 mg / day ( ± 128.4 mg) in CR (N = 9) and
307.1 mg / day ( ± 171.8 mg) in CZ (N = 7) and after 12 months
450 mg / day ( ± 168.3 mg) in CR (N = 4) and 325 mg ( ± 185.4 mg) in
CZ (N = 7). The dose-reduction of clozapine in CZ over the whole
treatment period turned out to be statistically signifi cant (CZ:
F = 4.085; p < 0.001). The mean doses of risperidone were
3.82 ± 1.8 mg / day at week 6, 4.0 ± 0.6 mg / day at week 26 and
2.75 ± 1.3 mg / day after 52 weeks. In CZ, the augmentation doses
had been 134 ± 34.4 mg / day at week 6 and decreased to
120 ± 65.3 mg / day after 26 and 52 weeks, respectively. With
regard to additional medication, at week 26 one CZ patient was
still receiving clonazepam, one in each group valproic acid at
constant doses, but no antidepressants were prescribed. At week
52, valproic acid was administered to only one patient in CZ.
Amongst the patients maintained on protocol, the clinical
improvements observed after 6 weeks of combined treatment
proved to be stable over time (within group analysis, primary
endpoint). Regarding a between-group comparison, the secondary endpoint of this investigation, there emerged no superiority
of one treatment regimen over the other. At week 26, a treatment response as defi ned by a PANSS reduction of 20 % was
achieved in 7 of 7 (CZ) or 8 of 9 (CR) patients; at week 52, 6 of 7
(CZ) or 4 of 4 (CR) patients were categorized as responders. In
detail, we observed a variety of signifi cant improvements in several rating scales (see ●▶ Figs. 1 – 3 and ●▶ Table 2 ). The analysis of
variance following a mixed-model paradigm revealed signifi cant
within-subjects changes in PANSS positive (CR: F = 3.695;
p = 0.001 / CZ: F = 3.009; p = 0.005), PANSS negative (CR: F = 4.979;
p < 0.001 / CZ: F = 4.813; p < 0.001), PANSS global psychopathology
(CR: F = 7.279; p < 0.001 / CZ: F = 2.880; p = 0.008) and PANSS total
scores (CR: F = 7.592; p < 0.001 / CZ: F = 4.298; p < 0.001)
(see ●▶ Fig. 1 ). Similarly, the SANS ( ●▶ Fig. 2a ) improved over
time without group-specifi c diff erences (CR: F = 2.566; p = 0.017 /
 CZ: F = 3.115; p = 0.005). As a further hint for aff ective improvements, both treatment groups showed a decrease of HAMD
( ●▶ Fig. 2b ) scores over time which reached statistical signifi -
cance in CR and the level of a trend in CZ (CR: F = 2.366; p = 0.026 /
 CZ: F = 1.987; p = 0.061). Further evidence for improved
psychopathology under both ziprasidone and risperidone augmentation is refl ected in changes of the GAF (CR: F = 12.274;
p < 0.001 / CZ: F = 15.706; p < 0.001) and CGI severity (CGI1: CR:
F = 13.554; p < 0.001 / CZ: F = 5.363; p = 0.001) and therapeutic
effi cacy scales (CGI 3.1: CR: F = 4.047; p = 0.005 / CZ: n.s.). The
general trend of good tolerability was kept up over the follow-up
period. Within the intra-individual long-term comparison of
changes in body weight and BMI, we did not observe signifi cant
diff erences: CR: mean changes of + 1.6 kg and + 0.6 kg / m 2 (26
weeks), + 2.2 kg and + 0.9 kg / m 2 (52 weeks): CZ: mean changes
of − 1.1 kg and − 0.3 kg / m 2 (26 weeks), − 1.7 kg and − 0.6 kg / m 2
(52 weeks). Heart rate and blood pressure were normal and
unchanged over time in both groups. Clozapine side eff ects (visual analogous scale 1 – 10) were kept stable at the reduced levels
of week 6: CR patients showed a value of 3.22 ± 1.6 (week 26)
and of 2.25 ± 1.3 (week 52), while the CZ group was averaged to
3.29 ± 2.0 (week 26) and 2.86 ± 1.8 (week 52). These reductions
from baseline were statistically signifi cant (CR: F = 4.524;
p < 0.001 / CZ: F = 4.103; p < 0.001). Low severity levels in the EPS
scale ( ●▶ Fig. 3b ) at baseline further decreased. Comparing
 endpoints of akathisia (HAS, ●▶ Fig. 3a ) between groups (CR:
0.89 after 26 weeks and 0.75 after 52 weeks; CZ: 1.29 after 26
weeks and 52 weeks) a trend of superior tolerability became
apparent (F = 2.871, p = 0.098). The side eff ects subscale of CGI
revealed improvements in both groups of at least the level of statistical trends (CGI 3.2: CR: F = 2.546; p = 0.075 / CZ: F = 3.615;
p = 0.024).

Discussion
▼
 The long-term follow-up of a randomized clozapine-combination study that involved patients with insuffi cient response to
clozapine monotherapy is reported. Initially, 24 patients had
received the atypical antipsychotics risperidone or ziprasidone
as add-on over a 6-week period and comparable, satisfying effi -
cacy of both treatment strategies was shown. After 26 and 52
weeks favorable treatment eff ects on psychotic symptoms, mood
and global parameters of clinical state and psychosocial functioning were found in the subsamples being treated according to
protocol. In addition, marked reductions of co-medication
became possible.
 Until now, four RCTs on the clozapine / risperidone combination
yielded inconsistent results [3, 5, 15, 20, 22] . The most important
factors that downsized their effi cacy may have been short observation periods, high and fi xed clozapine doses, low doses of augmenting substances and samples with highly severe and
chronically ill patients, altogether hampering the therapeutic
plasticity in these treatment settings. It cannot be excluded that
the artifi cial setting of placebo -controlled trials does not closely
enough resemble clinical conditions where treatment resistance
to clozapine leads to combination approaches. Therefore, a careful comparison of the results derived from our naturalistic trial
with the above-mentioned RCTs might be necessary.
 Several patients (see ●▶ Table 1 for details) dropped out or were
switched to alternative strategies, while these measures did not
lead to major improvements at follow-up visits. In perspective,
these multi-resistant patients might benefi t from innovative
treatment mechanisms [21] . It is timely to extend the therapeutic arsenal in schizophrenia beyond the borders of dopaminergic
and serotonergic neurotransmission and to address, for example, the glutamatergic system [29, 38] .
 The results of both the acute and long-term treatment documented
similar effi cacy and a diff erential pattern of side eff ects in both
treatment arms. This is widely in concert with previous comparisons of ziprasidone and risperidone in monotherapy [2, 16] , switch
studies between the two antipsychotics [18, 36, 37] as well as one
recent long-term comparison over a period of 44 weeks [1] .
 As for the mode of action on psychotic symptoms and mood, we
assume pharmacodynamic eff ects via receptors of several neurotransmitter systems. Besides a supplementary antidopaminergic blockade by both agents, ziprasidone functions as a
reuptake inhibitor of serotonin and noradrenaline (SSNRI) as
well as an agonist at 5-HT1A receptors [8, 31, 34] .
 This study is limited by its open design, lack of clinical drug
monitoring, the long inter-visit interval, the restriction to two
visits and the loss of statistical power due to dropouts. Therefore, the level of evidence has to be improved in forthcoming
studies. The chosen mode of statistical evaluation aimed at
including all observations of patients who were treated per protocol at the assessments. In contrast to an LOCF (last observation
carried forward) procedure, this strategy is more conservative,
avoids the extrapolation of the favorable eff ects observed at
week 6, incorporates the high dropout rate and by this means
allows a naturalistic description of populations and eff ects.
 In conclusion, the long-term evaluations of clozapine-resistant
patients in randomized augmentation with either ziprasidone
or risperidone provide evidence for similar effi cacy of both treatment arms. Further randomized head-to-head and placebo -
 controlled studies appear to be necessary and should involve a
suffi ciently long period of follow-up investigations.
