Background. Severe thromboembolic and hemorrhagic
complications after mechanical heart valve replacement
essentially depend on the intensity of oral anticoagulation and the fluctuation of individual international normalized ratio (INR) values.
Methods. After heart valve replacement with
Medtronic Hall, St. Jude Medical, and CarboMedics
implants, patients were randomly divided into two
groups, one controlling INR values at home, the other
being monitored by family practitioners.
Results. Almost 80% of the INR values recorded by
patients at home were within the stipulated therapeutic
range, INR 2.5 to 4.5, compared with just 62% of INR
values recorded by family practitioners. The overall
complication rate (hemorrhages and thromboembolic
events) of the self-management group was significantly
(p < 0.05) decreased compared with the conventional
group.
Conclusions. Through INR self-management, an improvement in the quality of ongoing oral anticoagulation
could be shown. Starting this form of therapeutic control
early after mechanical heart valve replacement appears to
effect a further reduction in anticoagulant-induced complications.

Although numerous mechanical and biologic heart
valves are now available after more than 30 years of
continual improvement in this field, none of them fulfills
all of the demands we make of an ideal replacement for
a destroyed human heart valve [1]. Biologic implants
show a lower thrombogeneity and therefore require no
long-term anticoagulation. Because of their structural
degeneration, however, their use is restricted to elderly
patients. During an 11-year follow-up it was possible to
show that biologic heart valve replacements involve a
40% higher explantation rate than mechanical heart valve
replacements [2]. Despite progress made in the field of
mechanical heart valves, thromboembolism is still a
frequent complication after heart valve replacement. The
risk of thromboembolism is reduced through treatment
with oral anticoagulants, and yet with the newer valves it
is still 1.5% in aortic position and 3% in mitral position [3,
4]. Hemorrhage rates vary in degree depending on the
quality of the anticoagulation, ranging from 4.2% to
15.4% per patient-year [3, 5–9].
Thromboembolism and anticoagulant-induced hemorrhage thus continue to account for 75% of all complications after mechanical heart valve replacement [3]. These
complications occur most frequently during the first 6
months after operation. The risk then becomes low
where it remains constant for years [8–10].
Risk levels in conjunction with ongoing anticoagulation therapy are considerably higher in cases in which
international normalized ratio (INR) values fluctuate
strongly. When anticoagulant-induced complications occur, as many as 60% of the coagulation values controlled
are not within the therapeutic range [11, 12].
Valid studies to find an appropriate anticoagulation
intensity, ie, an intensity that results in the lowest possible morbidity (thromboembolic and hemorrhagic complications), are not available to date. Current recommended therapies are therefore largely empirically
based. The previously available studies also omit inclusion of INR self-management and its goal of improved
therapy compliance (oral anticoagulation) as the basis for
stable anticoagulation intensity. This study investigates
the extent to which INR self-management after mechanical heart valve replacement affects improved anticoagulation stability. It also examines the extent to which
freshly operated on patients who are trained in INR
self-management just 6 to 11 days after operation are
able to effect a potential reduction in morbidity (thromboembolic and hemorrhagic complications).
Patients and Methods
Our so-called ESCAT study (Early Self-Controlled Anticoagulation Trial) was monocentric, randomized, and
prospective. It began on February 1, 1994, and closed in
October 1997, in line with the randomization, having
included 1,200 patients.
Of these 1,200 patients, data from the first 600 to

undergo a complete 2-year follow-up and survive were
evaluated. We excluded from our analysis patients who
died within the perioperative phase or immediate postoperative phase (n 5 37, Figs 1 and 2) or who dropped out
of the follow-up (n 5 90, Figs 3 and 4). We define
perioperative as during the operation and immediately
postoperative as within 30 days of operation. None of the
deaths was directly related to our investigation.
The 600 remaining patients (394 men [66%], 206 women
[34%]) had a mean age of 62.5 years, with a standard
deviation of 10.2 years. An aortic valve replacement had
been performed in 447 patients (74.5%), a mitral valve
replacement in 111 patients (18.5%), and a multiple valve
replacement in 42 patients (7%). This distribution of four
aortic to each mitral valve replacement reflects the normal distribution in Germany at the current time, as
reported by the German Society for Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery. Permanent postoperative atrial fibrillation was present in 153 of these patients (25.5%).
Food and Drug Administration–approved implants were
selected in varying distributions, including Medtronic
Hall (Medtronic Hall, Medtronic GmbH, Dusseldorf,
Germany), St. Jude Medical (St. Jude Medical GmbH,
Nu¨ rnberg, Germany), and CarboMedics (Sulzer Carbomedics GmbH, Hamburg, Germany) valves.
In accordance with the study protocol, 295 patients
were included in the so-called conventional group (group
A) and 305 patients in the INR self-management group
(group B). The patients in group B were trained in INR
self-management 6 to 11 days after operation. After
successful training, each of them received a coagulation
monitor, initially Biotrack from the Ciba Coming company, later to be renamed CoaguChek plus from the
Roche Diagnostics company (Roche Diagnostics GmbH,
Mannheim, Germany). Randomization was conducted in
accordance with the Masters Random list. The two
groups were comparable with regard to age, rhythm,
valve distribution, and risk factors (Fig 5). Every month
the study center received by post the INR values recorded in group A by family practitioners and the INR
values recorded in group B by the patients themselves.
Within the framework of the study, patients were also
asked to record any complications (thromboembolism,
hemorrhage) themselves, these records then being double-checked by the study center. All patients were required to visit the study center as outpatients for a
cardiologic check-up every 6 months, including coagulation controls. Each patient therefore underwent four
outpatient controls during the 2-year follow-up. All patients had been checked with the ultrasound system
Sonos 2500/5500 from Hewlett-Packard (Agilent Technologies, Bo¨ blingen, Germany).

Statistics
The statistical calculations were performed using SPSS
7.5 (SPSS GmbH Software, Munich, Germany) and represent our descriptive evaluations as of November 28,
1998. All results refer to the number of patients included
and not the number of documented coagulation controls
as this would distort the results considerably, the number
of results submitted varying considerably from patient to
patient. Variable independence was tested using Fisher’s
exact test.
Results
In all patients recruited for the ESCAT study since it
began in 1994, oral anticoagulation was monitored using
INR values. As shown in Figure 6, the observation period
ranged from 25 to 51 months (mean, 38.32 months). This
corresponds to an overall observation period of 1,916
patient-years (conventional group, 943 patient-years;
self-management group, 973 patient-years).
Accordingly, 18% of patients took part in the follow-up
for 25 to 30 months, 22% for 31 to 35 months, 22% for 36
to 40 months, 35% for 41 to 50 months, and 3% of patients
for more than 51 months.
In our study, an anticoagulation intensity of INR 2.5 to
4.5 was selected as generally acceptable, regardless of
prosthesis distribution. During the entire investigation
period, a total of 28,292 (23,693 self-management; 4,599
conventional) workable INR values were submitted to
our study center. The intensity distribution is shown in
Figure 7.
In group A, only 62% of recorded values were within
the stipulated range during the entire observation period, compared with 79% in group B. Few INR values in
either group were more than 4.5; the remaining values
outside the stipulated range were less than 2.5, with
group B achieving more favorable results than group A.
This course of anticoagulation intensity was achieved by
group B in just 4 weeks. Only 25 patients (8.3%) from
group B gave back their coagulometers (Coaguchek
plus), for varying reasons. This small group was discounted from the analysis.

Taken together for the entire observation period, grade
III hemorrhagic and thromboembolic complications
amounted to 74 events (Table 1). A statistically significant
difference (p 5 0.04) could be observed in favor of INR
self-management (Fig 8). A high proportion of the complications in both therapeutic groups were hemorrhagic.
The number of hemorrhagic complications was not significantly different between the two groups, the same as
the number of thromboembolic complications.
In line with the accumulated probability (Fig 9), more
than 98% of patients in group B are still free of grade III
anticoagulant-induced complications after an observation period of 24 months.
The therapeutic difference can be increased still further by taking into account the temporal sequence of
grade III anticoagulant-induced complications (Fig 10).
This figure clearly shows that anticoagulant-induced
complications are at their highest in the first 11 months
after, the start of anticoagulation after heart valve replacement. In the further course they then decrease
considerably. Just starting INR self-management early
was in itself sufficient to effect a convincing reduction in
anticoagulant-induced complications, especially during
the first year of therapy. After this period has elapsed,
there is no longer a significant difference between the
two forms of therapy.
Comment
This paper compares two different therapeutic approaches to determine the intensity of permanent oral
anticoagulation. Permanent oral anticaogulation after
mechanical heart valve replacement was indicated in
both groups. The stipulated therapeutic range was selected as INR 2.5 to 4.5. International normalized ratio
self-management led to a determination of values at
weekly intervals. This in turn led to a highly significant
improvement in the quality of the anticoagulation controls. Nearly 80% of the INR values submitted by the
self-management group were within the ideal therapeutic range, compared with just 62% of values submitted by
the practitioner-controlled group, a statistically significant difference of p less than 0.001. Our evaluation
therefore shows an impressive increase in the quality of
ongoing oral anticoagulation.
This improvement in the quality of ongoing anticoagulation was in itself sufficient to reduce the incidence of
severe thromboembolic and hemorrhagic complications
after mechanical heart valve replacement, with a statistical significance of p 5 0.04. The considerable benefit to
the patient was particularly noticeable in the first year of
therapy, confirming indications for starting INR selfmanagement early. Because of the relatively small

amount of emerging anticoagulation-related complications accorded grade III, we have not differentiated
between thromboembolic and hemorrhagic events. A
detailed and secure statement about this issue is anticipated with the final evaluation of the ESCAT I study.
Animal experiments and clinical trials have shown that
thrombi can occur intraoperatively, during the implantation of a valve replacement. Reasons for this are valvular
and mural endocardial lesions on the one hand, and the
polyethylene terephthalate fiber (Dacron) ring (DuPont
Company, Wilmington, DE), anchoring the valve replacement and sewn with it into the surrounding tissue,
on the other. Thrombocytes marked with indium-III are
able to show that thrombocytes can be deposited around
the valve ring as early as the first 24 hours after operation
[13, 14]. This is further confirmation of the advantages of
starting INR self-management early after mechanical
heart valve replacement.
The quality of the anticoagulation can be considerably increased through the introduction of INR
self-management. Our results show that INR selfmanagement should commence immediately after the
onset of anticoagulation therapy.
We thank all surgeons for their cooperation and also Mr. Otto
Wagner for his support with the data management and statistics.
