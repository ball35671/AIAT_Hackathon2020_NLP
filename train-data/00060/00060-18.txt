Background: Control of oral anticoagulant treatment has been
reported to be suboptimal, but previous studies suggest that patient self-management improves control.
Objective: To compare the quality of control and the clinical
outcomes of oral anticoagulant treatment in self-managed patients
versus patients following conventional management.
Design: Randomized, controlled trial.
Setting: University-affiliated hospital in Spain.
Patients: 737 patients with indications for anticoagulant treatment.
Intervention: The self-management group (n  368) received
simple instructions for using a portable coagulometer weekly and
self-adjusting treatment dose. The conventional management
group (n  369) received usual care in an anticoagulation clinic
(monthly measurement and control of international normalized
ratio [INR], managed by hematologists).
Measurements: Percentage of INR values within the target
range and major related complications.
Results: The median follow-up period was 11.8 months (range,
0.3 to 16.9 months). The unadjusted percentages of in-range INRs
were 58.6% in the self-management group and 55.6% in the
conventional management group (difference, 3.0 percentage
points [95% CI, 0.4 to 5.4 percentage points]). Twenty-seven
patients (7.3%) in the conventional management group and 8
(2.2%) in the self-management group had major complications
related to anticoagulant treatment. The unadjusted risk difference
for major complications between groups was 5.1 percentage
points (exact 95% CI, 1.7 to 8.5 percentage points). Fewer patients had minor hemorrhages in the self-management group
(14.9%) than in the conventional management group (36.4%).
Fifteen patients (4.1%) in the conventional management group
and 6 (1.6%) in the self-management group died (unadjusted risk
difference, 2.5 percentage points [exact 95% CI, 0.0 to 5.1 percentage points]).
Limitations: The trial was performed at only 1 center and was
not blinded. The dropout rate in the intervention group was 21%.
Conclusions: Compared with conventional management by an
anticoagulation clinic, self-management of oral anticoagulant treatment achieved a similar level of control. Of note, major complications and minor hemorrhages were less common in the selfmanagement group.

ndications for oral anticoagulant treatment to prevent
thromboembolic disease have increased in recent years
(1). Prothrombin times must be monitored frequently in
patients taking oral anticoagulants to determine the safest
dose and to minimize the risk for complications. The clinical management of oral anticoagulant treatment improved
greatly after the international normalized ratio (INR) was
introduced as a measurement of anticoagulation intensity
(1). The establishment of accurate therapeutic INR ranges
was also beneficial. Target ranges include the safest INR
values that carry the lowest risk for hemorrhagic or thromboembolic complications (2). Despite these improvements,
however, serious complications are still associated with oral
anticoagulant treatment (3, 4), and management by specialized staff at anticoagulation clinics seems to be safer
than other clinical strategies in terms of numbers of complications (5–7).
Currently, portable coagulometers are available for determining INR easily and reliably (8). This technology
provides interesting clinical models for the control of oral
anticoagulant treatment, the most promising of which are
patient self-testing and patient self-management. For patient self-testing, patients measure INRs themselves and
ask their referring physicians for the proper anticoagulant
dose. Patient self-management assumes that patients will
adjust their own doses and is the most autonomous strategy. Several published studies have compared these strategies with usual care (that is, monitoring of oral anticoagulant treatment by practitioners) (9 –13) or with specialized
anticoagulation clinics (14 –18). Although these studies
showed that both patient self-testing and patient self-management are feasible, their samples were relatively small (9,
11, 13, 14 –18) or included selected patients with mechanSee also:

ical valve prostheses (10) or patients older than 65 years of
age (12). In general, previous studies indicate that patient
self-management may be superior to management by general practitioners or anticoagulation clinics in quality of
INR control (10 –18). In addition, Ko¨rtke and Ko¨rfer (10),
Beyth and associates (12), and Sawicki (13) reported a
decrease in major complications among self-managed patients compared with patients managed by general practitioners. To date, no published data have suggested a better
clinical outcome (decrease in associated complications)
with patient self-management than with specialized management at an anticoagulation clinic (5, 19). We performed a randomized, controlled trial to directly compare
self-management of oral anticoagulant treatment, as evaluated in terms of efficacy and safety in unselected patients,
with management in an anticoagulation clinic.
METHODS
Study Design
The Alternative Control of Oral Anticoagulant Treatment (ACOA) trial is a single-center, centrally randomized,
controlled study that was performed at Hospital de la Santa
Creu i Sant Pau, Barcelona, Spain, from January 2001 to
July 2002. The hematologists who manage our anticoagulation clinic use a homogeneous dosing protocol and standard protocols to manage situations that increase clinical
risk. The clinical staff includes trained nurses. Computers
control the clinical data and INR records, ensuring excellent follow-up. Patients and their relatives receive basic education at the beginning of oral anticoagulant treatment,
including information on the main characteristics of oral
anticoagulants, potential risks, rationale for periodic monitoring, and drug interactions. Samsa and Matchar (20)
recommended that these characteristics be used to provide
an appropriate control group in a trial on patient selfmanagement. The institutional review board of our hospital approved the study.
Recruitment Phase
The recruitment phase began with computerized random selection of 1500 patients from the more than 5000
who were receiving oral anticoagulant treatment controlled
in our hospital. We included any ambulatory patient 18
years of age or older who had been receiving long-term
anticoagulant therapy for at least 3 months before entering
the study. We excluded patients who were younger than 18
years of age, who had a severe physical or mental illness
without a responsible caregiver, or who were of foreign
origin and were unable to understand Spanish.
Once the patient (or his or her caregiver) agreed to
participate, written informed consent was obtained. Next,
centralized telephone randomization assigned the patient
to the experimental group (patient self-management) or to
the control group (conventional management). The allocation sequence was generated at the hospital’s epidemiology
department, and the sequence of randomization was concealed until the patient was assigned to a group. To facilitate comparability between study groups, this randomization was stratified according to sex, age (70 years of age
or 70 years of age), and indication for oral anticoagulant
treatment (4 groups). Members of our anticoagulation
clinic enrolled participants and assigned them to groups.
Baseline data included demographic details, clinical information on associated risk factors, other medications,
previous length of anticoagulant therapy, bleeding or
thromboembolic complications during oral anticoagulant
treatment, and target INR range.
Follow-up for patients assigned to the conventional
management group was done immediately. Patients in the
self-management group received a training course first, and
follow-up was not performed until the nurse teaching the
course judged that the patients had acquired a minimum of
expertise in self-management.
Training Course
An educational program was designed to optimize the
number of patients able to understand and safely perform
self-management (Appendix, available at www.annals.org).
It was similar to the German program developed by Sawicki
(13) but was demographically adapted to the characteristics
of the Spanish population, considering differences in daily
schedules, diet, educational level, and other idiosyncratic
factors. The program consisted of 2 sessions of 2 hours
each on consecutive days. A specially trained nurse was
responsible for teaching the patients in small, organized
groups. The lessons included basic theoretical and practical
concepts involving the use of a coagulometer, interpretaContext
Although many outpatients require oral anticoagulation,
the optimal management of outpatient anticoagulation
remains uncertain. Studies have demonstrated the feasibility of patient self-management using portable coagulometers, but the studies that compared patient outcomes
with self-management and those with conventional management in an anticoagulation clinic did not find a better
outcome with self-management.
Contribution
In this randomized, controlled trial of 737 patients, patients assigned to self-management of anticoagulation
achieved a similar level of control and had fewer adverse
events than patients assigned to conventional management.
Implications
Health care providers should begin to implement patient
self-management of oral anticoagulation with portable
coagulometers in mainstream practice.

tion of INR, and adjustment of dose. The concepts of
target range and dose modification were emphasized when
necessary. A simple card system was designed to help the
patient select the correct dose. For each target range, a
specific card was provided. Patients were taught to use the
portable coagulometer CoaguChek S (Roche Diagnostics,
Mannheim, Germany) with the appropriate reagent strips.
Follow-up Phase
Normally, the patients in the conventional management group visited our hospital every 4 weeks to check
their INRs. When the INR result was out of target range,
our dosing protocol indicated that we should advance the
next appointment for INR testing to 1 or 2 weeks. International normalized ratio was determined by means of a
standard KC 10 coagulometer (Amelung, Lemgo, Germany). As a thromboplastin, we used Thromborel S (Behring, Marburg, Germany). A hematologist experienced in
oral anticoagulation management adjusted the dose and
made the appointment for the next INR test. Patients in
the self-management group performed the INR tests at
home once per week using the CoaguChek S kit. They
determined the appropriate dose of oral anticoagulant and
the time of the next INR test. All of the INR results in
both groups were entered into a computer (in the central
system of our anticoagulation clinic or in the portable coagulometers) to facilitate data management.
Patients in both groups were interviewed monthly by
telephone to record any complications or changes in their
health status. For the conventional management group,
these interviews were done approximately midway between
hospital visits. The questions addressed minor or major
bleeding, thromboembolic events, episodic diseases, changes
in long-term medications, and hospital stays. Associated
complications were diagnosed and evaluated by a third
physician who was not involved in the trial and was unaware of patients’ study group. Standard criteria were used
to diagnose any thromboembolic complications. Transient
ischemic attack was diagnosed clinically by a neurologist,
and superficial thrombophlebitis was diagnosed clinically

by an angiologist. To diagnose stroke, arterial embolism,
venous thromboembolism, pulmonary embolism, or valve
thrombosis, we used widely accepted methods (computed
tomography or magnetic nuclear resonance imaging, angiography, surgical diagnosis, Doppler ultrasonography,
phlebography, lung angiography or ventilation–perfusion
lung scanning, cardiac ultrasonography, or fluoroscopy).
All thromboembolic complications were considered major
events. Life-threatening bleeding or bleeding requiring transfusion or hospital admission was considered a major event.
Any other bleeding was considered a minor event.
Statistical Analysis
Study outcomes were evaluated on an intention-totreat basis and also on an on-treatment basis. The primary
outcome with respect to efficacy was the individual percentage of INR values within the target range. Also, related
to efficacy, we evaluated the individual percentage of time
within target range, calculated by a linear interpolation
(21). A Student t-test was used to compare these 2 variables
in the 2 groups. The mean distance of individual INRs to
the central point of target range was used as a measure of
dispersion of INR values. Since these mean distances were
not normally distributed, a Mann–Whitney test was used
to compare the 2 treatment groups.
The secondary outcome, related to safety, was the
occurrence of major thromboembolic and hemorrhagic
complications. Occurrence of minor bleeding was also
evaluated. We computed unadjusted risk differences for
complications and death. There were no clinically relevant
differences in baseline characteristics between the 2 groups.
Because of this and because of insufficient outcome events,
we did not provide adjusted risk differences. Statistical
comparisons included 95% CIs, and a P value less than
0.05 was considered statistically significant. We used SPSS
software, version 11.5, for all analyses (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, Illinois). In addition, exact 95% CIs for the risk differences between groups were calculated by using StatXact
for Windows, version 6 (Cytel Software Corp., Cambridge,
Massachusetts). A minimum of 250 patients was required
in each comparison group; from data from previous publications (10, 11, 13–17), we expected a difference of 10%
among in-range INR tests (  0.05;   0.10).
Role of the Funding Sources
The funding source, Roche Diagnostic S.L., had no
role in the design or conduct of this study or in the decision to submit the manuscript for publication.
RESULTS
The Figure shows the flow of patients through the
study. The recruitment phase lasted 8 months. After we
interviewed the first consecutive 1233 of 1500 randomly
preselected patients, 737 (60%) agreed to participate and
signed the informed consent form. All 737 patients were
treated with acenocoumarol. Of the 1233 consecutive patients, 496 were not included because they declined to
participate (n  461) or did not meet the inclusion criteria
(n  35). Using stratified randomization, we assigned 369
patients to the conventional management group and 368
to the patient self-management group. Table 1 shows the
baseline characteristics of both groups.
In the intention-to-treat analysis, no statistically significant differences were observed in the distribution of the
baseline variables (in addition, the size of the observed differences was not clinically relevant), except that a higher
proportion of patients in the self-management group
(13.5% vs. 7.9%) had had thromboembolic events during
previous anticoagulant treatment. Theoretically, this difference implies a higher risk for complications in the selfmanagement group. For the on-treatment analysis, the selfmanagement group was also slightly younger and had a
higher proportion of patients within the INR target range
of 2.5 to 3.5.
Between randomization and the beginning of training,
58 of 368 patients in the self-management group (16%)
declined to participate, most because they lacked selfconfidence. Nine of 369 patients in the conventional management group (2.4%) withdrew after randomization. We
trained 310 patients in the self-management group. It took
approximately 4 hours for patients to learn to evaluate
themselves reliably; some older patients needed 5 to 6
hours. Only 10 patients (3%; mean age, 70 years) could
not pass the course and returned to conventional management. In the intention-to-treat analyses, these 10 patients
were considered part of the self-management group. Thirtynine of the patients trained (13%) required some help
from a relative or caregiver to perform self-management
reliably; the mean age of these nonindependent patients
was 71 years.
The observation period ranged from 0.3 to 16.9
months (median, 11.8 months). The results of the intention-to-treat analysis of efficacy are shown in Table 2. The
mean percentage of INR determinations within the individual target range was higher in the patient self-management group than in the conventional group (58.6% vs.
55.6%; difference, 3.0 percentage points [95% CI, 0.4 to
5.4 percentage points]). The time within target range and
the INR distance were not statistically different in the 2
treatment groups. Table 2 also shows the comparison between groups separately according to the 3 intended target
ranges. The worst outcomes in the 3 efficacy measures occurred in patients whose target INR range was 3.0 to 4.5.
There was no relationship between the percentage of INR
tests within target range and age, educational level, or indication for oral anticoagulant treatment. In addition,
these variables were not associated with the time within
target range (data not shown).
Table 3 shows the numbers and risk differences for
each type of complication. All of the results were unadjusted because the number of outcome events was low.

causes of death. When the 37 severe complications described in Table 4 were diagnosed, the INRs were within
target range in most patients and no differences between
groups were observed (data not shown). In the conventional management group, 27 patients had major complications (20 thromboembolic events and 7 hemorrhagic
events). One hundred thirty-four patients reported minor
hemorrhagic events. Fifteen patients died during the study,
and 3 of the deaths were directly associated with anticoagulant therapy. In the self-management group, 8 patients had

major complications (4 thromboembolic, 4 hemorrhagic)
and 55 reported minor hemorrhages. Six patients died, but
none of the deaths were related to anticoagulant therapy.
According to the intention-to-treat analysis of risks,
patient self-management appeared protective in comparison with conventional management for all types of complications. The major complication rate was 7.3% in the
conventional management group and 2.2% in the selfmanagement group (risk difference, 5.1 percentage points
[exact 95% CI, 1.7 to 8.5 percentage points]). When analyzed separately, the rate of severe hemorrhage was 1.9 in
the conventional management group and 1.1 in the selfmanagement group (risk difference, 0.8 percentage point
[exact 95% CI, 1.1 to 2.9 percentage points]). The selfmanagement group had lower rates of minor hemorrhages
(14.9% vs. 36.4%) and deaths (1.6% vs. 4.1%).
DISCUSSION
In this study, patient self-management of oral anticoagulant treatment was essentially similar to management by
a specialized anticoagulation clinic when measured by the
quality of INR control. However, self-management was
superior in terms of reduction of total major complications. To date, none of the published randomized, controlled trials comparing clinical outcomes of oral anticoagulant treatment in these 2 settings has reported such a
difference (14 –17). However, all of these clinical trials inTable 2. Bivariate Analysis of Efficacy*

volved smaller samples (50 patients per group), much
younger patients (average age between 42 and 54 years),
and shorter follow-up periods (19). The incidence of clinical complications is of major interest in the investigation
of clinical progress attributable to patient self-management, while the time within target range and the proportion of in-range tests are intermediate outcomes that may
be more or less highly correlated with these incidence rates
(20).
Our unselected sample of patients was older than
those in most previous studies (10, 11, 13–18). Major
complications occurred in fewer patients in the self-management group (2.2%) than in patients managed conventionally (7.3%). Classically, the factors influencing risk for
adverse events are the intensity of anticoagulation, age, indication for anticoagulation, and history of thromboembolism or bleeding (22). These factors did not explain the
difference we observed because both study groups had similar distribution (Table 1). However, any other potential
confounder not included in the statistical analyses could be
responsible for the observed differences, although this possibility is difficult to evaluate.
A direct comparison among different studies is not
possible. However, the occurrence of major complications
in our conventional management group was of the order of
magnitude reported by other authors in patients managed
by anticoagulation clinics (4.9% to 15.7% of patient-years)
(3, 4, 6, 23). On the other hand, a German research team
with long-term experience in patient self-management recently reported a rate of severe complications lower than
1% of patient-years in patients with mechanical heart
valves, using the same INR target ranges as in our study
(24). Another experienced team obtained results close to
ours after 5-year follow-up of a self-management group
that was included in a previous randomized trial (13). Sixtytwo percent of their INR values were in range, and the
occurrence of major complications was 1.7% of patientyears (25). These results (24, 25) compare well with ours
(major complications in 2.2% of patients) and support the
idea that patient self-management is clearly safer than conventional management.
In the patient self-management group, our dropout
rate was 21% (Figure). Fifty-eight patients declined to participate a short time after signing the consent form but
before participating in training; 10 patients could not pass
the examination and never began self-management; and
another 11 patients withdrew after they began self-management. This relatively high dropout rate is common in patients assigned to self-management and has ranged from
17% to 33% in previous studies (9, 11, 14, 26). In the
trials by Sawicki (13) and by Gadisseur and associates (17),
which had lower dropout rates (approximately 10%), the
patients were 10 years younger than our patients.
In our intention-to-treat analysis, the percentage of
in-range INR values was slightly higher in the self-management group than in the conventional management group
(58.6% vs. 55.6%; P  0.02). However, when the efficacy
was evaluated in terms of time within target range, the
difference was in the opposite direction, although it was
not statistically significant (64.3% vs. 64.9%). This apparent contradiction may be due to the greater number of
INR measurements in the self-management group. In any
case, it is important to realize that, from a clinical and
practical point of view, both groups obtained similar levels
of efficacy in INR testing.
Several previous studies that compared self-management
with management in anticoagulation clinics (Table 5) reported that self-management was superior in the percentage of
INR tests (14 –17) or percentage of time within target
range (17), although the differences were mostly modest (10%) (14, 15, 17). It has been argued that the improvement in these variables can be explained by the higher freTable 4. Associated Major Complications and Causes of

quency of testing in the self-management group (27). This
improvement in the proportion of tests or amount of time
within target range could lead to a decrease in the incidence of
complications. Such a decrease has been reported in 2 previous randomized, controlled trials that compared patient selfmanagement (10) or patient self-testing (12) with care by general practitioners. Ko¨rtke and Ko¨rfer (10) found a
complication incidence of 4.7% of patient-years in a control
group and 2.9% of patient-years in a group of self-managed
patients, along with an improvement in percentage of inrange INRs (61% vs. 78%).
Beyth and associates (12) studied a very old sample
(mean age, 75 years) and reported complication incidence
rates of 25% of patient-years and 14.7% of patient-years in
the control group and in the self-testing group, respectively. These results coincided with an improvement in time
within target range in the intervention group versus the
control group (56% vs. 33%). What is surprising in Beyth
and associates’ results is that both comparison groups
tested INR with the same frequency (monthly). These results and ours cast doubt on the simple explanation of the
correlation among test frequency, improvement in control
of INR, and decrease in major complications. We obtained
a better clinical outcome without improving INR control,
and Beyth and associates improved outcome without increasing test frequency. When used in an older sample
(closer to that seen in clinical practice), patient self-management was equivalent or slightly superior (a difference of
3% in the number of in-range test results) to management
by specialized physicians in our anticoagulation clinic, despite performance of 4 times more INR tests per patient
(weekly vs. monthly). Surprisingly, in terms of clinical outcomes, patient self-management achieved better results
than conventional management, reducing the risk for major complications by approximately 70% and exhibiting a
trend toward reduced mortality. Our results call into serious question the usefulness of evaluating the safety of oral
anticoagulation by using percentage of in-range INR tests
or time within target range. The decrease in the risk for
complications may be explained by the empowerment of
the patient (8, 28), the impact of the self-management
strategy on adherence, and the improvement on self-awareness of health status when patients are responsible for making clinical decisions themselves (29 –31).
We estimate that a minimum of 50% of our population could safely use patient self-management to control
anticoagulant therapy. This conclusion is based on the results of our recruitment (737 of 1233 patients agreed to
participate) and the success of the training (300 of 368
patients learned to monitor themselves adequately). Relatively simple teaching programs are clearly useful in achieving good results. It must be emphasized that approximately
90% of the patients who participated in this study were
not highly educated (that is, had only a primary-school
education or were illiterate).
One weakness of our study is that it was an unblinded
single-center trial. Also, it can be argued that the conventional management group did not receive training on selfmanagement of oral anticoagulant therapy. However, our
purpose was to compare patient self-management with the
real-life situation in Spanish anticoagulation clinics, where
patients taking oral anticoagulant therapy do not receive

special training. Another potential limitation of our study
is the relatively high dropout rate in the patient self-management group.
Our study also had several strengths. It was centrally
randomized and controlled, and the sample of recruited
patients was unselected and was larger than samples in
previous trials on the same topic. We studied patients with
a mean age of 66 years who had heterogeneous indications
for anticoagulant therapy. Our follow-up period was twice
as long as that of previous comparable trials, and our data
were analyzed by using both intention-to-treat and ontreatment approaches.
In conclusion, patient self-management of oral anticoagulant treatment decreased the incidence of major complications in comparison with conventional management
performed by physicians specialists. Many patients are candidates for self-management, since old age and low educational level do not seem to be major obstacles. Ideally,
self-management with the specialized support of an anticoagulation clinic should be used to manage oral anticoagulation for as many patients as possible. In Spain, the portable coagulometer we used in our study costs 730 euros
($947 U.S.) and each reagent strip costs 3.6 euros ($4.67
U.S.). Previous studies addressing important issues associated with patient self-management, such as quality of life
(32) and cost-effectiveness (33), have yielded promising results. Nevertheless, further studies are warranted.

APPENDIX 1: OBJECTIVES AND GENERAL
CHARACTERISTICS OF THE TRAINING COURSE FOR
PATIENT SELF-MANAGEMENT
Primary Objectives
The primary objectives of the training course were to teach
patients receiving oral anticoagulation, responsible relatives, or
both how to use portable coagulometers, how to interpret results
of INR tests, and how to self-adjust doses of oral anticoagulants.
Secondary Objectives
The secondary objectives of the training course were to give
the patients basic information on blood coagulation, anticoagulant drugs, drugs that interact with oral anticoagulants, and indications for anticoagulation, as well as information on how to
recognize and treat associated complications (bleeding or thrombosis). Also, patients were taught the factors that are most likely
to change the effect of oral anticoagulants, such as other drugs,
foods, and alcoholic drinks.
This course was designed within the context of the ACOA
clinical trial. It must be applied to patients who are randomly
assigned to a self-management program. The program must be
understandable and executable by any regular patient who is receiving long-term treatment and is not mentally or physically
disabled, independent of age and educational level. It is based on
the German model but was adapted to correspond to Spanish
behavioral characteristics (13, 34–36). The didactic tools used in
the course were created by the investigators and are not commercially available.
Organization of Sessions
Sessions were held at a hospital and were taught by a trained
nurse. Patients were divided into small groups of 5 to 8 and had
the option of being accompanied by a relative. Two sessions were
held on 2 consecutive days. Each session was intended to last for
2 to 3 hours (total time for the regular course, 4 to 6 hours). An
optional extra session was held 7 days later.
After the course, the patient began self-management with a
short trial period (2 to 3 weeks), during which he or she could
consult with a health professional over the telephone. At the end
of this period, the nurse evaluated patients’ progress and examined them to approve the beginning of clinical follow-up in the
trial.
Didactic Tools
The following tools were used during the course.
1. The last regular INR control sheet. This was given to
patients after each INR measurement in our anticoagulation
clinic. The sheet included such information as name, diagnosis,
intended INR target range, last 10 INR tests with dates and doses
of oral anticoagulant, current INR result, dosage until next appointment, and date for next appointment.
2. CoaguChek S kit (coagulometer, fingerstick, reactive
strips).
3. Sanitary material for finger puncture (antiseptic, cotton
wool, bandage).
4. Diary for self-management of oral anticoagulant treatment.
5. Folder with exercises to practice management of doses.
6. Pens or pencils.
7. Posters with schemes on blood coagulation.
8. Screen and projector for transparencies.
9. Blackboard and chalk.
Session 1
Session 1 lasted approximately 2 hours. The main objectives
of this session were to teach self-testing of INR control and impart the basic principles of coagulation and oral anticoagulants.
During the introduction, the relationship of the program to the
clinical trial and the objectives of the clinical trial were summarized. The nurse clearly described the main objectives of the
training course, summarized the topics and the course structure
(using transparencies), and explained the basic concepts of blood
coagulation (using posters and transparencies). The basic concepts were as follows: function of coagulation; physiologic utility;
abnormal (excessive) clot formation; diseases caused by excessive
clot formation; drugs used to treat these diseases (oral anticoagulants and heparins); coagulation factors, vitamin K–dependent
factors, and anti–vitamin K drugs; and risk for overdosing on
anticoagulants (bleeding episodes).
Traditional control of oral anticoagulant treatment and the
new strategy, patient self-management, were compared. The
nurse described the potential advantages of patient self-management: increased frequency of testing at home, increased accuracy
of control, possible decreased risk for bleeding and thrombosis,
increased quality of life, and reduced work burden at the anticoagulation clinics.
The nurse then described the content of the CoaguChek kit.
The patients were shown how to use the fingerstick and were told
about the coagulometer and its management. The nurse provided
a step-by-step description of the self-testing procedure (Appendix
2) by using transparencies and demonstration. Patients were
given practical advice on how to obtain a good drop of blood (for
example, clean and dry hands, warm skin). Each patient repeated
the procedure using a kit, and the nurse checked each patient’s
performance. The INR result was noted in each patient’s diary
(Appendix 3, Appendix Tables 1 and 2). To conclude the session, the patients were given more information about the theory
of the process, such as the concept of INR (Appendix 4), the
definition of the target range, and the way different diseases can
imply different target ranges.
Session 2
Session 2 also lasted approximately 2 hours. The main objectives of this session were to teach patients how to adjust doses
after obtaining an INR result and to stress the importance of the
diary. After a review of the first session, patients repeated the
step-by-step self-testing procedure and used cards to obtain the
correct dose (Appendix 4, Appendix Tables 3 and 4). Each patient was given specific cards depending on his or her target range
and his or her current doses. Next, the nurse presented examples
of theoretical cases and determined different doses as required by
different situations (Appendix 5).
Patients were then given individual examinations on adjustment of doses. Each patient had to adjust his or her dose for
Annals of Internal Medicine
www.annals.org 4 January 2005 Annals of Internal Medicine Volume 142 • Number 1 W-1
different INR results (within target, above target, and below target). The patients who passed this examination (no mistakes in
any proposed INR) received a CoaguChek kit and a card with a
study contact telephone number. Patients started the probe period during the next few weeks, before the final examination.
During this time, they performed an INR test weekly and adjusted doses according to the dosing cards. Support was available
by telephone if necessary. The questions the patients asked
helped the researchers to evaluate the degree of learning for each
patient and to decide whether he or she needed a third training
session.
Patients who made at least 1 mistake or had difficulty managing the coagulometer received a third training session. Those
who still had difficulties after the third training session were
invited to bring a companion. The companion also learned the
self-management technique, took an examination, and signed a
document assuming the responsibility of the testing and dosing
for the patient. If the patient could not bring a companion, he or
she was declared incapable of self-management and was excluded
from the program.
Final Examination
For the final examination, an interview with the training
nurse was scheduled. Each patient came to the unit with his or
her CoaguChek kit and diary. The training nurse used 4 criteria
to approve the patients’ inclusion in the trial follow-up.
1. Accurate diary records during the probe period.
2. Satisfactory performance of self-testing procedure.
3. Correct diary recording of INR result, doses, and time for
next test.
4. Correct answer to question about hypothetical INR
results.
APPENDIX 2: SELF-TESTING PROCEDURE
A CoaguChek coagulometer with power adapter and batteries, reactive strips (CoaguChek PT test), and fingerstick and lancets (Softclix II, Roche Diagnostics) were needed for the selftesting procedure. The batteries allowed for approximately 60
measurements. The coagulometer turned off automatically in 4
minutes if not used. Each box of reactive strips had a coding chip

that functioned only for the strips from that box. This coding
chip had to be placed in the coagulometer each time a new box of
reactive strips was started. The coding chip had to be placed
while the coagulometer was turned off.
The steps for self-testing were as follows.
1. Turn on the coagulometer.
2. Wait for the appearance of the icon “INSERT STRIP” on
the screen.
3. Open the strip blister and save for discarding the used
strip.
4. Insert the reactive strip completely in the coagulometer
following the direction of the arrow.
5. On the screen, the icon “PLEASE WAIT” will appear
until the strip reaches the adequate temperature for the reaction.
6. Then, the icon “APPLY THE SAMPLE” will appear on
the screen.
7. Puncture the finger with Softclix II and obtain an adequate drop of blood.
8. You will have 90 seconds to apply the blood drop to the
appropriate zone.
9. The coagulometer will start the measurement automatically. The icon “PERFORMING TEST” will appear on the
screen.
10. You must record the INR result in your diary.
Note: If the blood drop is too small or is not well placed on
the reactive strip, or if too much time elapses before applying the
blood sample, an “ERROR” icon will appear on the screen. In
this case, the complete procedure must be repeated from the
beginning. The second blood sample must be obtained from a
different finger.

page gave the hospital name and a contact telephone number.
The last page contained the number of the clinical record, the
kind of oral anticoagulant used (warfarin or acenocoumarol), the
individual target range, the date on which long-term oral anticoagulation was started, and diagnostic information.
The diary also included a table (Appendix Table 1) to
record 1 year of follow-up (12 sheets, with 4 weeks per sheet). A
sample diary can be seen in Appendix Table 2.
APPENDIX 4: ADJUSTMENT OF DOSES AND
INSTRUCTIONS TO PATIENTS
What Is the INR?
It is a measure of your anticoagulation level. This measurement is accepted internationally and allows comparison of results
among different laboratories and coagulometers. A healthy person not taking oral anticoagulants will have an INR very close to
1.0. An INR of 2.0 indicates that it took twice as long for your
blood to clot than it would if you were not receiving anticoagulation and were healthy. If the INR is 3.0, your clotting time will
be 3 times longer than that of normal people. The INR result
that you measure by the portable coagulometer is exactly the
same as that measured at a laboratory in a hospital.
Dose Adjustment
The main goal is to maintain your INR within target range.
The target range is the range of INR values where the treatment
is most safe and indicates the lowest risk for bleeding and the
lowest risk for thrombosis. It depends on your disease. The target
range is fixed for different groups of patients (for example, patients with a mitral valve usually have an INR range of 2.5 to
3.5). However, the anticoagulant doses required to achieve INRs
within the target range vary depending on the individual.
When the INR is below the target range (for example, 1.7),
there is an increase in thrombosis risk. When the INR is above
the target range (for example, 4.6), there is an increase in bleeding risk. The risks increase in proportion to the deviation from
the target range. For example, an INR of 8.3 implies a higher risk
for bleeding than an INR of 7.2.
The drug used in our clinic is acenocoumarol (Sintrom, Novartis Farmaceutica, Barcelona, Spain). Each pill contains 4 mg,
so daily doses are given in quarter-pill increments. For example,
one quarter of a pill equals 1 mg, one half of a pill equals 2 mg,
three quarters of a pill equals 3 mg, and 1 pill equals 4 mg.
Dose Cards
The dose cards (Appendix Tables 3 and 4) provide simple
guidelines to help choose the correct doses. The cards have 2
printed sides. The first side depends on your target range, and the
other side depends on your usual dose of anticoagulant. The
cards include important rules.
1. If the INR is higher than 7, you must repeat the test. If
the result is the same, call the anticoagulation clinic.
2. If you are bleeding overtly, test your INR and go to the
hospital emergency department.
3. If you must increase the anticoagulant dose, follow the
arrow on the card (read the guideline from right to left).
4. If you must decrease the anticoagulant dose, follow the
arrow on the card (read the guideline from left to right).
The patient’s last dose before starting self-management was
listed on the guideline card. The dose was highlighted to emphasize the patient’s current dose level.
APPENDIX 5: DOSING EXERCISES
Problem 1
Ms. Sa´nchez has a target INR range of 2.0 to 3.0. She is
currently taking 16 mg of acenocoumarol per week: one-half
tablet, one-half tablet, three quarters of a tablet, one-half tablet,
one-half tablet, three quarters of a tablet, one-half tablet (level
19). Her INR result was 3.2. Which dose must she take? When
must she repeat the test?
Solution: Ms. Sa´nchez should maintain level 19. The next
test should be performed in 7 days.
Problem 2
Mr. Pe´rez has a target range of 2.5 to 3.5. His usual dose is
level 26: three quarters of a tablet, 1 tablet, three quarters of a
tablet, 1 tablet, three quarters of a tablet, 1 tablet, three quarters
of a tablet. His INR result was 4.8. Which dose must he take?
When must he repeat the test? If his target range were 3.0 to 4.5,
what should he do?
Solution: Mr. Pe´rez should decrease his dose 1 level from
level 26 to level 25, starting with three quarters of a pill. The next
test should be performed in 7 days. Mr. Pe´rez would do exactly
the same if his target range were 3.0 to 4.5.
Problem 3
Mr. Garcia has a target range of 2.5 to 3.5. His usual dose is
1 pill per day (level 29). On Tuesday, his INR result was 1.3. He
remembered that he forgot to take his pill 1 day last week. What
must he do? What is his new dose? When must he repeat the test?
Solution: Mr. Garcia should repeat the test and confirm the
INR. He should note in the diary that he forgot to take a dose
and should increase the dose 2 levels (from level 29 to level 31),
starting with the higher fraction. He should test his INR again in
4 days.
After 4 days, Mr. Garcia’s INR is 2.8. What must he do,
considering that the previous low INR (1.3) was due to an omission of a dose?
Solution: Mr. Garcia should try to avoid further omissions of
doses. He should continue with the usual dose of 1 pill per day
(level 29) and should repeat the test in 7 days.
Problem 4
Mrs. Martinez has a target range of 2.0 to 3.0. She takes
one-half pill per day. Her INR test result was 4.5. What must she
do?
Solution: Mrs. Martinez should decrease her dose 1 level,
from level 17 to level 16, starting with one quarter of a pill. The
next test should be performed in 7 days.
Problem 5
Mr. Alonso has a target range of 3.5 to 4.5. His usual dose
is one-half pill to three quarters of a pill, alternatively (level 20).
Today, his INR test yielded a result of 1.4. What must he do?
W-4 4 January 2005 Annals of Internal Medicine Volume 142 • Number 1 www.annals.org
Solution: First, Mr. Alonso must repeat the test and confirm
the very low INR. If it is confirmed, he should increase the dose
3 levels to level 23, three quarters of a pill every day. In addition,
he must inject prophylactic doses of low-molecular-weight heparin during the next 3 days (subcutaneous enoxaparin, 40 mg/d,
until the next test). The next test should be performed in 4 days.
