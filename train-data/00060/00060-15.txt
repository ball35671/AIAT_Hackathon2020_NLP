The value of education and self-monitoring in the management
of warfarin therapy in older patients with unstable control of
anticoagulation
Despite the efficacy of dose-adjusted warfarin therapy in
reducing stroke risk in atrial fibrillation (Atrial Fibrillation
Investigators, 1994), this treatment is under-prescribed
(Sudlow et al, 1998; White et al, 1999). One reason for the
under use is concern about the drug’s safety in older patients
because of instability of anticoagulation control and monitoring problems. Risk of life threatening bleeding complications,
including subdural haematoma and intracranial haemorrhage,
is increased in those with unstable anticoagulation control, and
should therefore be reduced by measures that improve stability
of control (Fihn et al, 1993).
Much of the intra-individual variability in response to
warfarin therapy remains unexplained. Concordance is one
factor that directly affects anticoagulation control. Patients’
attitudes have been demonstrated to have a significant
influence upon concordance with anticoagulation, with nonconcordant patients having perceived less potential benefit and
more barriers to treatment than concordant patients (Arnsten
et al, 1997). As warfarin has a narrow therapeutic index, and
the pharmacodynamic response to it is unpredictable, the
recognition of factors that affect patients’ attitudes and
concordance towards their therapy will be a prerequisite in
reducing the adverse effects of warfarin therapy associated with
unstable anticoagulation.
Patients in the UK have traditionally had their response to
warfarin monitored at hospital-based anticoagulation clinics,
and more recently in general practice. The introduction of
small portable devices for near-patient testing, and the
provision of monitoring strips by the National Health Service,
has enabled patients to either self-monitor (i.e. measure own

Summary
Of 125 patients aged 65 years or over, with atrial fibrillation taking warfarin
for at least 12 months, with a standard deviation (SD) of prothrombin time,
expressed as the International Normalized Ratio (INR) >0Æ5 over the
previous 6 months, 40 were randomized to continue with usual clinic care
and 85 to receive education about warfarin. Of these, 44 were randomized to
self-monitor their INR and 41 returned to clinic. Compared with the
previous 6 months there was a significant increase in percentage time within
the therapeutic range for the 6 months following education [61Æ1 vs. 70Æ4;
mean difference 8Æ8; 95% confidence interval (CI): )0Æ2–17Æ8; P ¼ 0Æ054] and
following education and self-monitoring (57 vs. 71Æ1; mean difference 14Æ1;
95% CI: 6Æ7–21Æ5; P < 0Æ001), compared with those patients following usual
clinic care (60Æ0 vs. 63Æ2; mean difference 3Æ2; 95% CI: )7Æ3–13Æ7). Using the
same comparative periods, the INR SD fell by 0Æ24 (P < 0Æ0001) in the group
allocated to education and self-monitoring, 0Æ26 (P < 0Æ0001) in the group
receiving education alone and 0Æ16 (P ¼ 0Æ003) in the control group. Intergroup differences were not statistically significant (intervention groups
0Æ26 ± 0Æ30 vs. control 0Æ16 ± 0Æ3, P ¼ 0Æ10). Quality-of-life measurements
and health beliefs about warfarin were unchanged (apart from emotional role
limitation) with education or education and self-monitoring. Patient
education regarding anticoagulation therapy could be a cost-effective
initiative and is worthy of further study.

International Normalized Ratio (INR) but have dosing decisions made by anticoagulant clinic staff), or self-manage (i.e.
self-measurement of INR and self-dosing of warfarin) their
therapy. Studies have shown that patient self-monitoring or
self-management of anticoagulation therapy improves anticoagulation control, probably as a result of more frequent
monitoring and dose adjustment and improved patient
concordance (Cromheecke et al, 2000). Treatment-related
quality-of-life also improves in some patients as a direct
consequence of their increased control over their treatment
(Sawicki, 1999; Cromheecke et al, 2000). Better INR control
ultimately results in fewer thromboembolic or bleeding events
(Beyth et al, 2000; Heidinger et al, 2000). Patients participating in studies of self-monitoring of anticoagulation receive a
thorough education about the therapy and its indications. The
extent to which subsequent improvement in anticoagulation
control can be attributed to enhanced patient concordance as a
result of education or near-patient testing is not clear.
Studies of near-patient testing for anticoagulant control
have, in the main, been non-randomized, and have tended to
include younger patients, selected on the basis that they are
likely to be highly motivated. The impact of self-monitoring of
anticoagulation on the stability of anticoagulation control in
the older patient with non-valvular atrial fibrillation has not
been evaluated, but is particularly important as this patient
population is at a greater risk of adverse effects associated with
unstable control of anticoagulation (Fihn et al, 1993).
We therefore set out to assess the effect of an anticoagulation education programme with or without self-monitoring
in patients with atrial fibrillation, aged ‡65 years, upon
stability of anticoagulant control and treatment-related quality-of-life measures. The study had the approval of the
Newcastle and North Tyneside Local Research Ethics Committee.
Methods
Sample size calculation
Based on our clinic database, for those patients with atrial
fibrillation with a target INR of 2Æ5 (range 2–3), the median
standard deviation (SD) of INR values over 6 months was 0Æ3.
The 20% of patients with the most unstable control of
anticoagulation had an INR SD ‡ 0Æ5. It was calculated that,
with this study design, 105 patients (35 in each of the control,
education only and education plus self-monitoring groups)
were required to detect a difference of 0Æ32 units in the SD of
the INR (significance level 0Æ05, power 0Æ8) between the
groups.
Protocol
The study design and patient numbers are shown in Fig 1. A
total of 249 patients in the anticoagulation service were
selected by computer and identified as eligible on the basis of
the following criteria: indication of atrial fibrillation with
target INR range of 2–3, taking warfarin for at least 12 months,
INR SD ‡ 0Æ5 over the previous 6 months and aged 65 years or
over. Fifty-five patients were excluded because of general
frailty, poor hearing or eyesight, impairment of hand function

caused by disabling arthritis, stroke or tremor, dementia, or
living in institutional care which precluded the use of a
CoaguChek System, or when the cause of instability of
anticoagulation control was apparent (e.g. drug interactions)
and would not be altered by access to the CoaguChek System.
40 (27 males) continued with the usual anticoagulation clinic
care, as the control group. They were unaware of their
participation in the study as it was deemed that their prior
knowledge of this could affect their behaviour. For the
intervention arms of the study, 154 patients were approached
and the study explained to them individually. Sixty-nine
patients declined to take part for reasons of fear of self-testing,
needles or preference to continue to attend the anticoagulant
clinic.
The 85 participating patients gave written informed consent.
They attended, in groups of two or three, a 2-h education
session based on Roche educational material led by a doctor.
This session perceived health status and quality-of-life using
the 36-item United Kingdom Short Form Health Survey
(UKSF-36) (Garratt et al, 1993) and European Quality of Life
questionnaire (Euroqol) (The Euroqol Group, 1990) and
health beliefs specific to warfarin, using an instrument
designed to measure quality-of-life in anticoagulated patients
(Lancaster et al, 1991), were assessed at interview by a research
worker, who was not a member of the anticoagulant clinic
staff. Patients were then told about atrial fibrillation and the
clinical benefits and risks of anticoagulation in their condition.
Information was given about the pharmacology of warfarin,
and factors that affect the INR, particularly concordance, drug
interactions and diet. The sessions were interactive with
opportunities for discussion and questions. Written information covering the issues raised was provided.
The patients were then randomized according to a computer-generated program, using a random numbers table, into
two treatment groups: anticoagulant clinic monitoring or
weekly self-monitoring of the INR (Fig 1). All patients
participating in the study, including the controls, attended
the anticoagulation clinic for INR measurements at intervals
determined by the stability of their INR and with dosage
changes determined through a computerized dosage program
(Poller et al, 1998). The median age of patients in the control
group was 73 years, range 65–93 years, in the education and
clinic care group it was 75 years, range 65–87 years, and in the
education and weekly self-monitoring group it was 71 years,
range 65–91 years.
The patients (n ¼ 44) who were allocated to self-monitoring
underwent training in self-measurement of capillary INR using
the CoaguChek System (Coaguchek; Roche Diagnostics,
Mannheim, Germany). They then measured their INR weekly
at home. The study co-ordinator spoke with each patient by
telephone, and based on the patient’s INR value, gave
appropriate advice about warfarin daily dosage for the next
7 d.
The patients actively participating in the study also attended
the anticoagulation clinic at 6, 12 and 24 weeks to take part in
an interview to determine attitudes to anticoagulation and
treatment-related quality-of-life (The Euroqol Group, 1990;
Lancaster et al, 1991; Garratt et al, 1993), and to have their
venous INR values measured as an external quality control
measure. The manufacturer’s internal quality control measures
for Coaguchek were performed each time a new test kit was
used or if an INR was unexpectedly high or low, to confirm
that the device was functional. The number and type of
bleeding episodes, classified according to Landefeld and
Goldman (1989), and thromboembolic episodes including
stroke and episodes of hospital admission for the two
intervention groups were recorded. The reasons for any patient
withdrawing from the study before its completion were
recorded.
Measurements
Venous INR. These tests were performed on citrated samples,
using either the MDX or MDA CoaguChek System
(Biomerieux, Cambridge, UK) with the company’s specific
reagents (Simplastin HTF, International Sensitivity
Index ¼ 1Æ15). Three levels of commercial quality control
material (normal, slightly abnormal and very abnormal) were
applied three times daily to all machines.
Capillary INR. The Capillary INR was performed on
Thrombotrak equipment (Biomerieux) using Manchester
reagents (Thrombosis Reference Centre, Manchester, UK)
and controlled by the daily application of abnormal quality
control material from the same company. Both types of test
were controlled externally as part of the National External
Quality Assurance Service (Sheffield, UK) and Central Quality
Assurance Scheme (Birmingham, UK) profiles. This laboratory
has full Clinical Pathology Accreditation [Clinical Pathology
Accreditation (UK) Ltd, Sheffield, UK].
Data analysis
The percentage of time at which the INR was within the target
range of 2–3 for each patient was calculated by the method of
linear interpolation (Azar et al, 1994). The main focus of
interest was whether there was a change in mean value of a
variable (e.g. time in range, SD of INR) as a result of the
interventions. For each variable, the change in score was
calculated for each patient and the mean change tested against
zero assuming approximate normality, which was found to be
an acceptable assumption. When two groups were compared,
this was performed using independent group t-tests. The
assumptions of normality and equal variance were checked. To
generate odds ratios for the seven questions assessing health
benefits and barriers relating to anticoagulation, patients’
ratings were dichotomized by combining the response ‘a great
deal’ with ‘some’ and the response ‘not at all’ with ‘hardly’ and
‘not sure’. The reason for combining the latter was based on
the assumption that patients who do not know whether the

intervention is affecting their quality-of-life in a specified way
(by responding as ‘not sure’) are not experiencing any
significant impact on their health (Arnsten et al, 1997). An
exact binomial test was performed on responses that changed
from week 0 to week 24. Analyses were carried out on data
from those patients who completed the study.
Results
Four patients dropped out of the self-monitoring group: one
was unable to perform self-monitoring competently at home,
and three discontinued warfarin therapy, one because of a
haemarthrosis. Two patients in the education and clinic care
group did not complete the study as their warfarin was
discontinued. Demographic details of the study population are
shown in Table I. Individuals who refused to participate did
not differ in age or gender distribution from the studied group.
WE did not record the educational level of non-participants.
There was a good correlation between capillary INR, as
measured by Coaguchek, and venous INR (r ¼ 0Æ75;
P < 0Æ001) with any differences between absolute values being
small and of no clinical significance.
The quality of anticoagulation control, measured as percentage of time within the target INR range, showed a
significant improvement as a result of intervention particularly
in the group with education and self-monitoring. For the
group participating in education alone, the percentage time
within the therapeutic range increased from a mean ± SD
61Æ1 ± 15Æ1 during the 6 months prior, to 70Æ4 ± 24Æ5 during
the 6 months after the study began (mean difference: 8Æ8, 95%
CI: )0Æ2–17Æ8, P ¼ 0Æ054). For patients participating in
education and self-monitoring, the percentage time within
the therapeutic range increased from 57Æ0 ± 17Æ0 to
71Æ1 ± 14Æ5 (mean difference: 14Æ1, 95% CI: 6Æ7–21Æ5,
P < 0Æ001). For the control (non-intervention) group there
was no significant difference in the percentage time within the
therapeutic range between the 6 months prior (60Æ0 ± 18Æ8) to
the six months after the study began (63Æ2 ± 25Æ9) (mean
difference: 3Æ2, 95% CI: )7Æ3–13Æ7, P > 0Æ5). The time within
the INR range during the study periods in the three groups is
shown in Figs 1 and 2.
Comparison of the results between the 6 months prior to
and the 6 months after the study commencement demonstrated a fall in the SD of the INR of 0Æ24 (P < 0Æ0001) in the
group allocated to education and self-monitoring, 0Æ26
(P < 0Æ0001) in the group allocated to education alone and
0Æ16 (P ¼ 0Æ003) in the control group (Table II). Although the
intervention groups had a larger decline in SD than the control
group, the differences between the groups were not statistically
significant (intervention groups 0Æ25 ± 0Æ30 vs. control
0Æ16 ± 0Æ30, P ¼ 0Æ12). The differences in percentage time
within the therapeutic range and in the INR SD between the
groups were not statistically significant because of the large
amount of variability.
Age was not a relevant factor within this cohort; there was
no association between time within range or SD and age either
before or after the intervention. Similarly, the changes in time
within range and SD did not correlate with age (P > 0Æ01 for
all comparisons).
Those performing self-monitoring made an average of 4 ± 2
dose changes during the study (median 4, range 0–9),
compared with 1 ± 1 (median 1, range 0–5) in the education
and clinic care group and 2 ± 2 (median 1, range 0–7) in the
control group (P < 0Æ0001) in the 6 months after the study
commencement.
Of the parameters recorded by the UKSF-36, there were no
significant differences in scores for bodily pain, social function,
mental health, emotional function or physical function
between the two intervention groups at the start of the study
and thereafter at weeks 6, 12 and 24 (Table III). Only one
variable changed significantly from baseline to week 24
(emotional role limitation – in the education and selfmonitoring group; difference 13Æ33, 95% CI 0Æ85, 25Æ81,
P ¼ 0Æ04). The Euroqol scores were similar between the two
groups and did not change during the study (Table III).
Perceived benefits and barriers to anticoagulation were not
significantly different between the group receiving education
and self-monitoring and the one receiving education alone
(Table IV).
One patient in the self-monitoring group developed a
haemarthrosis, his INR being 1Æ7 at the time and two patients
in each of the two intervention groups reported minor nose

bleeds. No thromboembolic complications were reported. We
did not monitor adverse events in the control group.
Of the 40 patients performing self-monitoring who completed the study, 30 reported no problems with the technique
and would have wanted to continue with self-monitoring for
its ease and convenience. Ten of the sample, however, reported
some difficulty with the technique, finding it difficult to place
the fingertip blood drop on the right position on the test strip
and, in consequence, having to use multiple strips to achieve a
single reading. One patient did not complete the study because
of this difficulty.
Discussion
It has been demonstrated that 50–60% of patients can be
expected to remain in their target range if monitoring of INR
occurs monthly, 77–85% if monitored weekly and up to 92% if
monitored every 3 d (Oral Anticoagulation Monitoring Study
Group, 2001). It has been postulated that a threshold may exist
beyond which there is no further beneficial effect of increased
testing and this has been suggested to be between 2 and 4 d
(Samsa, 2000). It would be unrealistic to expect an anticoagulation clinic to monitor patients with such frequency, but
home monitoring does allow for this.
Near-patient testing would be a suitable model of oral
anticoagulation therapy management if it could be shown to
improve therapeutic control, thereby decreasing complication
risk, improving patients’ quality-of-life and increasing costeffectiveness when compared with the current management
strategies. Studies examining the quality of anticoagulation
control have indicated that patients performing self-monitoring spent significantly more time within their therapeutic
range compared with control groups (Sawicki, 1999; Viller
et al, 1999; Cromheecke et al, 2000). It is generally concluded
that this is probably a result of increased frequency of testing,
leading to better dosage advice and improved concordance.
The major criticisms of such studies, however, are that patients
had not been randomly selected and not all data had been
collected prospectively. Extrapolation of the results of such
studies is also hampered by the diversity of anticoagulation
management of the control groups.
There is little information about the outcomes of selfmonitoring or self-management in older adults. Two previous
studies in anticoagulated patients aged 65 years or over
reported that the percentage time in therapeutic range was
higher in the self-monitoring patients, at 56% (Beyth et al,
2000) and 69% (Heidinger et al, 2000), than in those with
usual care. These values are rather low in comparison with
studies of groups of younger patients (Oral Anticoagulation
Monitoring Study Group, 2001).
Because the unstable patients were selected from the top
20% of the SD of the INR in our clinic population, it was
anticipated that, for some patients, the SD had been overestimated by chance. Thus we expected an average reduction in
the INR SD because of the regression to the mean effect. This
may explain the decline in SD in the control group.
A major outcome of our randomized study in patients with
unstable control of anticoagulation was that education alone
produced a similar improvement in time within the therapeutic range as did education plus self-monitoring of anticoagulation. Evidence suggests that patients having a good contact
with health care professionals and more knowledge about their
disease and treatment adhere better to their therapy (George

and the following 6 months (——–) in the control group (A), those
participating in education alone (B) and those participating in education and self-monitoring anticoagulation (C).

et al, 1983; Viller et al, 1999). Not all doctors and pharmacists
provide adequate information about anticoagulation therapy,
and where it is provided, it may be forgotten or poorly
understood by patients (McMahon et al, 1987). Attempts are
made in our monitoring service to inform patients about their
warfarin therapy, both through written information and with
verbal support through answering questions when asked,
thereafter. Studies have shown that, in spite of having been
given information, patients’ knowledge about warfarin is
generally poor, and is less in older patients (Griffin & Griffin,
1996; Lambert & Wynne, 2003). The education programme
implemented in our study was a more rigorous way of
informing elderly patients about anticoagulation, and led to
the improved stability of control, perhaps through better
concordance. How the change was effected, how much it
depended on education or the fact that the patients were aware
that they were participating in a study, the acceptability of the
programme in the clinical setting and the relative importance
of the key factors of verbal and written information in this
education are the subjects of further study.

Some published studies have indicated an improvement in
some quality-of-life measures and patient satisfaction as a
result of self-management of anticoagulation, but these have
focused upon younger patients who have more concerns about
warfarin therapy and the limitations it imposes upon their lives
(Ansell et al, 1995; Kulinna et al, 1999; Sawicki, 1999; Cromheecke et al, 2000). Some report a patient preference for selfmanagement through empowerment to organize their time
more efficiently and increased independence (Kulinna et al,
1999). As with other multi-item tests, the presence of a
marginally significant difference in emotional role limitation
found by the UKSF-36 in our study groups is probably the
result of chance. The difference between the intervention
groups and the control group is also partially explained by the
high baseline value in the self-monitoring group, with the 24-
week values being similar. Differences in patient age does
influence attitudes to anticoagulation monitoring; patients
over 65 years are less likely to view attendance at a hospitalbased clinic as inconvenient than are younger patients, with
many describing their visits as enjoyable, providing an
opportunity for socializing and receiving support (Siat Chin
Leong Sit & Wynne, 2003).
Our failure to demonstrate a statistically significant difference in time within the therapeutic range between the groups
is because of the large amount of variability within each group
and also possibly due to the limited number of patients that
were studied. We aimed at recruiting those patients whose
control was the most unstable, being at increased risk of
thromboembolic or bleeding complications, and therefore
having most to gain in terms of risk reduction by improved
control. However, half of those approached declined to
participate. Reasons given were physical constraints, which
patients judged precluded them from the use of near-patient
testing, lack of confidence or being unwilling to experience the
uncertainty or perceived risk of the study and not wanting to
change their current, satisfactory situation. Concomitant
medication or identification of factors contributing to instability rendered ineligible only a minority of patients with
unstable control. Forty-three of 44 older patients of this selfselected group did perform self-monitoring competently, the
majority wishing to continue, to avoid travelling to clinic or to
allow more frequent monitoring. Based upon the free text
views, some older people had initial difficulty with the
technique of blood sampling but learnt with practice, and all
found it convenient. They felt it would prove most suitable for
older patients who do not wish, or have difficulty, travelling to
an anticoagulant clinic, particularly those with erratic INR
control that require frequent monitoring, and for frail people
who have a carer who could perform the test at home.
Although our experience suggests that older patients will not
be lobbying for near-patient testing to take over from clinicbased monitoring in the UK, the case for increased education
about anticoagulation being made available to this group
should be supported. The significant improvements in anticoagulation control noted after just one education session
suggest that this could be a cost-effective initiative worthy of
further study.
