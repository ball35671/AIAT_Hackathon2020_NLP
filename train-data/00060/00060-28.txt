period of investigation from December 1999 to July 2001, only
202 patients (64.3±9.2 years,
69.3% men) consented to participate. The study was discontinued
prematurely since the number of

target range significantly more
frequently (p=0.0061) in patients
under self-management (67.8%)
as compared to the family doctor

with regard to the time within
target range, but the difference
was not significant (178.8 ±126
days as compared to 155.9±118.4

Introduction
As a consequence of demographic change, the number of patients with atrial fibrillation is bound to increase since the incidence of this most frequent arrhythmia doubles with every decade from the 55th
year of life [13]. Whereas the prevalence in the overall population is about 0.5%, almost every tenth person over 70 is affected [29]. In the United States of
America, almost 2.3 million adults have atrial fibrillation at present. This figure is expected to double
in the next 30 years on the basis of a cohort study
conducted in California (ATRIA Study) [8].
In every age category, the risk of suffering a cerebral
ischemic event is fivefold in patients with atrial fibrillation [29]. Comparing the different pathomechanisms
reveals that the morbidity and mortality is twice as
high as a result of the greater age and the larger infarct
area in patients with a stroke induced by thromboembolism [3, 18]. Application of treatment guidelines
must therefore be stipulated in patients with atrial fibrillation, especially since the risk of thromboembolic
events can be lowered by up to two-thirds by treatment
with oral anticoagulants both in primary and secondary prevention [1, 5]. Appraisal of risks and benefits
shows the need for an intensity with an International
Normalized Ratio (INR) between 2 and 3, since the
rate of hemorrhage rises exponentially above INR 3
whereas the rate of thromboembolism increases exponentially below INR 2 [6, 11].
Although this evidence-based data has been incorporated in treatment guidelines for years, less
than 50% of patients receive oral anticoagulants on
a routine basis [7, 22]. If the family doctor checks
treatment in anticoagulated patients, only every second patient reaches the target range of an INR between 2 and 3. For example, 61% of the INR values
were below the target value of 2 to 3 at the time of
inpatient admission despite ongoing anticoagulation
in stroke patients with atrial fibrillation [19]. An improvement of treatment control by about 20% can be
attained with INR self-management [25]. In this way,
a marked reduction of thromboembolic and hemorrhagic events was attained in the comparative investigations, mainly in patients with heart valve replacement [14, 27]. Only a retrospective cohort study
of Heidinger et al. on the feasibility and value of
INR self-management has been available up to now
for patients with atrial fibrillation with a relatively
low incidence of complications: 1.69% hemorrhages
and 1.04% thromboembolic events per patient year
[9]. The objective of the present study was to determine the number of thromboembolic and hemorrhagic complications requiring treatment and to establish how well the INR values were kept in the individual target range over a two year period of observation in an open randomized and prospective
group comparison.
Methods
Two thousand patients in whom long-term anticoagulation was indicated because of permanent nonvalvular atrial fibrillation were to be included into
the investigation. Exclusion criteria were the lack of
suitability for INR self-management, participation in
another study, alcohol or another addiction, a mechanical heart valve replacement or anticoagulant
treatment already administered for another indication and diseases such as AIDS or carcinomas. The
size of the random sample was chosen under the as-
sumption that the 4% rate of complications (total
thromboembolic and/or hemorrhagic events) in routine management would be halved. The details of
the study design have already been published elsewhere [24]. The primary endpoint comprised the
number of thromboembolic or hemorrhagic complications requiring treatment. The degree of handicap
after stroke was determined according to the Rankin
scale [23], and the degree of severity of the hemorrhage was determined according to van der Meer
[21]. Severe hemorrhages were defined as intracerebral or fatal hemorrhages which required transfusions or inpatient admission for more than 24 hours
with or without surgical operation. The proportion
as well as the cumulative time of the INR values in
the individual target range, INR variance, the time
course of the complications and finally the cost-efficiency of self-measurement as compared to conventional procedures were secondary endpoints.
In an open study design, only 202 patients
(64.3±9.2 years, 69.3% men) consented to randomization in the period from 14 December 1999 to 6 July
2001 at 33 study centers. The study was discontinued
because the number of cases was too small, and the
group comparison is confined to the evaluation of
the number of INR values measured and the total period for which the patients remained outside, above
and below the target range using the two-tailed t test.
Results
Of the 202 patients included, 101 were assigned to
the self-management group (64.6±9.6 years, 71.4%
men) and 101 patients were assigned to the family
doctor group (64.1±8.9 years, 61.4% men, n.s.).
The overall period of observation was 37.34±5.93
years in the patients with self-management and
40.25±6.07 years in the patients managed by the
family doctor. In the respective period of observation, two severe hemorrhages (intra-articular or gluteal) occurred in one patient within an interval of
four days in the self-management group, whereas
there was one thromboembolic event (thrombotic
occlusion of the right iliac artery) in the group managed by the family doctor. The total number of INR
measurements was 2865, comprising 2072 in patients under self-management and 793 in the family
doctor group. The values were in the target range
significantly more frequently (p=0.0061) in the patients under self-management (67.8%) as compared
to the family doctor group (58.5%) (Table 1). There
was a trend but no significant difference with regard
to the number of days within the target range
(178.8 ±126 days as compared to 155.9±118.4 days).
Discussion
Patients with atrial fibrillation also appear to benefit
from INR self-management. This randomized study
on patients with an average age of 64 years at least
documents that this form of monitoring is more effective in attaining values within the desired INR
target range than conventional management by the
family doctor.
It could be shown that the improved treatment
management in patients with heart valve replacement is also associated with a reduction of thromboembolic and/or hemorrhagic complications by up
to 50% [27]. A low INR variability appears to be the
major reason for this success. Variations of more
than 20% entailed a poorer survival rate than the
age factor (per decade of life) or the presence of diabetes mellitus [2] in a cohort study of 1272 patients
after heart valve replacement. In cohort studies, INR
self-management was associated with lower INR
variability compared to conventional treatment management by the family doctor [26]. In the course of
one year, the variability of INR values was 0.7 in the
family doctor group as compared to 0.57 in the selfmanagement group in 353 consecutive patients with
long-term oral anticoagulant treatment. This may explain the improvement of treatment control in selfmanaged patients that is a prerequisite for the desired therapy effect. A study just published by Hylek
et al. on patients with permanent atrial fibrillation
indicates that too low an intensity of anticoagulant
treatment (INR less than 2) is as effective as aspirin
monotherapy [10]. The fear of hemorrhages prevents
an adequate intensity of anticoagulation especially in
elderly patients [28]. This is also confirmed in the
present investigation, since patients in the family
doctor control group showed INR values below the
target range significantly more frequently (22.1% as

compared to 15.3%). When the INR is between two
and three, the rate of hemorrhage in more elderly
patients is not raised compared to young patients
[16]. There are no age-dependent differences in the
quality of oral anticoagulation treatment. Nor is
there a divergence between the rate of hemorrhages
and INR measurements in the target range in a comparative investigation of Copland et al. on a total of
328 patients [4], as long as the different metabolic
situation in older patients is taken into consideration. Compared to younger patients, the concentration of vitamin K-dependent factors is lowered in
older patients, so that only two-thirds of the usual
dosage is required in the frequent cases of parenchymal disease or renal failure [17]. The relative danger
of falls in elderly patients should no longer be regarded as a contraindication, since investigations by
Mau-Son-Hing et al. did not show any raised danger
of hemorrhage in patients with restricted mobility
[15]. Since the mean age of the patients was on average 10 years greater in the present study than in
other studies on the implementation and value of
INR self-management, this kind of management
would be of benefit to the majority of patients with
atrial fibrillation. This is especially the case since
studies comparing the rhythm versus rate control
have shown beneficial effects on the latter [22, 30].
The patients required prolonged anticoagulation
even after restoration of sinus rhythm owing to a
high rate of recurrence or onset of asymptomatic intermittent atrial fibrillation [12].
Conclusion
An increase of patients with atrial fibrilliation is to
be anticipated in view of the demographic development. A high quality of therapy management is required in order to reduce the rate of cerebrovascular
events, a stipulation that appears to be met in the
predominantly elderly patients by INR self-management to a greater extent than by management of the
family doctor. This may enable better attainment of
existing guideline targets, especially since patients
also require prolonged anticoagulation after cardioversion.
