therapy is increasingly used
for prevention and treatment of various thromboembolic complications.1 The aim of this
therapy is to maintain levels of anticoagulation capable of preventing thromboembolic events without increasing the
risk of hemorrhagic complications.2 The
risk of either complication depends
largely on the time frame during which
patients are outside the therapeutic range
of prothrombin time (PT).2,3 Standard anticoagulation therapy requires frequent
venous punctures and patients’ visits to
a physician’s office or a laboratory and
laboratory standardization. Interactions with other drugs4 and dietary influences5 can affect control. Furthermore, poor compliance with the
prescribed treatment strategies and inadequate medical counseling have been
identified as major factors for unstable
control of anticoagulant therapy.6
In the treatment of diabetes mellitus
and hypertension, self-monitoring and
self-adjustment of medication dosage
combined with structured patient teaching and treatment programs have resulted in major improvements of patient compliance, medical outcomes, and
quality of life.7,8 The use of portable capillary whole-blood analyzers combined
with an effective self-management program for patients could likewise improve the outcome for anticoagulation.

Context Control of oral anticoagulation therapy has been reported to often be inadequate. Previous retrospective investigations suggest that patients’ self-adjustment
of oral anticoagulants may lead to improved control.
Objective To investigate the effects of patients’ self-management of oral anticoagulation therapy on accuracy of control and measures of treatment-related quality
of life.
Design Randomized, single-blind, multicenter trial.
Setting and Participants A total of 179 patients receiving long-term oral anticoagulation treatment were enrolled at 5 referral centers in Germany.
Intervention Patients were randomized to an oral anticoagulation selfmanagement group based on a structured treatment and teaching program and international normalized ratio (INR) self-monitoring. The control group received conventional care as provided by family physicians, including referral to specialists if necessary.
Main Outcome Measures Deviation of INR values from the individual INR target
range (squared) and the 5 categories of treatment-related quality of life.
Results Deviation of INR value from the mean of the INR target range was significantly lower in the intervention group at 3-month (squared INR deviation, 0.59
vs 0.95; P,.001) and 6-month follow-up (0.65 vs 0.83; P=.03) compared with the
control group. Also, the intervention group had INR values within the target range
more often (repeated measurement analysis for categorical data, P = .006). The
results were mainly due to less frequent suboptimal INR values in the intervention
group (32.8% vs 50.0% [P=.03] at 3-month, and 33.7% vs 48.2% [P=.08] at
6-month follow-up). Treatment-related quality-of-life measures, especially treatment satisfaction scores, were significantly higher in the intervention group compared with controls.
Conclusions An anticoagulation education program that includes selfmanagement of anticoagulation therapy results in improved accuracy of anticoagulation control and in treatment-related quality-of-life measures. Further studies are
needed to describe whether the program will reduce risk of bleeding or
thromboembolism.

patient self-management of oral anticoagulation based on self-measurement of
PT is feasible and safe and results in control at least as good as in a specialized
anticoagulation clinic. The current multicenter, randomized trial was designed
to determine the effect of a structured
educational program aimed at selfmanagement of anticoagulation therapy.
The success of the therapy was based on
the quality of care as defined by achievement of international normalized ratio
(INR) values within the target range and
treatment-related quality of life compared with conventional care.
METHODS
Patients and Inclusion Criteria
Five departments specializing in the treatment of patients receiving oral anticoagulation therapy participated in this
multicenter study. The centers were advised to screen all consecutive patients
with oral anticoagulant treatment appearing at the respective center. If the inclusion criteria were met and the patient agreed to participate in the study,
the patient reported to the coordinating
center (FIGURE). Patients who had not
been previously treated in these centers, who had a disease or condition expected to require life-long anticoagulant treatment, and who agreed to
participate were enrolled. No other preselection was done. The study’s statistician randomized all patients at the coordinating center by means of a computer
program. A separate randomization table
was used for each center to ensure an
even distribution of patients to both study
groups in each center.
The study protocol was approved by
the ethical committees of all participating centers. All patients gave their written informed consent to participate in the
study. The family physicians of all the patients were informed about the study. The
oral anticoagulant was phenprocoumon. Before enrollment into the study,
the INR therapeutic target range was defined individually by the treating physicians and reported to all patients. In
patients with prosthetic heart valve replacement, the INR target range was, in
most cases, 3.0 to 4.0, 3.0 to 4.5, or 2.5
to 3.5,11 and in those with atrial fibrillation it was 2.0 to 3.0. However, in some
patients, the treating physician defined
a rather narrow INR range, for example
3.0 to 3.5. All INR target ranges were also
documented in patients’ log books at
baseline; they remained unchanged
throughout the trial.
Control Group
The control group, usual outpatient care,
consisted of twice monthly visits to a family practitioner or an outpatient clinic.
During these visits, blood was drawn by
the physician or the laboratory to determine the INR value. When necessary, the
family physician advised the control
group patient with regard to the change
in the anticoagulant dosage. The treating physicians provided the control
group patients with unstructured information about oral anticoagulants, diet,
and adverse effects. The control group
patients were asked to refrain from selfmonitoring and self-management of anticoagulation for 6 months until the end
of the study, when participation in the
self-management program would also be
offered to them. Control patients with
INR values out of range at baseline and
at 3-month follow-up were advised to see
their physician.
Intervention
A structured educational program was
developed and all teaching nurses and
physicians responsible for the education of the patients in the intervention
group participated in a 2-day training
course. The goal of the oral anticoagulation teaching and self-management program was to help patients assume increased responsibility for disease
management based on systematic INR
value self-monitoring and selfmanagement of the anticoagulant dosage. The program consisted of 3 consecutive weekly teaching sessions of 60
to 90 minutes for groups of 3 to 6 patients. During the first session, patients
were informed about anticoagulation in
general and received extensive training
in INR value self-monitoring using a
whole blood PT/INR monitor (CoaguChek, Boehringer Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany).12During the first week,
the patients were encouraged to measure INR values routinely and to record
the results and the anticoagulant dosages in their log book. The topics of the
second session included instructions to
prevent bleeding and thromboembolic
complications and the effect of diet and
additional medication on anticoagulation control. During the second and the
third session, patients were instructed
about indications and models of reducing or increasing the anticoagulant dosages to achieve INR values within the target range. Several examples of adapting
drug dosage were discussed and practice exercises were completed by the patients. In addition, possible problems that
might be encountered with operations,
illness, exercise, pregnancy, and traveling were discussed. The quality of INR
value self-monitoring was checked by the
teaching nurse at the end of the first and
at the beginning of the following 2 sessions. After participation in the program, the patients had to estimate their
INR value with an absolute deviation of
less than 0.4 from the reference value.
If this was not the case, then the training was repeated. At the end of the training all patients who participated in the
study achieved INR measurements with
deviations of less than 0.4 from the refFigure. Enrollment and Scheduled

erence INR measurement. After participation in the program, the patients were
encouraged to control the INR values by
self-monitoring 1 to 2 times per week,
to adjust their anticoagulant dosage accordingly, and to contact the teaching
center in case of difficulties.
Outcome Measures
Patient examinations were scheduled at
baseline and at 3 and 6 months after randomization. At baseline and at both follow-up visits, plasma was obtained from
9 mL of whole blood anticoagulated with
1 mL of sodium citrate, followed by centrifugation at 2000g for 30 minutes. For
laboratory measurement of INR values,
all samples were stored at −70°C until
after the end of the study, when PT was
measured using an automated coagulation laboratory instrument (Behring Coagulation System, Behring Diagnostics)
with a single charge of a Thromborel-S
(Behring Diagnostics). Laboratory measurement of PTs and the corresponding
INR values was performed by a technician and a documentation assistant who
were blinded to the treatment arm of the
study. Anticoagulation was assessed at
baseline and at 3- and 6-month followup. To simultaneously evaluate positive
and negative differences between the INR
target range and INR values, the squared
INR value deviation was assessed with
the following equation:
Squared INR Value Deviation =
[INR − 1⁄2(Upper Value of Target INR Range
+ Lower Value of Target INR Range]2
.
To detect a difference of 0.5 regarding
the means of the squared INR value deviation between the groups with a power
of 90%, a sample size of 86 patients per
group was needed, assuming a significance level of P = .05 and SD of the
squared INR value deviation of 1.0 in
each group.
In addition to the assessment of the
squared deviation of the INR values, the
laboratory INR values were also rated in
relation to the individual INR target range
for each patient as to whether they were
inside or outside of the target range. This
evaluation was performed by an independent person (Mr Johannsen) who was
not directly involved in the study and was
blinded to the treatment arm. At baseline and at 6-month follow-up, treatment-related quality of life was assessed using a structured questionnaire
containing 40 items (available on request). This questionnaire was developed with the help of the national selfhelp group for patients receiving oral
anticoagulation. The members of the patients’ self-help group formulated sentences describing their feelings with regard to their treatment, of which 40 were
combined into a questionnaire. Thereafter, the study patients estimated the
impact of every item on their selfperceived treatment-related quality of life
by a graded scale ranging from a minimum of 1 (total disagreement) to a maximum of 6 (total agreement). The 40 items
covered 5 treatment-related topics: general treatment satisfaction, self-efficacy,
strained social network, daily hassles, and
distress. For every topic the total score
was divided by the number of items included, resulting in a minimum score of
1 and a maximum of 6 for every topic,
and the internal reliability coefficient of
the questionnaire (Cronbach a) was assessed according to the method of Todd
and Bradley.13 The person scoring the
quality-of-life measures (Ms Steinhoff)
was blinded to the treatment arm. The
occurrence of all thrombotic and bleeding complications was recorded. Bleeding complications were classified as minor or major according to the criteria of
Landefeld et al.14
Analysis
The data are presented as means and SDs
or proportions. For comparison of
groups, the Wilcoxon rank sum test (continuous variables) and 2-tailed Fisher exact test for categorical data were used. The
proportions of patients with INR values
within the target range during the follow-up time (2 time points) were additionally analyzed by means of repeated
measurement analysis of variance for categorical data.15 This general methodology for multivariate categorical data obtained from repeated measurement
experiments makes it possible to analyze the proportions of the 2 examinations simultaneously by specifying group,
time, and group-time interaction effects. The 95% confidence intervals
(CIs) for means and risk ratios (RRs) were
calculated by applying standard methods. The evaluation was performed on
an intention-to-treat basis. For computations, SAS procedures (MEANS, FREQ,
NPAR1WAY, and CATMOD) were
used.16 P,.05 was regarded as significant.
RESULTS
From the 179 patients who were enrolled into the study, 90 patients were
randomized to the self-management
group and 89 to the control group (Figure, TABLE 1). A total of 165 patients
were followed up for 6 months, 83 in the
self-management group and 82 in the
routine care group. Fourteen patients left
the study without any follow-up examination and were excluded since no INR
follow-up data were available for them.
Five patients in the self-management
group and 6 patients in the routine care
group refused to participate in the follow-up examinations, 2 patients (1 in
each group) died due to cardiac causes
(heart failure and ventricular fibrillation), and anticoagulation was terminated in 1 patient when atrial fibrillation had permanently changed to sinus
rhythm. After participation in the teaching and treatment program, 2 patients
from the self-monitoring group did not
perform anticoagulation self-monitoring at all. After randomization to the routine care group, 7 patients decided to participate in self-monitoring training and
reported self-management of anticoagulation at follow-up. The evaluation of the
study results was performed on an intention-to-treat basis; hence, these 9 patients remained in their original treatment groups.
During the follow-up period, 1 event
of major bleeding occurred in each
group. Twelve minor bleeding complications occurred in the self-management group and 10 in the routine care
group. Two major nonfatal thromboembolic complications occurred (myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke), both
in the routine care group. One patient

in the self-management group reported
a transient (1 day) weakness of 1 leg,
which might have been due to a minor
cerebral ischemic episode.
Outcomes
At baseline, the groups did not differ significantly with regard to the squared INR
value deviation from the mean of the individual INR target range or the percentage of patients within the target range
(TABLE 2). The mean of the squared INR
value deviation at both follow-up examinations was significantly lower in the selfmanagement group (Table 2). The INR
values at the baseline examination were
within the target range in less than 29%
of the patients randomized to the selfmanagement group (Table 2). At the 3-
and 6-month follow-up this number increased to 57% and 53%, respectively,
whereas the percentage of controlled patients in the routine care group did not
change between baseline and 3-month
follow-up, but increased slightly thereafter (Table 2). In repeated measurement analysis for categorical data,15 the
2 groups differed significantly (x2
, 7.44;
P = .006) concerning the probability of
having INR values within the target range
during the follow-up period (2 time
points) adjusted for center (x2
, 34.39;
P,.001) and time (x2
, 2.64; P=.10) effect. In this model only the main effects
were used because all interactions (including the group-center interaction)
were not significant. The larger proportion of patients with INR values within
the therapeutic range in the selfmanagement group was mostly due to a
lower percentage of INR values that were
too low (Table 2). At baseline, both
groups were comparable with regard to
the INR values. When controlling for the
center effect using the Mantel-Haenszel
analysis, the routine care group was more
likely to be outside the target range at the
3-month follow-up (RR, 1.5; 95% CI,
1.2-2.0) but not significantly so at the
6-month follow-up (RR, 1.2; 95% CI,
0.9-1.6). In the intervention group,
the number of patients with INR values above 4.5 decreased from 4 at
baseline to 1 at 3 months and to 2 at 6
months. In the control group, INR values above 4.5 were present in 1, 2,
and 1 patient, respectively. There were
significant differences in the outcome
parameter between the centers, so the
center effect was included in the
repeated measurement analysis. Since
no interactions were significant, the
final model contained only main
effects. The center effect was significant, but the result of the group effect
remained unchanged after including
the center effect.
Patient Questionnaire
The treatment-related questionnaire was
completed by 160 patients both at baseline and at 6-month follow-up. The internal reliability was acceptable as indicated by the Cronbach a values
(TABLE 3). General treatment satisfaction and daily hassles scores improved
in the self-management group and remained unchanged in the routine care
group. The scores of self-efficacy and disTable 1. Baseline Characteristics of Patients Who Were Randomized to the Control Group

scores.
COMMENT
The results of this prospective randomized intervention study indicate that patients’ self-management of oral anticoagulation based on a structured teaching
and INR value self-monitoring program
is safe and results in an improvement of
both accuracy of anticoagulation control and treatment-related quality of life.
The ability of patients to reliably measure their INR values has previously been
convincingly documented.10,14,17-20 The
recent development of a simpler device
for self-monitoring of anticoagulation using blood obtained by finger pricking has
facilitated patient acceptance.14 In this
study, only 2 patients randomized to the
intervention group did not want to perform self-monitoring throughout the
study. Seven patients from the control
group who originally agreed to continue without anticoagulation selfmanagement for the 6-month duration
of the study opted for this form of
self-treatment outside of the study
protocol.
We assessed 3 laboratory INR values
in each patient in a blinded fashion. Based
on this evaluation, the probability of the
laboratory INR value at follow-up being within the therapeutic target range
was significantly higher in the intervention group. This was mainly due to a
lower frequency of INR values below the
target level of anticoagulation. A possible explanation could be that patients
performing self-monitoring adjust the anticoagulant dosage whenever necessary
more adequately compared with the routine physician care. Other factors in the
intervention group, such as more frequent monitoring and the patient education program, may also contribute to
this difference. Outcomes also improved in the control group, possibly because at baseline and at the 3-month follow-up, the control group patients were
advised with regard to improving their
anticoagulation control. Hence, the somewhat smaller difference between the
study groups at the 6-month follow-up
did not occur because of a loss of the beneficial effect in the intervention group,
but rather was due to an improvement
in the control group.
About two thirds of patients had INR
values outside the target range at baseline. This level of anticoagulation control has been documented elsewhere,21
but other studies using different definitions have reported the proportion of patients with poor anticoagulation control to be about one third.22-24 The
relatively high number of patients with
poor control initially may have been
caused by a rather high percentage of patients with relatively recent anticoagulation25 and/or relatively narrow INR
ranges in some cases. In this study, 138
patients had had anticoagulation less than
2 years and 105 had an INR target range
below 1.1; of these patients 70% and
71% had INR values outside the target
range at baseline compared with 62% and
61% of patients with a longer anticoagulation duration and a wider INR target
range, respectively.
Whether self-monitoring of anticoagulation resulted in the intervention effect or the effect was due to other components of the program cannot be
determined from this study. However, we
believe that proper self-management of
oral anticoagulation should not be done
without self-monitoring and a structured extensive teaching program.
This study was too small and too short
to assess the effect of self-management
on bleeding and thromboembolic complications. However, since this form of
anticoagulation therapy results in a lower
frequency of suboptimal anticoagulation values without increasing the rate
of excessive values, we expect that thromboembolic complications would be reduced in a larger, longer study.
We estimate the total cost of selfmonitoring 1 INR value to be about 9 European Currency Unit (ECU) (>$11 US).
This calculation is based on the costs over
a 5-year period of 1 patient enrolling in
a structured teaching and treatment program (150 ECU), 1 CoaguChek device
(1030 ECU), 52 test strips per year (180
ECU), 52 lancets per year (7 ECU), and
4 control solutions per year (1.5 ECU).
In Germany, patients taking oral anticoagulation therapy are usually advised to
visit a physician for control of the INR
values twice a month. The estimated
mean cost for such a visit is 16 ECU.

Therefore, even by only reducing the outpatient visits by 50% to once a month
(in patients performing INR selfmonitoring) this form of therapy will be
cost-effective. However, a comprehensive evaluation of the cost-effectiveness
has to include the costs of thromboembolic and bleeding complications. Since
this was not in the scope of this study, a
full evaluation must be left to larger investigations aimed at reducing the clinical end points.
Patients receiving oral anticoagulation therapy often worry about complications, dietary limitations, less freedom when traveling, frequent and
sometimes difficult venous punctures,
and regular visits to physicians and laboratories. These factors are likely to decrease quality of life. In this study we have
shown that when anticoagulant therapy
is based on self-monitoring and selfmanagement, most aspects of treatmentrelated quality of life do improve. In addition, when patients travel, INR values
are determined by a variety of laboratories, and differences due to the reagents
and clot timers may be important26 and
result in unwarranted changes of therapy.
Therefore, INR self-monitoring has the
additional advantage of consistency of
testing performed by a single system.
In conclusion, self-management of oral
anticoagulation can be performed by
patients, can improve patients’ reported treatment-related quality of life,
and may potentially improve medical
outcomes. Larger studies with longer follow-up are needed to determine the
efficacy of this form of therapy in reducing bleeding complications and thromboembolic events.
