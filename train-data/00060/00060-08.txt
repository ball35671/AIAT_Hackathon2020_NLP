Abstract
Objective To determine the clinical effectiveness of self
management compared with routine care in patients on long
term oral anticoagulants.
Design Multicentre open randomised controlled trial.
Setting Midlands region of the UK.
Participants 617 patients aged over 18 and receiving warfarin
randomised to intervention (n = 337) and routine care (n = 280)
from 2470 invited; 193/337 (57%) completed the 12 month
intervention.
Intervention Intervention patients used a point of care device
to measure international normalised ratio twice a week and a
simple dosing chart to interpret their dose of warfarin.
Main outcome measure Percentage of time spent within the
therapeutic range of international normalised ratio.
Results No significant differences were found in percentage of
time in the therapeutic range between self managment and
routine care (70% v 68%). Self managed patients with poor
control before the study showed an improvement in control
that was not seen in the routine care group. Nine patients
(2.8/100 patient years) had serious adverse events in the self
managed group, compared with seven (2.7/100 patient years)
in the routine care arm (2
(df = 1) = 0.02, P = 0.89).
Conclusion With appropriate training, self management is safe
and reliable for a sizeable proportion of patients receiving oral
anticoagulation treatment. It may improve the time spent within
the therapeutic range for patients with initially poor control.
Trial registration ISRCTN 19313375.
Introduction
Increasing numbers of patients need oral anticoagulation
treatment, so alternative management models are needed.1 2
Around 950 000 people in the United Kingdom are taking
warfarin,3–5 and the service load for monitoring anticoagulation
is predicted to increase by a factor of five over the next decade.6
The international normalised ratio (INR) measures the level
of the anticoagulation induced clotting defect; the incidence of
adverse events is related to the intensity of treatment.7 Point of
care devices have been shown to be reliable for estimating INR.8
Small observational and randomised studies, generally within
private healthcare systems, suggest that point of care testing is an
appropriate way to enable self management of oral anticoagulation by patients.9–11 However, these studies were small and in
select populations, and the lack of robust trial data for systematic
reviews has led to the conclusion that more data from large scale
randomised controlled trials are needed.12–14 The UK is a
challenging environment for trials of anticoagulation self
management—clinical effectiveness and cost effectiveness are
more difficult to demonstrate, as routine care within the NHS is
better than routine care reported in previous self management
studies in countries without socialised health care. Any new
model of care will therefore have to show levels of control of
greater than 60% of time within the therapeutic range of INR to
be deemed safe and a greater than 10% superiority over routine
care to be deemed superior.13 The advantages for healthcare
policy of doing such trials in the UK are considerable, as the
comparator population will represent realistic “best practice”
anywhere, and the results of any trial would therefore be valid
and generalisable.15–17
This paper reports clinical outcomes of the first UK, and the
largest worldwide, study of non-selected patients to investigate
self management of oral anticoagulation. Cost effectiveness,
quality of life, and training aspects18 are reported separately elsewhere.
Methods
We identified patients from primary care centres within the UK
Midlands Research Consortium (MidReC). We purposively sampled centres to cover rural and suburban centres with a
socioeconomic range of patients. We identified eligible patients
from practice generated computer lists. These were patients aged
18 or over, with a long term (greater than 12 months) indication
for oral anticoagulation,19 who had taken warfarin for at least six
months with a target INR of 2.5 or 3.5. Patient recruitment took
place in three phases: 15 practices in phase 1 (April 2001), 15
practices in phase 2 (September 2001), and 19 practices in phase
3 (April 2002).
Administrators verified computer lists to remove patients
who had discontinued warfarin, moved away, or died. We asked
general practitioners to remove only those patients they believed
should be excluded from the trial on clinical or social grounds.
Remaining patients were sent written invitations to participate in
the study. Patients or carers (defined as someone who takes care
of the patient but not employed to do so) who gave a positive
response were invited to an information session in the patients’
general practice.
We allocated consenting patients to intervention or routine
care by central telephone randomisation using a variable block
sized random allocation. Phases 1 and 2 were randomised 1:1,
whereas phase 3 was randomised 3:2 in favour of the
intervention (agreed by the Trial Steering Committee) because
of the initial dropout rate. We asked intervention patients to
attend two training sessions.18 Trained anticoagulation nurses
gave patients training at the practice. This covered the theory of
anticoagulation, the INR, INR targets, how to measure and interpret INR, how to adjust dose, and quality control. Patients who
did not attend training sessions were withdrawn and returned to
routine care. After the training, patients considered capable of
doing self management were given home testing equipment

managed their own anticoagulation for 12 months, testing INR
every two weeks (one week after a dose change). They adjusted
dosage by using a laminated dosing schedule based on a traffic
light system, where green represented INR within target range
(no dose adjustment), amber represented INR slightly high or
low (minor dose adjustment dependent on stable dose), and red
represented INR too high or too low (contact a healthcare professional). Patients were instructed to do internal quality control
tests if they got an unusual INR result or started a new box of test
strips. Intervention patients were reviewed at a practice based
clinic every three months to assess progress and to do external
quality assessment procedures.
Patients not considered capable of self management were
asked to return to routine care. Similarly, at the three month
assessment patients not safely self managing (for example, using
multiple finger pricks to obtain INR results) were returned to
routine care. Other reasons for withdrawal were self withdrawal
and serious adverse events. Routine care patients continued
attending either hospital or practice based anticoagulant clinics.
The primary outcome measure was therapeutic INR control
determined by the percentage of time spent within the
therapeutic range.20 We collected adverse event data from
general practice records. We defined serious adverse events as
those needing treatment or medical evaluation. An independent
adverse event committee (comprising a neurologist, a haematologist, and a general practitioner) were responsible for classifying serious adverse events at the end of the trial.
Patients withdrawn from the intervention completed the
study off the assigned treatment, and we collected INR data and
included them in the intention to treat analysis. Patients who
reached a study end point (discontinued warfarin, withdrew consent, or died) or were lost to follow-up (moved away) had no further INR data collected.
Study power and analysis plan
We did analyses by intention to treat (all patients randomised to
intervention group), on treatment (patients actually receiving
intervention), and off treatment (intervention data from patients
who discontinued the intervention early).
For the primary outcome, if INR control in terms of percentage of time spent within the therapeutic range in both groups
was equivalent at a level of 10%, with 5% significance and 80%
power, we needed 261 patients in each group (total 522). For
comparisons of percentage time in range we established a common dataset for all analyses, which included information on time
in range in both the pre-study (six months before inclusion in
study) and study periods.
We used the paired t test and the Wilcoxon signed rank test
for comparisons of patients’ quantitative results between the prestudy and study periods. We used the two sample t test and the
Mann-Whitney test for quantitative comparisons between different groups of patients. For comparisons of proportions of
patients the equivalent tests were McNemar’s test and the 2 test.
The purpose of the non-parametric Wilcoxon and MannWhitney tests was to confirm the results of the t test, which, in
broad terms, was the outcome in each case. Because of
occasional missing data for individual comparisons, the degrees
of freedom of some t tests varied slightly from those to be
expected if all patients had supplied all items of data.
Results
In all, 2530 patients from 49 practices were eligible (mean
51/practice, range 8-119). Total practice populations ranged
from 2150 to 14500 patients (mean 7831/practice). Only 60
(2%) patients were excluded by their general practitioner (mainly
because of terminal illness), leaving 2470 patients who were
invited to participate in the study, of whom 1888 (76%)
responded; 1156 declined to participate, and 732 agreed to
attend an information session to discuss participation in the trial.
Of those who initially agreed to attend, 48 (7%) did not attend
the information sessions and 45 (6%) were unwilling to provide
informed consent. A further 22 (3%) were excluded by researchers (figure).
Of patients initially agreeing to attend the information
session, 617 (84%) gave written informed consent and were randomised to the intervention or routine care arm of the study
(337 intervention, 280 routine care). The number of patients per
practice randomised ranged from 2 to 35 (mean 13). Of all
patients invited to take part in the study, 617/2470 (25%) were
recruited (10-63% per practice). Significantly more men than
women were invited to enter the study (1366 (55%) male v 1104
(45%) female, P < 0.001) and randomised into the study (400
(65%) male v 217 (35%) female, P < 0.001). The mean age of
those invited to participate was 69 (range 18-95) compared with
a mean of 65 for those recruited (range 18-87). Routine care
patients were older than intervention patients (66 v 64,
P = 0.015). In the intervention group, the mean age of those
completing training was significantly lower than that of those
initially randomised (61 v 64, P = 0.012).
Clinical indications for warfarin in rank order were atrial
fibrillation, mechanical prosthetic heart valves, recurrent pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis, cardiomyopathy, and
transient ischaemic attack or stroke. We found no significant differences between intervention and routine care in terms of coronary risk factors. Hypertension was the most widespread risk
factor (143, 42% intervention v 136, 49% routine care), followed
by hyperlipidaemia (84, 25% v 61, 22%).
Of 337 patients randomised to intervention, 242 (72%)
attended and successfully completed training. Ten (3%) did not
attend training, 80 (24%) did not complete training, and five (1%)
reached a study end point (three patients discontinued warfarin,
one patient withdrew consent, and one patient died). Main
reasons for not completing training were difficulties with obtaining a large enough blood sample or placing it correctly on to the
test strip. Of the 242 patients who completed training, 193 (80%)
completed the intervention. Thirty four (14%) patients did not
complete the intervention, and 15 patients reached a study end
point (seven discontinued warfarin, four died, and four moved
away).
In the routine care group, five patients had no data collected
(one withdrew permission for data to be collected from the
medical records, one discontinued warfarin, two died, and one
began to self monitor immediately after randomisation). Twenty
five patients reached a study end point (nine died, 14 discontinued warfarin, and two moved away). Of the 280 patients
randomised to routine care, 250 (89%) completed 12 months.
The mean frequency of testing before the study was 38.1
(95% confidence interval 36 to 40.2) days in the intervention
group and 37.9 (35.6 to 40.2) days in the routine care group.
During the study period, the mean frequency of testing was 12.4
(11.9 to 12.9) days in the intervention group and 37.9 (37.1 to
40.1) days in the routine care group.

Therapeutic INR control
In the intention to treat analysis, we found no significant
differences mean percentage of time within the therapeutic
range for INR between pre-study and study periods in either the
intervention arm (t320 = 1.57, P = 0.12) or the routine care arm
(t255 = − 0.37, P = 0.71) (table 2). INR control based on mean percentage of time within the therapeutic range during the study
did not differ significantly between the intervention and routine
care groups (70% v 68%; t575 = 1.35, P = 0.18).
In the intention to treat patients, we found a significant
difference in the percentage of time within the therapeutic range
for INR in pre-study and study periods between patients with
therapeutic targets of 2.5 and 3.5 in both groups. Intervention
group: pre-study 74% versus 45% (t319 = 7.46, P < 0.001); study
74% versus 55% (t319 = 7.48, P < 0.001). Routine care: pre-study
72% versus 52% (t254 = 3.70, P < 0.001); study 71% versus 53%
(t254 = 4.70, P < 0.001).
In the intervention group patients with a target of 3.5, a significant improvement occurred between pre-study and study
(45% v 55%; t65 = 2.77, P = 0.007). No significant difference
occurred in intervention group patients with a target of 2.5 (73%
v 74%; t254 = 0.29, P = 0.77) or the routine care patients with
either a target of 2.5 (72% v 71%; t217 = − 0.44, P = 0.66) or a target of 3.5 (52% v 53%; t37 = 0.07, P = 0.94) (table 3).
If we examine the distributions of percentage of time in
range by centiles, patients in the intervention group who were
poorly controlled at baseline (defined as time in range below the
median) showed a significant increase from pre-study to study,
whereas those in the routine care group did not. The magnitude
of this improvement was approximately 20% (95% confidence
interval 9% to 32%) for the 3.5 target group and around 15%
(6% to 24%) for the 2.5 target group. In the routine care group a
change of 3-5% occurred in both 2.5 and 3.5 target groups.
We found no significant difference in the number of patients
within their individual therapeutic range, based on the last INR
result recorded within the study period (intervention 70% v routine care 72%) (table 4). We found a significant difference in
point prevalence in the intervention group patients between
those with a target of 2.5 and those with a target of 3.5 (73% v
60%; P = 0.05).
Finally, table 5 records the differences evident in tables 2, 3,
and 4 between intervention and routine care patient groups. In
every case but one no significant difference exists between results
from the two groups. The only marginal exception is in the case
of INR percentage time in range for the 2.5 therapeutic target
group in the study phase of the trial. However, once adjustment
is made for the difference in pre-study levels (recorded in the
right hand column) a significant difference no longer exists. The
significance of the effect of the intervention for the 3.5 therapeutic target group is inevitably reduced here because of the extra
uncertainty included in the comparison.
Discussion
This study is the largest to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of
patient self management of oral anticoagulation compared with
routine care. Study recruitment was non-selective; the comparator provided good control of international normalised ratio
(INR), both enhancing generalisability and reflecting real life.
Overall, only 25% of eligible patients were randomised. A recent
smaller Dutch clinic based study had a similar recruitment rate,16
although a Spanish study managed to recruit nearly 50% of eligible patients.17 Whether the relatively low recruitment rate
relates to the demands of self management or the fact that
patients were being asked to participate in a trial is not clear. In
Germany, where self managed anticoagulation is routine, up to
80% of patients are able to self manage.21 This may reflect the
reimbursement system as well as the motivation and ability of
patients to do self management.
Training
Of those patients who were randomised to self management
most (72%) were able to complete training, and 78% of those
who started self management were able to complete 12 months.
Self management is therefore a feasible model of care for an
appreciable proportion of patients.

The study population was younger than the invited
population, and men were more likely to participate. Patients
who completed the intervention were younger than those
randomised. Around half of the study patients had atrial fibrillation as their primary indication for warfarin.
Therapeutic control
We found no overall significant differences between the study
arms for the primary outcome measure. Therapeutic INR
control was good in both arms; both groups spent around 70%
of time within their therapeutic range, which is comparable to
the Dutch study (68.6% in the self management group) and significantly better than the Spanish group (58.6%).16 17 In keeping
with previous studies, patients with a target INR of 3.5
(principally patients with mechanical heart valves) had poorer
therapeutic control than those with a target INR of 2.5. Examining the change from pre-study to study for self managed patients
separately for those with targets of 2.5 and 3.5 revealed that
those with poorer control, as monitored by time in range,
improved from pre-study to study. The improvement was
approximately 15% in the 2.5 target group and 20% in the 3.5
target group. This was not the case in the routine care group. Self
management is thus an effective and safe model of care for
patients who have been trained appropriately and may even represent the model of choice for patients who are poorly controlled in routine care.
Routine care
Patients in the routine care group were managed through a variety of different models, ranging from hospital outpatient clinics
to primary care clinics. The therapeutic control seen compared
favourably with previously published data.5 Adverse event rates
also compared favourably with previously published international data; the overall adverse event rate was 2.8% compared
with 7.3% in the Spanish study and approximately 4.5% in the
Dutch study.16 17 22 The comparator to self management in this
study was therefore robust.
Limitations
The study was limited, as are other studies, by the parameters set
down for patients doing self management. Patients were asked to
do an INR test every two weeks, with weekly testing
recommended after a dose change. Although this makes
comparison with routine care problematic, it reflects the reality
of the current models of service provision. The three month
clinical reviews generally worked well, but again there were a few
patients who had difficulty attending these sessions.
Only 25% of patients agreed to participate, but this probably
reflects reluctance to participate in a trial and a high level of satisfaction with current services rather than a reluctance to self
manage. A quarter of patients did not complete training,
however, and a further fifth withdrew prematurely, which
suggests that barriers to self management exist above and
beyond those to taking part in research. The findings warrant
further research before self monitoring is commissioned more
widely in the UK (as in Germany), as demand from patients may
be limited.
Conclusions
For an appreciable number of motivated patients on oral anticoagulation, self management is a safe and realisable alternative to
existing models of care in healthcare systems with high quality
routine anticoagulation management. This model of care is particularly effective for treating patients with poor INR control,
who are a difficult population to manage and are at risk of
adverse events. Now that self management for anticoagulation
has been shown to be as safe and effective as routine care, it
would be valid to test whether this reassurance alters patients’
(and health professionals’) equipoise in considering whether to
accept self management in this context.

What is already known on this topic
Self management for oral anticoagulation has been shown
to be effective in highly selected populations within
healthcare environments not comparable to the UK
What this study adds
Self management for oral anticoagulation is safe and
effective for a sizeable minority of patients receiving
warfarin
For patients who have been appropriately trained, self
management is as clinically effective as routine care
provided by UK oral anticoagulation clinics
Fewer patients than anticipated wished to self manage their
oral anticoagulation
