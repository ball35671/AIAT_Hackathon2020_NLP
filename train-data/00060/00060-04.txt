Abstract
Background and Objective: We have developed an expert computer
system for the control of oral anticoagulation therapy, accessible by
the patients via their own computer. To investigate if the weekly
measurement and dosing of international normalized ratio (INR) at
home using the online Internet-based system was superior to conventional treatment, we performed a randomized, controlled trial.
Patients and Methods: All 669 patients in our anticoagulation
clinic were asked to participate in the trial, providing that they had
Internet access and could use the CoaguChek XS system. A total of
140 patients were included and randomized to (A) once weekly
measurement and report online, (B) twice weekly measurement and
report online, and (C) continued conventional treatment with INR
measurement in the lab every 4 weeks and dose adjustment by letter.
Results: Group A had 79.7% (95% CI 79.0–80.3) of time in therapeutic range (TTR), group B 80.2% (95% CI 79.4–80.9) of TTR,
and group C 72.7% (95% CI 71.9–73.4) TTR. Groups A and B
perform statistically significantly better than the conventional group
C, with a difference of TTR of 7% points (p < 2.2 · 1016), whereas
no difference was seen between A and B. Conclusion: Home measurement of INR and the reporting and dosing of results online once a
week increase TTR from 72% to 79% as compared to conventional
computer-assisted monitoring in an anticoagulation clinic.

Introduction
T
raditionally oral anticoagulation with warfarin or phenprocoumon has been monitored in patients visiting hospitalbased clinics on a monthly basis. Usually, the patient
presents to an office or at a laboratory drawing center,
where a venous blood sample is taken and transported to the laboratory for analysis. In the laboratory a prothrombin time is performed, and the result is expressed in international normalized ratio
(INR) as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO), making
the result worldwide transferable and usable. After a variable length
of time, in some hospitals within an hour and in others after a day, the
result is available to the patient’s physician. The physician reviews
the patients result and after consulting the patient’s medical record,
with information on present dose of drug, previous INR level, target
for INR, and therapeutic range according to diagnosis, determines a
clinical course of action and/or drug dose adjustment. The patient is
contacted, usually by writing and in some cases by phone, and is
given the instructions for drug intake and next date of measurement.1
This is traditionally managed in a paper record system.
Due to an unacceptable frequency of adverse events caused by
mistakes or failures in correct dosing or transfer of prescription doses
to paper, many clinics in Denmark have started using electronic
expert systems or electronic patient record systems for the managing
of these chronic patients.
Due to the widening indications for oral anticoagulation especially
atrial fibrillation during the last 15 years and the increase in age of the
population, the number of patients on anticoagulation has increased
in Denmark from estimated 10,000 patients out of 5.5 mill population
in treatment in 1993 to 90,000 in 2007.2 The current demand for oral
anticoagulation therapy is expected to increase up to sixfold by 20503
and this imposes a severe burden on the healthcare system.
In our local clinic the number of patients has increased from 250 to
around 700. To cope with this burden we developed our AC anticoagulation computer system (CSO/AC; IntraMed A/S, Værløse,
Denmark) to be accessible for the patients via the Internet.4 Figure 1
shows the user interface, and Figure 2 shows the architecture of the
installation. According to Danish law, this is only legal if security
rules are followed, including controlling identity via both civil registration number and a digital signature system (OCES), administered
by the Danish National IT and Telecom Agency.5
From 2006 to 2008, we conducted pilot studies on the system’s
functionality and also performed a pilot study with 15 patients on
self-testing on the CoaguChek S system (Roche Diagnostics A/S,
Hvidovre, Denmark), reporting the INR online to the CSO patient
record system.
The reception of an INR measurement prompts an immediate demand for attention in the anticoagulation clinics computer screen. The
attending doctor handles the patients within an hour, creating a letter of
future dosage, accessible immediately on the patient’s own PC.
Based on the patient experience with the functionality of the
system and the convenience for the patients, saving time and
transport expenses, we decided to find out, whether the system would
increase quality of treatment, as measured by time in therapeutic
range (TTR).6

Materials and Methods
STUDY DESIGN
A randomized, controlled trial (RCT) was carried out at the anticoagulation clinic in the Vejle County Hospital to test the hypothesis
that patient self-testing (PST) using an online access to the anticoagulation (AC) clinic might be superior to standard anticoagulation
control. All (669) patients in treatment at the AC clinic received a letter
explaining about the investigation and they were asked—provided they
had a computer, had Internet access, and were willing to measure with
the point-of-care test system at home—whether they would like to
participate in this three-armed controlled trial. Those willing to participate, 140 patients, were randomized to one of three groups: group
A, measuring INR at home once a week; group B, measuring INR twice
a week; and group C, continuing regular visits to the AC clinic for the
next year before being switched to the PST methodology.
This study was approved by the Science Ethics Committee in the
Region of Southern Denmark (Project-ID: S-20080053). The primary
outcome, quality of anticoagulation treatment, TTR for the single
patient depending on each patients own therapeutic range during the
study period, was recorded according to the Rosendaal method.6
Secondary outcomes were the number of INR measurements below
1.5 or above 5.0. Numbers of adverse clinical events were recorded
but were too infrequent to be of value.
SAMPLE SIZE AND STATISTIC ANALYSIS
Our expectation was that the TTR would increase 10% based on
previous studies.7 Based on statistics for the conventional treatment,
it was seen that during 300 days
of observation for the single
patient the range of days within
TR was from 150 to 300 days, the
estimated standard deviation
(SD) then 30 days. As the mean
was 210 days and we wanted to
detect an increase of 30 days,
with a type 1 risk of 1% and a
power to detect the difference of
95%, 35 patients were needed in
each group for at least 300 days.
Hence, 140 patients were randomized to the three groups.
The primary variable was TTR
as measured with the Rosendaal
method in each arm. The difference in TTR between groups A,
B, and C was calculated using
chi-squared test, t-tests, or the
nonparametric equivalent where
appropriate using the R-software
(R Foundation for Statistical
Computing, Vienna, Austria).
Each patient in groups A, B,
and C, respectively, was also
compared to the previous 12-month period if data were available, and
statistics performed with the paired sample Wilcoxon rank sum test.
STUDY POPULATION
All included patients were on lifelong therapy and been in treatment for at least 6 months. They were asked to participate on the
condition that they were willing to accept a randomization to a
control group continuing conventional care for the next 12 months.
The participants should be able to use the Internet and demonstrate
their ability to use the CoaguChek XS system for measuring INR after
a 1-h teaching session. Patients were excluded from group A if they
had more than two intervals longer than 3 weeks without testing. In
group B, patients excluded for having more than two intervals longer
than 2 weeks. In group C, patients were excluded for having more
than two intervals longer than 5 weeks. In all groups, patients were
excluded if they had a one period longer than 60 days without testing.
RECRUITMENT
All participants received a letter asking them to participate and
explaining the design of the study. Patients responding were further
informed by the staff and evaluated for their ability to cope and
participate in the investigation.
EDUCATION AND TRAINING
Patients in groups A and B were educated in using the computer interface and the CoaguChek XS point-of-care test system
within *2 h. All patients in treatment at the clinic are aware of the
Fig. 1. User interface for the AC anticoagulation computer system.

theoretical aspects of anticoagulation, mechanism of action, meaning and importance of INR values and target ranges, diet and lifestyle,
and symptoms of over-coagulation, drug interaction, and compliance. Group C was not trained beyond this education.
The patients’ ability to measure correctly was tested by comparing
obtained values from the point-of-care instrument to the laboratory
result. Patients and the point-of-care instrument were accepted if
able to measure within 0.5 INR of difference. One patient was unable
to measure within 0.5 and was excluded before randomization.
The randomization program QuickCalcs (GraphPad Software, Inc.,
La Jolla, CA) generated a random allocation sequence and the patients were assigned to group A, B, or C accordingly. The trial was
unblinded. The patients received a manual for online access and
reporting of their INR and further on the communication system
connected to the reporting of the single INR measurement (e-mail
system integrated in the EPJ-expert system). They entered the study
immediately after training consecutively over a period of 1 year
(from April 22, 2008).
MANAGEMENT OF PST PATIENTS
Group A measured once a week and group B twice a week and
reported the single value, which was acted upon by the AC clinic by
adjusting dose for the following period and reported via the system. If patients reported problems
or asked questions on the parallel mail system, they
were answered by the AC staff or contacted via
telephone. The AC staff responded within 4 h to
reported INR values. Patients not reporting their
INR within the agreed time were alerted through
mail by letter. Patients observing values below 1.5
or above 5 were alerted by the system to contact the
clinic immediately as was the rule for changes
exceeding biological possible limits. The doctors,
three junior and two senior, in the clinic decided all
changes in medication in the same way for groups
A, B, and C.
Every half-year the patients visited the clinic to
make a parallel measurement on their point-of-care
system with the laboratory method. All fulfilled the
demand of maximum difference of 0.5 INR.
TRADITIONAL MONITORING
Patients randomized to group C visited the clinic
according to the usual rules of measurements being
maximum 4 weeks, but dependable on percentage
change in warfarin-dose with shorter time interval.
INR analysis was performed on a STAGO STA-R
Evolution (DIAGNOSTICA STAGO, Asnie`res sur
Seine, France) dose adjustments were performed by
the attending doctor. The CSO/AC anticoagulation

expert system (IntraMed A/S) was used for decision support and
registration. The expert system suggested both a new dose and a new
measurement date both adjustable by the doctor.
ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING
Patients reported via the mail system or by telephone any incident
during the period, including hospitalizations. Hospitalizations were
recorded through a discharge letter from the department, and
checked for every single patient in the electronic hospital database.

This represented *20% of the anticoagulation clinic population as
a whole. Seventeen patients were withdrawn for the following reasons. In group A, five persons were withdrawn for having more than
two intervals longer than 3 weeks without testing. In group B, three
patients were withdrawn for having more than two intervals longer
than 2 weeks. In group C, four patients were withdrawn for having
more than two intervals longer than 5 weeks and five patients were
withdrawn for having one interval longer than 60 days without
testing. In all circumstances they returned to the program. Absences
were caused by personal and family reasons.
One hundred twenty-three (n ¼ 123) completed the trial. Patient
demographics and indication of anticoagulation are shown in Table 1
compared to regular AC clinic. There were no significant difference
between the three groups, but the age and gender differed from the
AC clinic in general. There was not found any significant difference
between the groups and the AC clinic in the indication of anticoagulation and the target INR range.
OUTCOME
Data are shown in Tables 2 and 3.
The overall days in TR during the trial for the three groups were as
follows: group A, 12,288 of 15,427 days in TR (79.7%) (95% CI 79.0–
80.3); group B, 9,904 of 12,348 days (80.2%) (95% CI 79.4–80.9);
group C, 10,195 of 14,026 days in TR (72.7%) (95% CI 71.9–73.4).
Groups A and B performed statistically significantly better than the
conventional group C, with a difference in relative TTR of 7% points
( p < 2.2 · 1016), whereas no difference was seen between A and B,
once a week or twice a week.
The overall number of INR measurements in TR was in the same
period: group A, 1,635 of 2,087 measurements (78.3%) (95% CI 76.5–
80.1); group B, 2,407 of 2,979 measurements (80.8%) (95% CI 79.3–
82.1); group C, 616 of 916 measurements (67.2%) (95% CI 64.1–70.2).
The chi-squared test showed a statistical significant difference between groups A and B ( p ¼ 0.0321), and both performed significantly
better than group C ( p < 1.046 · 1010).
The individual relative TTR values are illustrated in Figure 4.
Mean INR is close to the target in all three groups but with a
difference in the variation. Kruskal–Wallis rank sum test shows that
there is no difference in the three groups mean values ( p ¼ 0.09476),
but that there is a difference in the SDs ( p ¼ 0.009794). (Before

looking at the variance of the INR measurements one patient with
extreme INR values was removed from group B.) Comparing SDs for
the individual groups shows that the SD for group C differs from both
groups A and B ( p < 0.04516) (Table 4).
ADVERSE EFFECTS
No patients died during the trial. One patient was admitted to
hospital during the trial. The reason for hospitalization was an INR
over 9. The next day the patient’s INR measured 5.1. No other adverse
effects were reported.
ANCILLARY ANALYSES
The chi-squared test was used to test whether the proportion of
number of INR measurements in and outside TR are equal in the
groups for a similar period before the trial and in the trial. Group C
was the only one that had the same proportions of INR measurement
in and outside TR as would be expected as that group continued in
conventional treatment (Table 5). (Chi-squared test for TTR showed
no equal proportions.)
DOSING
Comparison of mean doses for the individual patient before and in
the trial is performed with the Wilcoxon rank sum test. The p-values
are shown in Table 6. None of the groups showed a statistically
significant change in doses from before the trial, nor did the SD of the
individual patient dose show any significant change.
Discussion
This study is the second largest RCT study in observed patient
years yet to evaluate the quality of oral anticoagulation using patient
self-testing and Internet patient-to-doctor communication via direct
patient access to the electronic record system. Further, one weekly
measurement was compared to twice a week.
In total, 123 patients completed the trial spanning 114 patients
years. These numbers narrow the confidence limits to a minimum
and reduce p-values. Using an electronic system for conventional
hospital-based measurement and dosing, the TTR was 72.7% over
an average of 1 year with 95% CI of 71.9%–73.9%. Using once-aweek home measurement, the TTR was 79.7%, 95% CI 79.0%–80.3%,
p-value for statistically significant difference based on actual number of days being <2.2 · 1016.

Thus, the main conclusion of this study is that the TTR increased
from 73% to 80%, a percentage difference 7% (95% CI 6.0%–7.9%).
No advantage was found measuring INR twice a week, the difference to once a week being nonsignificant p ¼ 0.2516. Twice a
week being considerable more expensive, the advantage is too inferior to be applied in daily practice.
The stability of INR values over a year was better for self-testing,
the SD of the single patient in the once a week group being 0.44 INR
against the conventional control group 0.55 INR ( p < 0.045).
In the secondary outcome parameters, the number of INR measurements below 1.5 or above 5.0 showed no significant difference
between groups A and B ( p ¼ 0.92), and both were significant better
than group C ( p < 2.0 · 106
).
No patients died during the trial. Only one patient was admitted to
hospital during the trial. The reason for hospitalization was an INR over
9, without bleeding. We believe that this remarkable finding is caused
by the patients who chose to participate are younger and more engaged,
knowledgeable, computer literate, and, in general, in better health.
The TTR of 80% is, to our knowledge, the highest published value
in RCT until now. A recent article had a TTR with conventional versus
PST of 59% and 74%, but with wide confidence intervals caused by a
relatively low number of 66 observation years for 132 patients, and
with measurement every 4.6 days.7 The Dabigatran study8 had only
60% in TTR, using conventional management.
The absolute value of TTR is important as it is a marker for the risk
of bleeding and thrombosis. A 10% difference in TTR thus corresponds to an increased risk of 1.29 for mortality, 1.10 for stroke, and
1.12 for other thrombolic events.9
We observed the same mean INR in the three groups, meaning that
there was no tendency for the doctors to be more cautious in the
control group.
Comparing outcome parameters in the single patient in the period
1 year before trial and during trial, the above observations from the
RCT were reaffirmed, as the groups with once and twice weekly
measurements improved (Table 5), whereas the control group showed
no improvement. This demonstrated the absence of a Hawthorne or
placebo effect. This was true even though the frequency of testing
increased from every 21.3 days to every 15.3 days in the conventional control group. This can be explained by the doctors being more
careful, repeating measurements more than usual.
A concern using point-of-care testing instruments is always that
the measurements have a bias or an increased analytical imprecision.
For the CoaguChek XS the analytical quality has been thoroughly
documented,10–14 and our finding that patient SDs are smaller than
during conventional treatment emphasizes this. Thus, the analytical
imprecision is unimportant in relation to patient variation.15,16
A possible bias of the CoaguChek XS system was controlled by
parallel measurements toward the Stago laboratory method and acceptable difference were seen (data not shown).
To monitor a possible drift in electronics during the trial period,
the average dose of warfarin before and during the RCT was calculated. As Table 6 shows no increase or decrease in average weekly
dose was seen for the single patient or the groups, demonstrating that
the CoaguChek XS monitors were without clinical significant measurement bias.
The reduced SD for INR values during PST could be expected to
reflect more frequent and finer adjustment of the INR dose. This is,
however, not seen, as the SD of dose in mg/week did not change
significantly though the PST; groups A and B showed lower values
against group C’s increased values. We do believe, however, that the
more frequent testing enables smaller adjustments to keep INR in
therapeutic range. A larger study is needed to confirm this.
When comparing patient self-management (PSM) (testing and
self-dosing) against PST as in this article, it seems that quality of
management is better with PST, 79.7% of time in TR against 70.2%–
74% for PSM.17–19
As PST is expensive in medical manpower as compared to PSM, we
will now randomize our 180 patients currently in PST to continue in
PST or self-dosing via the expert computer system, to see if quality
can be maintained.
In conclusion, we believe that to have documented that managing
patients anticoagulation by telemedicine and based on home measurement of INR is safe and possibly of a better quality as measured by
TTR than patients’ self-management. Patient preference and satisfaction using this telemedical solution will be reported in a separate article.
