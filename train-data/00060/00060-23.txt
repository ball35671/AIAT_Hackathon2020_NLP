Summary
Self-management is safe and reliable in patients with long-term
oral anticoagulation (OAC).However,no study has yet assessed
the safety and efficacy of OAC self-management in elderly patients with major thromboembolic and haemorrhagic complications as primary outcomes. In this multi-centre, open,randomised controlled trial,patients aged 60 years or more were randomised into the self-management group (SMG) (N=99) orroutine care group (RCG) (N=96).We describe the rationale, design, baseline characteristics and interim analyses of oral anticoagulation control quality within the first year of follow-up.The
medians of the squared international normalised ratio (INR)
value deviations after six and 12 months were significantly lower

Introduction
Oral anticoagulation (OAC) has been shown to be highly effective in preventing thromboembolic complications in patients for
whom it is indicated (1, 2). Numerous studies have documented
that elderly patients seem to benefit most from OAC therapy (1,
3, 4). Atrial fibrillation (AF), the incidence of which increases
with age and approaches 10% for individuals aged ≥80 years,
carries the main risk for stroke (5); and among elderly patients
without antithrombotic therapy, AF-related stroke is associated
witha30-day mortality of 24%. In contrast, only 6% of patients
on warfarin at the time of stroke and with an international normalised ratio (INR) of 2.0 or greater, died within 30 days (6).
Despite its proven benefit, numerous studies have reported reluctance in prescribing OAC due to a variety of barriers, especially
in the elderly (7–10).Risk of haemorrhage, which is in fact twice as
great in those over 70 years of age as in younger patients, is one of
the major determinants of refusal to prescribe OAC therapy (11,
12).The risk of stroke risessteeply in patientswith atrialfibrillation
when INR values are lower than 1.8 (13), and INR values greater
than 4 to5are rapidly associated with increased bleeding rates(14,
15). Due to relatively small therapeutic ranges, in reality often only
a small percentage of the INR values have been found to be within the targetrange, which can be low as 29% ofINR measurements,
asseen in routine care patients prior to participation in a randomised self-management programme study (16).

One way to improve OAC care is by introducing patients’
self-management of OAC therapy. In this context it is important
to differentiate between INR self-testing alone, and full selfmanagement. Self-management includes self-adaptation of the
anticoagulation treatment based on self-monitoring results after
the patients have participated in a structured instruction and
treatment programme. A systematic review of randomised controlled trials has shown that the anticoagulation status of selfmanaged patientsis betterthan or at least equivalent to that of patients monitored by specialised anticoagulation clinics or general practitioners(17), and in a recently published meta-analysis,
the thromboembolic event and death rates were significantly reduced (18) in patients with self-management. A study by Beyth
et al. (19) involving elderly patientsshowed that excessive bleeding rates can be successfully reduced under self-monitoring. To
date, there have been no randomised trials to evaluate the longterm effects of self-management of OAC in the elderly population.
Our study aims to provide answers to this important medical
question by examining elderly patients receiving long-term anticoagulation treatment and randomised into self-management
versus routine-care groups, with thromboembolic and haemorrhagic complications as primary outcomes. In this publication
we describe the rationale, design, baseline characteristics and interim analyses of OAC control after the first year of follow-up.
The final paper with the analysis of the primary end-points will
be published after conclusion ofthe study on February 28, 2007.
Methods
Participants
Four departmentsspecializing in the treatment of patientsreceiving long-term OAC therapy initially joined this multi-centre
study, which was approved by the ethics committees of all participating centres. On April 26, 2006, one centre was excluded
after an external expert opinion (personal communication) drew
attention to the large amount of data missing in the follow-up examinations. Of the 21 randomised patients in that centre, at least
half did not come for the first follow-up visit, and increasing
numbers failed to appear for subsequent visits. According to the
external review, no bias can be expected because randomisation
was performed within each participating centre, and the exclusion from analyses occurred before any calculations were made.
Data on these 21 patientsfrom the excluded centre will therefore
no longer be considered in this publication.
All consecutive patients on long-term anticoagulation
(n=458) presenting at the participating centres were screened
and, if eligible and willing to participate, were included in the
study. Inclusion criteria were indication forlong-term anticoagulation either with phenprocoumon or acenocoumarol and age
≥60 years. Patients were also eligible for participation if longterm anticoagulation was recently indicated and they had not
been on OAC treatment before. Exclusion criteria were previous
participation in a self-management OAC programme, severe
cognitive (assessed informally by study personnel) or terminal
illness. The patient was informed by the physician of his/her individually defined INR therapeutic target range.
The recruitment phase started in March 2002. Due to the
slow recruitment rate, the recruitment phase was extended for
one additional year and closed in February 2005. The study will
end on February 28, 2007, two years after the randomisation of
the last patient. The follow-up time will range from two to five
years.
Procedures
Patients were block-randomised by centre according to a computer-based system to either the self-management group (SMG)
or the routine-care group (RCG). Allocation was done by a central statistical office by fax and without awareness of subject
data. The sequence of randomisation was concealed until the patient was assigned toagroup.
All physician and nurse instructors involved in the patients'
training programme participated inatwo-day training course as
developed by Sawicki et al. (16), which was adapted and modified for the needs of elderly patients.The goals of the oral anticoagulation training and self-management programme were to
help patients in assuming increased responsibility for disease
management based on systematic INR value self-monitoring and
adjustment of the anticoagulant dosage. In addition, instructors
were trained in additional teaching skills for working with
elderly patients.
Patients assigned to the RCG participated inasingle 90-minute session including basic theoretical information on haemostasis, main characteristics of oral anticoagulants, potential risksfor
thromboembolism and bleeding, and problems that might be encountered in special situations such as exercise, travel and diet
changes. During the whole study period, they were advised with
regard to changes in the anticoagulant dosage by their usual attending physicians, either in general practice or at a hospitalbased specialised anticoagulation clinic.
In the SMG, patients participated in four consecutive weekly
instruction sessions of 90 to 120 minutes each, in groups of three
to six patients. During the first session, patients were informed
about anticoagulation in general and received extensive training
in INR self-monitoring using the whole blood PT/INR monitor
CoaguChek
® S (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany), which has been previously validated (20). During the first
week, patients were encouraged to measure INR values routinely
and to record the results and the anticoagulant dosages in their
diaries. The second session included instructions on preventing
bleeding and thromboembolic complications and provided more
detailed information on haemostasis. During the third session,
patients were instructed about indications and models for reducing or increasing the anticoagulant dosages to achieve INR values within the target range. Several examples of adapting drug dosage were discussed, and the patients completed practical exercises. In the last session, patients were informed about problems
that might develop with operations, illness, exercise, travel and
additional medications, and key information from the training
programmes was recapitulated. At the beginning of the second to
the fourth sessions, the quality of INR self-monitoring was
checked by the nurse instructor. After participation in the programme, the patients had to estimate their INR value with an absolute deviation of less than 0.4 from the reference value. If this
was not the case, the training course had to be repeated. After parDownloaded by: Glasgow University Library. Copyrighted material.

ticipation in the structured programme, the patients were given
their diaries and encouraged to control their INR values by selfmonitoring once a week, to adjust their anticoagulant dosage accordingly, and to contact the training centre in case of difficulties.
Follow-up visits were scheduled upon screening and after
randomisation for participation in the training courses, either
once or four timesin the RCG or the SMG, respectively, and then
every six months. At baseline and at each follow-up visit, there
was a clinical examination, and patients were questioned about
minor or major bleeding or thromboembolic events, any interim
illnesses, changes in long-term medications, and hospitalisations. Anticoagulation status was assessed by patient records
in the diaries expressed as INR values; a copy of the patient's
diary was made at each visit.

Outcome measures
The primary endpoint of the main trial after termination of the
study, as defined by the protocol, on February 28, 2007, two
years after the randomisation of the last patient, is the combined
endpoint of all thromboembolic events requiring hospitalisation
and all major bleeding complications. Associated complications
are evaluated and checked by two independent physicians who
are not involved in the trial and are unaware of patients’ study
group. Complications include any thromboembolic complication requiring hospitalisation: arterial embolism (e.g. stroke,
transient ischemic attack, myocardial infarction, peripheral arterial embolism), venous thromboembolism (e.g. deep venous
thrombosis, pulmonary embolism) and valve thrombosis. Bleeding complications are classified as major or minor according to
the criteria of Landefeld et al. (21, 22)
Secondary endpoints are frequency and duration of hospitalisation, mortality, recurrence of stroke, numbers of INR values
above 4.5 or lower than 1.7, treatment-related quality-of-life
analysis according a structured questionnaire as described and
validated by Sawicki (16), and cost-effectiveness evaluations.
Tertiary outcomes are the median ofsquared INR value deviation [INR – ½(upper value of target INR range + lower value of
target INR range)] (23), the percentage of individual patients'
INR values within the target range and the percentage of time
within target range as obtained by linear interpolation for each
patient as obtained from the patients' diaries. When more than
one INR measurement per patient per day was made, the median
of the daily values was used as point estimate.
The reason for using only patients' diary reports is that the
laboratory tests differ among each other (24). In both the SMG
(CoaguChek self measurement) and in the RCG (measurement
at the attending physician's office or at a hospital-based specialised anticoagulation clinic with its own in-house device), the
INR values were always measured with one and the same laboratory system, which presents the values according to the anticoagulant dosage adjustments made.
For the interim analyses presented in this paper, one year
after randomisation of the last patient, the primary outcome was
the efficacy of oral anticoagulation control reported asthe median squared INR value deviation [INR – ½(upper value of target
INR range + lower value of target INR range)] (23). Furthermore, we analysed the individual percentage of INR values
within the target range and the individual percentage of time
within target range. Due to the small numbers of thromboembolic events, major bleedings and deaths, no formal statistical
analyses was performed, and only absolute numbers are given in
this publication.
Sample size and statistical analysis
Based on previously published pilot studies (16, 25), the calculation of sample size required was based on the following assumptions.To detect a 50% reduction in thromboembolic events
and major bleedings between the two treatment groups assuming
a significance level of p= 0.05 and a power of 90%, a sample size
of 88 patients per group was needed. With a calculated dropout
rate of 10%, this calculation resulted inatotal of 200 patients.
For continuous variables, differences were assessed by the
Wilcoxon test, unpaired for between-group comparisons and
paired for within-group comparisons. Categorical data were
compared by Chi2
-tests. For the time-to-event analyses, Kaplan
Meier curves will be presented, and the log-rank test will be performed. Significance level wasset at p=0.05. Medians were used
because of the skewed distributions of the data. For the interim
analysis presented here,statistics were done using the R package
forstatistical computing (26), an open-source implementation of
the S-Plus software package.
Results
In all, 458 consecutive patients from the three evaluated centres
were assessed for eligibility; 263 were excluded for the reasons
described in the trial profile in Figure 1.
Of the 195 patients who were randomised, 99 patients were
randomised to the SMG and 96 patients to the RCG. Table 1
shows the baseline characteristics for both groups. No statistically significant differences were observed in the distribution
of the baseline variables age, gender and intended INR ranges.
Clinical indications for OAC were atrial fibrillation, mechanical
prosthetic heart valve, venousthromboembolism, pulmonary artery disease and others such as recurrent stroke, myocardial infarction, arterial embolism, ischemic and dilated cardiomyopathy, coronary artery bypass graft, peripheral arterial and venous bypass graft, polycythemia vera rubra and thrombophlebitis, and ventricular aneurysm. At baseline there were no significant differences between the groups in terms of co-morbidities,
previous thromboembolic and haemorrhagic complications and
other long-term medications. Ninety-one percent and 89% of patients were on phenprocoumon and 9% and 11% were on acenocoumarol in the SMG and RCG, respectively.
At baseline, the groups differed significantly with regard to
the therapeutic INR control obtained from the patients' diaries
during the year previous to randomisation. The median of the
squared INR value deviation was significantly higher in the
SMG, accompanied by a significantly lower median percentage
of time within the target range and a median percentage of INR
measurements within the target range in this group. This fact
goes together with a significantly higher percentage of patients
in the SMG with INRvalues below the therapeutic range in terms
oftime and measurements at baseline as compared to theRCG.
Of 99 patients randomised to the SMG, 90 attended and successfully completed training. Of the patients who completed
training, 96% completed the first year of follow-up in the SMG.
Only two patients could not manage routine self-measurement
and two other patients were reluctant to perform self-management after the course. Two patients had manual impairment; one
patient hadahistory of stroke and another patient had Parkinson's syndrome; both patients were nonetheless included in the
study, and measurements were performed by relatives. The dropout rate in the RCG was 6%, and eight control-group patients
began with self-management six months after the study began
(Fig. 1).
The median frequency of INR measurements per patient in
the SMG was 27 and 24 compared to eight and seven in the RCG
after the first and second six-month periods, respectively. The
medians of the squared INR value deviations after six and 12
months were significantly lower in the SMG with medians of

0.16 and 0.16 compared to the RCG with medians of 0.25 and
0.25 (Table 2).
During the firstsix months, the percentage of time within target range and the percentage of INR measurements within target
range were significantly higher in the SMG versusthe RCG with
medians 71% versus 58% and 69% versus 57%, respectively.
During the second six months of the study, these differences remained statistically significant with medians of 75% versus 67%
and 72% versus 57% for the percentage of time within target
range and the percentage of INR measurements forself-management compared with routine management. After six months of
treatment, a significantly higher proportion of patients was
above the target range in the RCG group with respect to time and
measurements. During the second six months, only the percentage of INR measurements above the target range was significantly higher in the RCG.
In addition, we found a significant within-group improvement in the median of the squared INR value deviations
(p<0.001), the percentage of time (p<0.001) and the numbers of
INR readings (p<0.001) within the target range between prestudy and the first year of follow-up in the SMG. Overall, efficacy in OAC control remained unchanged in the RCG.
Forty-nine patients in the RCG were treated in general practices and 47 patients at hospital-based specialised anticoagulation clinics. At baseline, OAC control did not differ significantly between the SMG and the general practice-treated RCG.
During the first year of treatment, the median of the squared INR
value deviation was significantly reduced in the SMG versus the
general practice-treated RCG, with medians of 0.16 versus 0.27;
p<0.001. The percentage of time within target range (median,
74% vs. 58%; p<0.001) and the percentage of INR measurements (median, 70% vs. 50%; p<0.001) also improved significantly in the SMG versus the general practice-treatedRCG. Concentrating on the RCG treated in hospital-based specialised anticoagulation clinics, the OAC quality was significantly higher at
baseline and remained stable over the first year of treatment. For
the interim analysis after one year of treatment, there was no significant difference in terms of percentage of time within target
range between the SMG and the hospital-based specialised anticoagulation clinic RCG (median, 74% vs. 71%, p=0.082). However, the median of the squared INR value deviation was significantly reduced in the SMG versus the hospital-based specialised
anticoagulation clinic RCG with medians of 0.16 versus 0.24
(p=0.028), and the percentage of INR measurements within target range improved significantly as well (median, 70% vs. 60%,
p=0.005).
The numbers of all thromboembolic events requiring hospitalisations, major bleeding events, and deaths through the end of
the first study year did not differ between the groups and are reported for all randomised patients in Table 3.
Discussion
This randomised controlled trial will primarily attempt to determine whether thromboembolic events requiring hospitalisation
and major bleeding complications can be reduced by self-management of oral anticoagulation in patients over 60 years of age.
As long-term data from studies with elderly self-management
patients (self-testing and self-dosing after participation in a
structured treatment programme) are rare, we expect that the results in the final publication with the „analysis of morbidity and
mortality end-points“ will have important implications for the
treatment of elderly patients in the future. To date, only one randomised trial including patients with a mean age of 64 to 67 has
shown a significant reduction in thromboembolic complications
(27), and one other study indicated that excessive bleeding rates
can be successfully reduced when elderly patients perform selftesting (19). However, though clear evidence of the superiority of
self-management treatment for elderly patients is still lacking, it
is known from a recently published meta-analysis combining all
presently available randomised trials with predominantly
younger patients and short follow-up timesthat thromboembolic
complications and death rates can be significantly reduced in
self-managed patients (18).
Overall, 43% of eligible patients who were invited by doctors
to participate at the study centres were randomised; this is comparable to a Spanish study (27) and a study performed on elderly
patients in the United Kingdom (28) but is much higher than in
the studies presented recently by Gadisseur et al. and Fitzmaurice et al. (29, 30) with about 25%.
Of those patients who were randomised to self-management,
91% completed training, and 96% of those who started self-management completed the first 12 months of follow-up. Such a low
dropout rate was only found in the study by Khan et al. (28) and
is very low compared to other randomised controlled trials including a high proportion of elderly patients assigned to selfmanagement with a range of 21% to 28% (19, 27, 29). Some
other studies presented comparably low dropout rates (16, 30)
but included much younger patients. The withdrawal rate in the
RCG was 6%, and eight patients in the this group started with
self-management six months after the study began (Fig. 1).
After one year of intervention, patient self-management of
oral anticoagulation was superior to routine care in terms of the
median square INR deviation, which wasthe predefined primary
outcome for this analysis. This parameter provides useful information on the evaluation of positive and negative differences between the INR target range and INR values, as it simultaneously
incorporates very high and very low INR values. This result is
supported by the significant improvement of the percentage of

time and readings within the therapeutic range for INR between
the two groups after six and 12 months of treatment.
Patients in the SMG had poorer anticoagulation control at
baseline, but efficacy was markedly improved after the first year
of treatment.A possible explanation could be that after completing the structured training programme, patients under self-management can better adjust the anticoagulant dosage whenever
necessary than can the physician in the setting of routine care. In
general, therapeutic INR control in the SMG was good and almost comparable to other randomised trials (18, 31).
In the RCG, the accuracy of OAC control did not change over
the observation time of one year even though the patients had
also undergone a basic training course. The fact that the percentage of time and of INR values within the target range did not
change over time might be because the number of INR measurements was essentially low and stable during the first year of follow-up (on the average, about one measurement per month).This
may indicate that monthly monitoring, as currently foreseen for
routine care in Germany and Austria, does not suffice for the
prompt modifications of the daily dose that would be needed to
optimize the INR levels. This is in contrast to the small study of
Khan et al.(28), where elderly patientsin the education and clinical care group who participated inatwo-hour training session
hadaclear improvement in time within the therapeutic range at
the end of the study. This publication does not, however, clearly
state how often INR was measured and whether the dosage was
subsequently adapted. Another interesting randomised trial reported on a RCG that completed three training sessions (30). It
showed that the efficacy of OAC improved from the beginning to
the end of the study and did not differ between two other groups
on weekly self-management or weekly self-testing only.
Patientsin the RCG were advised by doctors either in general
practice or at a hospital-based specialised anticoagulation clinic.
The results of our analysis indicate that patients treated at
specialised clinics have high OAC control. Our results also support those of previously published randomised trials that INR
self-management is at least equivalent to management by a
specialised anticoagulation clinic and seems to offer more accurate anticoagulation control than is obtained under routine care
supervised by general practitioners (17, 27, 30).
It is currently too early to assess the effect of self-management on complications caused by OAC treatment, and the
numbers presented did not indicate any difference between treatment groups. However, with improved OAC control as an indirect parameter of a reduced risk of thromboembolic and bleeding
complications (32), it can be expected that this benefit will be
seen after termination of thistrial. In addition, other studies have
convincingly shown that quality of life was significantly improved in patients who performed self-management compared to
patients advised at specialised clinics and in general practices as
well (16, 33, 34). Furthermore, self-management seems to be a
cost-effective strategy for patients on long-term OAC therapy
(35, 36). Analyses on quality of life and cost-effectiveness are
planned after termination of the study.
These preliminary results suggest that self-management of
OAC is safe and feasible for elderly patients willing to participate in a structured training programme
