Study Objective. To evaluate the impact of a pharmacist-led warfarin patient
self-management program on quality of life and anticoagulation control
compared with management in a physician-led specialized anticoagulation
clinic.
Design. Prospective, randomized, controlled, open-label trial.
Setting. Tertiary care academic medical center.
Patients. A total of 114 patients aged 18–75 years who were followed at a specialized anticoagulation clinic, had received warfarin for at least 6 months,
and were expected to continue warfarin for a minimum of 4 months.
Intervention. All patients attended an educational session on anticoagulation
provided by a pharmacist. Patients randomized to the self-management
group (58 patients) also received practical training to use the CoaguChek
XS device and a self-management dosing algorithm. Patients in the control
group (56 patients) continued to undergo standard management at the
anticoagulation clinic.
Measurements and Main Results. Patients completed a validated quality-oflife questionnaire and the validated Oral Anticoagulation Knowledge test
at the beginning and end of the study. The quality of anticoagulation control was evaluated by using the time spent in therapeutic range. After 4
months of follow-up, a significant improvement in the self-management
group was observed compared with the control group in four of the five
quality-of-life topics (p<0.05). Improvements in knowledge were observed
in both groups after the training session and persisted after 4 months
(p<0.05 for all). The time spent in the therapeutic range (80.0% in the
self-management group vs 75% in the control group, p=0.79) and in the
extended therapeutic range ([target international normalized ratio ± 0.3]
93.2% in the self-management group vs 91.1% in the control group,
p=0.30) were similar between groups.
Conclusion. A self-management warfarin program led by pharmacists
resulted in significant improvement in the quality of life of patients receiving warfarin therapy as well as a reduction in the time required for anticoagulation monitoring, while maintaining a level of anticoagulation control
similar to a high-quality specialized anticoagulation clinic.

Key Words: warfarin, anticoagulation, quality of life, pharmacist,

(Pharmacotherapy 2012;32(10):871–879)
Warfarin remains the most prescribed oral
anticoagulant in North America.1 Unfortunately,
warfarin requires frequent monitoring of the
international normalized ratio (INR) to maximize its efficacy and safety.2 Although anticoagulants that do not require INR monitoring have
been proposed as alternatives to warfarin, their
efficacy and cost-effectiveness remain to be demonstrated in the context of optimal warfarin use
and for many indications.3
With the emergence of portable monitoring
devices, patients have the opportunity to perform INR self-testing and warfarin self-management. With the self-testing approach, patients
measure their INR and report the results to their
health care provider who adjusts the warfarin
dose accordingly. With the self-management
approach, patients measure their own INR and
also perform their own dose adjustments. These
novel approaches have yet to be widely adopted
in North America.4, 5
Many studies have reported improvements in
the quality of oral anticoagulation with self–testing and self-management approaches, with possible improvements in clinical outcomes.6, 7
European data suggest that both approaches
result in improvements in quality of life,8–13
although data specific to self-management are
not available in North America.
Finally, although extensive data have
demonstrated that pharmacists in anticoagulation clinics lead to improvements in the quality
of anticoagulation therapy and monitoring,14, 15
to our knowledge, no study has tested the
impact of a pharmacist-led self-management
program.
Thus, the objective of this study was to
evaluate the impact of a pharmacist-led patient
self-management program on quality of life and
anticoagulation control in patients requiring
chronic warfarin therapy compared with
standard treatment in a physician-managed
specialized anticoagulation clinic.
Methods
Study Design
In this prospective, randomized, controlled,
open-label trial, patients were randomized in a
1:1 ratio to the self-management group, which
used the CoaguChek XS (Roche Diagnostics
Canada, Laval, Canada) device to monitor their
INRs, or the control group, which consisted of
standard management at the specialized anticoagulation clinic of the Montreal Heart Institute
(Montreal, Canada). The validity of the CoaguChek XS compared with traditional laboratory
testing has been reported previously.16, 17 Institutional review board approval was obtained for
the research protocol. The randomization list
was generated by using permuted random blocks
of sizes four and six. This list was generated
using the PLAN procedure in SAS, version 9.1
(SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC), by the Montreal
Heart Institute Coordinating Center biostatistics
department. All patients provided informed consent to participate in the study. The trial was
registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (ClinicalTrials.
gov registry number NCT01033279).
Patient Population
Patients were eligible for the study if they
were followed at the Montreal Heart Institute
anticoagulation clinic, were receiving warfarin
for at least 6 months, and were expected to continue warfarin for a minimum of 4 months.
Patients were required to be aged 18–75 years,
and their last two INRs had to be 1.5–4.0 for a
target INR of 2.0–3.0, or 2.0–4.0 for a target

INR of 2.5–3.5. Patients were excluded if they
had a hypercoagulable condition, including
active cancer; had an active or recent major
bleeding event in the last 3 months; experienced
a recent cardiovascular event or surgery; or had
a cognitive or physical impairment limiting their
comprehension or motor skills.
Study Protocol
On day 1, all patients attended a 3-hour educational lecture on anticoagulation provided by
a pharmacist (Figure 1). During this didactic
session, the patients received information on
anticoagulation treatment and monitoring, as
well as anticoagulation self-management. Patients completed a validated quality-of-life questionnaire9, 10 at the beginning of the session, as
well as the validated Oral Anticoagulation
Knowledge (OAK) test18 to test their knowledge
about anticoagulation. Patients were then randomized to continue their management at the
anticoagulation clinic (control group) or to
switch to self-management (self-management
group). Patients randomized to the control
group received no further training. Patients randomized to the self-management group immediately received practical training to use the
CoaguChek XS device and the self-management
algorithm developed by the investigators
(Appendix S1). This included instructions on
the frequency of INR monitoring, specific recommendations on what to do in the case of high
or low INR, how and when to communicate
with the pharmacists in the self-management
program, how to use the device, and the
patient’s responsibility in the program. The session was concluded with clinical scenarios, during which patients had to apply their
knowledge. They returned 1 week later to validate their use of the device and the algorithm.
Patients who had difficulty using the device or
algorithm at the second visit were invited to an
additional visit. After this third visit, if the
difficulties persisted, the patient would not have
been allowed to undergo self-management.
On a weekly basis, patients in the self-management group monitored their INR and
adjusted their dose of warfarin according to the
algorithm. Through a voicemail message,
patients were required to communicate their
INR result and any adjustment performed. The
patient was contacted if no telephone call was
received on the expected day, or if an error in
management occurred. If an INR fell outside the
algorithm limits (  1.5 or  4.5 for a target
INR of 2.0–3.0, or  2.2 or  5.0 for a target
INR of 2.5–3.5), the dose was adjusted by the
pharmacist. Each week patients also had to complete a pre-INR questionnaire to identify new
factors that could affect their INR such as the
addition of prescription or nonprescription
drugs, natural health products, new health
issues, missed doses, and changes in diet. In the
presence of such factors, patients were required
to inform the pharmacist of this information
before making any dose adjustment. Patients in
the self-management group recorded their INR,
daily doses of warfarin, and adverse events. All
patients were seen again after 4 months to
complete the OAK test and the quality-of-life
questionnaire. The INR results and dose adjustments from patients in the control group were
collected directly from the anticoagulation clinic
database.
Study End Points
The primary end point of the study was anticoagulation-related quality of life, measured with
a previously developed and validated questionnaire, which includes 32 statements covering
five sociopsychological topics: general treatment
satisfaction, self-efficacy, daily hassles, psychological distress, and strained social network.9, 10
Briefly, general treatment satisfaction measures
Figure 1. Schematic of the study design illustrating the
different aspects of the study after patient inclusion. The
didactic session included information on general
knowledge of oral anticoagulation. The practical session
included training specific to the use of the CoaguChek XS
device and use of the self-management algorithm. During
the validation visit, the understanding of the technique of
the device was validated, and a simulation exercise was
performed to validate the understanding of the algorithm.

whether a patient feels more content with
greater self-management of oral anticoagulation
therapy. The self-efficacy portion of the
questionnaire reflects patient self-confidence in
dealing with challenging environmental demands
by taking adaptive action. The daily hassles portion of the questionnaire is related to how the
cost and benefit of the intervention affect the
patient’s daily life. General psychological distress
provides information regarding the general
psychological burden associated with a patient’s
oral anticoagulation. Finally, the strained social
network focuses on the quality of the social
support. Each domain is evaluated using a
graded scale ranging from a score of 1 (total
disagreement) to 6 (total agreement). Higher
scores for self-efficacy and general treatment
satisfaction, and lower scores for daily hassles,
psychological distress, and strained social network are indicative of better quality of life.
Many secondary end points were evaluated.
Knowledge regarding oral anticoagulation was
compared between groups at baseline, after the
didactic session, and at the end of the study
using the OAK test.18 The quality of anticoagulation control was evaluated using the time spent
in therapeutic range, and the time spent within
the extended therapeutic range (target INR ±
0.3) and outside the critical INR value (INR <
1.5 or > 5), all calculated with the Rosendaal
method.19 We recorded the average time
required for patients to monitor their INR. For
the self-management group, this consisted of the
time spent measuring the INR with the device
and performing dose adjustments. In the control
group, it consisted of the average time required
to travel to and from the anticoagulation clinic
and the time spent at the clinic, estimated by
patient self-report at the beginning of the study.
We also recorded all adverse events. The severity of bleeding and thromboembolic events was
classified as previously described.20 Briefly, these
complications were considered minor if they
were not associated with costs or medical consequences (e.g., epistaxis), serious if they required
treatment or medical evaluation (e.g., gastrointestinal bleeding), life-threatening (e.g., requiring surgical intervention), or fatal.20
Statistical Analysis
The sample size was based on previously published data.9 To attain 80% power and an a of
0.05 compared with a control group, we calculated that eight patients in the self-management
group were required to observe an improvement
for the self-efficacy topic, 16 patients for daily
hassles, 22 for strained social network, 94 for
treatment satisfaction, and 184 for psychological
distress. For feasibility reasons, we chose a study
sample size powered to demonstrate differences
in the first four aforementioned topics of quality
of life. In order to compensate for a possible loss
to follow-up, the number was increased to 120
patients. Enrollment was stopped after inclusion
of 114 patients due to limited resources and
because it was expected that more than the
required 94 patients would complete the study.
Continuous values are presented as
mean ± SD when appropriate. Categoric variables are presented as numbers and percentages.
A t test for independent samples was used to
compare the mean values between groups.
Changes from baseline within one group were
calculated using a paired t test. For categoric
variables, a v2 method was used. To compare
the time spent in the therapeutic INR range or
outside the critical INR range, the method
previously proposed by Rosendaal was used.19
Results
Between November 2009 and January 2010,
207 patients were screened for participation in
the study. Of those, 93 were excluded; reasons
for exclusion are presented in Figure 2. Hence,
114 patients were randomized: 58 to the selfmanagement group and 56 to the control group.
The last date of 4-month follow-up occurred on
May 17, 2010. Baseline characteristics of the

study population are presented in Table 1.
Although there was no statistically significant
difference between the groups at baseline, there
was a trend for a higher proportion of patients
in the self-management group to have a target
INR of 2.5–3.5 (p=0.06). Patients consisted
mainly of men (68%), with a mean ± SD age of
57.7 ± 10.4 years. The majority of patients
received warfarin for atrial fibrillation or a prosthetic heart valve. Patients had been treated with
warfarin for 7.5 ± 6.3 years before enrollment. A
total of 34.2% of the patients had a high-school
diploma or less as the highest degree earned. No
patients were lost to follow-up. In the self-management group, warfarin was discontinued after
3.3 months in one patient after a successful
cardioversion.
Quality of Life
Data on quality of life at baseline and followup were incomplete or missing for two patients
in the self-management group and three patients
in the control group. Both groups were comparable with regard to quality of life topics at baseline (Table 2). After 4 months, treatment
satisfaction significantly improved in the selfmanagement group compared with the control
group (p<0.001). Daily hassles, psychological
distress, and a strained social network all significantly decreased in the self-management group
compared to the control group (p=0.024,
p=0.029, and p<0.001, respectively). Self-efficacy
increased in both groups (p<0.05), but the difference between the groups was not significant.
Anticoagulation Control
The number of INRs measured/patient in the
self-management group was greater than in the
control group (17.4 ± 1.3 vs 4.0 ± 1.5, p<0.001
[Table 3]). Intervention by a pharmacist was
required for 5.95% of the INRs performed in the
self-management group because values fell outside the management algorithm. In the self-management group, after a dose adjustment using
the algorithm was made after a nontherapeutic
INR, the mean proportion of the next INRs/
patient that were in the therapeutic range was
73.9 ± 24.5%, whereas 14.6 ± 20% were supratherapeutic and 11.5 ± 16.1% were subtherapeutic. In the control group, these values were
67.4 ± 34.8%, 14.0 ± 24.9%, and 18.6 ± 27.7%,
respectively. The mean proportion of therapeutic
INRs/patient after a dose adjustment was not significantly different between groups (p=0.44),
nor was the total proportion of therapeutic INRs
after a nontherapeutic INR in each group: 157
(64.1%) of 245 patients in the self-management
group versus 43 (54.4%) of 79 patients in the
control group (p=0.12). As a post hoc analysis,
we evaluated the number of errors that occurred
when patients chose a dose for the upcoming
week that led to an intervention by the pharmacist. We found four such errors, including two
when the patient was in the therapeutic range
and thus did not require a dose adjustment.
Similar anticoagulation control was observed
in both groups with regard to the mean time
spent within therapeutic INR range (p=0.79), in
the extended therapeutic INR range (p=0.30),
and outside the critical INR values (p=0.46)
(Table 3). Less time was dedicated to monitoring each INR in the self-management group
compared with the control group (5.3 ± 2.6 vs
158.0 ± 67.8 min, p<0.001). Also, less total time
was dedicated to anticoagulation monitoring

during the 4-month follow-up period
(99.6 ± 46.1 vs 614.9 ± 308.8 min, p<0.0001).
Knowledge Related to Oral Anticoagulation
Therapy
Twenty-three training sessions consisting of
1–9 patients each were held. Five patients
required an additional training session because
of difficulties using the device. No patient
required a third session. Hence, all patients
demonstrated proficiency in the use of the
device and self-management algorithm in
the self-management group. At the beginning of
the study, both groups had a similar level of
knowledge regarding anticoagulation use
(Table 4). Compared with this baseline knowledge, significant improvement in knowledge was
observed within each group after the training
session (p<0.001 for both groups), which persisted after the 4-month follow-up period
(p<0.05 for both groups). No significant
difference was noted between groups in the
knowledge acquired after the training session
(p=0.60) and after the 4-month follow-up period
(p=0.98).
Adverse Events
The proportion of individuals presenting with
an adverse event was similar between the groups
(Table 5). The majority of events consisted of
minor bleeding episodes, mainly epistaxis. Three
major bleeding events occurred during the
study, with two in the self-management group
and one in the control group. The first one
occurred in the self-management group in a
patient who presented with an ocular hematoma
after taking the wrong dose of warfarin. The
INR increased to 5.4. The ocular hematoma
resolved in 3 days without any intervention or
hospitalization. The second major bleeding event
in the self-management group was gastrointestinal bleeding caused by an acute exacerbation of
chronic ulcerative colitis that required hospitalization. The major bleeding event that occurred
in the control group was a case of hematuria
after urologic surgery. No thromboembolic

Discussion
These results indicate that a self-management
program led by pharmacists improves patients’
quality of life and reduces the time required for
anticoagulation monitoring, while maintaining
control of anticoagulation similar to a specialized clinic.
Our results demonstrate a significant improvement in four of the five quality-of-life topics in
the self-management group compared with
management at the specialized anticoagulation
clinic. These results support those of previous
European studies,8–10 with two of the studies
reporting improvements in all five topics in
patients self-managing their anticoagulation9, 10
and the third study reporting improvement in
four of the five topics.8 More modest results
were reported in another study.12 To our knowledge, our study is the first quality-of-life study
of anticoagulation self-management conducted
in North America.
Of importance, the improvements in quality
of life and time required for INR monitoring
were observed with comparable control of anticoagulation. The level of anticoagulation control
observed in both groups may help explain why,
contrary to previous studies,6, 7 we did not
observe improvements in the time in the target
INR range in the self-management group compared with the control group.6, 21 The use of
the Coaguchek XS device, along with the algorithm developed for the study, proved to be easy
for the patients to comprehend and performed
well. Only five patients (8.6%) required an

device, despite the fact that a third of our
patients had a high school education or less.
This is in agreement with The Home INR Study
(THINRS) substudy, which evaluated patients’
self-testing competency and concluded that a
majority of them were able to achieve successful
testing within 2–4 weeks.22 A potential drawback of INR self-management is the higher number of tests required. However, the amount of
time required by patients to monitor their
warfarin therapy was lower in the self-management group than in the control group. This
decrease in the time patients dedicate to their
warfarin monitoring and the fewer anticoagulation clinic visits may have contributed to the
improvements in quality of life observed. Recent
data from a pilot study investigating the implementation of a new Internet-based tool for the
management of anticoagulants indicated that
these were two of the three most valued features
of such systems by patients.23
An important longstanding issue regarding
anticoagulation self-management is if patients
actually benefit from self-management or if the
improvements in anticoagulation control
observed in previous studies were the result of
the additional training that patients received.8, 9
In these studies, the additional training was generally provided only to the self-management
group. In our study, both groups attended a
didactic session on anticoagulation, although the
practical training for the use of the device was
limited to the self-management group. Our
results show that the improvement in knowledge
evolved in a similar fashion in both the selfmanagement and control groups. This indicates
that self-management does not have a significant
impact on knowledge retention.
Our study has limitations. First, the small
number of patients precluded any evaluation of
the impact of the self-management program on
clinical events. Nevertheless, because the time
spent within critical INR values was extremely
low in the self-management group, one would
expect a low risk of major events.24 Furthermore, the level of anticoagulation control we
observed was equal to or better than that in selfmanagement studies that demonstrated reductions in such events.7 The small sample size of
our study may also have contributed to the fact
that both groups were not completely identical
at baseline. Another potential limitation of the
study is related to the study population. The
patients included in our study were receiving
warfarin therapy for a mean of approximately
7 years. Therefore, our results cannot be extrapolated to individuals who have recently started
warfarin. In addition, 80 (38.7%) of the 207
patients screened were not eligible, which limits
the application of our findings to the population
studied. Finally, the short duration of the study
should be noted.
Conclusion
Our study indicates that patients treated with
warfarin on a long-term basis can be trained by
pharmacists to manage their warfarin dosing
requirements. This self-management leads to
improvements in quality of life and reduces the
time dedicated to INR monitoring while maintaining a quality of the anticoagulation comparable to that provided by a specialized
anticoagulation clinic.
