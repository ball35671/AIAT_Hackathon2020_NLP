Abstract: Long term oral anti-coagulation with vitamin K antagonists is a risk factor of hemorrhagic or thromebomlic complications. Periodic laboratory testing of international normalized ratio (INR) and a subsequent dose adjustment are therefore mandatory. The use of home
testing devices to measure INR has been suggested as a potential way to improve the comfort
and compliance of the patients and their families, the frequency of monitoring and, finally, the
management and safety of long-term oral anticoagulation. In pediatric patients, increased doses
to obtain and maintain the therapeutic target INR, more frequent adjustments and INR testing,
multiple medication, inconstant nutritional intake, difficult venepunctures, and the need to go
to the laboratory for testing (interruption of school and parents’ work attendance) highlight
those difficulties. After reviewing the most relevant published studies of self-testing and selfmanagement of INR for adult patients and children on oral anticoagulation, it seems that these
are valuable and effective strategies of INR control. Despite an unclear relationship between
INR control and clinical effects, these self-strategies provide a better control of the anticoagulant effect, improve patients and their family quality of life, and are an appealing solution in
term of cost-effectiveness. Structured education and knowledge evaluation by trained health
care professionals is required for children, to be able to adjust their dose treatment safely and
accurately. However, further data are necessary in order to best define those patients who might
better benefit from this multidisciplinary approach.

Introduction
Long-term oral anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists could display the risk of
hemorrhagic or thromboembolic complications. The occurrence of these potentially
life-threatening complications depends on the accuracy of oral anticoagulant treatment.
A periodic laboratory testing of international normalized ratio (INR) and a subsequent
dose adjustment are therefore mandatory.
Long-term oral anticoagulation is a public health concern as, for instance, ~1%
of the French population requires vitamin K antagonists. Moreover, it was associated
with the highest rate of hospitalization due to iatrogenic effects in France during 2007.1
Several studies proposed guidelines for administrating and monitoring oral anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists in children,2
 with many difficulties in their use in this
population especially in infants under the age of 12 months. Different reasons could
explain this problem: the lack of patients’ education, the complex pharmacokinetics

and drug interactions of vitamin K antagonists, the need for
continuous monitoring and dose adjustments, and patients’
compliance.3
The use of home testing devices to measure INR has been
suggested as a potential way to improve the comfort and
compliance of the patients and their families, the frequency of
monitoring and, finally, the management and safety of longterm oral anticoagulation. Indeed, current practice guidelines
suggest the strategy of self-management for patients treated
with vitamin K antagonists who are motivated and can demonstrate competency in self-management strategies, including
the self-testing equipment (Class IIb).4
In pediatric patients, increased doses to obtain and maintain the therapeutic target INR, more frequent adjustments
and INR testing, multiple medication, inconstant nutritional
intake, difficult venepunctures, and the need to go to the
laboratory for testing (interruption of school and parents work
attendance) highlight these difficulties.5
 The purpose of this
section of our paper is to review the most relevant published
studies of self-testing and self-management of INR for adult
patients and children on oral anticoagulation.
Methods
We considered only randomized controlled trials comparing
the effects and the clinical outcomes of self-testing or selfmanagement of oral anticoagulation therapy with standard
monitoring and care, including personal physicians and
anticoagulation hospitals or clinics. We included studies
focusing on adult patients and children on oral anticoagulation therapy irrespective of the indication for treatment.
Results
In the adult population, we identified 20 published randomized controlled trials that met the inclusion criteria (Table 1).
Fourteen trials included patients on oral anticoagulant
treatment for any indication.6–19 Four trials considered only
patients on lifelong oral anticoagulation after heart valve
replacement with a mechanical prosthesis.20–23 Two trials
included only patients on long-term anticoagulation for atrial
fibrillation.24,25 Twelve trials analyzed the strategy of selfmanagement6,8,10,12–15,17–19,21,25 while seven trials the strategy
of self-testing.7,11,16,20,22–24 Gadisseur et al reported the results
of both self-management and self-testing.9
In the pediatric population, we identified only one randomized controlled trial that met the inclusion criteria.26
Jones et al in 2011 published a review of the literature concerning oral anticoagulation therapy in children, and they
demonstrated that time in therapeutic range was from 39%
to 81% but they did not describe randomized trials of either
self-testing or self-management.27
Clinical effectiveness
The best way to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of selftesting and self-management is the control of the anticoagulant

INR self-management
effect. The simplest indicators of the anticoagulant effect
are the mean INR within the target range and the mean time
spent within the target range. Owing to our review of the
literature, nine trials reported mean INR within the target
range.6,8–10,12,15,20,21,25 Every single trial showed a better INR
control in the self-testing or self-management group but this
improvement was statistically significant only in five trials.12,15,20,21,25 Improvements ranged from 3% to 17% (Table 2).
Moreover, 14 trials analyzed the mean time spent within the
INR target range (Table 3).7,9–17,21–24 Among these trials, 12
documented an improvement in the self-testing or -monitoring
group,7,9,10,13–17,21–24 but the statistical significance was reached
only in five trials.7,15,16,21,22 Finally, two trials did not show a
beneficial effect in the intervention group.11,12
Even if self-testing or self-management of oral anticoagulation is more effective or, at least, as effective as conventional
care management, some authors argued against the correlation between improvement of INR control and decrease in
major complications and call into serious question the usefulness of evaluating the safety of oral anticoagulation by using
the percentage of mean INR and/or time within target range.12
The use of point-of-care devices for routine INR measurements has demonstrated safety, reliability, and effectiveness
in infants and children requiring long-term oral anticoagulation therapy.28,29
Baumann et al in the EMPoWarMENT study26 have
studied 28 wafarinized children performing self-testing for
>3 months and randomized them to self-testing at home
or self-management. The mean age was 10 years,1–19 and
93% were followed during 12 months. Mean number INR
test over the study was around 22 either for self-testing or
self-management. Time in therapeutic range was 77% for
self-testing and 83% for self-management. INRs >5 were
not related to warfarin dosing decision but to unexpected
illness. Patients with self-management made dose decisions
consistent with the guidelines in 90% of time.
Clinical benefits
The ideal endpoint of oral anticoagulation therapy studies is
the evaluation of major complications. However, the reduction of oral anticoagulation-related complications – namely,
bleeding and thromboembolic events – as a consequence of
a better control of the anticoagulant treatment (as discussed
earlier) is still a matter of debate.
When we take into consideration previous reviews of the
literature calculating the overall effect size, there is general
agreement on the reduction of thromboembolic complications determined by self-testing or self-management. Overall,
these strategies show a 50% reduction of thromboembolic
complications as compared to the control group.3,30,31
Conversely, the analysis of bleeding complications is
more challenging. Heneghan et al found a significant onethird reduction of hemorrhagic complications in their review
published in 2006,3
 but other investigators did not.30,31 These
different conclusions should probably be explained by a
nonhomogeneous definition of major and minor hemorrhagic
complications used in every report.

Pozzi et al
Finally, the same consideration could be done to the
analysis of mortality. In fact, Heneghan et al found different
results in their reviews published in 2006 and 2012.3,30 In the
former, there was a significant reduction of overall mortality
in the self-testing/ self-management group,3
 while in the latter
the difference was not statistically significant.30 The relative
weight of oral anticoagulation control, thromboembolic
complications, and bleeding in determining overall mortality
is difficult to estimate and other factors may participate in
the outcome of patients’ population.
Previous studies in children have shown a rate of bleeding ranging from 0.5% to 1.7% with oral anticoagulation
therapy, with only one death reported related to the patient
anticoagulation therapy;32 only two prospective studies have
reported thromboembolic events with a rate under 2% and
10% per patient year.
In the EMPoWarMENT study, there were no hemorrhagic
or thromboembolic events, and baseline time in therapeutic
range for the self-monitoring group was less than the selftesting group due to poor adherence in four patients.27 As an
answer, it has been now well demonstrated that the ability of
parents to use point-of-care monitor and parental knowledge
is the major criterion for clinical effectiveness and benefits.
Quality of life assessment
The success of an effective oral anticoagulation could be
also evaluated with the treatment-related quality of life.
Our review of the literature identified six trials that assessed
quality of life outcomes.6,8,16,17,18,24
Sawicki et al evaluated at baseline and 6-month followup the treatment-related quality of life using a structured
questionnaire containing 40 items.6
 The 40 items covered
five topics: general treatment satisfaction, self-efficacy,
strained social network, daily hassles, and distress. General
treatment satisfaction and daily hassles scores improved in
the self-management group and remained unchanged in the
routine care group. The scores of self-efficacy and distress
improved in both groups but improved significantly more in
the self-management group. The intervention had no significant effect on the strained social network scores. Interestingly,
the general treatment satisfaction scores displayed the most
pronounced improvement. Other investigators used the same
structured questionnaire in order to perform a self-perceived
assessment of the quality of care.8,17 As previously outlined,
there were significant differences in all five categories of the
questionnaire in favor of the self-management group: scores
for general treatment satisfaction and self-efficacy were
higher in the self-management group whereas the score for
daily anxieties, distress, and strain were significantly lower.
Moreover, Matchar et al evaluated patients’ satisfaction with
anticoagulation, measured with the Duke Anticoagulation
Satisfaction Scale, and quality of life, measured with the
Health Utilities Index Mark.3,16
At 2 years (the minimum duration of follow-up), patient
satisfaction with anticoagulation as measured by the Duke
Anticoagulation Satisfaction Scale was greater in the selftesting group than in the clinic-testing group and a cumulative gain in health utilities according to the Health Utilities
Index Mark 3 was noted in the self-testing group as compared
with the clinic-testing group. Finally, Siebenhofer et al
focused attention on elderly patients and found a pronounced
improvement in general treatment satisfaction after participation in the self-management program.18
Conversely, Khan et al did not find any difference in quality of life measurements and health beliefs about warfarin
between the control and self-monitoring groups using the
36-item United Kingdom Short Form Health Survey and
European Quality of Life questionnaire.24
Two main studies have described the quality of life in
children on home INR self-testing or self-management.33,34
KIDCLOT-PAC-QL© was the first preliminarily validated
inventory to assess quality of life in anticoagulated children;
it determined confounders to therapy and may facilitate partnership in care.33 In 2013, Newall et al tried to evaluate the
impact of a home INR self-testing on the quality of life of
children and their families. In all, 55 parents and 35 children
participated; time in therapeutic range was 71%, and parents
reported statistically significant improvement in quality of
life for themselves, their family, and their child.34
Cost-effectiveness evaluation
Our review identified only one trial performing a costs evaluation.16 In this study, costs were higher in the self-testing group
but not significantly different from those in the clinic-testing
group (difference = $1,249; P=0.32).
Only one study has been found in the pediatric population
as well.35 The home monitoring saved a total of 1 hour and
19 minutes per INR test and has a cost saving to society of
$66.83 per INR test compared to traditional care incorporating health sector costs, travel expenses, and lost time.
Discussion
The self-testing and self-management of INR during oral
anticoagulation is safe and effective and provides an accurate
control of the anticoagulant treatment. Portable devices offer
patients a more frequent and regular control of INR, thus

INR self-management
reducing the intensity and frequency of supratherapeutic and
subtherapeutic values. In fact, it has been demonstrated that
there is a linear relationship between the frequencies of INR
testing and quality of oral anticoagulation.36
Nevertheless, this accurate control of oral anticoagulation
does not automatically translate into a substantial reduction
of major complications. In the largest randomized clinical
trial – THINRS (The Home INR Study) – weekly home INR
testing did not reduce the aggregate outcome of stroke, major
bleeding, or death as compared to monthly clinic INR testing.16
In contrast, there is a general agreement in the amelioration of the quality of life provided by the self-testing or selfmanagement of INR. In fact, from a theoretical standpoint,
patients should perform their INR measurements in the same
laboratory in order to reduce the inter-laboratory variability,
which can span from 10% to 30%.37 This dependence from
the same laboratory could represent a major limitation of
patients’ personal or professional daily activities. Self-testing
or self-management of oral anticoagulation might effectively
face this limitation and this is clearly witnessed by a global
improvement of general treatment satisfaction as compared
to standard care.6,8,16–18,24
A structured teaching program is however of outmost
importance and plays a key role in self-strategies of oral
anticoagulation. This is even more important in children,
elderly, or low-level education or social status patients.
Limitations
Our review displays of course several limitations. Firstly,
although comprehensive, we could have potentially missed
some published studies. Moreover, the analysis of published
data was not performed in a statistical manner and without
any stratification according to the indications, frequency
of tests or the length of the anticoagulant treatment, and
different models of standard routine care. Finally, we did
not take into consideration the type of education and training and the reasons and rate of dropout of the self-testing/
self-management group.
Conclusion
The present review article reported that self-testing and selfmanagement for INR control provided a better control of the
anticoagulant effect and improved patients’ and their family
quality of life. These findings would be very useful in the
actual clinical setting.
And the reviewers would expect that the system and
procedure of self-testing and self-management for INR
control would evolve to be more user-friendly, and hope that
especially in child patients, the novel anticoagulant therapy
would be innovated to a stage wherean INR control would
not necessary.
They are valuable and effective strategies of INR control.
Despite an unclear relationship between INR control and
clinical effects, these self-strategies provide a better control
of the anticoagulant effect, improve patients’ and their family quality of life, and are an appealing solution in term of
cost-effectiveness. For children, structured education and
knowledge evaluation by trained health care professionals,
children, and their caregivers appear to be able to adjust
their dose treatment safely and accurately. Further data are
however necessary in order to best define those patients who
might better benefit from this multidisciplinary approach.
