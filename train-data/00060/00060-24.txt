Abstract
Objective: Previous retrospective studies suggest that patients’ self management of oral anticoagulants leads to improved control. In this
prospective randomized study, we investigated the effects of self management on the control of anticoagulant therapy and quality of life.
Comparison with the conventional management through the Dutch Thrombosis Service is addressed. Methods: Between January 2005 and June
2007, 62 consecutive patients who underwent elective mechanical aortic valve replacement were included in this study. Patients were
randomized into two groups: (1) conventional group controlled by the Local Thrombosis Service, and (2) self management group using
CoaguChekW. Primary endpoints were the total number of international normalized ratio (INR) values within the target range as well as the
quality of life measurements (SF-36v2)W one year postoperatively. Results: The number of INR values within the target range (2.5—4.5) was
significantly higher in the self management group (mean = 72.9  11%) than in the conventional group (53.9  14%; p = 0.01). Both groups showed
an improvement in the quality of life scores one year postoperatively. However, postoperative improvement was statistically significant in the self
management group regarding the physical component summary only ( p = 0.001). Conclusion: Despite the well-organized INR control by the
Thrombosis Service in The Netherlands, self management program after adequate training improves the INR control. Postoperative improvement
in the quality of life scores was significant in the self management group with regards to the physical component summary only. Further studies are
needed to describe whether self management program will reduce the risk of bleeding and/or thrombo-embolism.

1. Introduction
The risk of bleeding and thrombo-embolism still accounts
for most of the complications after mechanical heart valve
replacement, with an incidence of 0.9—3.6% per patient year
[1]. These complications occur most frequently during the
first six months after surgery. Later on, the risk decreases and
remains constant for years [2]. The risk of anticoagulantrelated events increases when the long-term INR variance is
higher. When bleeding or thrombo-embolism occurs, as much
as 60% of the INR values were observed to lie outside the
therapeutic range [3].
In the Netherlands, control of oral anticoagulant therapy
is regulated through a network of anticoagulation clinics
called ‘The National Thrombosis Service’. This has led to a
decrease in thrombo-embolic and bleeding complications
[4]. Frequent long-term monitoring of the INR values can lead
to a better control, but it has physical, psychological, social
and financial consequences for both patients and health care
system [5].
With the development of portable INR measurement
devices, it was possible for many patients to control their
own anticoagulation therapy. After sufficient training, the
patient can adjust the intensity of anticoagulation and
eventually change the dose if needed [6,7].
Recent studies [8,9] have demonstrated that INR self
management can lead to better anticoagulation control and
this can lead to less complications. This study was
prospectively designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy
of INR self management in comparison with the National
Thrombosis Service in the Netherlands in patients undergoing
elective mechanical aortic valve replacement.

committee. All patients who were accepted for an elective
mechanical aortic valve replacement operation were
screened for the study.
Inclusion criteria:
1. Elective mechanical aortic valve replacement.
2. Informed consent.
3. Enough knowledge of computers and use of Internet.
Exclusion criteria:
1. Patients already using anticoagulants before the operation.
2. Patients with chronic bleeding diathesis.
3. Patients with chronic liver disease.
4. Chronic alcoholism.
5. Neurological deficits which interfere with the self
measurement method; e.g. tremors, amnesia, etc.
6. Severe operative or postoperative complications that can
prolong the hospital stay or any other complications that,
according to the investigator, can influence the postoperative course.
After signing the informed consent, patients were
randomly divided into two groups:
1. Conventional management group, which follows the
Dutch Thrombosis Service.
2. Self management using CoaguChekW devices (Roche
Diagnostics GmbH, Manheim Germany).
Three weeks preoperatively, patients of group 2 received
a special information session. During this session, the patient
received CoaguChekW and all the disposables needed. This
was followed by registration of the patient in a special
website (www.Heartspoint.nl). After sufficient training for at
least one week under supervision of the Thrombosis Service,
the patient had to pass an exam of self measurement. One
day preoperatively, patients were asked to complete the SF36v2W questionnaire.
The postoperative procedures started in the hospital with
adjustmentoforalanticoagulants.AnINRtargetrangeof3—4was
accepted for both groups in consultation with the ‘Thrombosis
Service’ of Eindhoven. During data analysis the range was
extended to 2.5—4.5 to discard small deviations in readings.
Patients of the self management group had to measure the
INR themselves under supervision of the ward physician.
After discharge, these patients measured the INR at home
and notified the anticoagulant dose on the website. During
the first four weeks, the patient’s suggestions were revised
and corrected, if needed, by the Thrombosis Service. The
patient had then to pass the exam of anticoagulant dosage on
the website. Afterwards, all patients were re-evaluated by
the Thrombosis Service once every three months.
One year postoperatively, all patients were clinically
evaluated by the research physician. They had to complete
the SF-36v2W questionnaire again.
2.1. Data analysis
All the INR values were collected in a special data base.
With the use of a spread sheet (MicrosoftW Excel) the total
number of INR values within the target range was compared
in the two groups. The SF-36v2W scores are transformed into
eight components (four physical and four mental). The mean
score for every component is 50  10 (mean US population
1998). The questionnaire has been used in numerous public
health studies [10]. Analysis of discrete variables was
accomplished by a two-tailed Fisher’s exact test. Comparison
of means for continuous variables was conducted using an
unpaired Student’s t-test. A p-value of <0.05 was considered
significant.
3. Results
Between January 2005 and June 2007, all patients who
were scheduled for an elective mechanical aortic valve
replacement (n = 481) were screened for the study. Only 132
patients (27.5%) were possible candidates of the study. Sixtytwo patients (47%) have signed the informed consent. Four
patients were excluded from the study: one patient has got a
biological valve, one patient was operated as an emergency,
one patient has got a percutaneous coronary intervention
(PCI) and one patient died preoperatively.
The number of patients who completed the one-year
follow up was 58 (29 in each group). The mean age was
55.7  9.3 years in group 1 and 56.3  8.6 years in group 2
without statistically significant difference.
The total number of INR values differs significantly
between the two groups. In group 1 (conventional management), this number was 666 values (mean = 23.8  10). In
group 2 (self management), the total numbers of INR values
was 1526 (mean = 61.04  27) [p < 0.001].
The mean INR value was 3.0  0.95 in group 1 and
3.3  0.99 in group 2 ( p = 0.01). The number of INR values
per patient within the target range (2.5—4.5) was significantly higher in the self management group (72.9  11%)
than in the conventional management group (53.9  14%)
[p = 0.01] (Fig. 1).
We have also calculated the total periods of time (in days)
during which the INR value for each patient was outside the
target range. This ‘period of risk’ was presented as a
percentage of the whole follow up period (one year). This
percentage was significantly higher in group 1 (28.6  14)
than in group 2 (22.2  10) [p < 0.001] (Table 1).

Table 2 shows both the mortality and the postoperative
complications within one year after the operation. There was
no significant difference between the two groups in this
regard.
Fig. 2 shows that the improvement in the postoperative
quality of life scores in group 1 was statistically not significant
in almost all the components. Only two components, physical
functioning and role physical, showed significant postoperative improvement. Fig. 3 shows physical component
summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS). The
postoperative improvement in group 1 was not significant
with regards to both summaries.
On the other hand, patients of group 2 showed a
statistically significant postoperative improvement in all
components except bodily pain (Fig. 4). Fig. 5 shows that the
postoperative improvement was statistically significant only
in the physical summary (PCS) ( p = 0.001).
Difference in the quality of life scores between the
preoperative and postoperative state is calculated in
percentage for every patient. Comparison between the
mean percentages in both groups is shown in Table 3.
4. Discussion
This prospective randomized study was designed to
evaluate the safety of the self management program in
controlling oral anticoagulant therapy compared to the Dutch
National Thrombosis Service. We have confirmed that INR self
management improves the anticoagulation control and
minimizes the periods of risk during which the INR values
are outside the target range. Improvement in the quality of
life was documented using a standard questionnaire.
During the inclusion period (30 months), 421 patients have
undergone elective mechanical aortic valve replacement and
were possible candidates for the study. Only 138 patients
(32.8%) have fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Sixty-two
patients (45%) have given an informed consent. This means
that a certain group of patients are still not feasible enough
for self management. This can be either due to exclusion
criteria; e.g. neurological deficits or due to the patient
himself who does not have enough selfconfidence. This was
also concluded by different authors [8,9,11]. However,
others have found that all patients who are able to lead

an independent and self-supporting life are capable of self
management of anticoagulation, irrespective of education
and social status [12]. Although we have selected patients for
this study, this selection was also applied to the conventional
management group. The two groups were equal concerning
age, educational level and social status. Moreover, other
studies have included patients on chronic anticoagulation
therapy [13] while our patients were randomized and trained
before starting anticoagulants.
With regards to INR values within the target range, the
number of values was significantly higher in the self management group than in the conventional group, 72.9% vs 53.9%,
respectively. This confirms the statement that self management improves the quality of INR control. Several studies have
been in agreement with this finding [5,9,10,13—15]. One
possible limitation is the big difference in the total number of
INR values, 666 values in the conventional management group
vs 1526 values in the self management group. This means that
patients of the self management group tend to measure the INR
more often than the conventional group. If the measuring
points are close to each other, this makes many measuring
points of less importance or weight [16].
The weight of every point depends on the time interval
between that point and the closest point of measurement.
The longer the time, the more important the point counts. In
other words, if some points are very close to each other, they
are per point less important because they cover a shorter
period of time. That is why we have calculated, in days, how
long the INR value for every patient was outside the target
range. This period of risk is calculated as a percentage of the
whole follow up period (one year). Comparison between the
mean percentages in both groups has shown that patients of
the self management group have significantly shorter periods
of risk (22.2%) than patients of the conventional management
group (28.7%). This can lower the risk of bleeding and
thrombo-embolism [3].
We did not find a significant difference in the incidence of
complications between the two groups possibly because of
the relatively small number of patients in our group.
However, this was not our primary endpoint. In the majority
of previous studies, the number of included patients has been
limited as well [17]. Other investigators [10,18] have shown
that fewer adverse events by better INR management may
translate into improved long-term survival.
Improvement in the quality of life was investigated using a
well-known standard questionnaire (SF-36v2)W [19]. Although
both groups have shown a postoperative improvement in
quality of life components, improvement was statistically
significant in the self management group. Again, we have
calculated the postoperative improvement in each component
for every patient as a percentage. The difference in the
postoperative improvement between the two groups was
significant with regards to the physical summary only.
However, looking to the different components, we found a
significant difference concerning three components: bodily
pain, vitality and role emotional. These components are also
closely related to the mental status and cannot be only
translated as physical components.
Although both groups were matched concerning age and
level of education, patients of the self management group
have shown better quality of life at one year follow-up. There
are possible reasons for this difference. Patients of the self
management group have a more detailed knowledge about
anticoagulant therapy and the influence of diet, infectious
diseases, alcohol, drug interactions, etc. than patients of the
conventional group. They are therefore very much aware of
the potential complications concerning this treatment.
Furthermore, the patients have a higher degree of compliance because they are highly motivated, since they do not
need to go to the ‘Local Thrombosis Service’ for blood
specimen and dose adjustment. This allows the patients to
travel and manage their job without interruption which
conventional management has on their daily life.
Although some studies have also pointed out that self
management improves the quality of life [20,21], our study
was unique in adopting a standard well-known questionnaire
(SF-36v2)W.
In conclusion, this study has confirmed the efficacy of the
self management in improving the INR control in this group of
patients. Although we did not investigate incidence of
complication, patients of the self management group had
significantly shorter periods of risk than the conventional
group. Improvement in the quality of life was only significant
in the self management group concerning only the physical
summary.
