Abstract
Background: Computer-assistance and self-monitoring lower the cost and may improve the quality of
anticoagulation therapy. The main purpose of this clinical investigation was to use computer-assisted oral
anticoagulant therapy to improve the time to reach and the time spent within the therapeutic target range
compared to traditional oral anticoagulant therapy by physicians.
Methods: 54 patients were randomized equally into 3 groups. Patients in two groups used CoaguChekW systems
to measure international normalized ratio (INR) values and had dosages of anticoagulation treatment calculated in a
computer system by an algorithm specific to each group. The third group received traditional anticoagulation
treatment by physicians. The obtained INR values were compared regarding the time to reach, and the time spent
within, the therapeutic target range, corresponding to INR values from 2 to 3.
Results: Patients randomized to computer-assisted anticoagulation and the CoaguChekW system reached the
therapeutic target range after 8 days compared to 14 days by prescriptions from physicians (p = 0.04). Time spent in
the therapeutic target range did not differ between groups. The median INR value measured throughout the study
from all patients by CoaguChekW at 2.5 (2.42–2.62) was lower than measured by a hospital-based Clinical and
Biochemical Laboratory at 2.6 (2.45–2.76), (p = 0.02).
Conclusions: The therapeutic target range was reached faster by the use of computer-assisted anticoagulation
treatment than prescribed by physicians, and the total time spent within the therapeutic target range was similar.
Thus computer-assisted oral anticoagulant therapy may reduce the cost of anticoagulation therapy without
lowering the quality. INR values measured by CoaguChekW were reliable compared to measurements by a clinical
and biochemical laboratory.
Background
Oral anticoagulant therapy with vitamin K antagonists is
increasingly used and has widely documented effects for
prophylaxis and treatment of several thromboembolic
events [1,2]. The number of Danish patients on oral
anticoagulant therapy is increasing and although the
exact number is unknown, about 1.6% of all Danes are
estimated to receive oral anticoagulant therapy [2-4].
Oral anticoagulant therapy increases the risk of bleeding
and if the treatment is not strictly controlled, bleedings
diminish the net benefit of therapy [1-5]. In some clinical studies the annual risk of serious bleedings reached
6-7%, with 1% fatal [1,6-9]. The time in therapeutic target range (TTR), corresponding to an international normalized ratio (INR) between 2 and 3, correlates strongly
and negatively with the incidence of bleedings and
thromboembolic events and is often used as a surrogate
marker for efficacy and quality of the therapy [1,2,7,8,10].
The establishment of specialized anticoagulation
clinics has improved oral anticoagulant therapy among a
large number of patients by standardizing procedures
[11], and the use of computer-aided-management-systems reduce the amount of time used by the physician
prescribing oral anticoagulant therapy and improve the
quality of the therapy [12-15].
Oral anticoagulant therapy is a troublesome and
demanding task for both patients and physicians. Selfmanagement of oral anticoagulant therapy using coagulometers at home is increasingly used and is safe [14-16].

The quality of oral anticoagulant therapy should be continuously documented and monitored to ensure maximum efficacy and a minimum of complications, and
especially improving strategies for maintaining INR between 2 and 3 are important to reduce hemorrhagic or
thromboembolic events [10].
The main purpose of this clinical investigation was to
use computer-assisted oral anticoagulant therapies to
improve the time to reach and the time in the TTR compared to traditional oral anticoagulant therapy by physicians. Specifically our primary endpoint was to maintain
INR in the TTR for at least 80% of the treatment time,
since specialized anticoagulation clinics already have
been able to maintain INR in the TTR during 60 to 70%
of the treatment time, although traditional therapies by
physicians may result in less than 50% treatment time in
the TTR [14]. Finally we examined if INR measured by
patients using CoaguChekW correlated with the INR
measured at our hospital-based Clinical Biochemical
Laboratory.
This investigation is innovative in combining two
technological advancements (computerized treatment algorithm and point of care testing) in patients on warfarin with the implicit ultimate goal of streamlining and
improving dosing regimens.
Oral direct thrombin inhibitors are rapidly emerging
as a possible therapeutic option for oral anticoagulation
without the need for intensive dose/monitoring regimens, but oral direct thrombin inhibitors may be expensive, and cannot be used in patients with impaired renal
function, and therefore warfarin treatments are not easily replaced, especially in patients were warfarin is welltolerated, adding to the current relevance of this clinical
investigation [17].
Methods
A computer-aided management system for telemedical
oral anticoagulant therapy named CoaguTel was developed and tested cooperatively by the IT-company
Context and Frederiksberg Hospital (FH). This computer
system contained an electronic patient record and
enabled continuous monitoring of the quality of oral
anticoagulant therapy. CoaguTel offered a computeraided management system for the physician regarding
indications, contraindications, recommended therapeutic
INR intervals and the recommended duration of the
treatment. The system contained algorithms for dosages,
e.g. when an INR value was obtained, the system suggested both a dosage of warfarin (MarevanW) and a time
point for obtaining the next INR. INR values were
automatically transferred from the Clinical Biochemical
Laboratory to CoaguTel.
The patient population in this investigation was
included January 20th 2002 to January 6th 2004 from both
FH’s Cardiological-Endocrinological Department and the
Stroke Unit. Most of the patients were warfarin naïve and
had ischemic stroke with atrial fibrillation, atrial fibrillation without stroke and other diagnoses e.g. deep venous
thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. Patients with indications for oral anticoagulant therapy were offered to participate in this study and there were no exclusion criteria.
Cognition was not measured due to limited resources,
but all patients were screened to make sure that they
were able to participate in the study and were thought to
be compliant to anticoagulant therapy. Patients who after
learning and under guidance were able to operate the
CoaguChekW system were offered to use this system, but
all INR values measured by the CoaguChekW system were
simultaneously measured by the Clinical Biochemical Laboratory. None of the patients refused to participate, and
patient data were recorded in CoaguTel system. Due to
the use of traditional oral anticoagulant therapy by a
physician it was not possible to blind investigators completely, but investigators were blinded for group-specific
algorithms (group 1 and 2) and all statistical analysis of
results were performed by personnel who did not participate in data collection, study design and who had no
competing interest. Furthermore the randomization of
patients was randomly performed by computer stratified
according to age and diagnosis/indication for oral anticoagulant therapy to one of the following three treatment
groups:
Group 1 Computer-assisted oral anticoagulant therapy
using an algorithm-based initiation followed by
a specially designed algorithm (FH algorithm)
to calculate maintenance dosages [6,12].
Group 2 Computer-assisted oral anticoagulant therapy
using an algorithm-based initiation (identical to
Group 1) and a modified Hillingdon algorithm
to calculate maintenance dosages [6,18].
Group 3 Traditional oral anticoagulant therapy maintained
by a physician without computer assistance.
The algorithm-based initiation of the anticoagulation
treatment was as described in Additional file 1; although
patients estimated as needing a low dosage for maintenance during the first 4 days received 1.5 tablets a day instead of 2 (dosage at initiation × 0.75), but hereafter
patients were treated corresponding to Additional file 1
with all dosages multiplied by 0.75. Twelve or 15 days
after initiation the computer-assisted patients continued
receiving maintenance dosages either by the FH or the
Hillingdon algorithm.
Rasmussen et al. Thrombosis Journal 2012, 10:17 Page 2 of 7
http://www.thrombosisjournal.com/content/10/1/17
The Hillingdon-algorithm was: M = 1 + (0.4 + (1 / (D + 5)) *
ln (T / A), where ”M” is the dosage ratio corresponding to
the factor, by which the previous dosage should be multiplied
with in order to reach the next dosage. “D” is the number of
days between two INR values, while “T” is the INR target
value and “A” is the current INR value [18].
The FH algorithm was a slight adaptation of the
maintenance-algorithms of Table 1. The purpose of the
modification was to make a functional algorithm also for
other therapeutic intervals than those in Table 1.
By using the FH algorithm the computer used the following algorithms:
a. If INR was in the TTR (A = T): No adjustment of
dosage.
b. If INR was above the TTR (A > Ul, where Ul = upper
limit of the TTR), then the following dosage
adjustments were made: Fw = 0.3 + 0.67 Ul/A, (Fw
was the dosage ratio and corresponded to the factor,
by which the last maintenance (weekly) dosage was
to be multiplied with to provide the next weekly
dosage). Furthermore, 1) if Ul/A < 0.88, then
treatment with MarevanW was paused for 24 hours,
2) if Ul/A < 0.61, then MarevanW was paused for 48
hours, 3) if Ul/A = 0.5–0.3, then MarevanW was
paused for 72 hours and 4) if Ul/A < 0.3, then
MarevanW was paused until obtaining the next INR
value.
c. If INR was below the TTR (A < Ll, where Ll = Lower
limit of the TTR), then the following dosage
adjustments were made: Mn = 2.3–1.3 × A/Ll,
although the maximum accepted value of Mn was
1.5. Mn was the factor, which the previous
maintenance dosage was multiplied with to provide
the next maintenance dosage. If A/Ll < 0.8, then a
double dosage of MarevanW was administered at the
day of the INR measurement.
Two blood samples were obtained simultaneously from
patients randomized to computer-assisted management.
A venous blood sample was sent to the Clinical Biochemical Laboratory for measurement of INR and
patients used the coagulometer CoaguChekW S (Roche
Diagnostics, Switzerland) to measure INR. The dosage
of MarevanW was calculated using the INR values
obtained from CoaguChekW. Patients’ randomized to
traditional oral anticoagulant therapy had INR measured
at the Clinical Biochemical Laboratory and dosages of
MarevanW were calculated by different physicians at the
clinical departments of FH.
Ethics
This clinical investigation was subject to the guidelines of
the 2nd Helsinki Declaration. The ethics committees of
Copenhagen and Frederiksberg approved the investigation, file no. 01-014/02. All patients provided written consent in order to participate. Patients were only allowed to
participate by their own free will and could cancel their
consent for participation at any time point. The database
was approved by the relevant Danish authorities.
Statistical analysis
Data from all patients were collected as INR values and
dosages related to the INR values. This investigation had
insufficient data to provide valid measurements of unwanted side effects like thromboembolic events and severe
bleedings. Calculations of the time in the TTR were performed according to the method of Rosendaal [19], where
the total observation time for each patient is categorized
in classes of INR values. Additionally this method

The FH-algorithm was a modification to the algorithm used in this scheme (6). VitK: Vitamin K1. FFP: Freshly frozen plasma. VKA: Vitamin K- antagonist. The
suggested changes to the maintenance dosages presume a steady state corresponding to an unchanged dosage of warfarin for more than 1 week or
phenprocoumon for more than 1 month, and that the sensitivity for VKA is unchanged in the following period of time.

presupposes a linear correlation between two neighboring
INR values. Thereafter the total time in oral anticoagulant
therapy was divided into time in, above or below the TTR,
and the results are provided as percentages [19].
The data was not distributed normally and therefore
non-parametric statistics were used. Mann-Whitney’s
test was performed when comparing individual groups
(unpaired observations) followed by the Kruskal–Wallis
nonparametric analysis of variance test to test for overall
significant differences among groups. For the time in,
above or below the TTR, Wilcoxon’s tests were used for
paired analyses. Wilcoxon’s test was further used to
evaluate differences between INR values from patients,
who had INR measured twice the same day, in order to
compare the measurements from the Clinical Biochemical Laboratory and the CoaguChekW.
P-values below 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Median results are displayed as values followed
by the associated 25th and 75th percentiles in brackets,
unless a more elaborate description is provided.
Power analysis and sample size calculations
In order to compare treatment efficacies, a change in the
time spent in the TTR from 50% to 80% would require
14 patients in both the computer-assisted and the traditionally treated groups, if Z2-alpha and Z-Beta (type 1
and type 2 errors) were 5% and 50% respectively. Thus a
total of 28 patients would need to be included in two
groups. We chose to add a third group in order to compare two different algorithms to traditional therapy. It
may be noted that investigators have found that physicians were able to maintain patients in the TTR for 30
to 60% of the treatment time [14], and using 30% for
reference instead of 50%, sizes would have been reduced
to 5 patients per group in this study.
Results
54 patients were included in this investigation. 19 patients
were randomized to the FH algorithm, 18 patients to the
modified Hillingdon algorithm, and 17 patients to traditional oral anticoagulant therapy performed by physicians.
The patients were investigated during an average of
28 weeks, and the total time of treatment was 29 years
and 4 months. Twenty-three (43%) of the patients were
women and 31 (57%) were men. There were no significant
differences in age, gender or the total treatment duration
between the three treatment groups (Table 2).
Patients randomized to computer-assisted oral anticoagulant therapy reached TTRs at day 8 (7–12) (median
and 25–75 percentiles) compared to traditional oral anticoagulant therapy performed by physicians, where TTRs
were reached at day 14 (8–22) (p = 0.04), as shown in
Figure 1.
The time in percent, when the different groups were
in, above or below the TTR, and the highest recorded
INR values, can be seen in Table 3.
A small difference was found comparing INR values
measured by the Clinical Biochemical Laboratory and by
CoaguChekW, with higher INR values measured by the
Clinical Biochemical Laboratory, 2.60 (2.45–2.76) versus,
2.50 (2.42–2.62), (p = 0.02) measured by CoaguChekW.
More than 94% of all INR values obtained the same day
from the same patient and from both the Clinical Biochemical Laboratory and CoaguChekW were within 0.5
INR-units.
Discussion
In this investigation, computer-assisted oral anticoagulant therapy was at least as efficient as traditional oral
anticoagulant therapy performed by physicians, and
therefore computer-assisted oral anticoagulant therapy
may provide a more cost-effective solution.
Authors of a recent meta-analysis of oral anticoagulation
trials found that keeping patients within INR 2 to 3 should
minimize risks of both hemorrhages and thromboembolic
formations, and that it was safer to keep patients between
INR 3 and 4 than below 2 [10]. We did not achieve significant results, but tendencies indicated that our used algorithms were at least as efficient in avoiding INR values
below 2 as physicians (Table 2). By maintaining patients in
the TTR for ~ 50% of the treatment time the use of algorithms did not expose patients to higher risks of either
hemorrhagic or embolic complications than traditional
therapy.
Our goal of keeping patients in the TTR for at least
80% of the treatment time was not reached indicating
that the algorithms were insufficiently designed to meet
this endpoint, but the use of algorithms made patients
reach the TTR faster than by traditional therapy.
We observed a difference between INR values measured by CoaguChekW and by the Clinical Biochemical
Laboratory. The difference was not larger than the

expected variance when comparing two Danish laboratories and the difference did not provide any significant
influence upon the dosing of warfarin. Therefore INR
values obtained and measured by CoaguChekW were reliable compared to analysis by a laboratory [20-22].
In our present investigation, computer-assisted oral anticoagulant therapy was at least as efficient in maintaining
patients in the TTR as traditional treatments by physicians,
thereby potentially eliminating the need for oral anticoagulant therapy maintained by physicians, and strengthening
similar evidence provided by other investigators [14,15].
Variability in patients’ genotypes and clinical information may cause an increased risk of hemorrhage and
demonstrates the difficulty in warfarin dosing [23]. Our
algorithms did not include genotyping as a parameter
for warfarin dose calculations, and inclusion of pharmacogenetic algorithms may increase patients’ time in the
TTR and reduce adverse events [23].
The mean time in TTR using conventional therapy
performed by physicians or medical specialists varied
from 30% to 60% in several studies, and when these
patients were not in the TTR, 75% of patients were
below the range [14]. In our study physicians maintained
INR in the TTR for 55% of the treatment time, and
when not in range, patients were more likely to be below
the range than above. Therefore the performance of physicians in our study corresponded to other studies [14].
Unfortunately the algorithms in our study did not keep
patients in the TTR for longer periods of time in comparison to patients receiving traditional anticoagulation
therapy. Specialized anticoagulation clinics have maintained patients in TTR for 60% to 70% of the treatment
time, although a substantial number of patients still were
below or above the TTR for considerable periods of time
[14]. Furthermore in many countries visiting specialized
anticoagulation clinics may be time consuming for
patients or inconvenient thereby reducing patients’ treatment satisfaction and quality of life.
In a recent study patients spent 80% of treatment time
in the TTR by twice weekly performing INR measurement at home and online report. In comparison patients
in an anticoagulation clinic spent 73% of their treatment
time in the TTR [24]. The before mentioned study did
not use algorithms for warfarin dose calculations, but
had specialized anticoagulation staff (5 medical doctors)
reporting new warfarin doses to patients within 4 hours
of receiving patients’ self-reported INR values. Thus the
latter study did require more manpower than our computerized algorithms, but also provided the possibility
for patients to measure INR at home. Thus the major
challenge may be to improve algorithms, possible by the
inclusion of pharmacogenetics, to provide similar or better anticoagulation management compared to current
efficacies of physicians and medical specialists.
An increased risk of adverse events may explain the
fact that too few patients with increased risk of
thromboembolic events receive oral anticoagulant therapy. Only 12–40% of patients with atrial fibrillation and
increased risks of thromboembolic events received anticoagulation treatment. Such findings may be partly
explained by contraindications, but often it is a subjective decision by physicians to treat a patient with oral
anticoagulant therapy or not [25,26]. In one stroke trial
18% of patients experienced atrial fibrillations and 70%
had atrial fibrillations diagnosed before the stroke, but
only 21% of these patients received anticoagulation treatment and many thromboembolic events could presumably be avoided by anticoagulation treatment [25]. Oral
anticoagulant therapy is demanding for the patient, and
an increasing number of patients increase hospital workloads. Self-monitored oral anticoagulant therapy, where
a patient measures INR by using a coagulometer at
home, decreases the workload of both patients and
therapists. Thus our study supports the growing positive
evidence of using computer-assisted oral anticoagulation,

because the quality and costs of computer-assisted oral
anticoagulation therapy were equal or better than traditional oral anticoagulation therapy performed by physicians. Such findings may lead to an increased use of oral
anticoagulation therapies and reduce risks of thromboembolic strokes.
Conclusions and suggestions for future research
Results from our study showed that dosing algorithms
matched the performance of physicians, and future optimizations of dosing algorithms, possibly including pharmacogenetics, may provide more time in the TTR, reduce the
involvement of physicians or medical specialists in dose calculations and expand the cost-effectiveness of computerassisted oral anticoagulation therapies.

computer-assisted algorithms were treated according to this scheme
from day 1 to day 12 or day 15 (6). An example of using the table above:
After 4 days of 5 mg daily warfarin treatment (5 mg = 2 tablets) the INR
was 2.6. According to point 3, the patient should continue with 1 tablet
daily. Day 8 INR was 2.0. According to point 4, the patient should
hereafter continue treatment with 8 tablets per week. Point 5 shows that
