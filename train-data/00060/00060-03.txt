Abstract
Background: The efficacy of self-managed oral anticoagulant therapy has been addressed in few randomized, controlled trials, which have
provided inconsistent results. The aim of this study was to compare the quality of self-managed oral anticoagulant therapy with conventional
management.
Methods: This was a pragmatic, open-label, randomized, controlled trial where 100 patients receiving long-term oral anticoagulant therapy
referred to a Danish clinic for self-management was randomized to either self-management of oral anticoagulant therapy (including a
teaching program of self-management followed by 6 months of self-management) or 6 months of conventional management. The primary
endpoint was an intention-to-treat analysis of a composite score combining the variance (median square of the standard deviation) of the
International Normalized Ratio (INR) value (using a blinded control sample analyzed monthly by a reference laboratory), death, major
complications, or discontinuation from the study. Secondary endpoints – assessed in per-protocol analyses – were the variance of the INR
value (using the blinded control sample) and time within therapeutic INR target range using the standard INR values from the coagulometer
and laboratory measurement.
Results: There was no significant difference in the primary endpoint between the self-management and conventional management groups
(composite score 0.16 vs. 0.24, respectively, p = 0.09). Self-management was significantly better (0.16 vs. 0.24, p = 0.003) with regard to the
variance in a per-protocol analysis. The difference in time within therapeutic INR target range was not significantly better (78.7% vs. 68.9%,
p = 0.14) using self-management.
Conclusion: The quality of self-management of oral anticoagulant therapy is at least as good as that provided by conventional management.

1. Introduction
Oral anticoagulation therapy with coumarin is prescribed
as prevention and treatment to patients who have an
increased risk of thromboembolism [1]. Since oral anticoagulation therapy increases the risk of bleeding, the
therapy requires a balance between the risks of these two
outcomes.
Oral anticoagulation therapy is conventionally monitored
by laboratory analysis of the International Normalized Ratio
(INR) on plasma obtained by venipuncture. Based on the
INR value, health care providers determine the appropriate
dosage of coumarin.
Despite close monitoring of therapy, thromboembolism
and bleeding are common worries and account for a large
proportion of the morbidity and mortality in these patients.
Variable oral anticoagulation therapy is the most important

factor for mortality in patients with mechanical heart
valves [2] and is responsible for approximately 75% of all
the postoperative complications observed in these patients
[3]. Low quality of oral anticoagulation therapy has also
been shown in other groups of patients [4].
Optimized oral anticoagulation therapy is thus likely to
improve the quality of treatment [5,6]. A potential avenue of
improvement is patient self-management, in which patients
analyze a drop of blood in a portable coagulometer (INRmonitor) to decide on coumarin dosage. To date, nine
randomized controlled trials of patient self-management
have been conducted [3,7 – 14], three of which reported a
statistically significant difference in favor of patient selfmanagement. The studies have primarily used surrogate
outcomes, such as time within therapeutic INR target range,
which is highly dependent on the frequency of testing, the
therapeutic INR target range, and the method of calculation.
Furthermore, it has recently been shown that time within
therapeutic INR target range does not correlate well with the
frequency of complications [13].
Another measure of the treatment quality is the variability of the INR. Large variability is associated with an
increased risk of complications [2,15,16].
Often, the laboratory INR is compared to that measured
by the coagulometer. Yet, using two different methods of
measurement is misleading since the INR-result of the two
methods deviate and the estimated deviation is, therefore,
uninformative [17]. External INR control samples using the
same method of estimating the INR with the same frequency
of testing should, therefore, be used when comparing
different types of management.
In general, limitations of sample size, questionable
measurement standardization, inappropriate control selection, randomization procedure, etc. make the interpretation of the existing reports of patient self-management
difficult.
Given conflicting evidence from previous trials, we
wished to re-evaluate self-management for oral anticoagulation therapy. We hypothesized that self-management
yields a better quality of treatment than the conventional
management in eligible patients, and the aim of this study
was to compare the quality of self-management with
conventional management in a randomized, controlled
trial.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Study population
Out of approximately 3 million inhabitants in western
Denmark, an estimated 18,000 persons were prescribed oral
anticoagulation therapy during the period from June 2002 to
August 2003. Patients were potentially eligible for this study
if they were referred for patient self-management by a
general practitioner or hospital department to the Center of
Self-Managed Oral Anticoagulation, Skejby Sygehus, Aarhus University Hospital. Inclusion criteria were: on oral
anticoagulation therapy for at least 8 months, age more than
18 years, and willingness to be randomized. Exclusion
criteria were previous use of patient self-management and
residence/travel abroad.
Eligible and willing patients were evaluated for their
ability to conduct patient self-management. The evaluation
had four dimensions: physical health, mental suitability,
interest in oral anticoagulation therapy, and expected level
of compliance with patient self-management. All of the
evaluations were performed and recorded with the patient
present.
The protocol for the study complied with the Helsinki II
declaration and was approved by the local scientific ethics
committee and The Danish Data Protection Agency. The
patients were included after having given oral and written
consent. The study was conducted according to good
clinical practice (GCP) standards and was monitored and
approved by the GCP-unit, Aarhus University Hospital,
Aarhus, Denmark.
2.2. Study design
This was a pragmatic, open-label, randomized, controlled
trial. Patients who were judged to be qualified for patient
self-management were randomly assigned to patient selfmanagement or conventional management using a computerized, prospective, randomization schedule. Randomization
in blocks with various sizes in numbers of 2, 4, and 6
without blinding of allocation was used.
The training for patient self-management is shown
schematically in Fig. 1. First, the patient practiced analyzing
blood specimens. The patient then gradually assumed
management of the oral anticoagulation therapy, initially
by suggesting the anticoagulant therapy dosage and
subsequently by taking over the dosage adjustment followed
by monitoring. After 27 weeks the patient were required to
display their skills in an exam. If this test was passed, the
patient was labeled self-managing. To resolve problems,
patients were instructed to contact the Center of SelfManaged Oral Anticoagulation.
Self-management patients reported their INR values and
coumarin doses to the training center every 3rd month. The
performance of each patient’s coagulometer was controlled
by the patient approximately every 11th month and by the
Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Skejby Sygehus,
Aarhus University Hospital every 9th month.
In the conventional management group, the physician or
hospital that had managed the patient’s oral anticoagulation
therapy before the patient was enrolled in the study
continued their conventional management for the 6 months
after enrollment. After these 6 months, these patients began
training in patient self-management, and the patient completed participation in the study when she/he had passed the
patient self-management exam.

2.3. Observation period
The analysis focused on three time periods:
1) 8– 12 months before randomization
2) Primary observation period (6 months of either patient
self-management or conventional management)
3) Patient self-management training (27 weeks)
There was a 6-month primary observation period; for the
patient self-management subjects, this began immediately
after successful completion of the patient self-management
exam. For the conventional management subjects, it began
immediately after randomization.
2.4. INR-analysis methods and INR values
Patients in the patient self-management group used the
CoaguChek\ S coagulometer (Roche Diagnostics, Switzerland) equipped with CoaguChek\ PT-test strips. A finger
puncture device (Softclix\) was used to release a drop (10 –
25 Al) of capillary whole blood, which was applied to the
test strip and inserted into the coagulometer. The INR value
was displayed after 1– 2 min and recorded by the patient on
a dedicated data sheet. INR was measured on the
coagulometer once a week and these results were used by
the patient to adjust the coumarin dosage.
Patients in the conventional management group continued their pre-randomization routine consisting of at least
monthly blood sampling either at the hospital laboratory
nearest the patient’s home or with a coagulometer at a
physician’s office. These results were used to adjust the
coumarin dosage.
In both groups, an additional (control) blood sample was
taken once a month from each patient. This sample was sent
the same day for INR analyses to the Department of Clinical
Biochemistry, Skejby Sygehus, Aarhus University Hospital.
A Behring Coagulation Timer (Behring Werke AG, Marburg, Germany) was used with Nycotest\ PT thromboplastin (Axis-Shield PoC AS, Oslo, Norway) with an ISI-value
from 1.02 to 1.06.
The result of these INR analyses was blinded for all
except for one secretary who would ensure the safety of the
patient by contacting the managing physician if the INR
value was below 1.5 or above 4.5.
If the patient temporarily stopped oral anticoagulation
therapy or reduced the dose (e.g., because of surgery), the
INR values were excluded from that time until 10 days after
re-initiation of full oral anticoagulation therapy.
Coumarin dose was expressed as mg/day. Warfarin
(Marevan\) or phenprocoumon (Marcoumar\) was used
as coumarin.
2.5. Endpoint and statistical analysis
Major complications were defined as thromboembolism
and bleeding events requiring intervention. Death, major
complications, and/or discontinuation of the study were
reported to the investigator either by the patient or by the
managing physician and were verified by medical records.
The primary endpoint of the trial was a composite
consisting of the variance (median square of the standard
deviation) of the INR value from the monthly control
sample plus ‘‘penalty points’’ for death, major complication,
or study discontinuation. For deaths, major complications,
and discontinuation, the points were set in the protocol to
1000, 100, and 10, respectively. This was done during the
training phase (27 weeks) and the 6-month primary
observation period. If a patient randomized to conventional
management dropped out during the training for patient selfmanagement (after the primary observation period), his/her
variance was added to the patient self-management group.
Thus, these dropouts negatively affected the result of the
patient self-management group.

coagulometer and by weekly hospital INR measurements. After these 3 weeks of daily training, INR measurements are made weekly and hospital INR
measurements are obtained every 3rd or 4th week for another 24 weeks. In this 24-week period, co-responsibility for dosage adjustment is gradually transferred
from physician to patient. Self-control analyses and external control of the CoaguChek\ coagulometer are made every 11th month and by the laboratory at the
Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Skejby Sygehus, Aarhus University Hospital every 9th month, respectively.

The main secondary endpoint was the variance of the
INR value in the control sample in a per-protocol analysis.
Furthermore, time within therapeutic INR target range was
estimated in the two trial arms using the coagulometer
measurements in the patient self-management group and the
laboratory measurements in the conventional management
group.
In the primary analysis, the data were analyzed by
intention-to-treat, and the secondary analysis was perprotocol. The Mann –Whitney U-test was used to compare
groups, and the Wilcoxon W-test was used to compare
paired data. We considered a p level below 0.05 (two-tailed)
to be statistically significant.
As the variance of the INR values in our population was
unknown, we estimated sample size using the time within
therapeutic INR target range, which was expected to be
approximately 77% in the patient self-management group
and 67% in the conventional management group with a
standard deviation of 15% [18]. In order to detect this
difference with a type I error of 0.05 and 80% power, 36
patients were needed. Due to the short follow-up and an
anticipated failure of some patients to complete patient selfmanagement training, 50 patients in each group were
considered appropriate.
3. Results
3.1. Patients
Two hundred and forty patients were referred to the
Center of Self-Managed Oral Anticoagulation for patient
self-management from 1 May 2002 to 6 August 2003, and
100 patients were randomized. Baseline demographics in
the two treatment groups are displayed in Table 1. We
excluded 140 patients for the following reasons: not on oral
anticoagulation therapy for at least 8 months (n = 77), age
under 18 years (n = 9), previous use of patient selfmanagement (n = 3), refusal to participate (n = 18), no
response from the patient after referral (n = 5), residence/
travel abroad (n = 6), unqualified for patient self-management (n = 15; 13% of all the patients assessed), and other
reasons (n = 7).
In the patient self-management arm, three patients
dropped out: one during the training period (withdrawn
by the treating physician), one patient during patient selfmanagement training, and one patient died during the
primary observation period. In the conventional management arm, one patient was withdrawn by the treating
physician in the primary observation period and four
patients dropped out during patient self-management
training. The two patients withdrawn by physicians were
excluded from the analysis. Thus, 98 patients were
included in the primary endpoint analysis and 92 were
included in the secondary endpoint analysis. Time within
therapeutic INR target range was estimated using data
from 90 patients since 2 patients in the conventional
management group only had one INR sample taken. No
major complications occurred. All patients remaining in
the study passed the patient self-management exam after
27 weeks.
3.2. INR values and coumarin dosage
The total number of INR measurements in the primary
observation period is shown in Table 2.
Four patients had their oral anticoagulation therapy
suspended or reduced in dose, and their INR values were
excluded for a total of 80 days.
Patients who had changed the type of coumarin
preparation within 1 year before randomization and those
with a therapeutic INR target range other than 2.0 – 3.0 were
excluded from this analysis. The only significant difference
was observed with regard to warfarin in the patient selfmanagement group, where the dose was significantly

increased during the training and primary observation
periods compared to the pre-randomization period (Table 3).
3.3. Outcome
Among the 98 patients included in the primary
analysis, the median values of the composite endpoint
in the patient self-management and conventional management groups were 0.16 and 0.24, respectively ( p = 0.09).
Among the 92 patients included in the secondary analysis,
the median values of the secondary endpoint in the patient
self-management arm (n = 47) and conventional management arm (n = 45) were 0.16 and 0.24, respectively
( p = 0.003). Time within therapeutic INR target range in
the patient self-management and conventional management group was 78.7% and 68.9%, respectively ( p = 0.14;
Table 2).
The variance of the control sample was reduced
significantly in the conventional management group after
shifting from conventional management to training for
patient self-management. In the patient self-management
group, a non-significant reduction in the variance was
observed after shifting from training to patient selfmanagement (Table 4).
4. Discussion
Using a composite endpoint in the intention-to-treat
analysis, we found the quality of oral anticoagulation
therapy using patient self-management to be comparable
to conventional management. In the per-protocol analysis,
the difference favoring patient self-management was statistically significant.
In the conventional management group, a reduction in
variance of INR was observed when patients underwent
training for patient self-management. In the patient selfmanagement group, a reduction in variance was found after
the shift from training to the period of patient selfmanagement (Table 4). The patients referred to our clinic
comprised a selected group with various indications for oral
anticoagulation therapy. All patients were evaluated for
patient self-management and only those deemed qualified
were then randomized. By enrolling only patients qualified
for patient self-management, we avoided mixing of the
effects of patient qualification with those of the procedures
under study.
The ideal outcome in oral anticoagulation therapy studies
is the incidence of major complications and mortality, but
such studies require large numbers of patients and a long
follow-up. In this trial we used a composite endpoint
consisting of both surrogate and clinical outcomes. Owing
to the serious drawbacks of time within therapeutic INR
target range, we used the variance of the INR value as an
indicator of the treatment quality and included a blinded
control sample. The frequency of sampling was equal in the
two study arms, and the INR values in blood samples were
obtained by the same laboratory at a short enough interval
(< 24 h) to have no significant effect on the INR [19,20]. Of
the two studies with relatively large numbers of patients
[3,13], only the study by Ko¨ rtke and Ko¨ rfer [3] was
powered to detect a difference in the number of complications. They reported a significant reduction in complications

in patient self-management compared to conventional
management. However, this study had several limitations,
including important deviations to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines [21] and
failure to account for dropouts.
Mene´ndez-Ja´ndula et al. [13] recently reported a dropout
rate of 21%, and the dropouts were not accounted for in the
statistical analysis. In our study, the dropout rate was
approximately 5%. Including the dropout patients in the
statistical analysis helps avoid overestimation of the positive
effect of patient self-management in the primary endpoint.
Owing to the 27-week training period and to prospective
inclusion of patients, there was a time gap regarding
intervention. This might have resulted in frustration among
patients randomized to conventional management since they
had been referred for patient self-management. This could
have lowered the quality of conventional management and
early dropout rate from that arm. We estimated that a 6-
month follow-up period was the longest we could achieve
without generating a reluctance of potential subjects to take
part.
The patients in our study were specifically referred for
patient self-management, indicating that they had been prescreened with respect to motivation for patient selfmanagement. We do not know what proportion these
patients constitute of the typical oral anticoagulation therapy
patient population.
The change in dose of warfarin in the patient selfmanagement group could have been due to chance, to
imprecision of the coagulometer used, or to the fact that
patients randomized to patient self-management aimed for a
more intense anticoagulation (i.e., a higher INR). This
finding calls for further investigation.
There are probably several reasons why a patient selfmanagement group performs at least as well as a group of
patients under conventional management. The former group
receives more detailed information about oral anticoagulation therapy and the influence of diet, infectious diseases,
alcohol, drug interactions, etc. on oral anticoagulation
therapy than is practically feasible for an average health
care provider. At this point, large, well-designed, randomized, controlled trials using clearly defined clinical endpoints are needed to thoroughly investigate patient selfmanagement.
