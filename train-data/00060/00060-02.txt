A Multicomponent Intervention To Prevent Major Bleeding
Complications in Older Patients Receiving Warfarin
A Randomized, Controlled Trial
Rebecca J. Beyth, MD, MS; Linda Quinn, MS; and C. Seth Landefeld, MD
Background: Warfarin is effective in the treatment and prevention of many venous thromboembolic disorders, but it often leads
to bleeding.
Objective: To develop a multicomponent program of management of warfarin therapy and to determine its effect on the frequency of warfarin-related major bleeding in older patients.
Design: Randomized, controlled trial.
Setting: University hospital in Cleveland, Ohio.
Patients: 325 patients 65 years of age or older who started
warfarin therapy during hospitalization.
Interventions: Patients were stratified according to baseline risk
for major bleeding and were randomly assigned to receive the
intervention (n 5 163) or usual care (n 5 162) by their primary
physicians for 6 months. The intervention consisted of patient
education about warfarin, training to increase patient participation,
self-monitoring of prothrombin time, and guideline-based management of warfarin dosing.
Measurements: Major bleeding, death, recurrent venous thromboembolism, and therapeutic control of anticoagulant therapy at 6
months.
Results: In an intention-to-treat analysis, major bleeding was
more common at 6 months in the usual care group than in the
intervention group (cumulative incidence, 12% vs. 5.6%; P 5
0.0498, log-rank test). The most frequent site of major bleeding in
both groups was the gastrointestinal tract. Death and recurrent
venous thromboembolism occurred with similar frequency in both
groups at 6 months. Throughout 6 months, the proportion of total
treatment time during which the international normalized ratio
was within the therapeutic range was higher in the intervention
group than in the usual care group (56% vs. 32%; P < 0.001).
After 6 months, major bleeding occurred with similar frequencies
in the intervention and usual care groups.
Conclusions: A multicomponent comprehensive program of
warfarin management reduced the frequency of major bleeding in
older patients. Although the generalizability and cost-effectiveness
of this program remain to be demonstrated, these findings support
the premise that efforts to reduce the likelihood of major bleeding
will lead to safe and effective use of warfarin therapy in older
patients.

Bleeding is the major side effect of warfarin and is a
major deterrent to its use, especially in older patients.
Older people are widely thought to be at increased risk for
warfarin-related bleeding (1–8), and they are less likely to
be treated with warfarin, even when it has been proven
efficacious, in part because of concern about risk for bleeding (9–13). Efforts that reduce the frequency of major
warfarin-related bleeding not only will increase the net
benefit of therapy but also will facilitate more appropriate
and widespread use of warfarin therapy in older patients.
Methods for identifying patients at highest risk for bleeding have recently advanced (5–7, 14–21), and experience
with specialized programs that coordinate the management
of anticoagulant therapy suggests that clinical outcomes
may be improved (6, 14, 18, 22–27). However, there is
little controlled or experimental evidence on how to optimize management of anticoagulant therapy in older patients and prevent bleeding.
We developed a multicomponent comprehensive program for management of warfarin therapy aimed at improving control of the anticoagulant effect and reducing
events (such as use of an interacting medicine) that might
precipitate bleeding. We hypothesized that this intervention would be acceptable to most elderly persons starting
warfarin therapy and would reduce the frequency of warfarin-related major bleeding.
METHODS
Patients
Patients hospitalized at University Hospitals of Cleveland, a 900-bed teaching hospital, between September
1992 and October 1995 who were 65 years of age or older
and were receiving 10 000 units or more of intravenous
unfractionated heparin every 24 hours were screened daily.
Of these patients, we identified 426 persons who were 65

years of age or older, who resided in Cuyahoga County,
Ohio, and for whom treatment with warfarin was planned
for 10 or more days (Figure 1). Patients were excluded if
they had been treated with warfarin at any time during the
previous 6 months, were admitted from a nursing home,
were enrolled in another clinical trial, were too ill to give
consent and had no available surrogate, were discharged
prematurely, or did not speak English; if their private physician refused to participate; or if no random allocation was
taking place (for example, during vacations or holidays).
Eligible patients who were enrolled did not differ significantly from those who were not enrolled with regard to
age, ethnicity, sex, or indication for therapy.
Patients were stratified according to their baseline risk
for major bleeding by using the Outpatient Bleeding Risk
Index (20). This index includes four independent risk factors for major bleeding: age 65 years or older, history of
gastrointestinal bleeding, history of stroke, and one or
more of four specific comorbid conditions (recent myocardial infarction, hematocrit , 30%, creatinine concentration . 133 mmol/L [1.5 mg/dL], or diabetes mellitus). Patients with one or two risk factors were classified as
intermediate risk, and those with three or more risk factors
were classified as high risk; estimated frequencies of major
bleeding in 6 months were 6% and 35%, respectively.
After stratification, patients were randomly assigned to
receive usual care or intervention. Informed consent for
observation and data collection was then sought from both
groups, and informed consent to participate in the intervention was sought from the intervention group. This
method, initially proposed by Zelen (28), allows the study
to test the effectiveness of offering the intervention rather
than simply the efficacy of the intervention in patients who
consent to participation before random assignment. The
sample size was calculated to provide 80% power and an a
level of 0.05. The study protocol and informed consent
procedures were approved by the hospital’s institutional
review board.
Intervention
The intervention had two main components. The first
component consisted of a guideline-based consultation
that assessed the patient’s indications for therapy and potential risk factors for warfarin-related bleeding. We used
this method previously to reduce the frequency of anticoagulant-related bleeding during hospitalization (27). Specific recommendations about modifiable risk factors, such
as use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, were made
and implemented. The study investigators directed warfarin dosing and international normalized ratio (INR) testing
after hospital discharge. The second component included
patient education, coaching, and self-monitoring of prothrombin time; this component was grounded in social
learning theory (29–31) and experimental evidence (32,
33) showing that increasing participation of patients in
their care can improve clinical outcomes but that increasing patient knowledge alone is insufficient (34, 35). Patient
education consisted of one-on-one teaching by a lay educator using a specifically formatted workbook for older
adults to teach them about warfarin, indications for its use,
drug and food interactions, and the signs and symptoms of
bleeding. The lay educator reviewed the workbook and was
taught how to use the prothrombin time monitor by one
of the authors but had no formal medical training. Coaching was aimed to increase patients’ participation in their
care and to improve information-seeking skills. Patients
were trained and encouraged to communicate more effectively with physicians and other health personnel about a
range of issues, such as health concerns, drug interactions,

or changes in lifestyle or diet. Finally, patients were taught
to self-monitor the prothrombin time by using a home
portable monitor (Coumatrak Protime Test System, Biotrack, Inc., Mountain View, California). The monitor uses
a fingerstick to obtain a blood sample and has well-established accuracy (36–38).
Patients were initially assessed, educated, and taught to
use the portable monitor while hospitalized; training lasted
30 minutes to 1 hour. They were seen daily while hospitalized, warfarin therapy was adjusted as needed, and any
concerns or questions about anticoagulant therapy were
addressed. Within 3 days of discharge from the hospital,
the lay educator or study investigator made a home visit to
assess patients’ use of the portable monitor and to check
the prothrombin time. In general, patients were instructed
to check their prothrombin time three times during the
first week after hospital discharge, weekly for the remainder
of the first month, and monthly thereafter depending on
their results. Patients phoned in their results to the coach,
who reviewed the results with one of the investigators and
provided same-day follow-up, including recommendations
for dose and subsequent INR testing. Patients were instructed to call whenever they had questions or concerns
about their warfarin management or possible side effects, if
they were hospitalized for any reason, or if they began
receiving new medications. After the 6-month intervention
period, management and dosing of warfarin therapy reverted back to patients’ personal physicians.
Patients assigned to usual care received medical care,
including management, dosing, and medical information,
according to the discretion and practices of their personal
physician.
Data Collection
Trained abstractors who were not involved with the
intervention component of the study collected data from
the medical chart at the start of anticoagulant therapy; at
each subsequent hospitalization; and by blinded interview
at enrollment and 1, 3, and 6 months after enrollment and
every 6 months thereafter. Data elements included demographic characteristics, clinical history including comorbid
diagnoses, indications for therapy, potential risk factors for
bleeding, functional status, and new illnesses or comorbid
conditions that developed after enrollment. Surveillance
for bleeding and thromboembolism was conducted identically in the intervention and control groups and consisted
of 12 items inquiring about bleeding and thromboembolism at each follow-up interview. Whenever an event was
reported, the clinical characteristics of the bleeding or
thromboembolic episode were determined by review of the
relevant medical record and abstracted without identifying
patient information onto a standard form. All dates of
death were confirmed by death certificates, and all causes
of death were confirmed by review of death certificates and
medical records. Follow-up was complete for all patients.
End Points
The primary end point was the first major bleeding
event during the 6-month intervention period. Using explicit criteria in the Bleeding Severity Index (39) for the
amount, rate, and consequences of bleeding, we defined
major bleeding as overt bleeding that led to the loss of at
least 2.0 units of blood in 7 days or less or was otherwise
life-threatening (for example, intracranial bleeding). Bleeding was classified without information about possible risk
factors or randomization status. Two author-reviewers who
were blinded to group assignment adjudicated bleeding
events; their agreement was high (k statistic, 0.97).
Secondary outcomes were death and recurrent venous
thromboembolism at 6 months; major bleeding after 6
months; and control of anticoagulant therapy during the
first 6 months of therapy, as measured by the INR. The
therapeutic range of the INR was defined as 2.5 to 3.5 for
persons with mechanical heart valves and 2.0 to 3.0 for
persons with all other indications (40). Therapeutic quality
control was assessed by using the “patient-time” approach,
described by Rosendaal and colleagues (41), for three time
periods after discharge from the hospital: 0 to 1 month, 1
to 3 months, and 3 to 6 months of therapy. This approach
estimates the amount of time a patient is in the therapeutic
range based on the actual INRs measured, assuming a linear relationship between consecutive INRs. Patients with
only one INR measurement during the time period and
those not discharged with continued warfarin therapy were
excluded from the analyses.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses of all outcomes were performed on
an intention-to-treat basis. The rate of major bleeding during the 6-month intervention was determined. The rates of
major bleeding during hospitalization and at 1 month and

6 months after discharge were also ascertained. Control of
therapy and other secondary outcomes were evaluated.
Differences between groups were evaluated by using
the chi-square statistic for categorical variables, the Wilcoxon rank-sum statistic for continuous variables, and the
log-rank test for survival curves. All tests of significance
were two-tailed. Cumulative incidences of major bleeding
were determined by using the Kaplan–Meier technique.
Patients were censored at the first major bleeding event,
death, or cessation of anticoagulant therapy, whichever
came first. All analyses were performed by using SAS software (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina).

RESULTS
The mean age of the patients was 75 years (range, 65
to 94 years). Fifty-seven percent of patients were women,
and 67% were white. The primary indication for warfarin
therapy was venous thromboembolism in 38% of patients,
atrial fibrillation in 17%, cerebrovascular disease in 15%,
heart prosthesis in 11%, and other indications in 19%.
The baseline risk for bleeding was classified as intermediate
in 85% of patients and high in 15%. At enrollment, the
intervention group and the usual care group did not differ
in clinical or sociodemographic variables (Table 1).
Among the 163 patients randomly assigned to the intervention group, 132 (81%) participated in the intervention. Of the 163 patients, 46 patients (28%) monitored
their prothrombin time themselves; 50 (31%) had a
spouse, other relative, or visiting nurse help with their prothrombin time monitoring; and 36 (22%) were monitored
conventionally without self-monitoring (20 had physical
limitations, such as severe arthritis or decreased vision; 12
felt more comfortable with venipuncture; 3 stopped warfarin therapy during the index hospitalization; and 1 was
discharged to a nursing home that precluded use of the
portable monitor). Thirty-one patients (19%) declined to
participate in the intervention; their anticoagulant therapy
was managed by their personal physician.
The cumulative incidences of major bleeding at 1, 3,
and 6 months were 4.6%, 4.6%, and 5.6%, respectively, in
the intervention group and 7%, 12%, and 12%, in the
usual care group (P 5 0.0498, log-rank test) (Figure 2).
The most common site of bleeding during the 6 months
was the gastrointestinal tract in both groups (Table 2).
Major bleeding was fatal in one patient in the intervention

group and three patients in the usual care group. Excessive
anticoagulation and a recent history of an invasive procedure or surgery at the time of major bleeding were more
common among patients in the usual care group than
among those in the intervention group (Table 2). Of the
eight major bleeding events that occurred in the intervention group, six occurred in patients who had declined the
intervention, including the one patient with fatal gastrointestinal bleeding and two patients with intracranial bleeding.
Almost half (12 of 25) of the major bleeding events
occurred during the index hospitalization; of these, 3 occurred in the intervention group and 9 occurred in the
usual care group (P 5 0.08). The respective cumulative
incidences of major bleeding were 2.7% and 2.2% at 1
month after discharge and 3.7% and 6.5% at 6 months
after discharge among patients who survived to discharge
(P . 0.2 by log-rank technique). After 6 months, major
bleeding occurred in 2 patients in the intervention group
and 3 patients in the usual care group (P . 0.2).
A total of 4091 INR measurements were taken during
26 065 patient-days of follow-up; the median number of
determinations per patient was 17 (range, 2 to 39) in the
intervention group and 10.5 (range, 2 to 44) in the usual
care group. Patients in the intervention group were within
the therapeutic range at each of the three time periods
significantly more often than were patients who received
usual care (proportion of total treatment time with INR in
the therapeutic range, 56% vs. 32%; P , 0.001) (Table 3).
At 6 months, 21 patients (13%) in the intervention
group and 26 patients (16%) in the usual care group (P .
0.2) had died. The difference in the death rates between
the groups was 0.011 death per patient-month (95% CI,
20.01 to 0.03). Recurrent venous thromboembolism at 6
months occurred in 14 patients (8.6%) in the intervention
group and 21 patients (13%) in the usual care group (P 5
0.2). The difference in recurrence rates between the two
groups was 0.013 recurrence per patient-month (CI,
20.005 to 0.031).
DISCUSSION
We found that a comprehensive program of anticoagulant management reduced the frequency of major bleeding in older patients randomly assigned to be offered the
intervention at the start of long-term anticoagulant therapy
in the hospital. The intervention was acceptable to most
older patients to whom it was offered, did not require
extensive training, and could be implemented in a manner
similar to the use of a home glucometer. The greatest difference between the intervention and usual care groups in
the frequency of major bleeding occurred during the first
week (when anticoagulant therapy was started in the hospital) and after the first month of therapy (when outpatient
therapy was presumably stabilized). The groups differed
little during the second through fourth weeks of therapy,
when patients were generally discharged and warfarin was
first monitored in the outpatient setting.
The improvements in patient outcomes were accompanied by substantial and consistent differences between
the intervention and usual care groups in control of the
anticoagulant effect. For patients in the intervention
group, the INR was in the therapeutic range more than
half the time—nearly twice as much of the time as that in
the usual care group. In the usual care group, the INR was
supratherapeutic more than one third of the time during
the first month of outpatient therapy and was subtherapeutic most of the time thereafter.
Various approaches to the comprehensive management of long-term anticoagulant therapy have been described (6, 14, 18, 22–26), but their effects on the process
and outcomes of care have not been evaluated. Patient
education and self-management of anticoagulant therapy
can improve anticoagulant control in carefully selected

patients (42), but the effects of this approach on patient
outcomes is unknown. Other advances that may improve
management of anticoagulant therapy include use of lowerintensity therapy for venous thrombosis (43) and in the
setting of prosthetic valves (44), identification of risk factors for bleeding and risk stratification of patients (2, 6, 7,
14, 15, 18, 20, 21), use of INR as a measure of anticoagulant effect (45, 46), and portable prothrombin time monitors (42, 47-50). We previously evaluated the efficacy of
consultation on the frequency of in-hospital bleeding in
patients treated with heparin or warfarin and demonstrated
a reduction in this event from 31% to 13% (27). The

current study was designed to incorporate these recent advances in a comprehensive, multicomponent intervention
and to evaluate this intervention in a randomized, controlled trial.
Despite the low rates of warfarin-related bleeding
achieved in several randomized trials of the efficacy of warfarin (51–55), higher rates of major bleeding have been
reported in many observational studies of warfarin used in
practice outside the clinical trial setting (6, 7, 14, 15, 18,
21, 56, 57). Thus, it has been unclear whether lower rates
of bleeding could be achieved in practice. In this study, the
sample was assembled with few exclusion criteria and consisted of a heterogeneous group of older persons; the bleeding rates in the usual care group were similar to those in
previous observational studies. The comprehensive intervention achieved a frequency of major bleeding in participating patients that was similar to the lower rates achieved
in previous randomized trials of the efficacy of warfarin.
Several methodologic considerations support the validity of our major findings. The experimental study design,
random assignment of patient, and intention-to-treat analysis make it unlikely that our findings are attributable to
unrecognized confounding or selection bias. Although data
collection could not be blinded to group assignment, measurement bias was minimized by systematic surveillance of
the intervention and control groups, use of an explicit and
highly reliable method for classifying the major outcomes,
and blinding to group assignment of outcome classification. The conclusion that the intervention was beneficial is
further supported by the consistency of the intervention’s
apparent effects on bleeding, recurrent thromboembolism,
and INR control.
The study was not designed to determine the relative
importance of the components of the intervention. Thus,
we cannot determine how much of the improved INR
control and lower bleeding rate are attributable to patient
education, patient participation, or expert guidance of warfarin monitoring and dosing. Our study also did not determine why some patients declined to participate in the
intervention program; these patients, one quarter of whom
developed major anticoagulant-related bleeding, may benefit greatly from efforts to understand and reduce their
risks for bleeding. A formal cost analysis is beyond the
scope of this study. We estimate the cost of self-monitoring
for 6 months to be $1385 ($1295 for a monitor plus $90
for 6 months of supplies). Finally, we studied hospitalized
older patients starting long-term anticoagulant therapy.
The benefit of the intervention has not been demonstrated
in other patients, such as outpatients starting anticoagulant
therapy, and the intervention would probably have less
incremental benefit in settings in which usual care achieves
the high rates of INR control achieved by the intervention.
A comprehensive program of anticoagulant management should be considered in typical clinical settings; the
rate of major bleeding may be cut by half or more over 6
months, and the rate of death or recurrent thromboembolism may be reduced by one quarter. Extending such an
intervention to other settings may promote appropriately
more widespread use of warfarin to prevent stroke and
other serious thromboembolism in older patients who may
now go untreated (9–12, 58–60).
