abstract
Endometriosis-associated chronic pelvic pain (EACPP) presents with an intense inflammatory reaction.
Melatonin has emerged as an important analgesic, antioxidant, and antiinflammatory agent. This trial
investigates the effects of melatonin compared with a placebo on EACPP, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) level, and sleep quality. Forty females, aged 18 to 45 years, were randomized into the placebo
(n = 20) or melatonin (10 mg) (n = 20) treatment groups for a period of 8 weeks. There was a significant
interaction (time vs group) regarding the main outcomes of the pain scores as indexed by the visual analogue scale on daily pain, dysmenorrhea, dysuria, and dyschezia (analysis of variance, P < 0.01 for all analyses). Post hoc analysis showed that compared with placebo, the treatment reduced daily pain scores by
39.80% (95% confidence interval [CI] 12.88–43.01%) and dysmenorrhea by 38.01% (95% CI 15.96–49.15%).
Melatonin improved sleep quality, reduced the risk of using an analgesic by 80%, and reduced BNDF levels
independently of its effect on pain. This study provides additional evidence regarding the analgesic
effects of melatonin on EACPP and melatonin’s ability to improve sleep quality. Additionally, the study
revealed that melatonin modulates the secretion of BDNF and pain through distinct mechanisms.

1. Introduction
Chronic pelvic pain (CPP) is defined as a nonmalignant pain perceived in the structures related to the pelvis that is constant or
recurring over a period of 6 months [21]. A population study demonstrated a 3.8% occurrence rate [67]; however, in infertility populations, this rate can be as high as 40% [50].
Endometriosis is strongly associated with CPP. Endometriosis
lesions produce pain by compressing or infiltrating the nerves near
the lesions [54]. The presence of nerve growth factors in lesions is
correlated with hyperalgesia [54]. Nerve growth factor is also
responsible for the growth of sympathetic and sensory neurons
of ectopic endometrial growths [54]. C-fiber nociceptors these
neurons are activated by noxious events, such as inflammation;
not only do they convey information to the central nervous system
(afferent function), but they can release substance P, calcitonin
gene-related peptide, tachykinins, nitric oxide, and other factors
into the local environment (efferent functions). Once activated, C
fibers can become sensitized; efferent activity also increases the local vascular permeability and the ‘‘neurogenic inflammation’’ [55].
Although the full pathophysiology of CPP remains unknown,
cumulative evidence suggests that peripheral and central sensitization result in an amplification of sensory impulses [63]. It has
been suggested that estrogen increases brain-derived neurotrophic
factor (BDNF) during the estrous cycle [7], and BDNF has received
attention as a neuromediator of hyperalgesia and spinal central
sensitization in pain states [17,28]. In an experimental study, BDNF
enhanced the potentiation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors in
dorsal spinal horn neurons, increasing the neurons’ excitability
[25]. In another experiment, the neurotoxin mycotoxin 3-
nitropropionic acid also increased the BDNF and neuronal excitability [57]; however, melatonin reversed this effect. These results
seem mixed, as in intact cells, others have found that melatonin
increases the BDNF level [35,45]. Thus, we postulate that in chronic

pain, melatonin may reduce the activity of the neurotrophic factors, particularly BDNF, that play an important role in the pathogenesis of chronic pain.
Despite therapeutic advances, the options available for the
treatment of endometriosis have a limited impact on the course
of the disease and produce unsatisfactory results while causing
poorly tolerated adverse effects [8]. It is important to investigate
other therapeutic options, such as melatonin, which has been
shown to have a beneficial effect in experimental models of endometriosis [65]. Mounting evidence indicates that melatonin should
be tested in this setting, considering its analgesic, antioxidant
[27,32], and antiinflammatory effects. In fact, the antinociceptive
effect of melatonin has been demonstrated in animal models of
acute pain [20,39], inflammatory pain [5,6,19], and neuropathic
pain [60]. In the few studies conducted with humans, doses of 3–
10 mg of melatonin have been used [2,11,12,66].
Overall, these data prompted us to investigate whether melatonin can be used as a therapeutic agent in endometriosis. In this
context, we tested the hypothesis that melatonin would be more
effective than a placebo for the treatment of endometriosis-associated CPP (EACPP). We also tested whether melatonin would change
the levels of BDNF and whether it would be more effective than a
placebo in improving sleep quality.
2. Methods
The Methods and Results sections are reported according to the
CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) guidelines
[52].
2.1. Design overview, setting, and participants
All patients provided written informed consent before participating in this randomized, double-blind, 2-group parallel, clinical
trial, which was approved by the Research Ethics Committee at
the Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre (Institutional Review Board
IRB 0000921) in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (Resolution 196/96 of the National Health Council). We recruited 40
patients complaining of pelvic pain, who were between 18 and
45 years old, from the gynecology outpatient clinic at the Hospital
de Clínicas de Porto Alegre and by newspaper publicity. We
defined chronic pelvic pain and/or dyspareunia as a moderate-tosevere pain intensity lasting for more than 6 months [22], eliciting
pain scores on a categorical scale (0 to 10) equal to or higher than 4
and requiring regular analgesic use [46]. All patients had an endometriosis diagnosis confirmed by laparoscopic surgery in a pelvic
pain investigation by the same investigator (J.S.L.C.). The endometriosis stages included the following: stage 1 (only a few endometrial implants, mostly found in the cul-de-sac and pelvic area);
stage 2 (at least one of the ovaries had endometriosis); stage 3
(usually both ovaries, as well as the uterus, had endometriosis);
and stage 4 (endometriosis that was prominent in the abdominal
cavity and may affect many surrounding organs). Nongynecologic
causes of pelvic pain were excluded in all patients using history,
physical examination, and laboratory examinations when appropriate. We excluded patients with diagnosed malignancies, uterine
myomas, ovarian cysts, inflammatory pelvic disease, and pregnancy. Patients with a history of neurologic or oncologic disease,
ischemic heart disease, kidney or hepatic insufficiency, or a regular
intake of antidepressants or anticonvulsants that could not be discontinued at least 15 days before the start of the study were not included. Additionally, no patients were included who had a history
of alcohol or substance abuse in the past 6 months or who were
undergoing hormonal therapy or had irregular cycles. All of these
conditions could interfere with marker levels or disease symptom
measurements.
2.2. Sample size justification
The number of patients in each study group was determined by
previous clinical trials [23]. An a priori estimate indicated that a total sample size of 36 patients divided into 2 balanced treatment
groups (n = 18) was needed to detect a 1.3-cm reduction (average
SD 1.2 cm) in pain intensity associated with melatonin or placebo
at power and a levels of 0.8 and 0.01, respectively [16,53]; such a
reduction would be clinically relevant and comparable to other
pharmacological interventions. To account for multiple outcomes
and attrition, we increased the sample size to 40 patients, 20 per
group. For these calculations, we assumed that this remission
was clinically relevant.
2.3. Randomization and masking
We used a fixed block size of 4 to ensure that equal numbers of
participants were randomized into the 2 groups. Before the recruitment phase, envelopes containing the protocol materials were
prepared. Each envelope was sealed and numbered sequentially
and contained an allocated treatment. After the participant agreed
to participate in the trial, the envelope in the sequence was opened
by the nurse who administered the medications. During the entire
protocol timeline, 2 investigators who were not involved in patient
evaluations were responsible for the blinding and randomization
procedures. Other individuals who were involved in patient care
were unaware of the treatment group to which the patients
belonged.
2.4. Interventions
All patients began the treatment at the onset of the menstrual cycle. Over an 8-week period (56 days), the following oral medications
were taken at bedtime by the 2 groups: 10-mg melatonin tablets
(Sigma Chemical, Munich, Germany, provided batch-by-batch certificates of analysis authenticating the purity of each batch) or a placebo with identical characteristics. The capsules were manufactured
in such a way that the placebo and active treatment appeared to be
identical. To measure adherence to medication use, we employed
the following strategies: (1) a researcher counted the number of tablets consumed each week during the study period; (2) the patients
were asked to record a diary entry if they failed to use the medication; and (3) eligible patients were strongly encouraged to remain
on the medication throughout the 8 weeks, during which time they
were assessed weekly in a visit to the clinical center. Regardless of
their decision to continue or discontinue medication at this stage,
the patients continued to be assessed during the study period.
2.5. Supplementary analgesic use
All of the patients were permitted to use supplementary analgesic medication (acetaminophen, ibuprofen, codeine, or tramadol)
to relieve their pain if necessary. Patients were allowed to take
750 mg of acetaminophen up to 4 times per day (QID) and
200 mg of ibuprofen at maximum QID as a rescue analgesic. If their
pain persisted, patients were permitted to use 60 mg of codeine up
to QID or tramadol 3 times per day. The patients were asked to record their analgesic intake during the treatment period in their
pain diaries, and these diaries were reviewed during each treatment section. The total analgesic dose taken during treatment
was considered for the analysis.
2.6. Instruments and assessments
All of the psychological tests used in this study had been
validated for the Brazilian population [31,33]. Two independent

154 (2013) 874–881 875
medical examiners who were blind to the group assignments were
trained to administer the pain scales and to conduct the psychological tests. The baseline depressive symptoms of the patients were
assessed using the Hamilton Depression Scale [31], and sleep quality was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index [10]. Psychiatric disorders were evaluated with the Structured Clinical
Interview for DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders, 4th edition) Axis I Disorders [40], and anxiety was measured using the refined version of the Rash analysis of the StateTrait Anxiety Inventory [33]. Demographic data and medical
comorbidities were assessed using a standardized questionnaire;
patients were asked about any changes that occurred during treatment, such as changes in mood, sleepiness, dizziness, headaches, or
allergic reactions.
2.7. Outcomes
The primary outcome was pain, as assessed by the pain score
diaries (global pain in the last 24 hours, painful menstrual periods
[dysmenorrhea], or discomfort during intercourse [dyspareunia]),
the amount of analgesics used weekly throughout the treatment
period, and the level of BDNF. Secondary outcomes were discomfort during urination (dysuria) or defecation (dyschezia), and sleep
quality. The outcomes are described below.
2.7.1. Assessment of pain and sleep
(a) Pain intensity was measured by a 10-cm visual analogue
scale (VAS). The VAS scores ranged from no pain (0) to worst
possible pain (10 cm). The time of the worst pain during the
last 24 hours was recorded daily in the patients’ diaries.
They were asked to answer the following questions using
the pain VAS: (1) Considering your chronic pelvic pain in
normal period – how intense was your worst pain during
the last 24 hours?; (2) Considering the changes in pain at
the onset of menstrual bleeding – How intense was your
pain during your menstrual period?; (3) How intense was
your pain during intercourse?; (4) How intense was your
pain during defecation?; and (5) How intense was your pain
during urination? To improve patient compliance, an evaluator checked their pain records weekly. Pain scores during
menstruation were assessed for 7 days at a time.
(b) Diary entries recording analgesic intake (acetaminophen,
nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], or opioids)
were reviewed during each treatment section. The total
analgesic dose taken during treatment was considered for
analysis.
(c) Sleep quality during the study period was assessed daily by
the 10-cm visual analogue sleep quality scale (VASQS). VASQS scores ranged from worst possible (0) to best possible
(10 cm) sleep, and using the VASQS, the patients answered
the following question in their sleep diaries: (a) How well
did you sleep last night?
(d) Laboratory outcomes included serum levels of BDNF. Samples of blood were collected at 2 time points: at baseline
and at the end of treatment. The blood samples were centrifuged in plastic tubes for 10 minutes at 4500g at 4C, and
serum was stored at 80C for hormone assay. Serum BDNF
was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA) using a ChemiKine BDNF Sandwich ELISA Kit,
CYT306 (Chemicon/Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). The lower
detection limit of the kit is 7.8 pg/mL for BDNF. We analyzed
the effects of age in our model.
2.8. Statistical analysis
Figs. 1 and 3 T-tests for independent samples were used to analyze the continuous variables, and the categorical variables were

assessed by v2 or Fisher’s exact tests. We averaged the daily values
recorded in the pain and sleep diary to generate one value for each
of the 8 weeks of treatment. After first checking the assumptions of
normality for the outcome measures (VAS pain scores and VASQS
sleep quality scores) using skewness and kurtosis tests, we
conducted a group analysis by running a mixed analysis of variance
model in which the independent variables were time, experimental group (melatonin and placebo), the interaction between time
and experimental group, and the subject identification. If appropriate, we then performed Bonferroni test for post hoc multiple
comparisons to identify the differences between the groups at each
time point and used a paired t-test to assess the effects of the
variables on each experimental group. Stepwise multiple linear
regression analysis was conducted, with the VAS pain scores as
the dependent variable and the experimental group (melatonin
and placebo) and sleep quality the previous night as independent
variables.
We also calculated adjusted mean differences, which were defined as the relative changes in the melatonin group compared to
the placebo group. This measurement was used to describe the
melatonin treatment efficacy, which was calculated as the adjusted
mean difference divided by the adjusted mean placebo group and
expressed as a percentage (%). The 95% confidence intervals (CI)
and associated P-values were also calculated. We considered all
of the randomized patients as part of the analysis, using the intention-to-treat method, with the last observation carried forward.
The data were analyzed using SPSS version 18.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL).
3. Results
3.1. Patient characteristics
The clinical and demographic characteristics of the patients are
shown in Table 1. Twenty patients were allocated to the placebo
group, and 20 were allocated to the melatonin group. Thirty-six
patients completed the study; 3 patients in the melatonin group
and one in the placebo group withdrew due to treatment inefficacy. Baseline characteristics were similar across the melatonin
and placebo groups (all P values >0.05) (Table 1). We did not
observe serious or moderate side effects from the treatment.
3.2. Analysis of the main outcome: efficacy with regard to pain scores
(highest pain level during the last 24 hours and dysmenorrhea),
analgesic use, and BDNF
The melatonin group had significantly lower pain VAS scores
(P < 0.001) than the placebo-treated group (Table 2), and the interaction between time and treatment group was significant (P = 0.02)
(Fig. 2A). The melatonin group, compared to the placebo group,
demonstrated a mean pain reduction of 39.30% (Table 2). The melatonin group had significantly lower pain scores (P < 0.001) than
the placebo-treated group during menstruation (Table 2), and
again, the interaction between time and treatment group was significant (P 6 0.001) for these VAS scores (Fig. 2B).
Analgesic use during the treatment period occurred in 42.2% of
patients in the placebo group and in 22.9% of patients in the melatonin group. The relative risk for using analgesics at least 3 times
a week during the 8 weeks of treatment was 1.80 (95% CI 1.61–
2.08); that is, the placebo-treated group was 80% more likely to require additional analgesics. Of the analgesics used in the placebo
group, acetaminophen was used by 66.7% of the patients, codeine
or tramadol by 60%, and NSAIDs by 60% (the same patient may
have used more than one analgesic). In the melatonin group,

33.3% used acetaminophen, 40% used tramadol or codeine, and 35%
used NSAIDs. There was a significant reduction in the analgesic
doses for patients receiving melatonin treatment compared to
those receiving placebo (P < 0.01).
One important issue is whether the BDNF level reduction is secondary to pain improvement or whether it is a primary effect of the
intervention. To address this important issue, we conducted an
additional regression model in which we controlled BDNF-level
changes for cumulative pain scores during the treatment period.
The adjusted mean BDNF level for the placebo group was 25.64
(9.65) vs 20.46 (4.93) for the melatonin group, with a mean difference of 5.94 (95% CI 2.07–9.82); this difference was significant at
the P < 0.001 level. This model revealed that the effect of the pain
score was not statistically significant. However, the interaction
between group and pain VAS scores was significant (P < 0.001),
suggesting that the variability in the pain VAS score is dependent
on the effects of the treatment group on the main outcome (BDNF
levels). Additionally, when we performed a stratified analysis by
treatment group, the effect of pain was not statistically significant
in the melatonin group, but was significant in the placebo group
(Table 3). This result suggests that the effect of treatment on the
BDNF level is not dependent on the pain level.
3.3. Secondary outcomes: evacuation pain, dysuria, and sleep quality
There was a significant interaction between time and treatment
group (P < 0.01) for pain VAS scores during evacuation and dysuria.
The melatonin group recorded significantly lower pain scores (for
both outcomes P < 0.01) compared to the placebo group (Table 2).
There was a significant interaction between time and treatment
group (P < 0.001) for the previous night’s sleep quality VASQS
scores. Patients in the melatonin group reported a significantly better sleep quality (P < 0.001) than the placebo group (Table 2).
When compared with the placebo, melatonin produced a mean
improvement of 42% in how patients felt when they awoke
(Table 2).
4. Discussion
This study demonstrated that melatonin produced a reduction
in EACPP compared to placebo that was not only statistically significant but may also be clinically relevant. In addition, this study
showed that melatonin treatment was associated with improved
sleep quality and reduced BDNF levels. This finding suggests that
melatonin has a direct effect on pain pathways or on the levels
of signaling chemicals that regulate pain. Furthermore, the present
findings showed that the effect of melatonin on BDNF level is independent of its effect on pain.
These findings concur with the results of previous studies in animals in which melatonin caused the regression and atrophy of
endometriotic lesions [29]. However, to the best of our knowledge,
this is the first investigation that extends this literature to provide
additional evidence of the impact of melatonin on EACPP. Melatonin

was observed to have a clinically relevant effect on all parameters
used to assess pain, including a reduction in daily pain, dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, dysuria, and dyschezia (Table 2), as well an 80%
reduction in analgesic use. Overall, the magnitude of the effect on
reported pain was >35%. This result is important because a placebo
effect has been well documented in studies of pain control [59]. For
example, Koninckx et al. [36] reported a 30% reduction in pain
severity associated with placebo, even in women with deep endometriosis. Novel treatments for the symptoms of endometriosis
should therefore demonstrate superiority relative to placebo to verify their efficacy.
Additionally, the present study corroborates evidence from
previous randomized clinical trials in which melatonin performed
substantially better than a placebo in treating fibromyalgia [3,14]
and acute postoperative pain [30,31]. This finding has biological
plausibility because the antinociceptive effect of melatonin is
known to involve the activation of supraspinal sites and the inhibition of ‘‘spinal windup’’ [44]. In addition, experimental evidence
suggests that the analgesic effects of melatonin are mediated by
opioids [38] and by gamma-aminobutyric acid ([GABA]ergic) systems [64]. Moreover, melatonin produces marked antiinflammatory effects on peripheral sites by inhibiting the release of
proinflammatory cytokines [15]. Additionally, its effect on EACPP
may be explained by diverse mechanisms, including hormonal
pathways, because it is known that endometriosis is an estrogen-dependent chronic inflammatory gynecological disease. Thus,
melatonin may, at least in part, decrease the luteinizing hormone
surge, thereby blocking ovulation and progression into the luteal
phase, and increase progesterone without affecting follicle-stimulating hormone or estrogen levels [41]. Melatonin also inhibits
steroidogenesis by altering cyclic adenosine monophosphate levels through direct action on the theca or granulosa cells of the follicles [9,56]. Additionally, the treatment of rats with melatonin
resulted in reduced plasma levels of luteinizing hormone and 17
beta-estradiol and promoted differential regulation of the estrogen, progesterone, and androgen receptors in the reproductive
tissues [13].
A previous study found that estradiol-dependent estrogen
receptor (ER) activation was prevented in cells by treatment with
melatonin. Neither the nuclear localization of the ER nor the binding of estradiol to the ER is affected by melatonin [49]. Thus, it is
possible that the effect of estrogen may occur through 2 distinct
ER subtypes, ERa and ERb, which are widely distributed in the central nervous system, in astrocytes and in interneurons. Astrocytes
enhance the synthesis of astroglial-derived neurotrophic factors
and inflammatory mediators, such as cytokines and cycloxygenase-2, which, at least in part, maintain the maladaptive plasticity
implicated in EACPP. The inflammatory response involves the
hormonal and neuronal mechanisms by which the brain regulates
the function of the immune system and cytokines, allowing the immune system to regulate the brain. Although it has been reported
that BDNF is involved in inflammatory reactions [34,58] and that
its production is increased in response to proinflammatory cytokines, our findings support the notion that BDNF levels may constitute a neurobiological mechanism underlying EACPP. This
hypothesis is supported by our finding that the BDNF level was
linked with the pain level in the placebo group but not in the
melatonin group [37,42]. Thus, the melatonin-induced reduction
in this neurotrophin may be explained by other mechanisms; for
example, an antiinflammatory mechanism, or perhaps, an interaction with gonadal hormones could be involved.
The effect of melatonin on the BDNF level can be explained by
estrogen levels, which regulate the increase in BDNF mRNA in
areas associated with nociceptive sensory processing, such as the
hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and spinal cord [4]. The relationship
between BDNF level and pain may indirectly confirm the role of the
regulatory effect of estrogen on the sensitization of the central nervous system centers associated with nociceptive sensory processing. Furthermore, estrogen regulates opioid receptor density in
several pain-related areas (periaqueductal gray, parabrachial nucleus); the density of opioid receptors is significantly lower in
female rats during proestrus (higher plasma estrogen) compared
with the diestrus and metestrus phases [18].
Because BDNF levels can serve as a molecular ‘‘sensor’’ of the
global levels of neuronal activity, it has been suggested that the
induction of BDNF expression in response to increases in the level
of neuronal activity may dampen cortical excitability by promoting
the development and/or strengthening of inhibitory synapses in local circuits [26,51]. Overall, these findings show that the melatonin
effect may interrupt a response associated with a maladaptive neuroplasticity process orchestrated by neuronal, endocrinal, and immune mechanisms that can amplify sensory pain signals to the
neural pain matrix [24]. Macrophage-derived productions, such
as the production of tumor necrosis factor, interleukin (IL)-1b,
and IL-12, integrate this cascade of responses [1].
Another possible explanation for our findings is the involvement of melatonin in regulating circadian rhythms, which would
make melatonin a potentially valuable means for targeting the
pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying EACPP. Although melatonin is approved as a sleep aid, it also has a variety of other
beneficial effects that may account for its potential role in the
treatment of EACPP. Obviously, pain relief is a major goal, but
the additional treatment of restless sleep and sleep disturbances
may lead to a further decrease in pain [30]. However, in recent randomized clinical trials, we demonstrated that melatonin’s effect on
pain is independent of improvements in sleep quality [62]. It had
been demonstrated that the antinociceptive effects of melatonin
involve effects [38] on the gamma-aminobutyric acid and opioid
systems [64]. Moreover, melatonin produces marked antiinflammatory effects on peripheral sites by inhibiting the release of
proinflammatory cytokines [43].
The strengths of the study include the comparison of an active
treatment vs a placebo in a double-blind design, and the use of
multiple efficacy and safety measures based on previous trial

experience. Despite the knowledge of a substantial placebo effect,
there remains a scarcity of placebo-controlled studies of medications for the treatment of endometriosis pain [47,48]. This study
therefore represents an important contribution to evidence-based
prescribing. We conducted this trial according to CONSORT guidelines, and given that we used the Delphi List (a list of criteria for the
quality assessment of randomized controlled trials), our trial can
be considered to be of strong quality because all 8 items in this
scale can be positively scored in our randomized controlled trial
[61]. Although the homogeneity of this study population is methodologically advantageous, the issue of external validity arises.
Thus, additional research with a larger number of patients is
needed to more widely assess the potential benefits of melatonin
in various clinical settings, and future studies are required before
definitive conclusions regarding melatonin and pain treatment
can be made. Several issues concerning the design of our study
must be addressed. First, a potential limitation is the short treatment duration, as it would have been difficult to justify a prolonged placebo treatment period in patients experiencing chronic
pain. Second, the influence of pelvic floor musculature in pelvic
pain that is usually assessed by digital palpation during pelvic
examinations was not directly measured. Instead, it was assessed
indirectly using pain scores associated with various events (ie, pain
during urination, sexual intercourse, and defecation). Third, we did
not assess changes in menses, which could have been altered due
to melatonin effect on ovarian steroidogenesis. Finally, although
several strategies were used to prevent patients and evaluator
team from unblinding, formal assessment for awareness of the
allocation (either active or placebo) was not performed. However,
our objective surrogates less prone to bias (ie, serum BDNF, analgesics requirements) were consistent with pain scores, hence, unblinding is unlikely to have influenced the direction of our conclusions.
In conclusion, in this 8-week, randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled study, the oral consumption of 10 mg/day of
melatonin was associated with significant improvements in EACPP
and other efficacy measures. Melatonin reduced pain scores, lowered analgesic use, and improved sleep quality. Our results also
suggested that melatonin modulates the secretion of BDNF by a
mechanism that is distinct from the one underlying its analgesic
effect. Overall, melatonin may represent an effective and well-tolerated treatment for the painful symptoms of endometriosis.
