- ABSTRACT:
Primary dysmenorrhea is common among young women and results
in their incapacitation; it can be accompanied by various symptoms
that can disrupt their lives. The aim of this randomized trial was to
compare the effect of ginger, zinc sulfate, and placebo on the severity
of primary dysmenorrhea in young women. One hundred and fifty
high school students were recruited. The participants were divided
into three groups. The first group received ginger capsules, the second
group received zinc sulfate capsules, and the third group received
placebo capsules. All participants took the medications for four days,
from the day before the commencement of menstruation to the third
day of their menstrual bleeding. The severity of dysmenorrhea was
assessed every 24 hours by the pain visual analog scale. The severity of
pain was significantly different between, before, and after the intervention in both the ginger and the zinc sulfate groups (p < .001).
Compared with the placebo receiving group, participants receiving
ginger and zinc sulfate reported more alleviation of pain during the
intervention (p < .05). Ginger and zinc sulfate had similar positive
effects on the improvement of primary dysmenorrheal pain in young
women.

INTRODUCTION
Primary dysmenorrhea is a condition in which there is pain during menstruation
with no detectable organic disease or other medical condition. It has been
reported to be a common health problem in young women, with a prevalence
Pain Management Nursing, Vol -, No - (--), 2013: pp 1-8
Original Article
of 30% to 90% (Eryilmaz, Ozdemir, & Pasinlioglu, 2010;
Jang, Kim, Lee, Jeong, & Chung, 2013; Kim, Park, Lee,
& Chung, 2011). It has been reported to be severe in
10% of young women, resulting in their
incapacitation for the first 3-4 days of their menstrual
cycle. Menstrual pain may be accompanied by
various symptoms that can disrupt the life of women
at school, work, and home, and interfere with their
social interactions, resulting in isolation (Ortiz,
Rangel-Flores, Carrillo-Alarcon, & Veras-Godoy, 2009  ).
One of the most likely factors causing primary
dysmenorrhea has been reported to be an increase in
the production of uterine prostaglandins (Rosenwaks
& Seegar-Jones, 1980). Research has shown that the
inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis can ameliorate
the severity of menstrual pain in women. Thus, current
treatments for women suffering from primary dysmenorrhea are nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(NSAIDs), hormonal contraceptive, antipyretic medication, and analgesic medication (Daniels, Torri, &
Desjardins, 2005). However, these medications have
been reported to have a failure rate of 20% to 25%
(Daniels et al., 2005; Edwards, Moore, & Mcquay,
2004; Zhu, Proctor, Bensoussan, Smith, & Wu, 2007),
as well as to be associated with various unwanted
outcomes, such as diarrhea, stomachache, and
nausea (Harel, 2012).
Considering the contraindications of chemical
medications and their unwanted side effects, there
has been an increase in the use of alternative treatments among women (Abdali, Khajehei, &
Tabatabaee, 2010; Abdul-Razzak, Ayoub, Abu-Taleb, &
Obeidat, 2010; Kotani et al., 1997).
Because ‘‘herbs and spices are generally considered safe and proved to be effective against various human ailments’’ (Ajith, Hema, & Aswathy, 2007, p 2268),
many health problems have been treated by plant extracts, which have attracted attention in different fields
of medical science in the past decade (Penna et al.,
2003).
Ginger is one of the herbal supplements that has
been used for medical purposes since antiquity and is
known as a popular herbal medication to treat painful
diseases (Kizhakkayil & Sasikumar, 2011). In particular,
it is an important herb in traditional Chinese and AsianIndian medicine (Yip & Tam, 2008). A study by
Gardiner, Whelan, White, Filippelli, Bharmal and
Kaptchuk (2013) has shown that ethnic background
of people may affect the use of herbal supplements,
as the prevalence of herb use is reported to be higher
among Asians (30%) and Hispanics (30%) than African
Americans (17 %).
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the
United States has classified ginger as a ‘‘generally
recognized as safe’’ herb (Srivastava & Mustafa,
1992). Also, research has reported that there are
anti-inflammatory effects of ginger in rodents
(Vendruscolo et al., 2006). In addition, a recent study
by Rahnama, Montazeri, Huseini, Kianbakht, and
Naseri (2012) has shown the efficacy of ginger in
decreasing the intensity and duration of primary dysmenorrheal pain.
The anti-inflammatory effect of ginger has been reported to result from its efficacy in the inhibition of cyclooxygenase and 5-lipoxygenase, followed by the
reduction of leukotriene and prostaglandin synthesis
(van Breemen, Tao, & Li, 2011). However, its effect
on inflammation and pain in humans still needs more
in-depth investigation.
Other dietary supplements that are generally used
to promote health and well-being are minerals
(Khajehei, Abdali, Parsanezhad, & Tabatabaee, 2009;
Khajehei, Abdali, & Tabatabaee, 2010). A recent
research (Bailey, Gahche, Miller, Thomas, & Dwyer,
2013) has reported that the main motivations that
U.S. adults use supplements are to improve (45%)
and maintain (33%) overall health. The most frequently used type of supplement was reported to be
multivitamin-mineral products.
Zinc is a mineral that has been reported to have
anti-inflammatory effects and is a strong antioxidant
(Lang et al., 2007; Prasad, 2008). Research has shown
that zinc deficiency may cause pain in patients, with
burning mouth syndrome, and that administration of
zinc replacement therapy can decrease the mean
numerical pain scale in these patients (Cho et al.,
2010).
It has been suggested that zinc can prevent menstrual cramps and alleviate dysmenorrhea. The exact
mechanism of action of zinc in menstrual pain relief
is still unknown. However, it has been suggested that
zinc may have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects on the uterus, as it reduces the production of
prostaglandins resulting in the amelioration of menstrual pain. Also, research has suggested that zinc
may help improve the micro-vessel circulation, resulting in less uterine cramp and pain during menstrual
days (Eby, 2007).
Menstrual pain imposes disabling effects on
young women and can decrease their quality of life;
thus, it is important to explore the most appropriate
methods of treatment of this problem to promote
quality of life. Because the common chemical medications used to treat this problem have moderate to severe side effects, an investigation of alternative
treatments with high efficacy and minimal unwanted
effects is warranted. The present clinical trial was
conducted to address the issue. The purpose of this
2 Kashefi et al.
study was to compare the effect of ginger, zinc sulfate,
and placebo on the severity of primary dysmenorrhea
in young women.
METHODS
Trial Design and Setting
The Ethics Committee of North Khorasan University of
Medical Science approved the protocol before its
commencement. The study was conducted at three
high schools in Bojnurd, Iran from September 2011
to September 2012. The high schools were selected using cluster sampling as follows. All high schools in Bojnurd were divided into different clusters. Then,
through simple random sampling, three high schools
(3 clusters) were selected. All the students from year
9 to year 12 were invited to participate in the preliminary evaluation of dysmenorrhea. The high schools
were similar to other Iranian public high schools
with all female students, and the religion was Muslim.
The population of students in the schools ranged from
640 to 780, which was similar to other public high
schools.
Research Questions and Hypothesis
The specific research questions were as follows: (1)
What is the prevalence of primary dysmenorrhea
among young women? (2) Does ginger decrease the
severity of primary dysmenorrhea in young women?
(3) Does zinc sulfate decrease the severity of primary
dysmenorrhea in young women? (4) Does placebo
decrease the severity of primary dysmenorrhea in
young women? (5) Which intervention is more effective in alleviating the severity of primary dysmenorrhea? and (6) What are the side effects of each
intervention?
In the current study, we tested the hypothesis that
both ginger and zinc sulfate can ameliorate the severity
of primary dysmenorrhea.
Participants
Female high school students experiencing primary
dysmenorrhea were recruited in this study. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) being 15-18 years of
age; (2) having regular menstrual cycles; (3) experiencing dysmenorrhea during the first three days of
menstrual bleeding; and (4) obtaining a score higher
than four on the pain visual analog scale.
Participants were excluded from the study if they
met the following exclusion criteria: (1) secondary
dysmenorrhea due to an underlying disease or disorder
and (2) using hormonal medications, birth control
pills, or pain relief medications.
Tools
By using information from the literature, a questionnaire was designed to specifically collect data on the
following: participant’s age, religion, familial history
of dysmenorrhea, age at which they had their first menstrual bleeding (menarche age), the pattern of menstrual bleeding (duration of menstrual bleeding days
and interval of menstrual cycles), and the experience
of menstrual pain. The designed questionnaire was reviewed for face and content validity by the researchers
who had expertise in the field.
The severity of the dysmenorrhea was investigated by using the pain visual analog scale (PVAS).
The PVAS is a valid measure that has been used in
many studies to evaluate menstrual pain (Kashefi
et al., 2010; Wong, Lai, & Tse, 2010). Its reliability
varies from 0.76 to 0.97, as reported in different
studies (Bijur, Silver, & Gallagher, 2001; Boonstra,
Preuper, Reneman, Posthumus, & Stewart, 2008;
Phan et al., 2012). It contains a 10-cm horizontal
scale. The individual score on pain varies from 0 to
10, according to the severity of the pain. The score
0 represents no pain, and the score 10 indicates the
worst possible pain.
Preparation of Ginger, Zinc Sulfate, and Placebo
The medications were prepared in the Department of
Industrial Pharmacy by the Faculty of Pharmacy.
Ginger was purchased from a pharmacy and was
powdered mechanically under aseptic condition.
Then, the relative capsules were filled with 250 mg
ginger powder. The second group of capsules was
filled with 220 mg zinc sulfate, and the placebo capsules were filled with lactose.
The capsules were identical in shape, package,
and color, and were coded by the pharmacologist.
Neither the researcher nor the participants were
informed of the type of ingredient in each capsule.
Intervention Protocol
In this study, an information flyer was distributed
among all female students in the selected high schools.
Individuals who were interested in participating in the
study contacted the researcher and were then given
the questionnaire and the PVAS to record the pattern
of their menstrual bleeding and pain, as well as the
severity of menstrual pain during two consecutive
menstrual cycles. After two cycles, the data were
collected and participants were evaluated against inclusion and exclusion criteria. Individuals who met
the inclusion criteria and showed symptoms of primary dysmenorrhea were considered to receive the
intervention. Individuals with symptoms of secondary

dysmenorrhea were referred to a specialist for further
investigation and treatment.
The informed consent form was signed by each
eligible participant and her parents before the intervention. Then, 150 participants were randomly assigned to three study groups by using the random
table. The first group (n ¼ 48) received capsules containing zinc sulfate, the second group (n ¼ 56)
received capsules containing ginger, and the third
group (n ¼ 46) received placebo capsules. The participants were instructed to take the capsules three times
a day for four days, starting from the day before menstrual bleeding to the third day of menstrual bleeding.
The participants also were given the PVAS and were
asked to complete it every 24 hours during the intervention days for two consecutive cycles. The
completed PVAS was collected after each intervention
cycle.
Analysis
The SPSS version 18.0 was used to analyze the data.
Analysis of covariance was performed for comparison
of means for severity of pain in the three groups,
with baseline scores as the covariates. The c2 test
was used to compare categorical variables, and an independent t test was used to compare the means
related to the severity of pain between the three
groups. A p value less than .05 was considered as
significant.
RESULTS
A total of 150 participants received intervention. Thirteen participants failed to complete the study. Thus,
data from 137 participants were analyzed based on
the actual treatment received and the available follow
up (Fig. 1).
The mean age of participants was 17  43 (range,
14-18 years), and two thirds (72.9%) of the participants
had a family history of dysmenorrhea. More than half of
the participants (64%) stated that dysmenorrhea
started at age 13.
Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of the
study groups, including the age at menarche, age at
the first dysmenorrhea, duration of menstrual
bleeding, and the interval of menstrual cycles. As
shown in Table 1, no significant difference was found
among the three groups regarding their baseline characteristics (p > .05).
The severity of dysmenorrhea was not significantly different among the three groups before the
intervention (p ¼ .25) (Table 2). The decrease of
pain during the first month of intervention was more
remarkable in participants receiving ginger and zinc
sulfate compared with that of participants in the
placebo-receiving group (p < .001). The reduction of
pain during the second month of intervention was
more salient in participants receiving ginger and zinc
sulfate than in placebo-receiving ones (p < .001)
(Table 2).
Diarrhea, headache, and heartburn were adverse
effects of the medicines that were reported by six participants during the first month of the intervention and
by nine participants during the second month of the
intervention. No significant difference was found
among the groups regarding the adverse effects of
the medications (p > .05) (Table 3).
DISCUSSION
Dysmenorrhea has been shown to be one of the most
common gynecological complaints of young women
and may result in short-term absence from school or
work (Parker, Sneddon, & Arbon, 2010). Research
has shown that menstrual pain in young women is usually primary and is accompanied by normal ovulatory
cycles with no pathological background (Harel,
2012). Although some individuals may prefer to treat
their menstrual pain with chemical medications
(Parker et al., 2010), others may prefer to use alternative therapies such as herbal supplements (Wong &
Khoo, 2010). Recent research by Gray and Rutledge
(2013) has shown that herbal supplements are
perceived to be safer than prescription medications,
and this is why individuals prefer to use them.
Similar to other herbs, ginger has a very complex
nature. Research has shown that ginger contains
various useful substances, such as carbohydrates, free
fatty acids, amino acid, proteins, and gingerols
(Vinick, 2009). These substances have been shown
to have several positive effects, such as antiinflammatory, antioxidant, and antiemetic effects.
Indeed, it has been reported that ginger is a pain killer
that may be as effective as mefenamic acid and
ibuprofen (Ozgoli, Goli, & Moattar, 2009).
To the authors’ knowledge, the present study was
the first placebo-controlled randomized trial in which
the effect of ginger and zinc sulfate on menstrual
pain was assessed. The results showed that ginger
and zinc sulfate had similar therapeutic effects on the
reduction of menstrual pain. In the case of ginger,
the results of the study were in accordance with those
of prior studies that indicate that pain is reduced after
ginger is consumed. For instance, Altman and
Marcussen (2001) reported that ginger extract had positive impacts on the reduction of pain in patients
suffering osteoarthritis. Further, Haghigi, Khalvat,
Toliat, and Jallaei (2005) reported that ginger extract
4 Kashefi et al.
and ibuprofen had identical efficacy in the amelioration of pain in patients suffering osteoarthritis. This
finding has been supported by reports of a recent study
by Drozdov, Kim, Tkachenko, and Varvanina (2012),
which showed that ginger and diclofenac had similar
positive effects on the alleviation of gastropathy
symptoms—including pain and dyspepsia—in patients
suffering osteoarthritis, which was maintained for
up to six months. Nevertheless, ginger was reported
to be a safer treatment because of its low level of
side effects. Drozdov, Kim, Tkachenko, and Varvanina
(2012), however, reported that the exact mechanism
of action of ginger in pain reduction is not fully
understood.

Effect of Ginger and Zinc Sulfate on Primary Dysmenorrhea 5
Results of the present study showed that zinc sulfate is an effective analgesic, which supports reports
of previous studies. Kelly and Able (1983) reported
that the metabolism of prostaglandins may be inhibited by zinc. Santos et al. (2004) reported that individuals who used zinc in combination with diclofenac
demonstrated better response to inflammation treatment compared with those who received only diclofenac. The findings of our study also supported the
results of an earlier study by Nozaki et al. (2011) highlighting the role of zinc sulfate in the alleviation of
pain.
Our study showed that the alleviation of menstrual pain was more remarkable during the second
month of the intervention. This finding suggests that
if the medications had been used for a longer period
of time (4-6 menstrual cycles), there might have been
more reduction in the menstrual pain. One possible
reason may be the gradual release of the antiprostaglandin and anti-inflammatory elements during
using zinc (Eby, 2007) as well as the cumulative effect
of zinc and ginger (Christian et al., 2011; Salmon,
Bailey-Shaw, Hibbert, Green, Smith, & Williams., 2012).
Research Limitation
As with other clinical trials, the present study had some
limitations. Firstly, because pain tolerance is different
from person to person, the participants may have
had different levels of response to the pain reduction
effects of zinc sulfate and ginger. However, we hope
that randomization minimized this impact. Secondly,
although those who had recent stressful events were
excluded before the commencement of the intervention, we were not able to control for whether any of
the participants had been affected by any stressful
event during the intervention.
Implications for Nursing
Primary dysmenorrhea is a common health problem of
young women. Not only public health, but occupational health and family practice, are negatively
affected by this problem. It also influences the individual’s quality of life, as well as the national economy, by
increasing the recurrent short-term work absenteeism
(Marchini, Tozzi, Bakshi, Pistai, & Fedele, 1995; Proctor
& Farquhar, 2006). Considering the importance of the
issue, the menstrual pain of young women should be
handled with special care.
In view of the high prevalence of primary dysmenorrhea, it is important to provide effective and timely
treatment to young women experiencing this problem.
Nurses and health care practitioners who are in close
contact with young women should not consider chemical medications as the first option when dealing with
primary dysmenorrhea. They need to acknowledge
that ginger and zinc sulfate are inexpensive and safe
medical treatments that are easily accessible and can
be regarded as first-line therapy.

Not only can practitioner nurses inform women
about the use of alternative supplements, they also
can provide assistance to young women in the exploration of the available therapeutic options for primary
dysmenorrhea. Women need to know that moderate
changes in their life style can significantly decrease
the level of pain. These changes include but are not
limited to stopping smoking or avoiding being a passive smoker, avoiding alcohol, applying heat on the
lower abdomen, exercising regularly, and managing
stress (Durain, 2004; Lefebvre et al., 2005).
According to the results of the present study, the
herb ginger and the mineral zinc sulfate have similar
positive effects on the alleviation of primary dysmenorrhea in otherwise healthy adolescent females and are
reported to have low adverse events. Our study supports the need for future studies in this context.
Further studies in different populations may be needed
to compare the efficacy of ginger and zinc sulfate with
various chemical treatments of primary dysmenorrhea.
