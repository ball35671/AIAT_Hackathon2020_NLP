Abstract
Background: Primary dysmenorrhea is a prevalent disorder and its unfavorable effects deteriorates the quality of life in many people across the world. Based on some
evidence on the characteristics of fenugreek as a medical plant with anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties, this double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled trial
was conducted. The main purpose of the study was to evaluate the effects of fenugreek seeds on the severity of primary dysmenorrhea among students.
Methods: Unmarried Students were randomly assigned to two groups who received
fenugreek (n=51) or placebo (n=50). For the first 3 days of menstruation, 2−3 capsules containing fenugreek seed powder (900 mg) were given to the subjects three
times daily for two consecutive menstrual cycles. Pain severity was evaluated using
a visual analog scale and systemic symptoms were assessed using a multidimensional verbal scale.
Results: Pain severity at baseline did not differ significantly between the two
groups. Pain severity was significantly reduced in both groups after the intervention;
however, the fenugreek group experienced significantly larger pain reduction
(p<0.001). With respect to the duration of pain, there was no meaningful difference
between the two cycles in the placebo group (p=0.07) but in the fenugreek group, the
duration of pain decreased between the two cycles (p<0.001). Systemic symptoms of
dysmenorrhea (fatigue, headache, nausea, vomiting, lack of energy, syncope) decreased in the fenugreek seed group (p<0.05). No side effects were reported in the
fenugreek group.
Conclusion: These data suggest that prescription of fenugreek seed powder during
menstruation can reduce the severity of dysmenorrhea.

Introduction
ysmenorrhea, a Greek term, refers to painful
uterine contractions during menstruation (1).
It is associated with spasmodic pain in the
abdomen during menstrual bleeding (2). Primary
dysmenorrhea is the main cause of work absenteeism, decreased quality of life, and reduced ability
to carry out daily activities (3, 4). In primary dysmenorrhea, the pain is not accompanied by a pelvic disorder. In addition, it is more common in
younger women but may last until the fifth decade

of life (5). Dysmenorrhea results from uterine
contractions associated with ischemia (6). Increased concentrations of prostaglandins, vasopressin, leukotrienes, and emotional factors may
also result in dysmenorrhea (7).
The prevalence of primary dysmenorrhea has
been reported to range from 42 to 95% in different
countries (8–11). Various non-invasive nutritional
and psychological interventions have been suggested as treatments. These include psychotherapy, yoga, hypnotherapy, massage, transcutaneous
electrical nerve stimulation, vitamins and nutritional supplements. Prescribed medications include inhibitors of prostaglandin synthesis and
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
for the relief of pain as well as oral contraceptives.
Non-pharmaceutical treatments include acupuncture and surgery. Several of these treatments may
have adverse effects or may be contraindicated in
certain groups of women (5, 12).
Due to the lack of side effects compared with
synthetic drugs, approximately 60% of the world's
population is dependent almost entirely on plants
for medication. Natural products have been known
to be effective therapies (13). The use of herbal
medicines has been common hundred years before
pharmaceutical companies began to work, and
furthermore, many drugs have a herbal basis. The
consumption of herbal supplements has been increased in the developed countries, especially the
USA, at different age groups for various reasons
(14, 15).
Traditional medicines like brewed herbs have
been used to treat dysmenorrhea across the world
(16). Many women believe that dysmenorrhea is a
normal cycle of menstruation and does not need
pharmacological treatment (14). Naturally occurring agents used to treat dysmenorrhea include
herbal brews (eg., mint, chamomile, and oregano)
the roots of plants (eg., carrots and turnips) and
the petals of plants (marigold, hyacinth, and fenugreek) (12, 17). In a study, 78% of the participants
used the fenugreek, mint, and green tea among
which fenugreek had been used more than the
others (14).
Fenugreek [Trigonella foenum-graecum (Leguminosae)] is the most frequently used herbal
galactagogue and is a member of the pea family
(18). In Iran, fenugreek has been registered under
the name "Shanbalile" (/Šambalile/) (19). Fenugreek is an annual herb with medicinal properties
and has been known as the oldest herbal medicine
in Egypt and Greece (20). Today, new information has been achieved on the benefits and
pharmacological effects of fenugreek on human
wellbeing (21, 22). Fenugreek plant is native to
the West Asia and Iran (23). The Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) in the USA lists it as being
a generally recognized as safe (GRAS) plant. It
has been utilized around the world for centuries
(18). Fenugreek is added to ordinary foods of Indians, Egyptians, and Yemenis (13).
Fenugreek seeds are used as spices in food preparations to improve or impart flavor and are good
sources of protein, fat, minerals, and dietary fiber
(24). The use of fenugreek dates back to the ancient Egypt when it was used to facilitate childbirth and increase mother's milk. Egyptian women
still consume fenugreek for decreasing dysmenorrhea. Fenugreek was also used as a poultice to
treat gout, inflamed glands, tumors, scars, wounds,
and various skin inflammations (25, 26). The ripe
and young fenugreek seeds are full of carbohydrates and sugar, galactomannan, amino acid, fatty acid, vitamins, folic acid and saponins (22).
The main chemical constituents of fenugreek are
proteins rich in lysine and tryptophan, flavonoids
(eg., quercetin, trigonelline, saponins, and phytic
acid), and polyphenols (24, 27).
The well-documented therapeutic uses of fenugreek are its activity against hypoglycemia and
hypolipidemia (28−30). It also protects the gastrointestinal (31) and cardiovascular systems (32).
Fenugreek seeds are also used in traditional medicine to relieve common cold, arthritic pain, and
hyperglycemia. The extracts and isolates of fenugreek seeds have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities (33). The anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects of fenugreek have been demonstrated in experimental models (34−37). A study
proved the role of the serotonergic system in the
analgesic effect of the fenugreek extract on mice
and introduced the probability for the existence of
other analgesic mechanisms. It also mentioned the
superficial similarities between fenugreek extract
and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and the
presence of their analgesic, anti-fever, and antiinflammatory effects in combination (34).
Phytoestrogens are herbal compounds with estrogenic activity; fenugreek contains phytoestrogen compounds (38). The present study was conducted to evaluate the effects of oral administration of fenugreek on the severity of primary dysmenorrhea among students. The article also con-

field of traditional medicine and abundance of
some plants that have been mentioned as herbs
with analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects
among Iranian traditional medicines.
Methods
This was a double-blind, randomized, placebo
controlled trial investigation. It involved unmarried students living in a dormitory at Shahid
Beheshti University (Tehran, Iran) from October
2010 to April 2011 who experienced moderate-tosevere dysmenorrhea. The study protocol was approved by the Research and Ethics Committee of
the Faculty of Nursing and Midwifery, Shahid
Beheshti University of Medical Sciences and is
registered in the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials
(Number 201106196807N2). Students were informed about the purpose and methods of the
study and provided with written consent forms for
participation.
It was estimated that a sample size of 100 participants was required to reach statistical significance at the 95% confidence interval. Computergenerated random numbers were used to divide
participants into two groups for receiving fenugreek or placebo. Participants and researchers
were kept blinded to treatment allocation.
The variables related to dysmenorrhea and systemic symptoms including age, age of menarche,
age of dysmenorrhea and BMI were matched between the two groups. Other variables, such as
underlying diseases (Diabete, Chronic hypertention, Infectious diseases) which might affect fenugreek consumption or the inhibition of its use in
such people were controlled by excluding those
samples from the study. Students who had irregular menstrual cycles, endometriosis, history of
medication usage, experienced acute stress, and/or
had vaginal symptoms (burning, irritation, itching,
or discharge) were excluded from the study. It
was supposed that people who were allergic to
fenugreek or other plants or had used herbal drugs
during the previous 3 months should have been
excluded, though such cases were not found.
Samples who showed allergy to the fenugreek
when consuming it, did not use the capsule
properly, used any other herbal drug during the
intervention, stopped taking the capsule, and used
4 capsules or less daily were excluded from the
study.
Fenugreek seeds (from one geographical region)
were purchased from Zardband Pharmaceuticals
(Tehran, Iran). After identification and verification of the samples of fenugreek seeds in the Botanical Laboratory at the Faculty of Traditional
Medicine at Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, samples were ground down. The
seed powder was placed into capsules (900 mg)
using an automated machine. The placebo capsules contained potato starch. The capsules were
similar with respect to shape, color, and packaging. Fenugreek and placebo capsules were taken
three times a day [For the first 3 days of menstruation, 2−3 capsules containing fenugreek seed
powder (900 mg) were given three times daily].
The intervention continued for two consecutive
menstrual cycles. Participants were allowed to use
NSAIDs such as ibuprofen and mefenamic acid, if
required. However, they were asked to take these
medications ≥1 hr after taking the study capsule
and to record pain severity before consumption of
the sedative.
Before the intervention and during each treatment cycle, content and test–retest methods were
used to assess the validity and reliability (r =0.89)
of the questionnaire, respectively. The following
demographic data were collected: age, body mass
index (BMI), educational level, occupation of the
parents, exercise program, and stressful factors in
the past 6 months. A self-reported checklist was
used to collect information on the number of sedative drugs taken for dysmenorrhea, pain severity,
and the systemic symptoms associated with menstruation.
During the first three days of menstruation, the
pain severity of each sample was measured three
times a day on a 10 cm visual analog scale (VAS)
at the time the sample felt the most pain during
the hours of 8−13, 13−18, 18−24 o'clock (every
8 hr a day) and was classified as "mild" (score of
1–2), "moderate" (3–7), or "severe" (8–10) (39).
A multidimensional verbal scoring system from
0 to 3 was used to assess the severity of associated
systemic symptoms (fatigue, diarrhea, syncope,
nausea, vomiting, lack of energy, headache, and
mood swings) (40).
The validity of VAS, which was used to measure
the pain has been determined in many studies.
This scale has a wide range of applications in
studies and is considered as one of the most useful
and reliable pain measures (41, 42). The questionnaire related to the multidimensional verbal scoring system is valid and has been used in numerous

studies (40, 41, 43, 44). The imprint codes for the
capsules were recorded on a separate sheet.
Statistical analyses: SPSS ver16 (SPSS, Chicago,
IL, USA) was used for the statistical analyses.
Descriptive data are presented as frequencies,
mean values and standard deviations and t-test
was used to compare age, age of menarche and
other variables between the two groups. The
Friedman test was used to compare pain severity
between the three menstrual cycles. The Mann–
Whitney U test was used to compare the findings
between the two groups. If the results of the
Friedman test were significant, the therapeutic
cycles were compared in pairs via the Wilcoxon
signed-rank test and modification of the α level.
P<0.05 was considered significant.
Results
Among 400 unmarried female dormitory residents, 221 reported primary dysmenorrhea. After
exclusions, 106 individuals were enrolled in the
study. The final analysis involved 101 students,
51 of whom received fenugreek and 50 received
placebo. There were no significant differences
between the groups with respect to age, age at
menarche, onset of dysmenorrhea and BMI (Table
1).
Pain severity at baseline did not differ significantly between the groups. In the fenugreek
group, pain severity decreased from 6.4 at baseline to 3.25 in the second cycle, whereas that in
the placebo group decreased from 6.14 to 5.96
(Table 2). Pain severity in each intervention cycle
differed significantly between the two groups,
with pain reduction in each cycle being significantly larger in the fenugreek group (Table 3).
The duration of pain in intervention cycles was
shorter in the fenugreek group (p=0.01). With respect to the duration of pain, there were no meaningful differences between the two cycles in the
placebo group (p<0.07) but, in the fenugreek
group, the duration of pain decreased between the
two cycles (p<0.001). The mean number of sedative tablets required in the fenugreek group decreased significantly (Figure 1) (p<0.001). Furthermore, in the fenugreek group, the severity of
the systemic symptoms associated with dysmenorrhea decreased significantly as well (p<0.001)
(Table 4).

Discussion
Women with dysmenorrhea suffer from increased uterine contractions (6). It has been shown
that fenugreek has therapeutic effects against diabetes, infertility, and fungal infections, and that it
has analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic
properties as well (45). The present study was the
first to investigate the use of fenugreek in the
treatment of dysmenorrhea. Studies have shown
that fenugreek seed has been used for controlling
dysmenorrhea and mastalgia (14, 16, 25, 26). In
USA, fenugreek has been used for the treatment
of post-menopausal vaginal dryness and dysmenorrhea since the nineteenth century (46). The antispasmodic effect of fenugreek on gastrointestinal
system has been recognized and this may justify
its effectiveness in dysmenorrhea. Moreover, diuretic property of the fenugreek decreases pelvic
hyperemia and this property may explain the effectiveness of fenugreek in dysmenorrhea and
reduction of mastalgia (14). The chronic analgesic
effect of the fenugreek extract was observed and
studies have shown that fenugreek seed reduced
the pain through serotonergic system (36).
Anti-inflammatory, antipyretic and anti-anxiety
effects of leaf extracts of fenugreek were proved
in animal models (19, 34, 45−48). Phytochemical
studies have revealed that alkaloids, glycosides,
and phenols are the major components in fenugreek extracts (19, 34). Although the existence of
anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic effects in extracts suggests a NSAID-like mechanism, the presence of alkaloids as well as the absence of flavonoids, saponins and steroids does
not. Therefore, the alkaloid compounds in the extracts may have several effects (21). Phytoestrogens are herbal compounds with estrogenic activity; fenugreek contains phytoestrogen compounds
(49). Compared to dexamethasone and ibuprofen,
the fenugreek has showed similar anti-inflammatory effects. Diosgenin in fenugreek is a steroidal
sapogenin and is one of the compounds of fenugreek extract which acts as cortisone, and consequently, reduces anxiety (19).
In the present study, pain duration in the intervention cycles was shorter in the fenugreek group
(p=0.01). Hence, fenugreek seems to be effective
in reducing the duration of dysmenorrhea. Both
groups exhibited a reduction in the severity of
other symptoms associated with dysmenorrhea.
However, in the placebo group, symptom alleviation was not significant except in the reduction of
lack of energy (p=0.01). Therefore, fenugreek
may reduce dysmenorrhea-associated systemic
symptoms (nausea, vomiting, lack of energy,
headache, diarrhea, mood swings, syncope, and
fatigue). The antihistaminic effect of fenugreek
may reduce premenstrual symptoms. The effectiveness of fenugreek has been observed in dysmenorrhea, but not in temperament (14). The effects of fenugreek on systemic signs such as vomiting and anemia have also been reported (21).
Anemia causes lack of energy and fatigue, and
fenugreek leaves are a rich source of calcium,
iron, β-carotene, and vitamins (49). One of the
systemic symptoms associated with dysmenorrhea
is headache, and fenugreek has been shown to
alleviate this symptom (45).
Fenugreek seed paste is used to treat abscesses,
boils, ulcers and burns. Consumption of fenugreek
seed powder has therapeutic effects against gastritis and gastric ulcers due to bacterial infections

(50). The fenugreek is full of minerals which have
positive effects on the immune system and its
therapeutic effects may be justified by its minerals
(51).
The fenugreek group used fewer sedatives after
the intervention. This is an important finding because NSAIDs have numerous adverse effects,
including nausea, vomiting, dizziness, purpura,
petechiae, hyperkalemia, peripheral edema, peptic
ulcers and gastric bleeding (52). In the present
study, no complication was reported with regard
to fenugreek consumption. Very mild effects and
side effects of fenugreek have been introduced
(53−55). The existing evidence proves the nontoxicity of the aqueous extract of fenugreek. No
nutritional response has been observed in studies
related to fenugreek (56). This plant contains nontoxic mucilage, alkaloid, and sugar and has not
shown any specific side effect. One of the studies
showed side effects like allergic reactions, but no
hematological toxicity (13, 22, 57). The effectiveness of fenugreek in symptoms of dysmenorrhea
and its harmlessness have been observed (58).
Based on the findings of the present study, further
studies are needed to compare fenugreek with anti-inflammatory medications.
Conclusion
The present study showed that fenugreek reduced the severity of primary dysmenorrhea. Given that adverse effects were not reported for fenugreek, the herb can be administered safely for the
management of this condition.
