Objective. This study was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, and controlled trial with two parallel arms: the GJBNH group
and the placebo group. This trial recruited 100 women aging 18 to 35 years with primary dysmenorrhea caused by blood stagnation.
The investigational drugs, GJBNH or placebo, were administered for two menstrual periods (8 weeks) to the participants three times
per day. The participants were followed up for two menstrual cycles after the administration. Results. The results were analyzed by
the intention-to-treat (ITT) dataset and the per-protocol (PP) dataset. In the ITT dataset, the change of the average menstrual pain
VAS score in the GJBNH group was statistically significantly lower than that in the control group. Significant difference was not
observed in the SF-MPQ score change between the GJBNH group and the placebo group. No significant difference was observed in
the PP analyses. In the follow-up phase, the VAS scores of the average menstrual pain and the maximum menstrual pain continually
decreased in the placebo group, but they increased in the GJBNH group. Conclusion. GJBNH treatment for eight weeks improved
the pain of the dysmenorrhea caused by blood stagnation, but it should be successively administered for more than two menstrual
cycles. Trial Registration. This trial is registered with Current Controlled Trials no. ISRCTN30426947.
1. Background
Dysmenorrhea is a common medical complaint in reproductive women worldwide. The prevalence varies from 45% to
95% depending on the definition [1]. In Korea, 78.3% of all
adolescent girls have dysmenorrhea during their menstrual
periods [2].
The first option for the treatment of dysmenorrhea is
an over-the-counter drug, such as Ibuprofen, Naproxen, and
Mefenamic [3, 4]. However, these medications have not been
effective in 20% to 25% of women. Some adverse events such
as digestive disorders were reported [5].
Alternative therapies were reported to treat primary
dysmenorrhea. These treatments include acupuncture [6],
auricular acupressure [7], infrared-emitting sericite belt [8],
and single oral dose of vitamin D [9] and vitamin E [10]. The
effectiveness was observed in the treatments, but most studies
were pilot trials with small sample sizes. Large-scale clinical
trials are needed to clarify the efficacy.
In Korean Medicine, the main factor causing menstrual
abdominal pain is blood stagnation. If the flow of blood
or qi is interrupted, it may cause pain. The signs of blood
stagnation are being easily bruised, tender abdominal pain,
loaf in the menstrual blood, and so forth. Gyejibongnyeonghwan (GJBNH) is one of the most popular Korean Medicine
formulas for periodical pain due to dysmenorrhea. GJBNH
fluidifies blood to induce smooth blood flow and reduce
pain [6]. However, the effectiveness was reported mostly in
2 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine
the form of case reports or noncontrolled one-group clinical
trials [11, 12]. The well-designed clinical trial is mandatory to
prove the effect of GJBNH in primary dysmenorrhea.
The purpose of this trial is to identify the efficacy of
GJBNH in dysmenorrhea caused by blood stagnation.
2. Methods
2.1. Hypothesis. The hypothesis was that GJBNH would
reduce menstrual pain more effectively than placebo after
taking the intervention—the GJBNH or the placebo—for two
menstrual cycles.
2.2. Design. This was a multicenter, randomized, doubleblind, parallel group, and placebo-controlled phase IV trial.
This study was conducted from June 2009 to October
2012. Three investigational sites involved the trial: Korean
Medicine Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinic of Kyung Hee
Medical Center in Seoul, Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinic
of Won-Kwang Korean Medicine Hospital in Gunpo, and
Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinic of Gil Korean Medical
Hospital of Gachon in Incheon, Republic of Korea. The institutional review boards (IRBs) of three investigational sites
had approved the trial before the participants recruitment.
Participants were treated as outpatients in these sites. The
first visit was the screening. Participants were screened for
entry into the trial. Medical, medication, and gynecologic
histories were obtained. The second visit was the baseline.
At the baseline, the participants were randomly assigned into
two groups: the GJBNH group or the placebo group. Eligible
participants had taken the investigational drugs for eight
weeks. The 3rd visit was after one menstrual cycle from the
baseline, and the 4th visit was after two menstrual cycles
from the baseline. The 5th visit was after one menstrual
period from the 4th visit, and the 6th visit was after two
menstrual periods from the 5th visit. At the routine visit,
patients returned to the clinic for assessment of the clinical
improvement. The trial was conducted over five menstrual
cycles. The treatment phase was after two menstrual periods
from the baseline (about eight weeks). The participants were
followed up three menstrual cycles after the treatment phase.
Figure 1 is a flow diagram of this trial.
2.3. Participants. This trial recruited 100 women aging 18 to
35 years with primary dysmenorrhea. We used the 100 mm
visual analogue scale (VAS) to measure the menstrual pain.
The women enrolled were those whose pain intensity was
more than 60 mm. Two Korean Medicine gynecology specialists diagnosed the participants to determine whether
dysmenorrhea was caused by blood stagnation or not.
Inclusion criteria were for those with a period cycle
of 30 ± 3 days during the last 3 months, for those with a
VAS score over 60 mm of VAS at screening, and for those
diagnosed with blood stagnation.
Exclusion criteria were for those having major neuropsychiatric disorders, planning to have a baby, or taking
antidepressant, antiserotonin, barbiturate, or psychotropic
drugs. Other inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria were
described in the study protocol [13].
2.4. Intervention. Gyejibongnyeong-hwan (GJBNH) is one
of the Korean Medicine formulas for dysmenorrhea caused
by blood stagnation. The participants had taken the investigational drug, GJBNH or placebo, three times per day for
two menstrual periods (eight weeks). GJBNH consists of
Cinnamomiramulus, Poria, Moutan cortex, Persicae semen,
and Paeoniae radix. The placebo medicine was made of
lactose, corn starch, and food coloring and had a similar
appearance, shape, weight, taste, and color as GJBNH. As
rescue medication, ten pain-killer pills were provided during
each treatment cycle.
2.5. Randomization. Participants were divided into two
groups at Visit 2. The randomization process was commissioned to the independent institution. The random number
was produced by a computer random number generator.
The central web-site was used to perform the randomization
procedure.The investigators, participants, and monitors were
blinded to the study purpose and hypothesis.
2.6. Outcomes. The primary outcome was the change in the
visual analogue scale (VAS) of the average menstrual pain
after the baseline (Visit 2) and after the treatment (Visit
4). The secondary outcome measures included the VAS (the
maximum pain during the menstrual period) and the ShortForm McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ) [14].
2.7. Statistical Analyses. We carried out efficacy analyses on
ITT (intention-to-treat: all were randomly assigned participants) and PP (per-protocol: participants completed the
trial without any protocol violations). For ITT analysis,
missing data were imputed by last-observation carried forward (LOCF) method. We used SPSS version 20.0 (IBM,
Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) to perform the data analysis. The
descriptive statistics were used to compare the demographic
characteristics. We performed Student’s t-test to evaluate
the efficacy of GJBNH in the VAS and the SF-MPQ. For
categorical outcome variables, the Chi-square test was used
to test the difference. The significance level was 𝑃 = 0.05.
2.8. Ethical Consideration. The trial is conducted according
to the Declaration of Helsinki 2008 and/or the regulations of
the “Good Clinical Practice” principles of the Korea Food &
Drug Administration.
The institutional review boards (IRBs) have approved this
clinical trial at all investigational sites before the participants
recruitment. The reference numbers are KOMC IRB 2008-
07 (IRB of Kyung Hee Oriental Medical Center approved it
on the 18th of August 2008), WONSBHB IRB 2009-02 (IRB
of Won-Kwang University Sanbon Oriental Medical Center
approved it on the 24th of February 2009), and 09-101 (IRB
of Kyungwon Gil Oriental Medical Hospital approved it on
the 2nd of February 2009). Prior to undertaking any studyrelated procedures, all participants were fully informed and
signed consent forms.

3. Results
A total of 100 women were screened. Eight women did not
meet the inclusion criteria, and 92 participants were enrolled.
Forty-seven subjects were allocated to the GJBNH group, and
forty-five subjects were allocated to the placebo arm. After
the eight weeks of treatment, 15 participants in the GJBNH
group and 14 patients in the control group were dropped
out. Two of the most common reasons for dropout were the
irregular menstrual periods, under 27 days and over 33 days,
and being due to compliance. Adverse events were rare. The
most common compliant was the digestion problem.
The demographic characteristics of the two groups are
described in Table 1. The mean age at randomization for
the GJBNH group was 23.36 years, and it was 23.76 years
for the control group. The mean Short-Form McGill Pain
Questionnaire at baseline for the GJBNH group was 21.23,
and it was 22.98 for the placebo group. The mean VAS scores
of the average menstrual pain were 7.05 and 6.86 for the
GJBNH group and the placebo group, respectively. The mean
VAS of the maximum menstrual pain of the GJBNH group
was 7.74, and that of the control group was 7.65. There was
no statistical significant difference between the two groups in
most of the variables assessed at the baseline.
In the ITT analysis, after the eight weeks of treatment,
the change of the average menstrual pain VAS score in the
GJBNH group was significantly lower than that of the control
group (GJBNH group 1.75 ± 2.06, control group 0.88 ± 1.64;
𝑃 = 0.027). But the difference was not statistically significant.
The VAS scores of the maximum menstrual pain decreased
by 1.03 ± 1.84 and 0.44 ± 2.05 in the GJBNH and the placebo
groups, respectively. But the difference was not statistically
significant (𝑃 = 0.155). Significant difference was not
observed in the SF-MPQ score change between the GJBNH
group and the placebo group: 4.11 ± 8.61 and 2.60 ± 8.86
in the GJBNH group and the placebo group, respectively
(𝑃 = 0.410). Table 2 described the details of the ITT analysis
results.
In the PP analysis, after the eight weeks of treatment,
the change of the average menstrual pain VAS score in the
GJBNH group was lower than that of the control group
(GJBNH group 1.99 ± 2.18, control group 1.09 ± 1.84;

The VAS scores of the maximum menstrual pain decreased
by 1.26 ± 2.07 and 0.47 ± 2.44 in the GJBNH and the placebo
groups, respectively. But the difference was not statistically
significant (𝑃 = 0.188). Significant difference was not
observed in the SF-MPQ score change between the GJBNH
group and the placebo group: 5.03 ± 9.24 and 3.69 ± 9.81 in
the GJBNH group and the placebo group, respectively (𝑃 =
0.590). The details of the PP analysis were shown in Table 3.
The effect of GJBNH maintained one cycle of the menstrual period. Figures 2 and 3 showed the tendency of the VAS
of the average menstrual pain.The first followup was after one
menstrual cycle after the treatment, and the second followup
was after three menstrual cycles after the treatment.The score
of the GJBNH group was the lowest at the first followup, but
it increased at the second followup. The VAS score of the
placebo group decreased continually through the trial. The
difference at the first followup between the two groups was
more considerable than that after the treatment. But, at the
second followup, after the two menstrual cycles after the first
followup, the difference tendency disappeared.
3.1. Safety. A total of 16 adverse events occurred. The adverse
events were mild digestive disorder, breast stabbing pain,
menstrual cycle shortage, urticaria, diarrhea, skin itchiness,
and nausea. There were eight adverse events in the GJBNH
group and eight adverse events in the placebo group. The
adverse events rates were not statistically significant (𝑃 =
0.924). Table 4 showed the details.
4. Discussion
There are several study reports to treat dysmenorrhea.
Acupuncture is a recommendable therapy. Acupuncture was
as effective as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)
therapy [6]. A randomized controlled trial has shown the
effectiveness of acupuncture in primary dysmenorrhea [15].
But there were no significant differences between the groups.
Other therapies were effective in primary dysmenorrhea,
auricular acupressure [7], infrared-emitting sericite belt [8],
single oral doses of vitamin D [9] and vitamin E [10], and so
forth. But the statistically significant differences were rare.

the placebo. We discussed the reason for not detecting the
difference in the PP analysis, and we concluded that it was
due to the lack of sample size and the treatment period.
The first planned sample size was 100 participants. But
the enrolled participants were 92 women. It was due to
the pandemic break of influenza. In 2008, the influenza
A virus subtype had spread in Korea. The enrolment was
delayed. Although this study was supported by the National
R&D Project, the study due date was inflexible. As a result,
statistical power was lower than the planned.
There was the tendency of the pain decrease in the
average menstrual pain between the GJBNH group and the
placebo group. A decided difference was observed at Visit
4 and the first followup. This implied that GJBNH should
be administered over two menstrual cycles and that the
effect of GJBNH remains about one menstrual cycle after the
cessation.
6 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine
A total number of 18 adverse events occurred in this
clinical trial. But of all the adverse events were mild and
minor. The adverse events occurrence rates were not different
between the groups. We considered that GJBNH was safe for
clinical use.
This study assessed the other measurement. We analyzed
only the primary endpoint and two secondary endpoints.
More advanced analysis is needed for the other assessment.
The missing value imputation was planned by the multiple imputation (MI) method, but we used the LOCF method.
The VAS scores continuously decreased throughout the trial,
and the LOCF method was a conservative method. The
dropout rates between the groups were not significantly
different. Therefore, we inferred that the LOCF method was
appropriate to analyze the data.
This study was valuable to show the effect of GJBNH
by the randomized controlled trial. But still there were
limitations. The most deficient point was the dropout rate.
The participants were mostly young women in the university,
and the dropout rate was high in the vacation season. The
result was significant in the ITT analysis, but the significance
was not shown in the PP analysis. We concluded that the lack
of sample size was the main reason.
We expected that the results of this study would contribute to the practical use in the Korean Medicine clinics
and the design of the clinical trial of the Korean Medicine for
primary dysmenorrhea.
