Abstract
Objective: Preliminary evaluation of efficacy and safety of uzara use in treatment of moderate and severe primary
dysmenorrhea in comparison to ibuprofen.
Materials and Methods: This randomized, comparative two way cross-over study comprised 60 single female students at
Faculty of Medicine, Ain Shams University, Egypt, aged 19–28 years with moderate (n = 46) or severe (n = 14) primary
dysmenorrhea. Participants were randomized to take either uzara (80 mg/8 hours for two doses, then 40 mg/8 hours) then
ibuprofen (400 mg/6 hours) in two subsequent cycles or vice versa. The pain intensity, using VAS, was recorded
immediately before taking the medication (0 hour) and after 4, 12, 24, 48–60, 96–120 hours. Main outcome measures
included effectiveness of pain relief defined as drop of VAS to 3 or less, patient’s global evaluation of the drug, absence from
school, the use of a rescue medication, and, in those who continued the treatment, the pain intensity difference (PID) at
different points after start of medication and its sum (SPID).
Results: Uzara was comparably effective to ibuprofen (78.3% vs. 86.7% of cycles; respectively), with comparable rates of
effectiveness on global evaluation (being around 50% for either drug), and rates of school absences (11.7% vs. 13.3%;
respectively). The need for rescue medication was different (18.3% and 10%; respectively), albeit with no statistical
significance. The means of PID at different time points and SPID were comparable, with significantly lower average mean of
VAS scores compared to that felt with no medication (1.6 vs. 6.8, p,0.001). Side effects were less with uzara than ibuprofen
(0% vs. 8.3%, p,0.05).
Conclusions: Uzara might be as effective as ibuprofen in management of primary dysmenorrhea but with less side effects.
These findings need to be confirmed by a properly designed trial with a larger sample size.

Introduction
Primary dysmenorrhea is a common gynecological problem [1–
3]. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are well
established as first-line therapy. Common side effects are nausea,
vomiting, dyspepsia and diarrhea; with less common serious ones
[4]. They act by suppressing the production of endometrial
prostaglandins [2]. They are significantly more effective in
relieving pain when compared to placebo or paracetamol.
However, they have an overall treatment failure rate of
approximately 25%. Regarding effectiveness and safety, evidence
is still lacking to determine the best individual NSAID in treatment
of dysmenorrhea [2,5]. The combined oral contraceptives pills
(COCPs), which act by decreasing menstrual fluid volume and
prostaglandin production have been advocated to treat primary
dysmenorrhea, however there is insufficient evidence for pain
relief with their use [6]. Other alternative therapeutic modalities
include acupuncture [7], transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) [8], laparoscopic presacral neurectomy [9], spinal
manipulation [10], behavioral interventions [11], Zingiber officinale R. rhizomes (ginger) [12], and herbal and dietary therapies
(including magnesium, vitamin B6, vitamin B1, vitamin E, omega3 fatty acids, and Japanese herbal combination) [13].
Uzarae radix. is a herbal remedy extracted from the uzara root,
which constitutes of the dried underground parts of the 2–3 yearold plants Xysmalobium undulatum, This important medicinal
plant has been historically used by the native inhabitants of South
Africa to treat digestive complaints. It is approved by Commission
E to treat acute nonspecific diarrhea [14]. Although the inhibition
of active chloride secretion has been recently suggested to play a
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 August 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 8 | e104473
role [15], the anti-diarrheal action of uzara root extracts is thought
to be mainly through inhibiting the motility of visceral smooth
muscle. The action is qualitatively similar to that of papaverine
[16]. Uzara root extracts inhibit motility in the small intestine and
urogenital tract with traditional uses including afterbirth cramps
and dysmenorrhea [17]. Strangely enough, there are no published
studies evaluating its use as a treatment option for menstrual
cramps although its use has been suggested since 1913 [18]. Also,
no health hazards or side effects are known [19] and recent studies
have failed to find significant cardiovascular pharmacodynamic
effects with its oral administration [20]. Uzara contains glycosides
with cardenolide structure (uzarin and xysmalorin) which have
been reported to cross-react with the conventional digitalis assays
[20,21], thus not to be administered concomitantly with other
cardioactive glycosides [14,21].
The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety and
tolerability of uzara in comparison to ibuprofen, a NSAID, in the
treatment of primary dysmenorrhea.
Materials and Methods
This was a pilot phase III randomized comparative, two way
cross-over assignment, safety and efficacy study, aiming at
preliminary evaluation of uzara versus ibuprofen in the treatment
of primary dysmenorrhea. The protocol for this trial and
supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting
information; see Protocol S1 and Checklist S1.The study protocol
approval was obtained on 29th August 2010 (FMASU 773/2010)
from the Ethics and Research Committee of the Faculty of
Medicine, Ain Shams University 00006444. The authors confirm
that all their ongoing and related trails for uzara in their institute
are registered. The participants were 60 women with moderate or
severe primary dysmenorrhea, recruited from female students
attending clinical classes in medicine (Faculty of Medicine) or
nursing (High Institute of Nursing). The inclusion criteria were:
age between 18 and 28 years, regular cycles (21–35 days) with
duration of 3 to 7 days, a history of at least 6 consecutive months
of moderate to severe primary dysmenorrhea as determined by the
verbal rating scale (VRS, a 4-point self-rated verbal score: 0, none;
1, mild; 2, moderate; and 3, severe menstrual pain) [22], with the
pain lasting for at least 2 days and who required analgesia in each
of the last 3 consecutive cycles, preceding participation in the
study. The exclusion criteria were planning to get married during
the study period; known or suspected secondary dysmenorrhea
and other causes of chronic pelvic pain (previous major abdominal
or pelvic surgery, endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease,
ovarian cysts, pathological vaginal secretion, chronic abdominal
pain, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome);
hormonal therapy during the last 6 months or planning to take
hormonal therapy during the study period; regular intake of pain
medications (including NSAIDs) for other reason than dysmenorrhea, digoxin, antidepressants, tranquilizers, hypnotics, sedatives,
or sex hormones; any concomitant disease or condition that might
require any intake of analgesic medication; history of significant
chronic constipation or recurrent colitis; evidence of clinically
relevant serious condition whether gynecological, cardiovascular,
hematological, hepatic, gastrointestinal, renal, pulmonary endocrinological, autoimmune diseases, neurologic or psychiatric

disease, based on a clinical assessment and routine laboratory
investigations; unwillingness to comply with the protocol, or
participation in another clinical trial in the 3 months prior to the
start of this study.
Each participant completed a case record form, including
demographic details and past medical and surgical history. A
transabdominal ultrasonographic scanning (TAS) was performed
in all participants to exclude any pelvic pathology. Severity of
dysmenorrhea in all participants was initially assessed by two
validated pain scales: visual analogue scale (VAS), verbal rating
scale (VRS) [23]. VAS is a one-dimensional linear scale of 0–
10 cm (0 cm representing no pain; 10 cm, severe pain) with values
greater than 5 defined as moderate or severe. Marked limitation of
daily activities evidenced by absence from school was recorded.
The objective of the study was explained to eligible participants,
who all signed a written informed consent. The randomization
sequence was computer generated and kept concealed by the first
author (KA) who played no role in patients’ recruitment. Other
co-authors -indulged in patients’ recruitment and consenting to the
study- were continuously updated regarding number of participants with assigned sequence. They collaborated together to
allocate the next available number to each participant in order of
her enrollment in the study. Subsequently, the first author (KA)
was contacted and asked to release the sequence (order of drug
intake, uzara/ibuprofen or vice versa).
Uzara is a coated tablet, contained purely vegetable active
substance 40 mg dry extract of roots of uzara plant, Xysmalobium
undulatum (4–6:1) [extracting medium: methanol 60% (V/V)]

Registration owner: STADA GmbH, Bad Vilbel, Manufacturer:
HEMOPHARM GmbH, Germany). The control drug was
ibuprofen 400 mg sugar coated tablets (Brufen 400 mg, Kahira
Pharm. & Chem. Ind. Co., Cairo, Egypt; under license from
Abbott Laboratories). Treatment was commenced with the onset
of menstruation or when pain is felt to be impending (up to two
days before the expected start of menstruation) and stopped when
there was mild or no pain (VAS score 3 or less) 6–8 hours from the
last test tablet or after 5 days treatment duration. Both drugs were
taken orally; uzara two tablets every 8 hours for 2 doses then one
tablet every 8 hours (maximum daily dose 200 mg), Ibuprofen one
tablet every 6 hour (maximum daily dose 1600 mg). Each of the
two drugs, ibuprofen and uzara, has a short serum half-life, being
1.8–2 hours [24] versus 8.87 6 2.20 hours [25]; respectively. It is
reported that the duration of washout time should be approximately 106 the plasma apparent terminal elimination half-life to
provide for 99.9% of the administered dose to be eliminated from
the body [26]. So, the incorporation of a relatively long washout
period (3 weeks between treatment periods, i.e. two successive
menses) in the cross over design of the present study was assumed
to diminish safely the impact of carryover effects and eliminate the
need for testing for carry over effects. In both treatment cycles,
participants recorded the pain intensity they experienced, using
visual analogue scale (VAS) at 6 time-points: immediately before
starting the tested medication (0 hour) and after 4, 12, 24, 48–60
and 96–120 hours. The occurrence of school absence as a result of
confirmed marked limitation of physical activity in relation to
dysmenorrhea was recorded. The use of other analgesics was
allowed for those receiving little or no pain relief i.e., rescues
medication. This was permitted 1 hour after the intake of the
tested drug. The type, dose, frequency of administration and the
response using VAS were recorded after the intake of the rescue
drug, if needed. Adverse reactions and tolerability to all
medications were recorded. After the end of the each treatment
cycle, participants’ global evaluation of the study medication was
recorded as effective or non-effective.
In the present study, the primary outcomes measures –all
related to analgesic effect- were: a drop in VAS score to #3 at
point B (4 hours after receiving the medication), participant’s
global evaluation of the drug, absence from school, the use of a
rescue medication, and in those who continued the treatment, the
pain intensity difference (PID) at certain points after start of
medication and its sum (SPID). Secondary outcome measures
included adverse reactions and drug tolerability recorded at the
end of each cycle.

dysmenorrhea compared to the standard therapy (ibuprofen) in
knowledgeable medical students, who might be skeptic about its

effectiveness, we opted to include a sample size (60 subjects) larger
than usual to avoid a false negative result which would preclude
the opportunity to further examination of uzara in this respect. All
analyses were performed with SPSS 17 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL,
USA). The Student t tests (for independent and dependent
parameters) were used for continuous variables whereas Fisher’s
exact test was used for categorical variables. For all analyses, a
two-tailed p value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically
significant. Intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis was performed for all
outcomes except for pain intensity difference (PID) over time. The
latter was analyzed in those receiving study medications (uzara
versus ibuprofen) as ‘‘modified intention-to-treat’’ or ‘‘per protocol’’; a non-randomized, observational comparison. For those
receiving rescue medications, as pre-specified in study protocol,
the response using VAS scoring was recorded and analyzed
separately to avoid confounding the analgesic effect of study
medications. Risk analysis was done to estimate the risk of
untoward outcomes in either study group. The relative risk (RR)
was then calculated as the risk in the uzara group relative to the
ibuprofen group. Absolute risk reduction (ARR) was calculated by
subtraction of the risk in the ibuprofen group from that in the
uzara group. The number needed to treat (NNT) was then
calculated as the reciprocal of the ARR. All risk estimates were
presented along with their 95% C.I. (confidence interval).
Results
To save time as the researchers were late in registering the study
internationally, the study was announced during lectures so that
those students suffering from dysmenorrhea and willing to
volunteer in a trial of a new therapeutic line were invited to
register themselves in a preliminary list for interview. This lasted
till January 31st 2011when the trial was registered (Trial
registration number: ISRCTN25618258; Registry website:
http://www.controlled-trials.com). Following this, the first 103
subjects, in order, were interviewed with full explanation of the
study protocol and assessment for eligibility. Patients’ enrollment
(60 subjects) followed with signing a well-informed consent, use of
medications, and follow up till March 28, 2012 when the trial
ended (Figure 1). Initial assessment, using VRS scoring, revealed
that dysmenorrhea was moderate in 46 patients and severe in 14
patients, all virgin with absence of prior sexual intercourse. The
general characteristics of the participants are shown in Table 1.
Medical advice was sought in 16.7% (10/60); with an analgesic
being prescribed to the participants by a lay relative in 85% (51/
60) of cases. Family history of primary dysmenorrhea - in mother,
a sister, or both – was positive in 50% of participants (30/60).
Thirty participants started with uzara, while the other 30 started
with ibuprofen. There was no significant difference between uzara
and ibuprofen cycles regarding the number of doses taken by the
participants (2.12 6 0.97 vs. 2.28 6 0.76, p = 0.371; with median
being 2 and range 1–4 vs. 1–6; respectively). The effectiveness of
uzara and ibuprofen were comparable (Table 2) in terms of the
reduction of VAS score to 3 or less (78.3% vs. 86.7%; respectively,
p = 0.337) and participant’s global evaluation (48.3% vs. 51.7%;
respectively, p = 0.855). Satisfactory relief of pain, as indicated by
the absent need of rescue drug, was lower with uzara compared to
Ibuprofen (81.7% vs. 90%) groups, albeit with no statistical
significance (p = 0.295). Of note, 2 (3.3%) participants with severe
dysmenorrhea received a rescue drug with both tested medications, i.e. both medications failed to relief their pain. Discordant
response with only one drug being effective and reported failure
with the other was also noticed; uzara alone was effective in 2
participants, while ibuprofen only was effective in 9 participants.

School absence rates were comparable; being 11.7% (7/60) for
uzara and 13.3% (8/60) for ibuprofen, (p.0.05); both being lower
than the participants’ historical school absence rate (19/60 or
31.7%; p,0.01). In those who continued the study medications,
the means of pain intensity difference (PID) at different time points
after their start and its sum (SPID) were comparable (Figure 2, and
Table 3). The mean post-treatment VAS scores in both uzara and
ibuprofen cycles were comparable (1.6360.86 vs. 1.6160.83;
respectively), being both significantly lower than the initial (pretreatment) VAS (6.7761.57; p,0.001). In those using rescue
medications, the average VAS scores after drug use were 2.762.7
and 360.8; respectively (p.0.05).
All participants tolerated uzara well with 0% (0/60) side effects
compared to 8.3% (5/60) with ibuprofen (p,0.05). These were all
gastro-intestinal side effects including nausea (two participants),
vomiting (one participant), stomach cramps alone (one participant)
or with nausea (one participant).
Discussion
This study has assessed the efficacy, safety and tolerability of
uzara in comparison to ibuprofen, a NSAID, in the treatment of
primary dysmenorrhea. Our analyses showed that the effectiveness
of uzara was comparable to that of ibuprofen, a standard first line
therapy. The failure rates of uzara (21.7%) and Ibuprofen (13.3%)
were comparable to other reported NSAIDs [2,5]. Two participants failed to respond to both drugs, while discordant response
with only one drug being effective was also noticed in 11
participants. All participants tolerated uzara well with no reported
side effects compared to 8.3% in Ibuprofen cycles.
A point of strength of our study is the prospective randomized
design with crossover assignment of medication to allow each
participant to act as her own control. Also, to provide clinically
meaningful results, two measurement of severity of dysmenorrhea,
visual analogue scale (VAS) and verbal rating scale (VRS), were
used [22]. Although, some investigators considered a reduction of
3 points of pain severity in the VAS as an outcome to define
successful treatment [23], a reduction of VAS score to 3 or less was
chosen to indicate effectiveness in the present study as this would
indicate a mild degree of pain likely to be acceptable to the
woman. Retrospective participant’s global evaluation of each
medication showed also comparable efficacy; albeit with lower
figures which might be explained by subject’s expectation to have
complete analgesia. One limitation is failure to double blind this
study, due to lack of technical facilities to manufacture ibuprofen
tablet identical to that of uzara. Non-blinding of the participants
might have being disadvantageous to uzara, being acknowledged
by them as a test medication with potential loss of trust and
lowered expectations regarding efficacy. This could be a source of
bias against uzara with apparently less effectiveness (78.3% vs.
86.7% of cycles of ibuprofen; respectively), and higher need for
rescue drug usage (18.3% and 10%; respectively), though being
statistically insignificant. Other limitations are the apparently
lower number of study participants and belonging to a special
cultural sector with medical background. Since all study participants were virgin with absence of prior sexual intercourse, an
assumption based on strict religious banning of pre-marital sex in
our society, our results can be safely generalized to unmarried or
abstinent young females. In fact, one might assume that this would
not interfere with overall generalizability due to elimination of
other confounding factors, such as IUD or pelvic infection, which
can interfere with dysmenorrhea.
We hypothesized that uzara is effective in treating primary
dysmenorrhea. Catecholamines can theoretically cause either
excitation or inhibition of the uterus depending on whether alpha
or beta adrenergic receptors predominate. The adrenergic
responsiveness of the myometrium appears to be regulated by
steroid hormones [27]. It is suggested that stress-associated
enhancement of sympathetic activity leads to exacerbation of
uterine contraction and increased menstrual pain. This activity
might be decreased via exercise with subsequent symptomatic
relief [28]. The mechanism of analgesic effect of uzara is
apparently through inhibiting the motility of visceral smooth
muscle of the uterus, probably via the local stimulation of
sympathetic nerves with an inhibitory effect on smooth muscles;
an action similar to that suggested for its anti-diarrheal action [16].
This is further supported by earlier use of beta2-adrenoceptor
agonists in the treatment of women with primary dysmenorrhea.
Despite the failure of hydroxyphenyl-orciprenalin [29], and
isoxsuprine [30], to show any benefit in previous studies, another
one reported pain relief with a combination of isoxsuprine,
acetaminophen and caffeine [31]. Moreover, two studies reported
pain relief in severe primary dysmenorrhea with terbutaline
administered via spray inhalations [32] or intravenous injection,
along with inhibition of the myometrial activity and increased
uterine blood flow [33]. A recent review on the use beta2-
adrenoceptor agonists for dysmenorrhea found that adverse effects
with all these medications were reported in up to a quarter of the
total number of participants and they included nausea, vomiting,
dizziness, tremors and palpitations. Although this mechanism for
relieving dysmenorrhea fell into disrepute for over 30 years due to

Uzara in Treatment of Primary Dysmenorrhea
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 6 August 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 8 | e104473
high incidence of adverse effects in these few, relatively small-sized
and inadequate quality studies [34], this does not preclude the
assertion that uterine sympathetic supply plays a role in the
pathogenesis of primary dysmenorrhea. The response to uzara in
the present study supports this view. Therefore, uzara might
benefit women by relieving dysmenorrhea via this mechanism of
action, but without significant risk of side effects, which preclude
the use of beta2-adrenoceptor agonists as an acceptable clinical
treatment option.
This study suggests that uzara might be as effective as ibuprofen
in treatment of primary dysmenorrhea. Considering its better
tolerability, shorter contraindication list and lower incidence of
side effects, uzara might be considered as an alternative agent to
NSAIDs in women who have failed response, contraindications or
side effects. With suggested different mechanism of action of uzara,
one might wonder whether combining it with NSAIDs would have
a good additive effect evidenced by a better success rate and the

dysmenorrhea.
