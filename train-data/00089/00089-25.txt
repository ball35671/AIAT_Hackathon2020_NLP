Abstract
Background: Zingiber officinale R. rhizome (ginger) is a popular spice that has traditionally been used to combat
the effects of various inflammatory diseases. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of ginger on pain
relief in primary dysmenorrhea.
Method: This was a randomized, controlled trial. The study was based on a sample of one hundred and twenty
students with moderate or severe primary dysmenorrhea. The students were all residents of the dormitories of
Shahed University. They were randomly assigned into two equal groups, one for ginger and the other for placebo
in two different treatment protocols with monthly intervals. The ginger and placebo groups in both protocols
received 500 mg capsules of ginger root powder or placebo three times a day. In the first protocol ginger and
placebo were given two days before the onset of the menstrual period and continued through the first three days
of the menstrual period. In the second protocol ginger and placebo were given only for the first three days of the
menstrual period. Severity of pain was determined by a verbal multidimensional scoring system and a visual
analogue scale.
Results: There was no difference in the baseline characteristics of the two groups (placebo n = 46, ginger n = 56).
The results of this study showed that there were significant differences in the severity of pain between ginger and
placebo groups for protocol one (P = 0.015) and protocol two (P = 0.029). There was also significant difference in
duration of pain between the two groups for protocol one (P = 0.017) but not for protocol two (P = 0.210).
Conclusion: Treatment of primary dysmenorrhea in students with ginger for 5 days had a statistically significant
effect on relieving intensity and duration of pain.

Background
Primary dysmenorrhea is the term for painful menstrual
cramping, there is no pathological evidence for the condition and it occurs in up to 50% of menstruating
females [1]. It can lead to a woman’s failure to function
normally during menstruation rendering them unable to
perform daily activities; it can contribute to absenteeism
from work or school [2].
One reason that has been suggested as an explanation
for primary dysmenorrhea is an increased production of
uterine prostaglandins derived from cyclooxygenase
(COX)-2 activities [3, 4]. Studies have shown that an inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis occurs through inhibition of COX-2 that could be exerted by nonspecific
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). These
drugs have useful effects such as anti-inflammatory, antipyretic and analgesic [5, 6]. Moreover studies have indicated that the conventional treatment for primary
dysmenorrhea has a failure rate of 20% to 25% [7]. These
procedures may be contradictory or not tolerated by
some women with primary dysmenorrhea [8]. Given the
contraindications and side effects of NSAIDs as well as
their limited efficacy, an investigation of alternative
treatments with low toxicity such as herbal products
is warranted.

Ginger has a long history of traditional use. It contains
several constituents such as gingerol, gingerdiol, and
gingerdione, beta-carotene, capsaicin, caffeic acid and
curcumin [9, 10].
Several studies have demonstrated that ginger has
beneficial effects to cancer prevention [11], pregnancyrelated nausea and vomiting [12], chemotherapy nausea
[13], nausea and vomiting after surgery [14] and osteoarthritis [15]. It has been shown that ginger acts as an
inhibitor on cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipooxygenase
[16], resulting in an inhibition of leukotriene [17] and
prostaglandin [18] synthesis. Therefore ginger has been
used as an anti-inflammatory acting by inhibition of
prostaglandin synthesis [19]. Ginger is therefore worthy
of consideration as an analgesic in primary dysmenorrhea. Other research on the effects of ginger on dysmenorrhea has been of limited value as the study was
not randomized and there was no placebo group [18].
The present clinical trial was undertaken to investigate
the effect of 1500 mg ginger daily on pain relief in
students with moderate to severe primary dysmenorrha, when treated before and at the onset of the menstrual period or treated only at the onset of the
menstrual period.
Methods
Trial design
The study was a double blind, placebo-controlled and
parallel-group study with balanced randomization [1:1]
for the two groups. The study was conducted in Tehran,
Iran from June 2008 to December 2008.
Participants
A sample of female students aged 18 and over was
selected for the trial. Inclusion criteria consisted of:
being single, having a menstrual cycle that lasts from 21
to 35 days with 2 to 6 days of flow and average blood
loss of 20 to 60 ml [20], with moderate to severe primary
dysmenorrha. The severity of dysmenorrhea was determined by a verbal multidimensional scoring system [21],
with four grades as follows: painless menstruation = 0,
menstruation with pain but rare use of analgesics or
limit to normal activity = 1, menstruation with moderate
pain with influence on daily activity and use of analgesics for pain relief = 2, and menstruation with severe pain
with significant limitation to daily activity, ineffective use
of analgesics, and such symptoms as headache, tenderness, nausea, vomiting , and diarrhea = 3. Patients with
moderate to severe dysmenorrhea (scores of 2 or 3) were
included. The criteria that determined exclusion from
the study were as follows: diagnoses of a disease, a history of pregnancy or taking oral contraceptives, body
mass index (BMI) less than 19 kg/m2 or greater than
25 kg/m2
, and mild dysmenorrhea.
Study setting
The study was conducted at Shahed University dormitories from June 2008 to December 2008 in Tehran,
Iran.
Intervention
Zingiber officinale R. rhizomes were collected in April
2008 from the Iranian Institute of Medicinal Plants
(affiliated to Iranian Academic Center for Education,
Culture and Research-ACECR) field. A voucher specimen of the plant (number 1483) has been deposited
in the Central Herbarium of the institute. The rhizomes were dried in a dark condition at room
temperature and ground to a powder that was
encapsulated.
Preparation of Ginger and placebo capsules
The placebo capsules contained toast powder. The capsules were similar in shape, taste and color but one set
contained 500 mg ginger powder per capsule and the
others were placebo capsules. The ginger capsules did
not have distinguishable smell. The capsules were prepared in the Institute of Medicinal Plants and put into
coded packages. Capsules and their packages were identical in appearance.
After confirmation of a patient’s eligibility and after
written informed consent was given, the students were
randomly divided into two equal groups to be administered with ginger or placebo. The ginger and placebo
groups received 500 mg capsules of ginger powder and
placebo respectively three times a day in two different
treatment protocols. Both treatment protocols were
given at monthly intervals as follows:
Treatment protocol 1: In this protocol ginger and
placebo were given two days before the onset of the
menstrual period and continued through the first three
days of the menstrual period.
Treatment protocol 2: In this protocol ginger and
placebo were given only for the first three days of the
menstrual period (Figure 1).
In this study the two groups were independent and
remained on the same allocation throughout the study.
Outcomes
Severity and duration of pain were outcome measures
for the study. The severity of pain was assessed before
and after intervention by a visual analogue scale [22].
The visual analog scale (VAS) is a tool widely used to
measure pain. Students were asked to indicate a perception of pain intensity (most commonly) along a 10 cm
horizontal line. Duration of pain was determined by asking each student to indicate the number of hours she

had experienced pain during the first three days of the
menstrual period.
Assessment of adverse effects
Students in both groups were requested to write down
and report any unwanted adverse effects including diarrhea, upset stomach and heartburn. In addition, changes
in menstrual cycles including duration of menses and
interval of cycles were asked.
Sample size
In order to demonstrate a significant difference between
ginger and placebo groups using the pain severity test,
the estimated sample size was calculated to be at least
50 students per group. A study with such a sample size
would have a power of 90% at a 0.05 significance level.
Randomization
A random numbers table was used for assigning participants in a 1:1 ratio to receive placebo and ginger using a
block of two. An odd number was assigned to one patient and an even number to the other patient in each
block. For each individual student recruited in the trial,
a coded package was used (Figure 2).
Allocation concealment
The randomization code was available only to the midwife who had not participated in the process of patient
recruitment. The code was disclosed to the researchers
when the statistical analysis had been completed by
researchers.
Blinding
This was a double- blind trial. Both the students and
midwife providing care were blind to the treatment allocation. For this purpose, coded packages containing
ginger and placebo capsules were used. The ginger and
placebo capsules were identical in appearance, color
and taste.
Analysis
The SPSS version 16.0 was used to analyze the data. Descriptive analyses were carried out to explore the data.
Analysis of covariance was performed for comparison of
means for severity of pain and duration of pain in the
two groups with baseline scores as the covariates. The
Chi- square test was used to compare categorical variables, t test to compare pain score (OR severity of pain)
and duration of pain between two groups, P value ≤ 0.05
was considered as significant.
Ethics
The ethics committee of Shahed University approved the
protocol. We obtained written informed consent from
participants after comprehensive explanation of procedure involved.
Results
The study involved a total of 105 students. Thirteen students who had received placebo discontinued the trial
before completing the evaluation due to the fact that
they indicated did not like to be involved in this research
project any longer. More information on reasons for
leaving was not captured. However, there were no significant differences between characteristics of 13 patients
who left the placebo group and those who remained in
the study (Table 1).
There were no significant differences between the two
groups concerning baseline characteristics including age,
BMI (Body Mass Index) and menstruation characteristics (Table 1).
The results of this study showed that there were significant differences in severity of pain between ginger
and placebo groups for protocol one (P = 0.015, Table 2)
and protocol two (P = 0.029, Table 3). When the analysis
was adjusted for baseline score the results still remained
significant for both protocols (protocol 1: P = 0.003,
Table 2; protocol 2: P = 0.008, Table 3).
There was also significant difference in duration of
pain between the two groups for protocol one (P = 0.017,
Table 2) but not for protocol two (P = 0.210, Table 3).

The results also showed that there was significant difference between the two groups in duration of pain in
protocol one (P = 0.016, Table 2) but not for protocol
two (P = 0.080, Table 3) when the analysis was adjusted
for baseline scores.
Overall the ginger group reported 11 h less pain duration than the placebo group. Similarly they reported
3 cm less in severity of pain than the placebo group.
In all, 3 students in the ginger group (5.1%) and 4 students in the placebo group (8.7%) reported adverse
effects. Students in the ginger group reported heartburn
while students in the placebo group reported nausea.
Discussion
The results indicate that administration of 1500 mg ginger powder daily for three days is a safe and effective
way to produce analgesia in students with primary
dysmenorrhea.
Although the 1.4 and 2.0 point (cm) reduction in pain
severity seen under protocol 1 and protocol 2 were statistically significant, as suggested if we consider a reduction of 3 point (cm) pain severity in the VAS as clinically
significant [23], then one might argue that the finding
was not clinically significant. However, the 3-point reduction was reported for other conditions and it is
worth to establish this for ginger in the future studies.
Studies have shown that the NSAIDs are effective in
treating dysmenorrhea comparing to placebo [24-26],
but due to the absence of therapeutic response or intolerance to gastro- intestinal adverse events about 30%
of women with primary dysmenorrhea would not take
these drugs [27-29]. However, the result of this study
showed that 5.1% students were experienced heartburn
in ginger group and there were no significant differences
between the two groups concerning to gastrointestinal
adverse effects. Ginger is generally considered a safe
herbal medicine [30].
The results of present study showed that taking ginger
2 days before the onset of the menstrual cycle was significantly better at decreasing the duration of pain. However, there was some indication that the magnitude of
decrease in pain duration for protocol 2 was better than
protocol one. The explanation for such an observation
needs more investigation, although one might argue that
this apparent superiority was due to under reporting by
students using protocol 2.
Several factors including increased production of prostaglandins may be involved in menstrual pain [31]. To
explain the effects of ginger on pain relief from dysmenorrhea, it has been reported that ginger inhibits cyclooxygenase and lipooxygenase pathways in prostaglandin
and leukotriene synthesis [32] and the anti-inflammatory
property of ginger has been attributed to inhibition of
prostaglandin synthesis [19, 33]. However the inhibition
of prostaglandin synthesis may be the key mechanism
for ginger’s effect on menstruation pain in this study.
The findings of this research are in accordance with a
previous observation that compared efficacy of ginger to
some NSAID drugs [18]. Similarly, another study was
found that ginger had effect on pain relief in primary
dysmenorrhea [34]. Finally, studies are needed in order
to make ginger capsules in a standardized fashion and
dose-finding studies are recommended.
Limitations
This study is somewhat limited by a lack of observation
regarding the effects of ginger on the other symptoms
associated with dysmenorrhea. Furthermore, 13 patients
from placebo group left the study. Unfortunately we did
not collect data on reasons for leaving and this is a limitation. Moreover we did not analyze the gingerol or

shogaol content of our ginger powder nor was it made
in a standardized fashion. Consequently we do not know
how much of key constituents were in the capsules making it hard to know what dose of other ginger capsule to
give in the future and to determine if all the capsules
were uniform in there gingerols/shogaol content. Lastly,
it is worth noting that no measure of adherence or
blinding was assessed. Consequently, effect sizes could
be exaggerated if blinding was not achieved. Conversely
if some of the participants did not take enough capsules
or at the right times it could biases our results to the
null. However, it was found that the effects of ginger are
large enough to be clinically significant and to alleviate
primary dysmenorrhea.
Conclusion
The results suggest that ginger may be an effective and
safe therapy for relieving pain in women with primary
dysmenorrhea if administered at the onset or during the
3 days prior to menstruation. Furthermore studies with
larger number of patients concerning the efficacy and
safety of different doses of ginger as well as its effects on
the other dysmenorrhea symptoms are suggested to supplement this research.
