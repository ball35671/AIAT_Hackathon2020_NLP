Abstract
To prove the efficacy of oral vitamin B1 administration for the treatment of primary dysmenorrhoea, a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was carried out on 556 girls aged 12-21 yr, having moderate to very severe spasmodic dysmenorrhoea. Thiamine hydrochloride (vitamin B1) was given in a dose of 100 mg orally, daily for 90 days. The combined final results of both the 'active treatment first' group and the 'placebo first' group, after 90 days of vitamin B1 administration, were 87 per cent completely cured, 8 per cent relieved (pain almost nil to reduced) and 5 per cent showed no effect whatsoever. The results remained the same two months later as well when no drug was administered. Unlike all the current treatments which are suppression-oriented, this curative treatment directly treats the cause, is free from side effects, is inexpensive and easy to administer.
