Effect of rhubarb (Rheum emodi) in primary
dysmenorrhoea: a single-blind randomized
controlled trial
Abstract
Background: The aim of this study was to investigate and
evaluate the efficacy of Rheum emodi in the management
of primary dysmenorrhoea.
Methods: A randomized, single-blind, standard controlled
trial compared efficacy of R. emodi against mefenamic acid
on diagnosed subjects of primary dysmenorrhoea for three
consecutive cycles. Experimental group (n¼ 30) received
capsules of R. emodi powder two times a day, two days
before the expected date of menstruation, and continued
first three days of menstruation, while control group
(n¼ 15) participants received mefenamic acid capsules
three times a day on the same protocol. The primary outcome measures were reduced in severity and duration of
pain, assessed by visual analogue scale (VAS) and verbal
multidimensional scoring system (VMSS), and secondary
outcome measures were overall improvement of dysmenorrhoea and improved in quality of life (QOL). Statistical
analysis was done by repeated measures analysis of variance and Chi-square/Fisher Exact test.
Results: The menstrual pain was significantly decreased
in both groups after three-cycle intervention. Significant
changes were observed in VAS (p < 0.001) and VMSS
(p < 0.001) in the experimental group. There is a significant (p< 0.001) reduction in duration of pain in both the
groups. Associated symptoms and QOL were markedly
improved after treatment (p < 0.001).
Conclusions: It has been clear from the above result that
R. emodi is an effective herb in alleviating symptoms of
primary dysmenorrhoea. It can serve as an alternative
treatment without any apparent side effects. These results
deserve further investigations.

Introduction
Primary dysmenorrhoea is cyclic menstrual pain without
an identifiable pelvic pathology, often accompanied by low
backache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, headache, and so
forth [1, 2]. The pain is classically described as cramping or
labour like lasting for 48–72 h [3]. It affects the women of
reproductive age and is more prevalent among adolescent
girls with the establishment of ovulatory cycle [4, 5].
Whereas, secondary dysmenorrhoea is caused by some
underlying pelvic pathology such as endometriosis, leiomyoma, ovarian cyst pelvic inflammatory disease and due
to anatomic genital malformations [1, 3, 4].
The prevalence of primary dysmenorrhoea is estimated
to be from 20 to 90% among young reproductive women
and more than 10% of women suffer from severe pain that
interfere daily functions for 1–3 days per month [2, 6, 7].
Several studies have shown that dysmenorrhoea is the
single greatest cause of lost working hours and school
absence in the adolescent girls and it affects their academic
performance, social and sports activities; having a negative
impact on the general health of women [6, 8, 9]. Therefore,
it must be treated with due care. The proposed aetiology for
primary dysmenorrhoea is an excessive or imbalanced
amount of prostanoids released from the endometrium during menstruation. These prostanoids cause abnormal uterine contractions which leads to uterine tissue ischaemia
and pain [1, 4, 7]. The pharmacological treatment of choice
for primary dysmenorrhoea is the use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which inhibit the activity of
cyclooxygenase and reduce prostaglandin production,
resulting in less intense uterine contractions [10].

Evidence-based data support the efficacy of Ibuprofen,
mefenamic acid, naproxen, and so forth [11]. Hormone
therapy (contraceptive pills) is also an established treatment modality for dysmenorrhoea by reducing myometrial
contractility [12]. However, NSAIDs are contraindicated or
not tolerated by some women (owing to side effects) leading
to failure rate up to 20–25% [13, 14]. Despite the effective
available treatment for combating the menstrual pain, the
complete relief is still challenging. Hence an alternative
herbal treatment with low toxicity is warranted.
Presently complementary and alternative medicine
(CAM) therapies are widely adapted and a number of
females choose CAM to alleviate menstrual pain, such
as acupressure, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), behavioural interventions and herbal and
dietary therapy [13, 14].
Rhubarb, the rhizomes of Rheum emodi Wall. ex
Meissn., is a traditional medicine with antioxidant [15],
anti-inflammatory [16], antiulcer [17], hepatoprotective [18],
anticancer [15] and immunoenhancing [19] properties.
Rhubarb has been extensively used in gastrointestinal and
musculoskeletal system from very early time and has been
administered in Traditional Chinese medicine around 2700
BC [20]. Rhubarb contains a number of phenolic compounds
including anthroquinones, stilbenes, tannin, polysaccharides and others. Rhubarb emodin and tannins were proved
to have analgesic activity [21]. Traditional use of rhubarb for
menstrual disorders and to relieve menstrual pain has been
documented in The Canon of Medicine by Ibn Sina,
Compendium on Simple Medicaments and Foods by Ibn
Baitar and other classical sources [22–24]. However, to the
best of our knowledge, there are no reports of a controlled
study using rhubarb in dysmenorrhoea. The aim of present
study was to evaluate the efficacy of rhubarb in patients with
primary dysmenorrhoea.
Materials and methods
Trial design
This was a single-centre, single-blind, standard controlled and parallel group study with unequal randomization (2:1). The study was
conducted in Bangalore, India.
Participants
Forty-five unmarried participants between ages of 15–25 years having regular menstrual cycles which last from 21 to 35 days with 2–6
days of flow, with moderate to severe dysmenorrhoea were included
in the study. The severity of dysmenorrhoea was assessed by verbal
multidimensional scoring system (VMSS) [25] with grades as follows:
grade 0 ¼ painless menstruation, grade 1 (mild dysmenorrhoea) ¼
menstruation with pain but rare use of analgesics or limit to normal
activity, grade 2 (moderate dysmenorrhoea) ¼ menstruation with
moderate pain with influence on daily activity and use of analgesics
for pain relief, and grade 3 (severe dysmenorrhoea) ¼ menstruation
with severe pain with significant limitation of daily activity, ineffective use of analgesics, and symptoms such as headache, tenderness,
nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Patients with pelvic pathology,
irregular cycles, systemic illness, married women and allergic to
NSAIDs and mild dysmenorrhoea were excluded.
After a clinical diagnosis of primary dysmenorrhoea, all patients
underwent certain investigations, including complete blood picture,
erythrocyte sedimentation rates, random blood sugar, complete urine
analysis and thyroid profile to exclude systemic illnesses. Pelvic ultrasound was done to exclude pelvic pathology and to confirm the diagnosis of primary dysmenorrhoea. Participants were informed not to take
any other medication to relieve menstrual pain during trial. Participants
taking any drug that can influence the study outcomes such as NSAIDs
and oral contraceptive pills will be excluded from the study.
Study setting
The study was carried out at the Department of Ilmul Qabalat wa
Amraze Niswan (Obstetrics and Gynaecology) of the National
Institute of Unani Medicine, Bangalore, India from February 2012 to
March 2013. The trial was performed in accordance with the
Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Ethics Committee of the
Institute (NIUM/IEC/2010-11/019/ANQ/01; CTRI/2014/08/004924). As
per the recommendation of ethical committee members, sample size
in control group was reduced to 15 patients.
Intervention
The dried roots and rhizomes of R. emodi Wall. ex Meissn. of family
Polygonaceae were provided by institute and identified by botanists at
FRLTH, Bangalore. The specimen voucher was retained and kept under
herbarium no. 10/UQ/RES/2013 at museum of the institute for future
reference. Rhubarb was finely powdered and filled in 500 mg capsules;
each capsule contained ~420 mg of powdered drug. The control drug
used in this trial was mefenamic acid 250 mg (Meftal-250, Blue Cross
Laboratories Ltd). Mefenamic acid (250 mg) was powdered and filled in
capsules similar to test drug. These capsules were prepared in the
pharmacy of National Institute of Unani Medicine, Bangalore.
After the purpose of the study was explained to the patients and
informed consent was obtained, patients were randomly divided into
two groups: to be administered with rhubarb and mefenamic acid. The
experimental group received three capsules of rhubarb twice a day
beginning two days before the menstruation and continuing until first
three days of menstruation for three consecutive cycles. This dosage
regimen was determined by referring the use of rhubarb for dysmenorrhoea by Unani scholars. Control group patients took capsules of
mefenamic acid three times a day after meal for the same protocol.
Outcomes
Primary outcome measures were change in severity and duration of
menstrual pain from baseline to last follow up. Secondary outcome

measures of the study were overall improvement in dysmenorrhoea
(measured by change in associated symptoms) and improvement in
quality of life (QOL).
Severity of pain was assessed by visual analogue scale (VAS)
and VMSS. VAS is commonly used validated scale due to its simplicity and reliability, containing a 10 cm line (0–10 defined as no pain
to worst pain). A higher score represents more severity. VMSS is
designed for four grades of severity as follows: grade 0 or painless
menstruation, grade 1 or mild dysmenorrhoea, grade 2 or moderate
dysmenorrhoea and grade 3 or severe dysmenorrhoea (described
above). Severity of dysmenorrhoea could be assessed by these two
scales with a significant correlation coefficient of 0.83 [26]. Duration
of pain was graded as grade 0 ¼ no pain, grade 1 ¼ pain persist for
less than 12 h, grade 2 ¼ 12–24 h and grade 3 ¼ > 24 h [27].
Overall improvement of dysmenorrhoea was measured by
improvement of associated symptoms. Assessments of associated
symptoms such as fatigue, nausea, vomiting, headache and anorexia were done from 0 to 3 grading system given by Karunagoda
et al., 0 indicates the absence of any symptom and 3 indicates the
symptom with severity [27]. The QOL was appraised by a scale
devised by the American Chronic Pain Association [28]. The scale
is graded from 0 to 10; 0 means non-functioning and 10 indicates
normal QOL. The scale is modified as suitable for the study [29].
Assessment of symptoms of dysmenorrhoea and QOL was done at
baseline and after three-cycle intervention.
Adverse reactions or events
The safety of the drug was assessed by serum glutamic oxaloacetic
transaminase (SGOT), serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT),
alkaline phosphatase, blood urea, serum creatinine and serum uric
acid at baseline and after three cycles of treatment. All the participants were requested to report any adverse effect during the trial such
as gastric upset, diarrhoea and constipation. Participants were also
requested to report any change in the menstrual cycle during the trial.
Randomization
Patients were randomized into 2:1 ration by simple randomization
(lottery method) to receive either rhubarb (i.e. experimental group,
n ¼ 30) or mefenamic acid (control group, n ¼ 15). Investigator
assigned the participants to interventions but the participants were
not aware about the treatment.
Blinding
This was a single-blind trial. The appearances of the experimental
and control drug capsules were identical, and no aroma was
detected from either; the participants were blinded to the treatment
allocation. To measure compliance, we asked patients to report the
number of capsules they have taken.
Data analysis
The statistical softwares (SAS 9.2, SPSS 15.0, Stata 10.1, MedCalc
9.0.1, Systat 12.0 and R environment ver.2.11.1) were used for the
analysis of the data. Descriptive and inferential statistical analysis
has been carried out in the present study. Significance was assessed
at 5% with 95% confidence interval.
Repeated measures analysis of variance (RMANOVA) has been
used to find the significance of study parameters between three or
more groups of patients; Student’s t-test (two-tailed, independent)
has been used to find the significance of study parameters on a
continuous scale between two groups (inter group analysis); and
Student’s t-tests (two-tailed, dependent) has been used to find the
significance within each group on metric parameters. Levene’s test
for homogeneity of variance has been performed to assess the
homogeneity of variance. The Mann–Whitney U-test has been used
to find the significance between two groups of parameters on noninterval scale. Chi-square/Fisher Exact test has been used to find the
significance of study parameters on a categorical scale between two
or more groups. Intention-to-treat analysis with the last observation
carried forward procedure was performed.
Results
Participants flow
A total of 115 participants of primary dysmenorrhoea were
screened during the study period. Out of which 55 participants refused to participate; 15 were excluded and the
rest of them (45) were randomized into experimental and
control groups. Three patients in the control group did
not come for last follow up; information regarding lost to
follow up was not obtained. The final analysis was conducted on 45 patients (Figure 1).
Recruitment
Eligible participants of dysmenorrhoea were recruited from
February 2012 to November 2012. Participants were visited
before intervention, at one month interval for 3 months
(during intervention), and one month after intervention. At
each follow up, the intensity and severity of pain, duration
of pain, systemic symptoms, working ability and amount
of bleeding were assessed for both the groups.
Baseline data
No significant difference was identified between the
experimental and control groups with regard to basic
demographic data (including age, age at menarche, family
history of dysmenorrhoea, dietary habits and BMI) and
investigations with p > 0.05 (Table 1). Thus the participants
were homogenous before intervention. In the present
study, 16 (53.33%) participants in the experimental group
and 10 (66.7%) participants in the control group were

having severe dysmenorrhoea, while 14 (46.67%) subjects
in the experimental group and 5 (33.33%) in the control
group were reported to have moderate dysmenorrhoea.
Primary outcome
The results of this study showed that there was no significant difference in severity of pain between the experimental and control groups with p ¼ 0.236. Both VAS and VMSS
were significantly reduced in two groups (Table 2). There
was also a significant reduction in duration of pain of both
groups (p< 0.001) after three-cycle intervention (Table 3).
Secondary outcome
In the present study, associated symptoms reported were
fatigue in 45 (100%), nausea in 38 (77.78%), vomiting in
19 (28.89%), diarrhoea in 4 (8.88%) and headache in 17
(37.78%) participants. These symptoms were significantly
reduced in both groups after treatment with p < 0.001
(Table 4). QOL of patients was also improved in two
groups after intervention (p< 0.001). The improvement
in QOL may be due to reduction of pain and improvement
in symptoms (Table 4).
Twenty-nine participants in the experimental group
and 13 participants in the control group were reported
reduced severity of pain. Duration of pain was decreased
in all patients in both groups. Overall improvement of
dysmenorrhoea was observed in 25 and 13 participants in
the experimental and control groups, respectively. QOL
was improved in 22 participants in the experimental
group and 13 participants in the control group (Table 5).
Harms
In the rhubarb group, six (20%) patients were given the
history of side effects out of which two patients complained bloating and four patients diarrhoea for the last
two days of last cycle. As diarrhoea and bloating were
mild and were not so much troubling, so the trial continued. No other side effects such as heart burn, abdominal pain and vomiting were reported by patients.

Discussion
The aetiology of primary dysmenorrhoea has been the
source of some debate. There are several theories; the
most popular is prostaglandins (PG) theory. PG, in particular, PGF2α, causes vasoconstriction and myometrial
contractions which leads to ischaemia and pain. NSAIDs
given at the times of menstruation inhibit cyclooxygenase
(COX) activity and reduce production and release of PG
[2, 4, 5, 7]. In the present study, R. emodi was found as
effective as mefenamic in relieving pain from primary
dysmenorrhoea. In a search of the literature, we found
no study that assessed the effects of R. emodi on
dysmenorrhoea, so it is not possible to draw any comparisons with other trials. The use of the herb in dysmenorrhoea has been based on traditional sources by Unani
scholars [22–24].
The cause of dysmenorrhoea according to Unani concept is an obstruction (sudda) in the flow of menstruation
which is formed by cold humour (Phlegm, black bile) and
weakness of expulsive power (quwate dafe’a) of uterus
[22, 24, 30]. A medicine that clears the obstruction and
accredits the expulsive power of the uterus is helpful in
alleviating pain. The temperament of rhubarb is hot and
dry in the second degree [23]. The dry temperament of
rhubarb enhances the expulsive power of the uterus, and

deobstruent (mufatteh sudad), emmenagogue (mudire
haiz) and demulcent (mulattif) properties of the drug are
helpful to clear the obstruction and make the blood to
flow easily through vessels and thus relieve pain [23, 31].
On the other hand rhubarb contains a number of
phenolic compounds such as sennosides, anthraquinones, stilbenes, glucose gallates, naphthalenes and
catechins [32]. Resveratrol is stilbene derivatives of R.
emodi possess to have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory
properties. Resveratrol reduces PG synthesis by acting on
arachoidonic acid release and expression of COX-2
enzyme [33]. Similarly, chrysophanol, an anthraquinone,
has shown anti-inflammatory activity and suppressed
lipopolysaccharides induced inflammatory response in
mouse peritoneal macrophages, i.e. TNF-α, IL-α and
expression of COX-2 enzyme [34]. Moreover, rhubarb
emodin was found to have analgesic, diuretic and vasorelaxant properties [35–37], and rhubarb tannins were
proved to have analgesic and haemostatic activities [19].
Diminished levels of nitric oxide (NO) induce myometrial contractions while NO causes uterine relaxation
[1, 5]. Thus R. emodi as a source of NO can be expected to
relax myometrial contractions in primary dysmenorrhoea.
Kounsar and Zargar studied NO synthetase activity of R.
emodi in murine macrophages, in a study. The authors
concluded that macrophages incubated with R. emodi
extract express high levels of iNOS (inducible nitric
oxide synthetase) and generate large amounts of NO in
a dose-dependent manner [38].
There were discrepancies concerning the medicinal
use of rhubarb since last decade. A number of animal
trials were conducted to confirm the safety of rhubarb so
that it can be used clinically without any harm [21,
39–41]. It was concluded from these trials that the toxic
effects of rhubarb are directly correlated with the drug
concentrations in target tissues. As it is known that there
is a relationship between the dose of a drug and the side
effects or toxicities. In the present study, the drug has
been used for short intervals, and all safety parameters
were within normal limits after three-cycle intervention,
hence it was found as safe medicine.
Although exact mechanism of R. emodi in reducing
the pain is not clear; however, it validates the claim of
Unani scholars that rhubarb can be used in patient with
dysmenorrhoea. Small sample size is the limitation of this
study. Large sample size and applications of indexes

such as PG index and cyclooxygenase index in plasma
before and after intervention are recommended for future
research. In addition, safety and efficacy of rhubarb on
various doses and exact mechanism of action of rhubarb
in dysmenorrhoea are also warranted.
Conclusions
Primary dysmenorrhoea involves more adolescence and
potentially be responsible for their poor academic performance and work absenteeism. In addition, most of
women do not report it, and untreated dysmenorrhoea
results in more socioeconomic consequences. This study
proves that use of rhubarb before two days of menstruation was found safe and effective remedy in abating
menstrual pain. It can serve as an alternate approach in
which cases, NSAIDs, are contraindicated or not tolerated. The results of this study deserve further
investigations.
