Abstract
The aim of this study was to
investigate the potential
mechanisms underlying the
efficacy of graded exercise
therapy for chronic fatigue
syndrome (CFS). Forty-nine
CFS patients were randomized
to a 12-week graded exercise
programme or to standard
medical care. At the end of
treatment the exercise group
rated themselves as significantly
more improved and less
fatigued than the control group.
A decrease in symptom
focusing rather than an increase
in fitness mediated the
treatment effect. Graded
exercise appears to be an
effective treatment for CFS and
it operates in part by reducing
the degree to which patients
focus on their symptoms.

CHRONIC fatigue syndrome (CFS) is characterized by ongoing, debilitating fatigue, and a range
of other symptoms such as headaches, sleep
disturbance, neuropsychiatric difficulties and
muscle pain (Fukuda et al., 1994). The illness has
a serious impact on the everyday functioning of
patients and results in high levels of medical
consumption and problems with work. Data
collected from tertiary care settings suggest that
left untreated, less than 10 per cent of adults with
CFS return to pre-morbid levels of functioning,
and most patients remain functionally impaired.
To date, the aetiology of CFS remains unclear.
Factors such as viruses, immune system and
hypothalamic pituitary axis dysfunction have
been implicated in the disorder, but no
consistent evidence has been produced for a
single biological cause (Moss-Morris & Petrie,
2000). In recent years cognitive behavioural
models have been proposed which hypothesize
that an interaction between cognitive and behavioural factors perpetuates fatigue and disability
in CFS (Surawy, Hackmann, Hawton, & Sharpe,
1995; Wessely, Butler, Chalder, & David, 1991).
These models propose that in the recovery
period following a physiological stressor such as
a virus, people may experience symptoms of
inactivity or deconditioning such as fatigue and
muscle aches as they begin to return to normal
levels of activity. People who go on to develop
CFS have a tendency to interpret these symptoms as signs of ongoing illness, and in response
reduce activity further, resulting in a downward
spiral of bursts of activity followed by periods of
symptom induced inactivity. Over time these
patients develop the belief that they have an
ongoing, serious and uncontrollable illness. They
believe that too much activity is harmful for
symptoms and that the only way to manage their
illness is to accommodate to the condition.
Support for this model comes from a recent
systematic review of treatments for CFS, which
concluded that the most promising findings have
been from studies that provided cognitive
and/or behavioural interventions. High quality
randomized controlled trials of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) have shown beneficial
results for patients which are sustained over
time (Deale, Chalder, Marks, & Wessely, 1997;
Prins et al., 2001; Sharpe et al., 1996). However,
CBT requires skilled therapist attention, which
reduces its feasibility in many health settings.
Graded exercise therapy, a behaviourally
based intervention, has also been shown to be
effective. Graded exercise relies less on the
availability of skilled therapists, making it a
more accessible and possibly cost-effective
option. The aim of this therapy is to encourage
the patient gradually to increase exercise with
the emphasis placed on consistency. Initial exercise intensity and duration are prescribed at a
level that is determined to be safe and unlikely
to exacerbate symptoms in the patient. In turn,
the patient is encouraged to decrease the degree
to which he or she monitors symptoms to determine activity levels (Fulcher & White, 1998).
To date three published randomized
controlled trials conducted in the United
Kingdom (UK), have shown benefits for graded
exercise as a treatment for CFS (Fulcher &
White, 1997; Powell, Bentall, Nye, & Edwards,
2001; Wearden et al., 1998). A Manchesterbased study showed that exercise was effective
in reducing fatigue six months after the intervention, but showed no effect on disability
scores and had a relatively high drop-out rate
(Wearden et al., 1998). A London-based study
showed that exercise was effective in reducing
both fatigue and physical disability, but CFS
patients with clinically significant levels of
anxiety and depression were excluded from the
study. As around 25–40 per cent of CFS patients
can be expected to have a comorbid anxiety or
depressive condition, it is difficult to generalize
these results to the wider CFS population. The
most recent study of exercise therapy conducted
in Liverpool had particularly convincing results.
At one-year follow-up, CFS patients receiving
the graded exercise treatment showed significant improvements in fatigue, mood, sleep and
disability. However, this exercise trial included
a substantial cognitive and educational
component so it is difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of the exercise on its own.
Although we now have good evidence to
suggest that graded exercise is an effective intervention for at least some CFS patients, the
mechanisms behind its efficacy remain unclear.
One possibility is that graded exercise improves
physical fitness, thus reducing symptoms of
deconditioning and preventing the ongoing
downward spiral of symptom monitoring and
activity reduction. There is certainly evidence
that CFS patients show a decreased exercise

capacity when compared to sedentary controls
(de Becker, Rocykens, Reynders, McGregor, &
de Mierleir, 2000; Fulcher & White, 2000) and
that decreased fitness in CFS patients is related
to fatigue and physical impairment (Bazelmans,
Bleijenberg, van der Meer, & Folgering, 2001).
However, this hypothesis may be overly simplistic, as Fulcher and White (1997) found that selfreported improvement following exercise
therapy was not related to improvements in
physical fitness or strength.
An alternative hypothesis is that gradual
increases in exercise help to alter patients’
beliefs about their symptoms and illness. A
number of studies have shown that CFS
patients’ negative perceptions of their illness,
their tendency to focus excessively on their
symptoms and their beliefs that decreasing
activity is the way to control symptoms are
related to increased fatigue and disability
(Heijmans, 1998; Moss-Morris & Petrie, 2001;
Moss-Morris, Petrie & Weinman, 1996; Ray,
Jefferies, & Weir, 1997; Silver et al., 2002).
Graduated exercise may enable patients to be
reassured that activity is not harmful and does
not exacerbate symptoms. It may also help to
alter control beliefs, thereby increasing their
confidence to undertake other daily activities and
reducing their levels of fatigue and disability.
The principal aim of the current study was to
investigate the potential mechanisms or mediators of the efficacy of graded exercise in CFS in
a randomized controlled trial. There were two,
not necessarily mutually exclusive hypotheses.
The first was that graded exercise would lead to
a reduction in fatigue and disability through an
increase in physiological fitness. The second was
that graded exercise would lead to a reduction
in fatigue and disability through decreasing
patients’ tendencies to focus on their symptoms,
by increasing their beliefs that exercise can help
to control symptoms and by decreasing their
illness identity or the number of symptoms they
ascribe to their CFS. We also wanted to investigate the effectiveness of a graded exercise intervention in a New Zealand sample of CFS
patients. To date all the graded exercise trials
have been conducted in the UK. To determine
the generalizability of the findings, patients with
and without comorbid psychopathology were
included.
Method
Participants
Participants were recruited from a specialist
CFS private general practice in Auckland, New
Zealand. The general practice advertised the
fact that the University of Auckland was
running a graded exercise study. Patients who
were interested in participating contacted the
investigators directly. For this reason a response
rate could not be obtained.
Patients were eligible if they met the US
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
criteria for CFS (Fukuda et al., 1994) and if they
were between 18 and 65 years of age. Patients
who were unable to undergo exercise testing for
medical reasons or who were already performing a consistent and regular exercise programme
were excluded from the study. Patients with a
concurrent anxiety and depressive disorder
were included. Anxiety and depression levels
were assessed at baseline using the Hospital
Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)
(Zigmond & Snaith, 1983).
Our power analysis to determine the number
of participants was based on an effect size of .76
calculated from Fulcher and White’s (2000)
graded exercise study. With power = .80 and
alpha = .05, we needed 27 patients in each
group.
Fifty-one patients volunteered to participate
in the study. All of these patients met CDC
criteria for CFS as assessed by the specialist
general practitioner and labelled themselves as
such. Two of these patients were excluded from
the trial, one because she was already exercising
three times a week for 30 minutes or more and
another because he was obese and deemed a
medical risk for exercise testing. Of the 49
patients eligible to participate, 70.9 per cent
were female, and 22.4 per cent were unemployed and unable to work due to disability.
Ages ranged from 19 to 60 years (mean age 40.9
years). The median duration of illness was 3.08
years, ranging from 6 months to 45 years.
Outcome measures
Global rating of improvement The primary
outcome measure was the participants’ selfratings of improvement, based on a measure of
overall change. This measure has been used in
previous studies examining the effects of a

graded exercise intervention for people with
CFS (Fulcher & White, 1997; Powell, 2001).
Participants are asked to respond to the question ‘how would you rate the change in your
CFS in the last three months?’ by indicating
their response from seven possible scores
ranging from ‘very much worse’ to ‘very much
better’. In accordance with Fulcher and White
(1997) responses were recoded into two variables where responses of ‘very much better’ or
‘much better’ were rated as being indicative of
clinical improvement and all other responses as
showing no improvement.
CFS-related impairment The 14-item Fatigue
Scale was selected to assess improvements in
CFS-related fatigue. The Fatigue Scale was
designed specifically for use with CFS patients,
and assesses both mental and physical fatigue. It
has been used in all the previous studies examining the efficacy of exercise programmes for CFS
(Fulcher & White, 1997; Powell et al., 2001;
Wearden et al., 1998) and has good reliability
and validity (Chalder et al., 1993). The 0, 1, 2, 3
scoring system was used in the current study.
The physical functioning subscale of the Short
Form Health Questionnaire (SF-36) was used to
measure physical functioning. The SF-36 has
been validated on the New Zealand population
and has good internal reliability and stability
(Scott, Tobias, Safarti, & Haslett, 1999).
Mediating variables
Physiological assessments In order to assess
physical fitness, each participant underwent
incremental exercise testing to determine
maximum aerobic capacity (VO2 peak) on a
motorized treadmill. Testing was conducted by
a research assistant blind to treatment
condition. Following a brief warm-up on the
treadmill, the walking protocol began at an
initial intensity of 4 metabolic equivalents
(METS; 1 MET equalling resting energy expenditure) and increased 1 MET every 2 minutes
until maximal effort was achieved. Using METS
meant that exercise could be adjusted with
reference to the participant’s weight while maintaining a steady increase. Throughout the test,
expired gas was analysed for percentages of
oxygen and carbon dioxide, and minute ventilation to give the peak oxygen consumption
(L/min) using a Schiller CS100 metabolic
analyser. Participants wore a polar heart rate
monitor during the test, and HR was recorded
every 30 seconds. Due to the fact that few
subjects were capable of achieving their agepredicted maximal heart rate or a plateau in
oxygen consumption at peak workload, we were
unable to achieve a true physiological VO2 max.
Instead VO2 peak, which measures the highest
single oxygen consumption measurement, was
used in the present study. While this measurement underestimates the subject’s physiological
maximum, it does represent the highest level of
activity they are able to achieve.
The modified Borg scale was used to measure
the rates of participants’ perceived exertion
(RPE) throughout the exercise test. Participants
were asked to rate their perception of effort
required on a 10-point scale at 2-minute intervals throughout the test until maximal perceived
effort (10) was reached.
Illness beliefs The Illness Perceptions Questionnaire-Revised (IPQ-R) (Moss-Morris et al.,
2002) was used to ascertain whether change in
patients’ beliefs about their CFS mediates the
relationships between exercise therapy and
outcome. The subscales of the IPQ and IPQ-R
(Moss-Morris, 1997; Moss-Morris & Chalder,
2003; Moss-Morris et al., 1996) have been shown
to be associated with both fatigue and disability
in CFS. Three of the subscales that were hypothesized to change following graded exercise
therapy were included. The identity section
assesses the degree to which patients identify
symptoms they experience as being related to
their illness. Treatment control assesses the
degree to which patients believe their treatment
helps to control their symptoms while personal
control measures how much control patients
feel they themselves have over the illness.
Symptom focusing This potential mediator
was measured using the focusing on symptoms
subscale of the Illness Management Questionnaire (Ray, Weir, Stewart, Miller, & Hyde,
1993). The questionnaire was designed specifically for CFS patients and has been shown to
have good psychometric properties. Examples
of items include, ‘I think a great deal about my
symptoms’, ‘I pay close attention to how well or
badly I am feeling’ and ‘you have to realize you
are helpless in the face of this illness’. Previous

research has indicated that symptom focusing is
related to fatigue levels in CFS (Ray, Jefferies,
& Weir, 1995).
Procedure
The Auckland Ethics Committee granted
ethical approval for the study. Once patients
provided informed consent, they were randomized into either the treatment or control
conditions by means of a sequence of computer
generated random numbers placed in sealed,
opaque envelopes by an independent administrator. Patients in the control group received
standard medical care from their CFS specialist
physician, while patients in the treatment group
received 12 weeks of graded exercise therapy.
Three of the 25 patients dropped out of treatment and 3 of the 24 control patients did not
return follow-up questionnaires at 12 weeks. Of
the patients who dropped out of treatment, one
patient stated she was doing well in the
programme but had unexpectedly to return
home to the United States. Another injured his
calf and decided not to continue while the third
could not be contacted at the time of follow-up.
Consequently, 88 per cent of both groups
completed the fitness assessment and self-report
questionnaires at baseline and at 12 weeks (the
end of the treatment period). Patients were also
sent a 6-month follow-up self-report questionnaire (42 weeks after the baseline assessment).
Sixteen exercise patients (73 per cent of
completers) returned this questionnaire and 17
(81%) of the controls.
Following the completion of the baseline
assessments, patients in the intervention group
met with one of the researchers (CS or RT) for
an initial one-hour interview. The rationale
behind the graded exercise programme was
explained using an adapted version of the cognitive behavioural model of CFS. The model
focused on the downward spiral of activity
reduction, physical deconditioning and symptoms. An individual plan for starting the exercise programme was then developed. The target
heart rate for each participant was initially set at
40 per cent of VO2max (approximately 50 per
cent max HR) attained on the treadmill test, to
be maintained for 10–15 minutes 4 to 5 times a
week.
Exercise goals were set collaboratively
between the researcher and participant. Initial
exercise intensity and duration were set at a
level that had been identified during exercise
testing as achievable and unlikely to exacerbate
symptoms in the patient. The importance of
consistently meeting but not exceeding exercise
targets was emphasized so that the amount of
exercise undertaken each day was not dependent on symptoms. Participants were issued
with a polar heart rate monitor to assess heart
rate during exercise sessions. The heart rate
monitor served two purposes. It assisted participants to meet but not exceed the prescribed
intensity levels, and also provided external
monitoring which reduced the likelihood of
focusing on, and adjusting exercise intensity in
response to bodily symptoms.
Researchers and participants met weekly
over a period of 12 weeks to assess progress,
provide encouragement and set new exercise
goals. During the first six weeks increases
focused on duration of exercise rather than
intensity. Increases generally involved duration
increases of three to five minutes per week.
After six weeks, intensity of exercise was gradually increased, aiming for heart rate increases of
approximately five beats/minute per week. This
gradual increase in intensity was selected to
improve subject compliance and confidence,
based on the fact that large or sudden increases
in exercise intensity induced anxiety and breathlessness in many subjects during baseline
testing. The final goal was for each participant
to be exercising for approximately 30 minutes
for 5 days per week at an intensity level relating
to 80 per cent of their expected maximum heart
rate (70 per cent of VO2max).
Both the exercise and the control groups
received standard medical care. All patients
consulted with the same specialist general practitioner for their CFS. This practitioner offers
both individual consultation on an ‘as needed
basis’ and education sessions on how to manage
issues such as diet, stress and CFS symptoms.
Data analysis
All data analyses were conducted on SPSS
version 10. Differences between the groups at
time one were tested using independent samples
t-tests, Mann Whitney U and chi-squared
analysis depending on the nature of the data.
Differences between the groups on the key
binary outcome, self-rated improvement, were

assessed using chi-square analysis. The number
needed to treat (NNT) calculation was based on
the risk difference of self-rated improved versus
not improved participants in each of the groups.
Analysis of the outcome data included a
completer analysis as well as an analysis on an
intention-to-treat basis. Because the key aim of
this research was to test mediation, both main
effects for group at the completion of treatment
and mediation effects were tested using multiple
linear regression. Possible baseline differences
between the two groups were controlled for by
entering baseline variables into the regression
analyses. Repeated measures analysis was used
to determine whether changes were maintained
at the six-month follow-up point.
Results
Testing for group equivalence
on the demographic
characteristics
Before testing the study’s hypotheses, comparisons were made to determine whether the two
groups were equivalent with regards to their
demographic and psychological characteristics.
Table 1 shows that the exercise group were
significantly younger on average than the
control group. Age was also significantly correlated with three of the four outcome variables
with r = .41 (p < .01) for physical fatigue, r = .43
(p < .01) for mental fatigue and r = –.34 (p < .01)
for the SF-36 physical functioning subscale.
Consequently age was controlled for in the
regression analyses testing for group differences
on the outcome variables and for mediation
effects.
Although there were no statistically significant differences between the groups with
regards to length of illness, level of education
and gender the data presented in Table 1 show
that the control group appeared to have been ill
for somewhat longer than the exercise group
and that there were more women in this group.
However, gender and length of illness were not
deemed to be potential confounding factors as
there were no significant correlations (r < .10)
between gender, length of illness and any of the
outcome variables.
We also compared the groups on their levels
of anxiety and depression. Table1 shows that
there were no statistically significant differences
between the groups on either the anxiety or
depression subscales of the HADS. Using the
recommended cut-off (Zigmond & Snaith,
1983) our data showed that 56 per cent of the
total sample were either possible or probable
cases of psychiatric disorder. With regards to
depression, eight participants (three exercise
and five controls) fell into the possible depressive disorder category and six (two exercise and
four controls) fell into the probable depressive
disorder category. This suggests that 30 per cent
of the total sample were either possible or probable cases of depression, with probable cases
making up 13 per cent. With regards to anxiety,
thirteen (eight exercise and five controls)
participants fell into the possible anxiety
disorder category and six (two exercise and four
controls) into the probable anxiety disorder
category. This suggests that as many as 42 per
cent of the sample were either possible or probable cases of anxiety disorder, with probable
cases making up 13 per cent.
Treatment outcome
Our main outcome was the dichotomized selfrated clinical global impression scale. Twelve of
the 22 (54.5%) patients who completed the exercise programme rated themselves as ‘much’ or
‘very much’ better compared with 5 (23.8%) of
the controls. Cross-tabulation using chi-squared

showed that this difference was statistically
significant 2 = 4.25 (p = .04); NNT = 1/(.55–.24)
= 3.2.
We were also interested in determining the
acceptability of the graded exercise therapy to
the CFS patients. At the end of treatment 68 per
cent of the exercise patients rated their exercise
therapy as ‘effective’ or ‘highly effective’ and
the same number rated their exercise treatment
as ‘better’ or ‘very much better’ than any other
treatment they had received to date.
The group means before and after the 12-
week exercise period for fatigue and physical
functioning are presented in Table 2. Four
separate multiple linear regression analyses
were used to ascertain whether there were any
statistically significant main effects for group on
outcome. The outcome or criterion variables
were physical and mental fatigue, total fatigue
and the SF-36 physical functioning score. The
predictor variables entered into all of these
analyses were group (dummy coded as 0 for
exercise and 1 for controls), age and the baseline score for the particular criterion variable.
After controlling for age and possible baseline
differences between the two groups, group was
a significant predicator in three out of the four
regression analyses (see the group standardized
beta-weights from these analyses in Table 2).
The exercise group scored significantly lower on
physical, mental and total fatigue than the
control group after the 12-week exercise period.
There was no statistically significant effect for
group on physical functioning although the
exercise group did report higher levels of
physical functioning after treatment than did
the controls.
Comparability of the current
data with previous exercise
trials
The graded exercise protocol used in our study
was based on Fulcher and White’s (1997)
protocol. Consequently, we used the outcome
data from their completers to ascertain the
comparability of our treatment effect. Table 3
demonstrates that both our study and the
Fulcher and White study reported that 55 per
cent of patients rated themselves as significantly
better at the end of the graded exercise treatment. Single samples t-tests demonstrated that
the sample from our study was significantly less

Fulcher and White sample but the samples were
equivalent on their SF-36 physical functioning
scores.
Intention-to-treat analysis
To determine whether drop-outs affected the
treatment effects, we completed an intention-totreat analysis. Patients with missing data were
counted as non-improvers on the clinical global
impression change score. Time two scores on
the other outcome measures were obtained by
substituting the missing data with the scores
obtained at time one.
Intention-to-treat analysis showed that there
was still a statistically significant effect for group
on the global impression change score (χ2 =
4.25; p = .05) with 48 per cent of the exercise
group rating themselves as ‘much’ or ‘very much
better’ compared to 21 per cent of controls.
Multiple regression analyses showed that group
remained a statistically significant predictor of
physical fatigue at time two (β = .30; p = .03).
There was also a strong trend for the effect of
group on mental fatigue (β = .27; p = .06). The
effect for group on physical functioning
remained non-significant (β = –.04; p = .76).
Six-month follow-up data
Six-month follow-up questionnaires were
returned by 77 per cent of the completers (67
per cent of the people who initially entered the
study). At this time point 54 per cent of the exercise group rated themselves as ‘much’ or ‘very
much’ better compared with 28 per cent of the
controls. Figure 1 presents the data for the other
outcome measures at the three time points. The
Figure shows that the exercise group maintained the gains they had made at the end of
treatment. A 2 (group)  3 (time) repeated

time interaction for physical fatigue was statistically significant suggesting that the exercise
group were still less physically fatigued at six

.05). However, the group by time interactions
for mental fatigue (F = 1.43; p < .25) and
physical functioning were not statistically
significant (F = 1.08; p < .35).
The effect of exercise treatment
on the potential mediators
Multiple regression analysis was used to determine whether exercise treatment had an effect
on the proposed cognitive and physiological
mediators included in the study. In these analyses, group, age and the relevant baseline variable were entered as predictors and the time
two variable was used as the criterion. Table 4
shows the means for these variables across the
groups at baseline and after the 12-week treatment period, and the standardized beta weights
for the group effect in each of the regressions.
The exercise group was significantly less likely
to focus on their symptoms after treatment than
were the controls. However, group had no effect
on patients’ control beliefs or their illness
identity.
There were also no statistically significant
group effects for the physiological variables,

including the maximum heart rate achieved, the
percentage of the predicted maximum heart
rate and VO2 peak. However, the physiological
data need to be treated with caution, as
complete data were only available for just over
half of the sample. This was due to the fact that
ten patients refused to have a second test as they
believed the initial test was harmful to them, five
failed to continue until they perceived themselves to have reached maximal effort, making
their data invalid and the data from two patients
could not be used due to equipment failure.
One way of dealing with the lack of power
owing to missing data is to compute the effect

size of group on the physiological variables. We
computed a partial Eta square for each of the
physiological outcomes. The effect size for VO2
peak was .03, for heart rate achieved .09 and for
heart rate predicted .11. The effect of group on
symptom focusing which was found to be significant was also .11. The conventional cut-offs for
small, medium and large values for partial Eta
square are .01, .06 and .14, respectively. Consequently, the effect size for heart rate predicted
was considered to be large enough to include in
the mediation analysis.
Taken together these data suggest that the
only variables that could be tested for mediation
were symptom focusing and heart rate as a
requirement for testing mediation is the existence of a significant relationship between the
independent variable (in this case group) and
the mediator (symptom focusing and heart rate)
(Baron & Kenny, 1986).
Testing mediation effects
Mediation was tested according to the guidelines published by Baron and Kenny (1996).
These guidelines specify that the dependent
variable (DV) (fatigue) needs to be regressed on
the independent variable (IV) (group) and the
mediating variable (MV) (symptom focusing) in
two separate linear regressions. If both the IV
and the MV are significant in these separate
regressions, mediation can be tested in a third
regression whereby both the IV and the MV
compete for the variance in the DV. If the effect
of the IV is no longer significant but the MV
retains its significance, mediation is deemed to
have occurred.
The data from the series of regressions
conducted for change in heart rate and then
change in symptom focusing on physical fatigue
are presented in Table 5. With regards to
symptom focusing, both group and change in
symptom focusing were independent predictors
of physical fatigue in the first two linear regressions. Examination of the beta weights in the
third regression showed that both variables
remained statistically significant, although the
effect for symptom focusing was greater than
the effect for group. This suggests that partial
mediation occurred, but that exercise treatment
and a decrease in symptom focusing both have
an independent effect on physical fatigue.
A similar pattern was found for change in
heart rate, with the beta weights in the final
regression showing a significant effect for
change in heart rate but not for group, suggesting a stronger mediation effect. The beta
weights for heart rate were in a negative direction suggesting that an increase in heart rate on

the second treadmill test was the mediator of
change. At first glance this finding appears to be
somewhat contradictory. Usually increased
fitness is associated with a decrease in maximal
heart rate not an increase. The fact that heart
rate increased in the exercise group suggests
that the change in heart rate was a psychological
rather than a physiological response. It may be
that patients altered their perceptions in the
second test and were able to push themselves to
a greater extent.
Table 6 shows true mediation effects for both
the mediators on mental fatigue. Group, change
in symptom focusing and change in heart rate
were independent predictors of mental fatigue
in the first two series of linear regressions. In the
final linear regressions a decrease in symptom
focusing and an increase in heart rate across the
programme remained statistically significant but
group was no longer significant.
If patients change their illness
beliefs and get fitter, do they
get greater benefit from the
exercise therapy?
Although the intervention did not have a significant effect on fitness or illness beliefs, we were
interested to determine whether change in these
variables could still predict a better outcome. In
other words if patients in the exercise group did
alter their beliefs or get fitter did they do better
than those who did not?
In order to answer this question, we
computed change scores by subtracting baseline
scores from the scores obtained at the end of
treatment for the cognitive and physiological
variables as well as for the fatigue variables and
physical functioning. We then computed correlations between change in the proposed mediators and change in outcome for the exercise
group. Table 7 shows that decreasing symptom
focusing and increasing beliefs in treatment
control were significantly correlated with
decreased mental and physical fatigue,
increased physical functioning and a higher
global rating of change. Increasing personal
control beliefs was significantly correlated with
a decrease in both mental and physical fatigue.
Change in illness identity was not significantly
related to change in outcome but there was a
strong trend suggesting that patients who
changed their perceptions about the number of
symptoms associated with their condition also
decreased their fatigue scores and rated themselves as significantly better after treatment.
With regards to the physiological data, an
increase in fitness was non-significantly related
to an improvement in both mental and physical

improvement in physical functioning. In accordance with the mediation data, patients whose
maximal heart rate and percentage of predicted
maximal heart rate increased at the follow-up
assessment showed a significantly greater reduction in fatigue and improvement in physical
functioning.
Discussion
The results from this study suggest that a simple
graded exercise intervention is a more effective
treatment for CFS than standard medical care
on its own. Between 50 to 55 per cent of CFS
patients reported that they were much or very
much better after the 12 weeks of exercise
therapy compared to 24 per cent of controls.
The intervention produced a statistically significant reduction in patients’ physical and mental
fatigue and these gains were maintained six
months post-treatment. Patients in the intervention group also improved their levels of
physical functioning, but not significantly more
than the standard care control group. The lack
of significant findings in this area may be related
to the small sample size. Alternately, it may be
that exercise therapy is a more effective treatment for fatigue rather than disability. Wearden
et al. (1998) also reported changes in fatigue
rather than disability in their CFS graded exercise trial.
Comparisons with Fulcher and White’s (1997)
data at the end of their 12-week treatment
period suggests that the gains made in the
current study were equivalent to those of this
earlier study in relation to global ratings of
improvement and physical disability. The
improvements in fatigue appeared to be even
greater in the current study. However, patients
in the Fulcher and White (1997) study continued
to improve over the six-month follow-up period,
while the patients in the current study only
maintained their improvements. The lack of
continued improvement may be a ceiling effect
in the current study in that the mean fatigue
score at end of treatment was less than 14, the
recommended cut-off for case level of fatigue.
Alternatively, it maybe that around 40 per cent
of patients in the current study had a probable
comorbid anxiety or depressive disorder.
Fulcher and White (1997) excluded patients
with a concurrent depressive and anxiety
disorder. Dysphoria measured by the HADS
has been shown to predict poor outcome following exercise treatment (Bentall, Powell, Nye, &
Edwards, 2002).
The results from this study also suggest that
one of the key mechanisms of change during
graded exercise therapy is a reduction in the
extent to which patients focus on their symptoms. Patients in the exercise treatment significantly reduced the amount they focused on their
symptoms, but there was no change on this variable in the control group. A reduction in
symptom focusing was strongly associated with
a reduction in mental and physical fatigue. It
was also related to the self-rated global
improvement score and to an increase in
physical functioning. This finding is in accordance with a study on CBT for CFS, which
showed that CBT was associated with a reduction in beliefs about the harmful effects of exercise and that this reduction was associated with
improved outcome (Deale, Chalder, & Wessely,
1998).
Whereas CBT is geared towards directly
identifying and challenging fear beliefs, the use

of heart rate monitors in exercise interventions
may provide an alternative medium for altering
symptom focusing and fear beliefs. In this trial,
patients were instructed to use the heart rate
monitor, rather than their symptoms, as an
external cue to decide whether they were exercising within a safe range.
Graded exercise therapy appeared to be less
effective in altering patients’ control beliefs or
their illness identity. However, if patients did
alter these beliefs they did substantially better.
Increasing the perception that the illness can be
controlled was associated with a statistically
significant change in fatigue and disability.
There was also a trend suggesting that patients
who decreased the number of symptoms associated with their CFS also decreased their fatigue
levels and rated themselves as significantly
better after treatment. These data suggest that
including a cognitive element in the exercise
therapy aimed at challenging control and
identity beliefs may help to maximize the treatment effect. This idea is further supported by
the findings from the Liverpool exercise trial,
which reported particularly impressive
improvements in their treatment group (Powell
et al., 2001). This may be due to the inclusion of
structured exercises that helped patients to
challenge their negative beliefs about symptoms
(Powell, 2001).
With regards to the physiological data, the
lack of an increase in aerobic fitness following
exercise therapy was unexpected. A similar
training programme in CFS patients did manage
to show an improvement in fitness (Fulcher &
White, 1997). However, three things may help to
explain this discrepancy. First, many patients
terminated their VO2 max test for reasons other
than maximal effort. As a result less than 25 per
cent of VO2 max tests achieved a true maximum,
as defined by physiological responses (Baldi
et al., 2003). Consequently, we used VO2 peak
as our measure of fitness. Furthermore, many
patients refused to repeat the max test after
their intervention, resulting in a large percentage of missing data. Thus, our VO2 peak data
may not accurately reflect adaptations to the
training protocol. Second, it was also noted that
many subjects had an exaggerated heart rate
response to the initial stages of the incremental
exercise test, which plateaued during the later
stages of the test. While the reasons for this are
not known, the ‘normal’ response to incremental exercise is a linear increase in heart rate. As
a result, prescribed exercise intensities, which
were calculated as a percentage of maximum
heart rate, may have represented a lower
relative intensity than expected, which may
explain a lack of improvement in aerobic fitness.
Third, the first six weeks of our programme
focused predominantly on consistency of exercise and it was only in the latter six weeks that
intensity was increased. This gentle approach
may be important in reducing exercise-related
fears in that only 12 per cent of patients dropped
out of the treatment. However, it may mean that
exercise programmes should be extended a
further 6 weeks so that patients have a 12-week
period where they work on upgrading their
intensity of exercise.
Although there was not an overall effect for
fitness, a proportion of patients did get fitter and
there was some evidence that this was associated with greater reductions in fatigue and
improvements in physical functioning. The
strongest association was with physical functioning. This finding was also reported by
Fulcher and White (2000) suggesting that
physical fitness may be more important in terms
of increasing physical capacity than decreasing
fatigue.
The physiological change variable that
appeared to be most important in terms of treatment response in this study was heart rate. An
increase in percentage predicted maximal heart
rate after the intervention was found to mediate
the group effect on fatigue, particularly mental
fatigue. Patients who achieved a higher maximal
heart rate on the second test also showed
statistically significant improvements in functioning and rated themselves as much improved.
This suggests that improvement may be related
to an increased ability to exert themselves on
the second test. The fact that many patients
failed to reach true maximum suggests that fear
of exertion may be a problem. Reducing this
fear through graded exercise may be reflected in
an increase in the maximal heart rate achieved.
Certain limitations of the study should be
noted. The sample size was smaller than anticipated which could have affected our power to
detect significant differences and to test for
mediation. Recruitment was severely handicapped by the appearance of an Australian

article in the lay CFS literature suggesting that
exercise therapy for CFS patients was harmful
and should be avoided. As all the patients were
volunteers, they may reflect a small proportion
of patients who are prepared to engage in the
therapy. The exercise testing proved to be
particularly difficult with this population
suggesting that future studies may be better to
rely on submaximal tests to collect more
complete and accurate fitness data.
Despite these limitations, this study adds to
the growing body of literature suggesting that
graded exercise therapy is an effective treatment for CFS. It appears to have a particularly
significant impact on fatigue and global ratings
of improvement and less impact on physical
functioning. The key mechanism for improvement appears to be psychological rather than
physiological. A reduction in symptom focusing
and an increased ability to exert oneself were
significant mediators of the treatment effect.
Using heart rate monitors may help to facilitate
this process. Improving aerobic fitness appears
to be less important as treatments gains were
made independently of improvements in
aerobic fitness. However, if patients do get
fitter, they appear to make significant improvements in their physical functioning.
