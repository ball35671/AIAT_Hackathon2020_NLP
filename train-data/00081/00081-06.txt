Background The Joint Working
Group ofthe Royal Colleges of Physicians,
Psychiatrists and General Practitioners
(1996) recommended graded exercise and
antidepressants for patients with chronic
fatigue syndrome.We assessed efficacy
and acceptability ofthese treatments.
Method Six-month prospective
randomised placebo and therapist contact
time controlled trial with allocation to one
offour treatment cells: exercise and
20 mg fluoxetine, exercise and placebo
drug, appointments only and 20 mg
fluoxetine, appointments and placebo
drug. Drug treatment was double blind
and patients were blind to assignment to
exercise or appointments.
Results Ninety-six (71%) of I36
patients completed the trial. Patients were
more likely to drop out ofexercise than
non-exercise treatment (P=0.05). In an
intention to treat analysis, exercise
resulted in fewer patients with case level
fatigue than appointments only at 26
weeks (12 (18%) v. 4 (6%) respectively
P=0.025) and improvement in functional
work capacity at 12 (P=0.005) and 26
weeks (P=0.03). Fluoxetine had a
significant effect on depression at week 12
only (P=0.04). Exercise significantly
improved health perception (P=O.O12)
and fatigue (P=0.028) at 28 weeks.
Conclusions Graded exercise
produced improvements in functional
workcapacity and fatigue, while fluoxet~ne
improved depression only.

The Joint Working Group of the Royal
Colleges of Physicians, Psychiatrists and
General Practitioners Report (1996) advocated the use of antidepressants in depressed chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS)
patients and graded exercise in all CFS
patients. A controlled trial of fluoxetine
found no benefit in chronically ill CFS
patients (Vercoulen et al, 1996) in contrast
to some open trials of antidepressants
(Butler et al, 1991; Behan et al, 1994;
White & Cleary, 1997). Graded exercise
improved fatigue and physiological outcomes in CFS patients without psychiatric
or sleep disorders compared to flexibility
exercises (Fulcher & White, 1997). The aim
of the present study was to determine the
efficacy and adherence to six months'
treatment with fluoxetine and a graded
exercise programme, prescribed and supervised by a physiotherapist, in CFS outpatients with or without depression. Both
treatments are simple to administer and
readily available in most hospitals.
METHOD
The trial was approved by the South
Manchester Medical Ethics Committee.
Patients gave written informed consent.
Patients
Patients over 18 years of age were recruited
from consecutive referrals to a university
department of medicine out-patient clinic
drawing from across north-west England
and north Wales between June 1993 and
March 1995. All patients were medically
assessed by a doctor (R.M., P.S. and D.P.)
under the supervision of a consultant
physician (D.P.). A full history, physical
examination and laboratory investigations
(full blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation
rate, biochemistry, creatinine phosphokinase, c-reactive protein and immunological
screen including thyroid antibodies) were
carried out.
All subjects met operationalised 'Oxford' research criteria (Sharpe et al, 1991)
for CFS: (a) a principal complaint of fatigue
of at least six months' duration, exacerbated by physical activity (and usually
mental activity); (b) impairment in three
out of four areas of activity (activities of
daily living, occupational, social or leisure
activities); (c) no medical cause of fatigue.
Subjects with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, eating disorder, alcohol or illicit
drug misuse, those with current suicidal
ideation, a history of ischaemic heart
disease or an inability to read and write
English were excluded.
Pre-menopausal women were required
to take precautions against pregnancy
during the trial. Subjects taking antidepressant medication were required to stop and
undergo at least a two week washout
period before entering the trial. Antidepressants were not withdrawn (and patients
were excluded from the trial) if patients
were judged to have any significant suicidal
risk.
A pre-study power calculation of the
sample size using a criterion of 50%
improvement in depression symptoms in
60% of a fluoxetine-treated group and 30%
of a placebo-treated group, suggested that
50 subjects per group would be required to
show a significant between-groups difference, assuming a drop-out rate of 25%,
with power of 80% at the 5% significance
level. A further power calculation was
carried out when 50 subjects had reached
12 weeks. At 80% power and 5% significance level, 35 subjects would be required in
each group (140 in total) to detect a mean
change in fatigue scale of 20% from a
baseline mean score of 14 (s.d. 4).
Design
A fixed daily dose of 20 mg fluoxetine and
a graded exercise programme were placebo
controlled and controlled for the amount of
therapist contact. The drug treatment was
double blind. The placebo to fluoxetine
was a capsule of similar taste and appearance. The placebo to the exercise programme was a review of activity diaries
by the physiotherapist. With respect to the
exercise programme, subjects were told that
they would receive one of two forms of
lifestyle advice and were blind to the other
type of advice. The design and patient flow
into the study are shown in Fig. 1. No
attempt was made to provide psychological
treatment.

Assignment
Immediately after initial assessment, subjects were randomised into a treatment
group by computer generated random
numbers, with groups being balanced in
blocks of 10 to obtain roughly equal
numbers. No stratification was employed.
A list of subject numbers marked with the
exercise group for each number was held by
the physiotherapist. Pharmacy staff dispensed medication in accordance with the
subject number assigned to each subject.
Assessments and outcome
measures
Subjects were assessed on entry to the trial
(week 0) and at weeks 12 and 26. Subjects
completed three self-rated questionnaires.
These were: (a) the 14-item fatigue scale
(Chalder et all 1993) - we used a cut-off of
four or more to designate caseness; (b) the
Medical Outcomes Survey Short-Form
Scales (MOS; Stewart et al, 1988) which
produces a measure of general health status
on the following six scales (cut-off scores
for poor function in parentheses): physical
function ( < 83.3), role or occupation function ( < =SO), social function ( < =40), pain
( < =SO), health perceptions ( < =70) and

mental health ( < =67); (c) the Hospital
Anxiety and Depression Scales (HAD;
Zigmond & Snaith, 1983) - cut-offs of 11
or more designated caseness.
On completion of the questionnaires,
subjects were interviewed by the psychologist with the revised Clinical Interview
Schedule (Lewis et all 1992). Supplementary questions were asked to enable a
diagnosis to be made in accordance with
DSM-111-R criteria (American Psychiatric
Association, 1987).
Physiological assessment included measurement of height, weight, body fat, grip
strengths and functional work capacity.
The last was determined using a Bosch
ERG 551 electronically braked cycle ergometer. Oxygen consumption and carbon
dioxide production were determined using
a P.K. Morgan Exercise Test System (P.K.
Morgan, Rainham, Kent). Subjects' predicted maximum heart rate was calculated
from the formula: 210-0.65 x (age in
years), and heart rate was monitored
throughout the test. Most subjects reached
subjective exhaustion before they had
reached their predicted maximum heart
rate and before a plateau in oxygen
consumption had been reached; consequently no extrapolation to theoretical
I I
maximum oxygen uptake was attempted.
Functional work capacity was calculated as
the amount of oxygen (in millilitres) consumed in the final minute of exercise per
kilogram of body weight, and was used as
the physiological outcome measure.
The main outcome variables were the
changes in score on the fatigue scale and the
percentages of subjects who scored below
case level on the fatigue scale (Chalder et al,
1993) from baseline to weeks 12 and 26.
Secondary outcome variables were changes
in functional work capacity, and changes in
scores on the MOS scales and the HAD
scale.
I
Treatments
All subjects attended the hospital on eight
occasions for treatment by the physiotherapist on weeks 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 20 and 26.
Subjects were assessed at weeks 0, 12 and
26, as specified in the study protocol. A
check-list of drug side-effects was completed at each visit. Subjects randomised to
graded exercise were instructed to carry out
their preferred aerobic activity (usually
walkingljogging, swimming or cycling),
for 20 minutes, at least three times per
week. The intensity of activity was initially 
TREATMENT FOR CHRONIC FATIGUE SINDUOME
set at a level which utilised oxygen at
approximately 75% of the subject's tested
functional maximum (American College of
Sports Medicine, 1995). Subjects monitored their prescribed exercise programmes
on a chart along with pre- and post-exercise
heart rates and perceived exertion (Borg,
1982). Exercise intensity was increased
when there was a consistent recorded
reduction of 10 beats per minute in postexercise heart rate for one week and two
points on the perceived exertion scale
(about three times in six months in an
adherent patient). Subjects adhered to the
exercise programme if their charts showed
that they had performed the required
activity, at the required intensity, at least
three times per week.
Subjects randomised to the exercisecontrol groups were not offered any specific
advice on how much exercise they should
be taking, but were told to do what they
could when they felt capable and to rest
when they felt they needed to. Subjects who
attended the required appointments adhered to the non-exercise treatment. Every
fourth week, subjects in all groups were
required to complete a diary of activities
over a seven day period. These were
discussed with the physiotherapist at the
next visit. Where possible, subjects who
dropped out of the trial were assessed
immediately and at the next scheduled
assessment date.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was carried out using
SPSS for Windows, Release 6. Analysis was
carried out on an intention to treat basis.
When there were missing data at weeks 12
and 26, scores on the previous assessment
were substituted. No data were available
on 17 patients for the week 12 assessment,
functional work capacity assessments at
week 0, seven at week 12 and seven at week
26. Mean and 95% confidence interval
change scores were computed from the
differences between scores at week 12 and
baseline and week 26 and baseline (using
Liken scoring for the fatigue scales). These
change scores were analysed using factorial
analyses of variance, with the two treatments entered as between subjects factors.
Drop outs from the trial were analysed
using Cox's proportional hazards model.
Differences on categorical variables were
examined using Pearson's x2 test or loglinear model analysis.
RESULTS
Table 1 shows demographic details and
Table 2 baseline measurements of the
patient sample on entry to the treatment
trial. The four treatment cells showed no
clinically significant differences on any
demographic detail or baseline measurement. Sixty-two subjects (46%) fulfilled
DSM-111-R criteria for a current psychiatric diagnosis: 14 (10%) had major depression, 32 (24%) either dysthymia or
depressive disorder not otherwise specified,
14 (10%) various anxiety disorders and
two subjects (2%) somatisation disorder.
Drop-out rate and characteristics
One hundred and fourteen (84%) subjects
completed three months and 96 (71%)
subjects completed six months of the trial.
Subjects dropped-out at a greater rate
throughout the six months with exercise
than with non-exercise (25168 (37%) v. 151
69 (22%), Cox's proportional hazards,
P=O.OS)). The difference in drop-out rate
between subjects allocated to fluoxetine
(24168 (36%)) or to placebo drug (16169
(24%)) did not reach significance. Eleven
subjects dropped out because of medication
side-effects (two taking placebo drug), 16
because they were not improving or feeling
worse, and 13 gave other reasons or no
reason for dropping-out.
Drop-outs were significantly more
likely than trial completers to be members
of a self-help organisation (15139 (39%) v.
20195 (21%), x2 (1)=4.34, P=0.04), to
have changed or given up their occupation
as a result of their illness (38140 (95%) v.
76/96 (79%), zZ (1)=5.22, P=0.02) and
had significantly worse baseline scores on
the MOS health perception scale (median
(interquartile range) 5.0 (18.8) v. 15.0
(18.8) Mann-Whitney U=1433, P=0.02).
There were no significant differences between drop-outs and trial completers on
any other demographic feature nor baseline
clinical measure.
Intention to treat analysis of
changes in scores
Table 2 shows the effects of exercise and
fluoxetine on fatigue, HAD depression and
functional work capacity in all treatment
cells. Changes in scores over time on all
measures were significant at the 1% level.
There was a significant effect of exercise on functional work capacity at both
weeks 12 (n=132, mean change=2.0 (95%
CI 0.60-3.49); F(1,28)=7.99, P=O.OOS)
and 26 (n=132, mean change=1.9 (95%
CI 0.15-3.69); F(1,128)=4.74, P=0.03).
Fluoxetine had no significant effect on
functional work capacity at either weeks
12 (n=132, mean change=-0.4 (95% CI
-1.9 to 1.0)) or 26 (n=132, mean
change=O.l (95% CI -1.7 to 1.9)).
There were trends for exercise to
improve fatigue scale scores at week 12
(n=136, mean change=2.l (95% CI -0.6
to 4.8); F(1,132)=2.36, P=0.13) and at
week 26 (n=136, mean change=2.9 (95%
CI -0.2 to 6.1); F(1,132)=3.35, P=0.07).
Fluoxetine had no effect on the fatigue
scale at week 12 or week 26. Improvement
in fatigue scale scores between baseline
and 26 weeks correlated with that in
functional work capacity (Spearman
r=0.34, P=0.003).

There were no significant effects of exercise

change=0.1 (95% CI - 1.2 to 1.3)).
There were no significant changes on
any MOS scale nor on the HAD anxiety
scale in the intention to treat analysis. In
trial completers there was a significant
improvement in fatigue with exercise at
12 weeks (n=96, mean change=3.8 (95%
CI 0.002-7.5); F(1,92)=5.08, P=0.027)
and 26 weeks (n=96, mean change=4.5
(95% CI 0.3-8.7); F(1,92)=4.98,
P=0.028). In trial completers who adhered
to the exercise treatment for six months
there was a significant improvement on the
MOS health perception scale (n=77, mean
change=12.8 (95% CI 2.9-22.8);
F(1,73)=6.6, P=0.012) at 26 weeks but
not at 12 weeks. Otherwise the results of
percentage of non-cases of fatigue at six
months: 8/23 (35%) subjects who fully
adhered to the exercise prescription were
non-cases, 3/21 (14%) who partially adhered, and 1/23 (4%) prescribed but not
complying with exercise compared with 41
69 (6%) who were not prescribed exercise
(XZ (1) test for trend=7.14, P=0.008).
Among subjects who adhered to drug
treatment (fluoxetine (43168) v. placebo
(44/68)), there was no significant difference between the number of non-cases of
fatigue at six months in the fluoxetine and
placebo groups. There were no effects of
exercise on HAD case level of depression
while the effects of fluoxetine are shown in
Table 4.
Outcome for drop-outs
Twenty-one drop-outs were reassessed at
week 26 (Fig. 1). For these patients, when
mean change scores (weeks 0-26) were
calculated for each of the four treatment
groups, there was no worsening of scores
on the fatigue scale, functional work
capacity, HAD depression scale and MOS
health perception scale (data not shown).
DISCUSSION
Two treatments, which are within the
resources of most general hospitals, are
safe and produce clinically important but
modest benefits to patients with CFS within
three to six months. The high number of
trial non-completers, the conservative practice of substituting the previous value for
missing data, and regression to the mean or
non-specific treatment effects may have
resulted in an underestimate of the effects
of graded exercise on fatigue and health
perception.
There was a 12% reduction in the
number of patients with case level fatigue
by 26 weeks and a 10% improvement in
functional work capacity at 12 and 26
weeks. The only benefit of fluoxetine was
a modest overall reduction in the HAD
depression score at 12 weeks which was
not sustained at 26 weeks, a finding

which does not contradict the absence of
clinical effect of 20 mg fluoxetine reported by Vercoulen et al (1996). A
bigger clinical response might have been
seen if a flexible fluoxetine dosage regime
tailored to each patient's response to the
drug was employed and more CFS
patients (only 10%) with major depression were recruited.

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS
Graded exercise produces small but clinically significant improvements in case level
fatigue and functional work capacity in CFS patients.
20 mg fluoxetine per day produces smalt lmprovtments in depression in CFS
patients.

patients; treatment started at 75% rather
than 40% measured peak oxygen consumption; and our patients exercised for
longer every other day rather than a short
period each day.
No systematic therapeutic attempt was
made to change patients' beliefs about
their illness or exercise at the start of the
programme or during treatment. Dropouts from the trial may have been reduced
and adherence to exercise improved if
patients were given more specific psychological treatment such as cognitive-behavioural therapy (Sharpe et al, 1996; Deale
et al, 1997). It is possible that the
maximum effect of graded exercise was
not seen in our study which was limited to
six months' follow-up since larger treatment effects are reported in studies with
12 months' follow-up (Sharpe et al, 1996;
Deale et al, 1997).

Mechanism of action of graded
exercise
Relatively low functional work capacities
in CFS patients at the end of graded
exercise treatment reported in our study
and by Fulcher & White (1997), and the
weak but significant correlation between
improved fatigue and functional work
capacity in our study, suggest that the

tolerance of subjects to exercise had improved rather than a substantial increase in
cardiorespiratory conditioning (Allied Dunbar, 1992; McArdle et al, 1994). Graded
exercise may work by providing the reassurance to patients that activity (delivered
at a controlled rate with a clearly defined
maximal level at each time point) need not
cause an exacerbation of fatigue symptoms.
As a result patients become more confident
and willing to attempt other everyday
activities.
Clinical implications of the study
Our study provides modest support for the
Joint Working Group Report's (1996)
recommendations for a graded exercise
programme to treat fatigue and nonsedating antidepressants to treat depression in chronic fatigue syndrome patients.
A considerable amount of support, explanation and encouragement should be given 
to patients with chronic fatigue syndrome
otherwise graded exercise, antidepressants
or other treatments may not be adhered
to.
