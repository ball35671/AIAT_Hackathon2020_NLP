Summary
Background Trial fi ndings show cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) and graded exercise therapy (GET) can be eff ective
treatments for chronic fatigue syndrome, but patients’ organisations have reported that these treatments can be harmful
and favour pacing and specialist health care. We aimed to assess eff ectiveness and safety of all four treatments.
Methods In our parallel-group randomised trial, patients meeting Oxford criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome were
recruited from six secondary-care clinics in the UK and randomly allocated by computer-generated sequence to receive
specialist medical care (SMC) alone or with adaptive pacing therapy (APT), CBT, or GET. Primary outcomes were fatigue
(measured by Chalder fatigue questionnaire score) and physical function (measured by short form-36 subscale score) up
to 52 weeks after randomisation, and safety was assessed primarily by recording all serious adverse events, including
serious adverse reactions to trial treatments. Primary outcomes were rated by participants, who were necessarily
unmasked to treatment assignment; the statistician was masked to treatment assignment for the analysis of primary
outcomes. We used longitudinal regression models to compare SMC alone with other treatments, APT with CBT, and
APT with GET. The fi nal analysis included all participants for whom we had data for primary outcomes. This trial is
registered at http://isrctn.org, number ISRCTN54285094.
Findings We recruited 641 eligible patients, of whom 160 were assigned to the APT group, 161 to the CBT group, 160 to
the GET group, and 160 to the SMC-alone group. Compared with SMC alone, mean fatigue scores at 52 weeks were
3·4 (95% CI 1·8 to 5·0) points lower for CBT (p=0·0001) and 3·2 (1·7 to 4·8) points lower for GET (p=0·0003), but did
not diff er for APT (0·7 [–0·9 to 2·3] points lower; p=0·38). Compared with SMC alone, mean physical function scores
were 7·1 (2·0 to 12·1) points higher for CBT (p=0·0068) and 9·4 (4·4 to 14·4) points higher for GET (p=0·0005), but
did not diff er for APT (3·4 [–1·6 to 8·4] points lower; p=0·18). Compared with APT, CBT and GET were associated with
less fatigue (CBT p=0·0027; GET p=0·0059) and better physical function (CBT p=0·0002; GET p<0·0001). Subgroup
analysis of 427 participants meeting international criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome and 329 participants meeting
London criteria for myalgic encephalomyelitis yielded equivalent results. Serious adverse reactions were recorded in
two (1%) of 159 participants in the APT group, three (2%) of 161 in the CBT group, two (1%) of 160 in the GET group,
and two (1%) of 160 in the SMC-alone group.
Interpretation CBT and GET can safely be added to SMC to moderately improve outcomes for chronic fatigue
syndrome, but APT is not an eff ective addition.

Introduction
Chronic fatigue syndrome is characterised by chronic
disabling fatigue in the absence of an alternative
diagnosis.1
 Myalgic encephalomyelitis is thought by some
researchers to be the same disorder and by others as
diff erent with separate diagnostic criteria.1,2 The
prevalence of chronic fatigue syndrome is between 0·2%
and 2·6% worldwide, dependent on the defi nition used.1
Prognosis is poor if untreated.3
Specifi c therapies can improve outcomes. The UK
National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence
(NICE) recommend cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT)
and graded exercise therapy (GET).2
 Although this
recommendation was supported by systematic reviews,4–7
supporting evidence remains restricted to small trials.4–7
Surveys by patients’ organisations in the UK have
reported that CBT and GET are sometimes harmful, and
have recommended pacing and specialist health care.8,9
We designed the pacing, graded activity, and cognitive
behaviour therapy: a randomised evaluation (PACE)
trial10 to compare pacing, defi ned as adaptive pacing
therapy (APT), CBT, and GET, when added to specialist
medical care (SMC) with SMC alone. We sought evidence
of benefi t and harm. We also aimed to compare APT
against CBT and GET and examine these comparisons in
subgroups satisfying diff erent diagnostic criteria for
chronic fatigue syndrome and myalgic encephalomyelitis.
We postulated that CBT and GET would be more eff ective

than would APT and SMC, and that APT would be more
eff ective than SMC alone.
Methods
Study design and participants
PACE was a parallel, four group, multicentre, randomised
trial, with outcomes assessed up to 52 weeks after
randomisation for patients with chronic fatigue
syndrome.10 We recruited 641 participants from consecutive
new out patients attending six specialist chronic fatigue
syndrome clinics in the UK National Health Service
between March 18, 2005, and Nov 28, 2008, and completed
outcome data collection in January, 2010.
Several diagnostic criteria exist for chronic fatigue
syndrome and myalgic encephalomyelitis.11–13 We selected
participants in accordance with Oxford criteria for chronic
fatigue syndrome.11 These criteria require fatigue to be the
main symptom, accompanied by signifi cant disability, in
the absence of an exclusionary medical or psychiatric
diagnosis (psychosis, bipolar disorder, substance misuse,
an organic brain disorder, or an eating disorder).11 All
participants were medically assessed by the specialist clinic
doctors to exclude alternative diagnoses.2,12 Research
assessors used the structured clinical interview from the
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV
to diagnose exclusionary and comorbid psychiatric
disorders (ie, mood and anxiety disorders).10,14
Other eligibility criteria consisted of a bimodal score
of 6 of 11 or more on the Chalder fatigue questionnaire15
and a score of 60 of 100 or less on the short form-36
physical function subscale.16 11 months after the trial
began, this requirement was changed from a score of 60
to a score of 65 to increase recruitment.
We excluded patients who were younger than 18 years or
at signifi cant risk of self-harm, unable to attend hospital
appointments, unable to speak and read English, had
medical needs that made participation inappropriate, had
previously received a trial treatment for their present
illness at a PACE trial clinic (we initially excluded anyone
who had received a trial treatment, but found the nature of
treatment given elsewhere hard to establish).10 Participants
were also assessed by international criteria for chronic
fatigue syndrome,12 requiring four or more accompanying
symptoms, and the London criteria13 for myalgic
encephalomyelitis (version 2), requiring postexertional
fatigue, poor memory and concentration, symptoms that
fl uctuate, and no primary depressive or anxiety disorder
(interpreted as an absence of any such disorder).
We obtained separate written informed consent for
assessment and entry into the trial. The West Midlands
Multicentre Research Ethics Committee (MREC 02/7/89)
approved the study.
Randomisation and masking
Participants were allocated to treatment groups through
the Mental Health and Neuroscience Clinical Trials Unit
(London, UK), after baseline assessment and obtainment
of consent. A database programmer undertook treatment
allocation, independently of the trial team. The fi rst three
participants at each of the six clinics were allocated with
straightforward randomisation. Thereafter allocation was
stratifi ed by centre, alternative criteria for chronic fatigue
syndrome12 and myalgic encephalomyelitis,13 and
depressive disorder (major or minor depressive episode or
dysthymia),14 with computer-generated probabilistic
minimisation. Once notifi ed of treatment allocation by the
Clinical Trials Unit, the research assessor informed the
participant and clinicians. One therapist was available for
every therapy per centre, with few exceptions. Specialist
medical care doctors were allocated by convenience. As
with any therapy trial, participants, therapists, and doctors
could not be masked to treatment allocation and it was
also impractical to mask research assessors. The primary
outcomes were rated by participants themselves. The
statistician undertaking the analysis of primary outcomes
was masked to treatment allocation.
Procedures
Panel 1 shows treatment strategies and webappendix p 1
shows characteristics of treating clinicians. Therapy
leaders (one per therapy and with substantial experience
in treatment of chronic fatigue syndrome) trained
therapists until they were deemed competent to provide
trial treatments. Individual therapy supervision was
provided once every month, and by group every
3 months.24 All treatment sessions were recorded
acoustically. Two independent clinicians, who were
masked to allocated treatment, rated recordings of a
randomly chosen sample of the tenth (or nearest) session
of 62 (13%) of 480 participants (two sessions for every
therapist, when available) for therapy type, adherence to
the manual (7-point Likert scale), and therapeutic alliance
between therapist and participant (7-point Likert scale).
These clinicians recorded when masking had failed, such
as when the treatment was mentioned by name. All
doctors received training in specialist medical care, and
we assessed competence and monitored manual
adherence for most. We defi ned ten sessions of therapy
or three sessions of specialist medical care alone as
adequate treatment for the per-protocol analysis. We
recorded number of treatment sessions attended, active
withdrawals from treatment, additional treatments
received, and dropouts from follow-up.
We undertook assessments at baseline and 12 weeks
(mid-therapy), 24 weeks (post-therapy), and 52 weeks
after randomisation. Primary outcomes were also
assessed at the time of dropouts, and used when no
other outcome data were available. The research
assessors did the assessments, usually face-to-face in
clinic. Most measures were self-rated by the participant.
Because masking of research assessors to treatment
allocation after randomisation was impractical, we
relied on participant ratings to keep observer bias to
a minimum.

Outcomes
The two participant-rated primary outcome measures
were the Chalder fatigue questionnaire (Likert scoring 0,
1, 2, 3; range 0–33; lowest score is least fatigue)15 and the
short form-36 physical function subscale (version 2; range
0–100; highest score is best function).16 Before outcome
data were examined, we changed the original bimodal
scoring of the Chalder fatigue questionnaire (range 0–11)
Overview
We standardised treatments by provision of manuals for
doctors, therapists, and participants. At least three sessions
of specialist medical care were offered to participants during
the 12 months, and more were offered if clinically indicated.
Up to 14 therapy sessions were offered during the first
23 weeks; the first four were once a week and subsequently
they were once every 2 weeks. An additional booster session
was offered at 36 weeks. No other additional sessions were
offered. Most treatments were delivered face-to-face but
some were provided by telephone. Treatment was provided
individually although participants could be accompanied if
they wanted.
Specialist medical care (SMC)
SMC was provided by doctors with specialist experience in
chronic fatigue syndrome (webappendix p 1). All participants
were given a leafl et explaining the illness and the nature of
this treatment. The manual was consistent with good medical
practice, as presently recommended.2
 Treatment consisted of
an explanation of chronic fatigue syndrome, generic advice,
such as to avoid extremes of activity and rest, specifi c
advice on self-help, according to the particular approach
chosen by the participant (if receiving SMC alone), and
symptomatic pharmacotherapy (especially for insomnia,
pain, and mood).
Adaptive pacing therapy (APT)
APT was based on the envelope theory of chronic fatigue
syndrome.17,18 This theory regards chronic fatigue syndrome as
an organic disease process that is not reversible by changes in
behaviour and which results in a reduced and fi nite amount
(envelope) of available energy. The aim of therapy was to
achieve optimum adaptation to the illness, hence APT. This
adaptation was achieved by helping the participant to plan and
pace activity to reduce or avoid fatigue, achieve prioritised
activities and provide the best conditions for natural
recovery.13,17,18 Therapeutic strategies consisted of identifying
links between activity and fatigue by use of a daily diary, with
corresponding encouragement to plan activity to avoid
exacerbations, developing awareness of early warnings of
exacerbation, limiting demands and stress, regularly planning
rest and relaxation, and alternating diff erent types of activities,
with advice not to undertake activities that demanded more
than 70% of participants’ perceived energy envelopes.
Increased activities were encouraged, if the participant felt
able, and as long as they did not exacerbate symptoms.
Because this treatment had not been described in a manual, we
created and piloted manuals for therapists and patients on the
basis of previous descriptions,13,17 what pilot patients and
clinicians reported as helpful, and with the advice of
experienced therapists. Westcare and Action for ME helped in
the design of the therapy and endorsed the fi nal manuals.18 APT
was provided by occupational therapists (webappendix p 1).
Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT)
CBT was done on the basis of the fear avoidance theory of
chronic fatigue syndrome. This theory regards chronic fatigue
syndrome as being reversible and that cognitive responses
(fear of engaging in activity) and behavioural responses
(avoidance of activity) are linked and interact with
physiological processes to perpetuate fatigue. The aim of
treatment was to change the behavioural and cognitive
factors assumed to be responsible for perpetuation of the
participant’s symptoms and disability. Therapeutic strategies
guided participants to address unhelpful cognitions,
including fears about symptoms or activity by testing them in
behavioural experiments. These experiments consisted of
establishing a baseline of activity and rest and a regular sleep
pattern, and then making collaboratively planned gradual
increases in both physical and mental activity. Furthermore,
participants were helped to address social and emotional
obstacles to improvement through problem-solving. Therapy
manuals were based on manuals used in previous trials.19–21
CBT was delivered mainly by clinical psychologists and nurse
therapists (webappendix p 1).
Graded exercise therapy (GET)
GET was done on the basis of deconditioning and exercise
intolerance theories of chronic fatigue syndrome. These
theories assume that the syndrome is perpetuated by
reversible physiological changes of deconditioning and
avoidance of activity. These changes result in the
deconditioning being maintained and an increased
perception of eff ort, leading to further inactivity. The aim of
treatment was to help the participant gradually return to
appropriate physical activities, reverse the deconditioning,
and thereby reduce fatigue and disability. Therapeutic
strategies consisted of establishment of a baseline of
achievable exercise or physical activity, followed by a
negotiated, incremental increase in the duration of time
spent physically active. Target heart rate ranges were set
when necessary to avoid overexertion, which eventually
aimed at 30 min of light exercise fi ve times a week. When this
rate was achieved, the intensity and aerobic nature of the
exercise was gradually increased, with participant feedback
and mutual planning. The most commonly chosen exercise
was walking. The therapy manual was based on that used in
previous trials.22,23 GET was delivered by physiotherapists and
one exercise physiologist (webappendix p 1).

to Likert scoring to more sensitively test our hypotheses of
eff ectiveness. The two primary outcome measures15,16 are
valid and reliable and have been used in previous trials.4–7
For safety outcomes, we included non-serious adverse
events, serious adverse events, serious adverse reactions
to trial treatments, serious deterioration, and active
withdrawals from treatment.10 Adverse events were
defi ned as any clinical change, disease, or disorder
reported, whether or not related to treatment. Three
scrutinisers (two physicians and one liaison psychiatrist
who all specialised in chronic fatigue syndrome) reviewed
all adverse events and reactions, independently from the
trial team, and were masked to treatment group, to
establish whether they were serious adverse events.
Scrutinisers were then unmasked to treatment allocation
to establish if any serious adverse events were serious
adverse reactions. Serious deterioration in health was
defi ned as any of the following outcomes: a short form-36
physical function score decrease of 20 or more between
baseline and any two consecutive assessment interviews;16
scores of much or very much worse on the participantrated clinical global impression change in overall health
scale at two consecutive assessment interviews;25
withdrawal from treatment after 8 weeks because of a
participant feeling worse; or a serious adverse reaction.
For secondary outcomes, we used the clinical global
impression scale to assess change from baseline in overall
health.25 This 7-point scale was condensed into three
categories: negative change (very much worse or much
worse), minimum change (a little worse, no change, or a
little better), and positive change (much better or very
much better). We also assessed overall disability with the
work and social adjustment scale,26 6-min walking ability
(distance in m walked),27 Jenkins scale score for disturbed
sleep,28 hospital anxiety and depression scale score,29
number of chronic fatigue syndrome symptoms, and
individual symptoms of postexertional malaise and poor
concentration or memory, as in the international criteria.12
These secondary outcomes were a subset of those specifi ed
in the protocol, selected in the statistical analysis plan as
most relevant to this report. After participants had been
told their treatment allocation, but before treatment began,
they rated how logical their proposed treatment seemed
and how confi dent they were that it would help them
(5-point Likert scale with moderately and extremely condensed into a positive response to help with interpretation).
At 52 weeks, participants rated satisfaction with treatment
received on a 7-point scale, condensed into three categories
to aid interpretation (satisfi ed, neutral, or dissatisfi ed).
Statistical analysis
We calculated sample sizes assuming 60% response to
CBT at 52 weeks, 50% response to GET, 25% response
to APT, and 10% response to SMC.10 We assumed APT
to be at least as eff ective as in previous trials of relaxation
and fl exibility therapies.20,22 For a two-sided test with
5% signifi cance level and 90% power, we calculated that
the number of participants needed to compare SMC
with APT was 135, SMC with GET was 80, and SMC
with CBT was 40. We increased group size to 150 per
group to allow for 10% dropout, to provide equality
between groups, and for secondary analyses. The

statistical analysis plan was fi nalised, including changes
to the original protocol, and was approved by the trial
steering committee and the data monitoring and ethics
committee before outcome data were examined.
We used continuous scores for primary outcomes to
allow a more straightforward interpretation of the individual outcomes, instead of the originally planned
composite measures (50% change or meeting a
threshold score).10,30 We prorated primary outcomes
scales only when there were at most two items per scale
missing (nine participants for Chalder fatigue questionnaire and 11 for short form-36). Prorating involved
calculating the mean value of the item scores present
and replacing the missing values with that score.
We summarised continuous variables with mean (SD)
or median (IQR) and categorical variables with
frequencies and proportions. Diff erentiation of
treatment compared independent ratings of therapy
sessions with actual treat ment. We calculated the interrater reliability (κ and 95% CI) between the two
assessors. We used Kruskal-Wallis tests for comparisons
of therapy received, therapeutic alliance, and manual
adherence. We compared categorical variables with
Fisher’s exact test.
A clinically useful diff erence between the means of
the primary outcomes was defi ned as 0·5 of the SD of
these measures at baseline,31 equating to 2 points for
Chalder fatigue questionnaire and 8 points for short
form-36. A secondary post-hoc analysis compared the
proportions of participants who had improved between
baseline and 52 weeks by 2 or more points of the Chalder
fatigue questionnaire, 8 or more points of the short
form-36, and improved on both. In another post-hoc
analysis, we compared the proportions of participants
who had scores of both primary outcomes within the
normal range at 52 weeks. This range was defi ned as
less than the mean plus 1 SD scores of adult attendees
to UK general practice of 14·2 (+4·6) for fatigue (score
of 18 or less) and equal to or above the mean minus 1 SD
scores of the UK working age population of 84 (–24) for
physical function (score of 60 or more).32,33
We estimated diff erences between treatment groups for
both primary outcomes with mixed linear regression
models with Kenward-Roger adjusted standard errors.
Covariates were treatment group, baseline value of
outcome, time, and stratifi cation factors (centre, present
depressive disorder, and alternative criteria for chronic
fatigue syndrome and myalgic encephalomyelitis; all as
stratifi ed at entry). Time by treatment interaction terms
were included to allow extraction of contrasts at 52 weeks.
Models for the primary outcomes and the clinical global
impression incorporated random intercepts and slopes
over time by participant and main health-care practitioner
(doctor or therapist who saw the participant most
frequently, or, if equal, the fi rst practitioner to see the
participant) to allow for clustering of outcomes within

practitioner. We calculated intraclass correlation
coeffi cients, adjusted for baseline outcomes, using oneway random eff ects analysis of covariance at 52 weeks
within every treatment group. Unadjusted and Bonferroni
corrected p values are provided for fi ve comparisons for
both primary outcomes. Comparisons of primary
outcomes across treatment groups by alternative criteria
for chronic fatigue syndrome and myalgic encephalomyelitis, and comorbid depressive disorder included
the treatment by criteria or disorder interaction terms.
Because some errors were made in stratifi cation at
randomisation, we used true status variables rather than
status at stratifi cation as covariates.
We calculated adverse event and reaction rates by
dividing the number of events by person-years of
follow-up multiplied by 100, and compared rate
diff erences (95% CI) between treatment groups.
We analysed changes in clinical global impression
scale using binary logistic generalised estimating
equations regression with an exchangeable working
correlation and bootstrapped standard errors. We
analysed the number of chronic fatigue syndrome
symptoms with ordinary least squares linear regression,
and the presence of specifi c chronic fatigue syndrome
symptoms with logistic regression. We analysed
secondary outcomes with mixed linear regression
models with random participant intercepts and slopes
over time, apart from the walking test, which had
random intercepts only. Covariates in the models were
otherwise the same, except for clinical global impression
(not measured at baseline) and chronic fatigue syndrome
symptoms (measured only at 52 weeks).
We excluded participants from the intention-to-treat
population for whom we had no primary outcome data
in the fi nal analysis, which used restricted maximum
likelihood. The per-protocol analysis excluded
participants who were ineligible after randomisation,
treated at a second centre, or did not received adequate
treatment, adjusting for actual stratifi cation factors.
Statistical analyses were done with Stata version 10,
SAS version 9.1, and SPSS version 18.

Results
Figure 1 shows the trial profi le. Briefl y, 898 (28%) of
3158 patients screened for eligibility progressed to
baseline screening and 641 (71%) participants were
recruited (fi gure 1). The commonest reason for exclusion from initial clinician screening was failure to meet
Oxford criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome
(1011 participants). 745 (74%) of these excluded patients
did not have chronic fatigue syndrome and the rest did
not meet Oxford criteria despite having cliniciandiagnosed chronic fatigue syndrome. Table 1 shows

outcome data, and were therefore excluded from the
fi nal analysis. Primary outcomes were assessed at the
time of dropout for three participants and included in
the fi nal analyses. Research assessors recorded primary
outcomes (eg, dictated over the telephone) on 74 (4%) of
1920 occasions.
Table 2 shows details of treatments received. Participants
allocated to SMC alone received more sessions, but there
were no diff erences in the number of SMC sessions or
therapy sessions received between the other three groups.
There were no diff erences between groups in the
proportions who had received adequate treatment (85% or
more in every group). Participants’ expectations were
high for APT and GET, but lower for CBT and SMC
(table 2). Most of those who received a therapy were
satisfi ed with treatment (82% or more for the three
therapies), but fewer were satisfi ed with SMC (50%).
Number of treatment dropouts did not diff er between
groups (p=0·50; table 2). The two independent therapy
assessors rated 58 (94%) of 62 and 57 (92%) of 62 therapy
sessions as being the one allocated; only one (2%) session
was rated by both assessors as diff erent from that
allocated. The inter-rater reliability (κ; 95% CI) was 0·86
(0·75–0·97). The independent assessors were unmasked
in 25 (40%) of 62 sessions that they listened to. All three
therapies were rated as adhering well to the manuals.
Thera peutic alliance median scores were high and the
same across therapies.
Table 3 shows baseline and outcomes data, and fi gure 2
shows profi les for the primary outcomes. In the fi naladjusted models (fi gure 3), participants had less fatigue
and better physical function after CBT and GET than they
did after APT or SMC alone. Outcomes after APT were
no better than they were after SMC. Allowing for
clustering eff ects caused by participants attending the
same main practitioner had little eff ect on these results;
intraclass correlation coeffi cients ranged from –0·02 to
0·11 for fatigue, and –0·01 to 0·03 for physical function.
Participant subgroups meeting international criteria for
chronic fatigue syndrome, London criteria for myalgic
encephalomyelitis, and depressive disorder criteria did
not diff er in the pattern of treatment eff ects (fi gure 2; all
pinteractions were non-signifi cant).
64 (42%) of 153 participants in the APT group improved
by at least 2 points for fatigue and at least 8 points for
physical function at 52 weeks, compared with 87 (59%) of
148 participants for CBT, 94 (61%) of 154 participants for
GET, and 68 (45%) of 152 participants for SMC. More
participants improved after CBT compared with APT
(p=0·0033) or SMC (p=0·0149), and more improved with
GET compared with APT (p=0·0008) or SMC (p=0·0043);
APT did not diff er from SMC (p=0·61; webappendix p 2).
25 (16%) of 153 participants in the APT group were
within normal ranges for both primary outcomes at
52 weeks, compared with 44 (30%) of 148 participants for
CBT, 43 (28%) of 154 participants for GET, and 22 (15%)
of 152 participants for SMC. More participants were
within normal ranges after CBT than APT (p=0·0057) or
SMC (p=0·0014), and more were within normal ranges
with GET compared with APT (p=0·0145) or SMC
(p=0·0040); APT did not diff er from SMC (p=0·65).
Webappendix p 3 shows the per-protocol analysis.
Diff erences between treatments were very similar to
those of the fi nal analysis, but magnitude was almost
always higher in the per-protocol analysis.
Table 4 shows safety outcomes. Non-serious adverse
events were common. Participants who received CBT
reported slightly fewer such events than did those in the
APT (p=0·0081) and SMC (p=0·0016) groups. Serious
adverse events and serious deterioration were uncommon;
serious adverse reactions were rare. There were more
serious adverse events in the GET group than there were
in the SMC group (p=0·0433). Rates of serious adverse
reactions and serious deterioration did not diff er between
treatment groups. Webappendix pp 4–5 shows a summary
of serious adverse events and serious adverse reactions.
Table 5 shows data for the clinical global impression
scale ratings. At 52 weeks, more patients rated themselves
as much better or very much better in overall health after
CBT and GET than did after APT and SMC. A minority
(≤9% in every group) rated themselves as much worse or
very much worse, which did not diff er between groups.

after CBT than there were after SMC. Poor concentration
and memory did not diff er between groups. Postexertional

diff erences in any secondary outcomes between APT and
SMC groups (webappendix pp 6–9).
Discussion
When added to SMC, CBT and GET had greater success
in reducing fatigue and improving physical function than
did APT or SMC alone. APT was no better than was SMC
alone. Our fi ndings were much the same for participants
meeting the diff erent diagnostic criteria for chronic
fatigue syndrome and for myalgic encephalomyelitis, for
those with depressive disorder, and after allowing for
clustering eff ects. Other secondary outcomes showed a
very similar pattern. There were no important diff erences
in safety outcomes between treatment options.

Mean diff erences between groups on primary
outcomes almost always exceeded predefi ned clinically
useful diff erences for CBT and GET when compared
with APT and SMC. In all comparisons of the proportions
of participants who had either improved or were within
normal ranges for these outcomes, CBT and GET did
better than did APT or SMC alone. No more than 30% of
participants were within normal ranges for both
outcomes and only 41% rated themselves as much better
or very much better in their overall health. We suggest
that these fi ndings show that either CBT or GET, when
added to SMC, is an eff ective treatment for chronic
fatigue syndrome, and that the size of this eff ect is
moderate (panel 2).
Our conclusions are supported by secondary outcomes,
as both CBT and GET provided greater improvements
than did APT and SMC for most outcomes. The objective
walking test favoured GET over CBT, whereas CBT
provided the largest reduction in depression. The
comparatively greater reduction in postexertional
malaise with both CBT and GET compared with the
other two treatments is notable, since the risk of
exacerbation of this symptom is commonly given as a
reason to avoid treatments such as GET. The 47%
prevalence of mood and anxiety disorders at baseline
was much the same as that noted in previous trials in
secondary care (38–56%).20,23,36 The equivalent use of
antidepressants in the treatment groups implies that
the diff erences in outcomes are unlikely to be attributable
to these drugs.
There were no diff erences between groups in the
proportions with serious deterioration or serious adverse
reactions. The increased rate of serious adverse events
with GET compared with SMC is unlikely to be important
because serious adverse events were not thought by the
independent scrutinisers to be related to treatment.
Consequently, if these treatments are delivered as
described, by similarly qualifi ed and trained clinicians,
patients need not be concerned about safety.37
The fi nding that APT when added to SMC was no more
eff ective than SMC alone was contrary to our initial
hypothesis. This fi nding might in part be caused by greater
improvement after SMC than was expected. Suboptimum
delivery of APT is an unlikely explanation because APT
therapists were the most experienced; the therapeutic
alliance and the adherence to manuals were rated highly
in this group and participant satisfaction did not diff er
from that for other therapies. Since participants’ confi dence
that APT would help them was much the same as for GET,
and greater than that for CBT, they were unlikely to have
been biased by negative expectations. The fundamental
diff erence between APT and both CBT and GET is that
APT encourages adaptation to the illness,13,17,18 whereas
CBT and GET encourage gradual increases in activity with
the aim of ameliorating the illness.2,4,7 Our results do not
support pacing, in the form of APT, as a fi rst-line therapy
for chronic fatigue syndrome.
We plan to report relative cost-eff ectiveness of the
treatments, their moderators and mediators, whether
subgroups respond diff erently, and long-term follow-up
in future publications. Our fi nding that studied
treatments were only moderately eff ective also suggests
research into more eff ective treatments is needed. The
eff ectiveness of behavioural treatments does not imply
that the condition is psychological in nature.
Our fi ndings were strengthened by the small numbers
of dropouts, high rates of acceptance of the treatments,
use of manual-defi ned treatments provided by competent
clinicians, high rates of participant satisfaction, adherence
to manuals, and therapeutic alliance. The PACE fi ndings
can be generalised to patients who also meet alternative
diagnostic criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome12 and
myalgic encephalomyelitis13 but only if fatigue is their
main symptom.11
Our trial had limitations. We excluded patients unable
to attend hospital. Our results apply to patients referred
to secondary care. SMC is not the same as usual medical
care that might be provided by a family doctor; this study
Panel 2: Research in context
Systematic review
We searched the PubMed and Cochrane Library databases up to
Nov 6, 2010, without language restrictions for full papers
reporting randomised controlled trials, systematic reviews, and
meta-analyses with the search terms “chronic fatigue
syndrome”, “myalgic encephalomyelitis”, “myalgic
encephalopathy “ and “cognitive behaviour therapy”, “exercise”,
“pacing”. We excluded trials of adolescents, education, and
group interventions. Our search identifi ed the two most recent
systematic reviews,4,5 two meta-analyses,6,7 and two additional
trials34,35 that were not included in these reviews. The reviews
and meta-analyses concluded that cognitive behaviour therapy
and graded exercise therapy are moderately eff ective
treatments for chronic fatigue syndrome, and that limitations
of previous trials included small size, an absence of data for
safety outcomes, and high dropout rates.4–7 The fi ndings from
these studies concur with the UK National Institute for Health
and Clinical Excellence guidelines.2
Interpretation
In the pacing, graded activity, and cognitive behaviour therapy:
a randomised evaluation (PACE) trial, we affi rm that cognitive
behaviour therapy and graded exercise therapy are moderately
eff ective outpatient treatments for chronic fatigue syndrome
when added to specialist medical care, as compared with
adaptive pacing therapy or specialist medical care alone.
Findings from PACE also allow the following interpretations:
adaptive pacing therapy added to specialist medical care is no
more eff ective than specialist medical care alone; our fi ndings
apply to patients with diff erently defi ned chronic fatigue
syndrome and myalgic encephalomyelitis whose main
symptom is fatigue; and all four treatments tested are safe.

was not designed to compare SMC with usual medical
care. Although more than 3000 patients attending
clinics had to be screened to identify the 641 recruited,
the commonest reason for exclusion at screening was
not having chronic fatigue syndrome. We chose
conventional criteria for defi ning clinically useful
diff erences between treatments, although other
thresholds could have been chosen.32 SMC was not as
closely monitored or supervised as the other therapies,
and participants receiving SMC alone had more sessions
than did those in the therapy groups; this is unlikely to
have aff ected comparisons between the groups. Masking
of participants or clinicians to treatment allocation was
not possible, and research assessors were also not
masked. Primary outcomes were subjective and rated by
participants. While this avoided investigator bias, it
could be subject to other biases. Although participantrated outcome measures could have been aff ected by
expectations of treatment, which were highest for APT
and GET, CBT was one of the two most eff ective
treatments despite lower expectations.
Findings from the PACE trial suggest that individually
delivered CBT and GET, when added to SMC, are more
eff ective and as safe as APT added to SMC or SMC alone.
Patients attending secondary care with chronic fatigue
syndrome should be off ered individual CBT or GET,
alongside SMC.
