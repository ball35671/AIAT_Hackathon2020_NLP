Abstract
In a double blind placebo controlled clinical evaluation of maintenance therapy in 40 chronic schizophrenic 24-60 yr old female outpatients, thioridazine in single daily doses not exceeding 375 mg/day for 6 mo was shown to be effective maintenance treatment compared with placebo, thereby establishing the sensitivity of the experiment. Pimozide was also shown to be effective in a single oral dose not exceeding 16 mg/day and comparable overall to the standard drug. The experimental design was based on the anticipated retrogression of placebo-treated Ss during the 6-mo study period, which was reflected in 5 of 9 (56%) "treatment failures" in the placebo group compared to 2 of 14 (14%) and 2 of 12 (17%) in the thioridazine and pimozide groups, respectively. In some instances improvement over baseline evaluations was noted in both drug groups, particularly on global impression. Though some items of the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale exhibited drug-placebo differences, the scale in general was felt to be rather insensitive for this kind of study. Social adjustment ratings on a special scale completed by the patients and families were also found to be insensitive to treatment differences. Side effects most often seen with thioridazine were sedation and EKG and liver function abnormalities. Headache and restlessness occurred most often with pimozide. Extrapyramidal symptoms and insomnia were seen most often with pimozide and placebo equally. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)
