PIMOZIDE (McN-JR-6238) is a diphenylbutylpiperidine compound, different in structure from butyrophenones
and phenothiazines, which has been reported to be an effective antipsychotic
agent in single oral doses ranging from 2
mg to over 20 mg per day. Side effects have
generally consisted of extrapyramidal
signs but may include nausea, abdominal
pain and diarrhea, appetite suppression,
anxiety, agitation, excitement, hallucinatory experiences, hypersedation, and
lowered blood pressure. 1 Doses below 10
mg/ day were not often associated with
side effects,2 but when side effects appeared they were usually managed easily
with dose reduction or antiparkinsonism
medication. Pimozide was felt to be more
effective in maintaining improvement
than in inducing it. The present study

was therefore undertaken to evaluate the
effects of pimozide in doses up to 40 mg
in chronic schizophrenic patients in terms
of acceptance and side effects and in
terms of its potential as maintenance
therapy.
Method
Twenty male chronic schizophrenic inpatients housed together on a special research ward area were randomly assigned
to either a pimozide or placebo treatment
group, ten subjects to each. Two weeks
prior to treatment each subject's antipsychotic medication was converted to an
equivalent dose of thioridazine so that all
subjects were receiving the same neuroleptic medication for two weeks before
beginning pimozide or placebo treatment.
All antiparkinsonism medication was discontinued one week before beginning the
new treatment and baseline psychiatric
and ward behavior measures were obtained at that time. Thereafter, each subject was placed on either placebo or
pimozide according to the schedule in
Table 1. Each subject received his medication as a single morning dose, and the
double-blind procedure was followed
throughout. Dose adjustments were permitted in the event of toxicity or intolerance. Antiparkinsonism medication
(benztropine mesylate) was permitted if
deemed necessary by the investigator.

beginning and end of the study only.
Whenever initial and final mean scores
were obtained, analysis of covariance was
used for data analysis, with the initial
value the covariate. Where only final
mean scores were available, as on the CGI
Improvement scores, a t-test was used for
testing the significance of differences between the group means.
Results
Before beginning the medication phase
of the study, one subject was .dropped
from the pimozide group when he developed severe hyperpyrexia. The remaining 19 all completed the study. During
the course of the study one subject in
the pimozide group was found to be mildly
hypothyroid but was permitted to complete the study under careful observation.

than that of the placebo group, the two
groups were quite similar in terms of

Dose reductions were not required in this

Improvement and Severity of Illness scores
provided by the psychiatrist and the nursing service. On the CGI Improvement
Scale both raters noted somewhat less
regression under the pimozide treatment
condition and this was a statistically significant difference for the nurse. On
Severity of Illness, however, the difference between the two treatment groups
was not significant.
Table V contains the BPRS total score
data, tabulating initial, final (12th week),
and adjusted final means by treatment
groups. Slight regression of scores in both
groups was observed, and was relatively
greater in the placebo group. However,
the difference between the two treatment
groups was not significant.
Table VI contains the initial, final
(12th week), and adjusted final means
of treatment groups for each of the six
NOSIE factor scores and the total NOSIE
score. The fourth- and eighth-week scores
are tabulated, but not included in the
analysis of covariance. The placebo group
exhibited some deterioration in overall behavior, whereas the pimozide-treated
group showed unexpected improvement
over the baseline scores. The intergroup
308
differences were statistically significant
for the factors representing social competence, social interest, and irritability;
general improvement compared with
placebo was reflected in the total score as
well.
Side effects observed appear relatively
benign and are tabulated in Table
VII. Extrapyramidal signs apparently occurred only in the pimozide group and
significant weight loss occurred more often
with placebo. One subject on pimozide
complained of an increase in auditory
hallucinations and dreams during the latter half of the study. There were no abnormalities of cholesterol or triglycerides
in either group. One patient on pimozide
was noted to have primary T-wave
changes by ECG at the end of the study,
slightly increased over that noted at baseline. Six plaecbo and two pimozide subjects had been noted to have ocular pigment deposits at baseline, presumably associated with past drug treatment. There
were no instances in either group of increase or development of ocular pigment
deposits over the 12 weeks of observation.
The only instance of regression of pigment occurred in one of the placebo paThe Journal of Clinical Pharmacology
PIMOZIDE IN CHRONIC SCHIZOPHRENIA
tients. One placebo subject had no followup eye examination at the end of the
study period.
Discussion
Since the principal purpose of this
study was to evaluate the maintenance
and side effect potential and acceptability
of pimozide, rather than its antipsychotic
efficacy, this study was designed without
a "dry-out" period. It must then be
realized that the early effects noted, both
positive and negative, could be the result
of the interaction of pimozide with the
residual of prior drug treatment. For this
reason all subjects were pretreated with
thioridazine in an attempt to lessen variability due to prior drug treatment. It
was also reasoned that by 12 weeks much
of the effect of prior drug treatment
would have dissipated, permitting a
measurable comparison of the placebo and
pimozide groups. However, in view of the
fact that several studies'S" indicate that
placebo can maintain many patients
reasonably well for three months or
longer, marked deterioration and large
group differences were not anticipated.
Despite that, the principal finding of this
study was that pimozide apparently induced further improvement in some subjects as measured by the NOSIE scale,
particularly in the areas of social competence, social interest, and irritability."
The improvement occurred in the face of
some deterioration in the placebo group
and statistically significant differences resulted. These changes are in keeping .with
the notion advanced by European investigators! that pimozide tends to improve
social attitudes and relationships and
hence might be helpful for the schizo-
* The decrease in irritability was even more surprising in view of the fact that in an unpublished study in prison volunteers it appeared that
irritability was increased by pimozide in some
subjects.

phrenic outpatient living and working in
the community. It would seem that this
idea might warrant further investigation.
Summary
In a 12-week double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial, patient acceptance of
pimozide in doses up to 40 mg and the
potential usefulness of this drug as maintenance therapy in chronic schizophrenic
male patients were evaluated, The subjects were changed abruptly from a phenothiazine to either placebo (N==10) or
pimozide (N == 9) in single oral doses up
to 40 mg, or 8 capsules per day. Side
effects encountered were the usual ones,
especially extrapyramidal signs of a relatively mild nature, and one subject complained of bad dreams and increased
auditory hallucinations. The results indicated that pimozide in the dose administered was generally well accepted following thioridazine and to a limited extent appeared successful in producing
some improvement and in preventing deterioration to the degree that it occurred
in the placebo group.. The improved "sociability" aspect of pimozide treatment
probably war-rants further investigation.
