Once Weekly Pimozide versus Fluphenazine Decanoate
as Maintenance Therapy in Chronic Schizophrenia
R. McCREADIE, M. MACKIE, D. MORRISON and J. KIDD
Summary: In a double blind trial, 28 male chronic schizophrenic in-patients
received either pimozide, given once weekly, or fluphenazine decanoate, given
mostly once fortnightly. Therewas no difference in relapseratesover nine months.
However, three-quarters of the patients on pimozide who completed the trial
developed at least mild tardive dyskinesia. All patients on pimozide lost weight,
the average loss being 5.4 kg (12 Ibs). Plasma pimozide levels suggested
satisfactory drug compliance. Plasma prolactin levels confirmed that in the
pimozide group there was fluctuating dopamine receptor antagonism, while in
the fluphenazine group average plasma prolactin levels throughout most of the
interval between injections were at the upper limit of normal.
The oral neuroleptic pimozide, under certain con
ditions, can be as effective in out-patient schizo
phrenics as the standard maintenance therapy
intra-muscular fluphenazine decanoate (Falloon et al,
1978a and b). However, as pimozide has a long plasma
half-life, over 50 hours in man (McCreadie et al, 1979),
it may not need to be given daily. When given four
days weekly, with a subsequent three day â€˜¿drug
holiday', it was as effective as fiuphenazine decanoate
in day-patient and in-patient schizophrenics (Mc
Creadie et al, 1980). The pharmacokinetic study
(McCreadie et al, 1979) also showed that a single dose
gave higher peak plasma levels and no more trouble
some parkinsonian side-effects than the same dose
spread over four days; also, the plasma level after the
single dose did not fall below the level produced by the
multiple doses until the fourth day after admin
istration. The clinical and pharmacokinetic evidence
suggests therefore that a single once-weekly dose of
pimozide might be effective as maintenance therapy.
The present study has examined this possibility by
comparing it with fluphenazine decanoate. It was decided to confine the study in the first instance to in
patients to ensure that drug compliance would be as high as possible.
Patient selection
criteria : (i) he was physically fit ; (ii) he fulfilled the
Feighner criteria for â€˜¿definite' schizophrenia (Feighner
et al, 1972); (iii) in the opinion of both medical and
nursing staff, he was well controlled on and bene
fiting from anti-psychotic medication ; (iv) he, and
where traceable his next of kin, gave consent. Twenty
nine patients fulfilled the criteria (average age 55 years,
range 27â€”70years ; average length of illness as esti
mated from first hospital admission 27 years, 9â€”41
years).
Medication
The trial lasted ten months. With the stipulation
that 14 received one drug and 15 the other, patients were randomly and blindly allocated to either
pimozide or fiuphenazine decanoate, the starting dose
of which was the approximate therapeutic equivalent
of the previously prescribed neuroleptic (Wyatt and
Torgow, 1977; 12.5 mg fluphenazine decanoate weekly
equivalent to 8 mg pimozide orally daily). One patient was receiving fluphenazine decanoate and five daily
pimozide before the study began; a further five
patients were receiving intra-muscular fiupenthixol
decanoate. To ensure double blind conditions, patients
received either active pimozide tablets and dummy
fluphenazine injections or dummy tablets and active
injections. Pimozide was administered daily for the
first week, four consecutive days weekly for the
second, twice weekly for the third and once weekly
thereafter on Monday mornings. The once weekly dose was four times the initial daily dose, subject to a

maximum of 60 mg; the maximum weekly dose of
fluphenazine, which in most cases was given two
weekly, alsoon Monday mornings, was50mg.
If patientswereonanti-parkinsonianmedicationat
the start of the trial, the doseof this was steadily
reduced and the drug eventually discontinued if signs
of parkinsonism were no more than â€˜¿mild' (see below).
Anti-parkinsonian medication was prescribed if signs
wereâ€˜¿moderate' or â€˜¿severe'.
Assessment
Before the trial began and during weeks 12, 24, 40
and at the time of withdrawal, the patient'smental
statewasassessedindependentlyby two psychiatrists,
using the Hamilton-Lorr Scale(Hamilton et a!, 1960);
depression and anxiety were also assessedusing the
relevant sections of the Krawiecka Scale(Krawiecka
eta!, 1977). The patient's ward behaviour was assessed
by a seniornurse,usingthe Wing Ward Behaviour
Scale (Wing, 1961), and the ability to work in the
industrial therapy unit by senior nursing staff and
instructors, using a standardized work report (Grif
fiths,1973).Parkinsonianside-effects(tremor,rigidity,
dystonia, akathisia) were assessedjointly by two
psychiatrists using a five-point scale(0 = absent, 1 =
doubtful, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, 4 = severe).
Dyskinesiawas assessedin sevenareas(upper face,
lips, jaw, tongue, arms, legs and trunk), using the
samefive-point scale.
A patient was withdrawn from the study if in the
opinion of either psychiatrists, nurses, or relatives,
there was a deterioration in his mental state, or
behaviour sufficient to warrant his removal from the
trial. Such withdrawal would not necessarilybe due
only to an exacerbation of schizophrenic symptoms.
Thepatientcouldalsorequesthisremoval.
The patient'sweightwasmeasuredbeforeandafter
the trial, and blood sampleswere taken during the
fourth, seventhand tenth months, immediately before
the administrationof an injectionor the ingestionof
oral medication(Monday, 9 a.m.) and 8, 48 and 96
hourslater. Full bloodcount,serumelectrolytes,liver
function tests and plasma prolactin and pimozide
concentrations were measured. Prolactin was meas
ured by a radioimmunoassay technique (C.I.S., UK,
Ltd). Pimozide wasalso measuredby a radioimmuno
assay method (Michiels et a!, 1975). The pimozide
levels may be somewhat higher than expecteddue to
high â€˜¿blank' levels(range 2.29â€”6.99ng/ml); this was
probably due to interferenceby an unknown factor in
the patient's serum. â€˜¿Blank' levels,however, measured
in different samplestaken from the samepatient over
many months showed little variation, thus suggesting
that the interferencefactor for an individual patient is
constant.
Statistics
Asthesamplesizesweresmallandasit couldnot be
assumed that the clinical data were normally dis
tributed, non-parametric tests were used. Differences
within groups were examined by the binomial or
Walshtest,differencesbetweengroupsby the Mann

out (Siegel, 1956).
Results
At the beginning of the trial, there were no stat
istically significant differencesbetweenthe two groups
with respectto age,length of illness,severity of illness,
as measured by the Hamilton, Wing, and Grifliths
scales (Table I), and equivalent starting dose of
pimozide, 33 mg per week. At the end of the study, the
average dose of pimozide was 40 mg weekly (range:
10-60 mg) and fluphenazine decanoate 14 mg weekly
(range: 2-25 mg). One patient in the secondmonth on
pimozide developed a rectal carcinoma; he was
removedfrom the studyand countedneitheras a
withdrawal nor non-withdrawal. No significant
abnormalities were found in full blood count, electro
lytes,orliverfunctiontests.
Withdrawals

tardive dyskinesia of the tongue at the time of with
drawal (patient C, Table II).
Six of the 15 patients on fiuphenazine (40 per cent) were withdrawn. One developed an exacerbation of
positive schizophrenic symptoms in the third month.
Two patients, one of whom made a suicide attempt, were withdrawn because of severe depression, one in
the seventh, the other in the tenth month. Two patients
and the relatives of a third requested their withdrawal
in the first few weeks because of parkinsonian side
effects, especially akathisia, rigidity and excessive
salivation, all of which were unrelieved by anti
parkinsonian drugs. They refused to persist with the
drug at a lower dose.
Examination of plasma pimozide and prolactin
measurements, which were inevitably scantier than in
non-withdrawals (see below), did not suggest that
levels were obviously above or below the range found
in non-withdrawals, except in two of the three patients on fiuphenazine, who were withdrawn on account of
parkinsonism; their prolactin levels were three times
higher than the mean for non-withdrawals.
Non-withdrawals
Eight of the 13 patients on pimozide (62 per cent)
and nine of the 15 on fluphenazine (60 per cent) com
pleted the trial.
Clinical findings
Analysis of within-group scores showed that in
neither the pimozide nor fiuphenazine group were
there any significant changes over the ten months in
mental state, ward behaviour, ability to work, parkin
sonism, or numbers of patients on anti-parkinsonian
drugs. Analysis of between-group scores at the
beginning and end of the trial showed no significant
differences.
Side-effects
Dyskinesia. In the pimozide group, there was a
significant increase (P <0.05) in the total scores on the
dyskinesia scale (Table II). At the start, one patient
had mild dyskinesia, but by the end, six of the eight
patients had at least mild symptoms in one of the seven
areas rated (P <0.03); in only one of the six were the
lips, jaw or tongue not affected. Symptoms were present by the sixth month in three of the five who
developed dyskinesia de novo. There was no corre
lation between dyskinesia scores and either pimozide or prolactin levels (see below). There were no signi
ficant changes in dyskinesia scores in the fiuphenazine
group; two patients at the start and three at the end
had at least mild symptoms (Table II). There were no
significant between-group differences.
Other side-effects. Three patients on pimozide, but

none on fluphenazine complained of one or other of
the following symptoms each Monday and sometimes
Tuesday: â€˜¿shakiness inide', â€˜¿restlessness', â€˜¿het up';
thesesymptoms were not helped by anti-parkinsonian
drugs. A fourth patient on pimozide complained of
â€˜¿dizziness' and â€˜¿swooning' each Monday afternoon.
These patients did not have obviously higher peak
pimozide or prolactin levelsthan the parent group (see
below).
Therewasa significant(P <0.008) weightlossin the
pimozide group over the ten months; all patients lost
weight, the meanlossbeing 5.4kg (12 Ibs). There were
no significant changes in weight in the fluphenazine
group.

the curve (AUC) was just statistically significant (r = +0.64, P < 0.05).
The mean prolactin level in the pimozide group was well within the normal range before dosing, rose
sharply over the following eight hours, and was back
within the normal range by Wednesday morning. In
the fiuphenazine group, the prolactin level was at the
upper limit of normal throughout the interval between
injections, with the exception of a small peak eight
hours after injection. The level in the fiuphenazine
group was significantly higher (P < 0.01) on Monday
morning and lower (P < 0.02) on Monday afternoon
than in the pimozide group. There were no significant
within-individual correlations between plasma pro
lactin and dose of either pimozide or fiuphenazine, or between prolactin and plasma pimozide levels.
Discussion
The study has shown that, in a group of male
schizophrenic in-patients, previously well maintained
on neuroleptics, pimozide given once weekly is as effective as fluphenazine decanoate in preventing
relapse over a nine-month period. Patients were with
drawn as frequently for depression as for positive
schizophrenic symptoms ; depression is increasingly
recognized as an important symptom in schizophrenia
(Johnson, 1981).
Plasma pimozide levels showed that drug com
pliance was good. Indeed, many patients spontaneous
ly expressed satisfaction that they only had to take
oral medication once weekly. Compliance with oral
medication can be a serious problem in schizophrenic
out-patients (Renton et al, 1963), but it is likely to be
improved considerably if patients have to take medi
cation only once weekly.
It is recognized that in-patients are not exposed to
family tensions and probably experience fewer stress
ful life events than out-patients (Leff and Vaughn,
1980); they are perhaps less likely to need main
tenance therapy. A more rigorous test therefore of the
effectiveness of weekly pimozide would be to give it to
out-patients. In view of the findings in this study and in
the previous one (McCreadie et a!, 1980), where
pimozide given four days weekly to mainly day
patients was effective, it would now be justifiable to
carry out such a trial. Another even more stringent
test of its effectiveness would be to give pimozide
weekly to patients who had recently recovered from an
acute episode of schizophrenia and who were judged
to need maintenance therapy.
It must be noted that of the six patients who before
the trial were receiving long acting intra-muscular
drugs, either fluphenazine or flupenthixol decanoate,
two were switched to once-weekly pimozide. It has
recently been suggested (Wistedt et a!, 1981) that
small quantities of fiuphenazine can be detected in
plasma several months after discontinuation of in
jections ; the same may well hold good for fiupen
thixol. These two patients therefore may have had
some protection against relapse not only from weekly
pimozide, but also from small amounts of a depot
neuroleptic.
Both plasma pimozide and prolactin levels sug
gested that weekly pimozide could be called â€˜¿inter
mittent medication'. Mean pimozide levels were
relatively high eight hours after dosing, but had fallen
almost to pre-medication levels four days later. It must
be remembered that the levels obtained were probably
raised by interference by an unknown factor in the
patient's serum. However, as â€˜¿blank'levels showed
little within-individual variation, this interference will
probably be constant for any given individual re
ceiving pimozide. It is unlikely, therefore, that this
factor will have altered the shape of the plasma
pimozide profile shown in Fig I, except to increase its
height.
Plasma profiles were similar for prolactin, levels of
which had fallen to within the normal range 48 hours
after administration of pimozide. The fluctuating
prolactin levels suggest fluctuating dopamine re ceptor antagonism in the tubero-infundibular system,
though it is not certain that there is a similar antagon
ism of dopamine receptors in the meso-limbic and
nigro-striatal systems. With fluphenazine decanoate, mean prolactin levels throughout the interval between
injections were for the most part at the upper limit of
the normal range; indeed, in a number of individuals,
prolactin was never above the upper limit of normal.
However, it is likely that some dopamine receptor
antagonism was present, as the pre-medication level on Monday mornings was significantly higher than that
found in the pimozide group.
Although the plasma prolactin and pimozide pro
files for the group were very similar, there was no
intra-individual correlation between these two meas urements; neither was there any significant correlation
between plasma prolactin and doses of pimozide or
fluphenazine. There were also few correlations bet ween plasma measurements and clinical findings.
However, two of the three patients who received
fluphenazine which was withdrawn on account of
parkinsonism had high prolactin levels.
Two side-effects in the pimozide group merit
further discussion: tardive dyskinesia and weight loss.
The majority of non-withdrawals on pimozide at the
end of the study had at least mild tardive dyskinesia,
and one patient was removed from the study at his
relative's request because of this movement disorder.
An excess of tardive dyskinesia was also found when
patients were given pimozide four days weekly (Mc
R. MCCREADIE,M. MACKIE, D. MORRISONAND J. KIDD 285
Creadieet a!, 1980).The causeof thiscomplicationis
not clear. A lesseningof parkinsonism, found in the
previous study, may make dyskinesia more obvious
(Crane, 1973),but in this trial there wasno appreciable
decreasein the amount of parkinsonism when patients
were switchedto pimozide. Intermittent medication
may be similar to stopping medication, which can
make dyskinesia show itself. Finally, intermittent
administration of a neuroleptic may have a â€˜¿kindling'
effect on dyskinesia, as discussed in another study
(Jesteeta!, 1979),which found that wherepatients had
irreversible tardive dyskinesia, they had experienced
significantly more drug-free intervals than patients
with reversible dyskinesia. The only satisfactory way
to examine this problem would be to give patients
intermittent maintenance therapy after the first
episodeof schizophrenia and to compare the incidence
of dyskinesiawith patientsgivencontinuous therapy.
Weight gain is common in patients taking neuro
leptics and diminishes when the drug is stopped. The
causeof weight gain is not clear; fluid retention, in
creased appetite and deposition of fat have all been
incriminated (Anonymous, 1974).It may also be that
neuroleptics and anti-depressants alter the hypo
thalamic sensitivity to a given level of glucose(Paykel
et a!, 1973). The significant weight loss found in the
patients on pimozide suggeststhat continuous medi
cation may be necessaryto produce the increase.The
weight lossmay be regardedasa beneficialside-effect;
through referenceto age/height/weight charts (Kems
Icy, 1952),the weight of three patients at the beginning
of the study, before being switched to pimozide, was
above the 95th centile, whereas the weight of no
patient at the end of the study was below the 5th
centile.
