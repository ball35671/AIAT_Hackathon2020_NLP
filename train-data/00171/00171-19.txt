Pimozide versus Haloperidol in Acute Schizophrenie. A Double Blind
Controlled Study

Psychiatrische Klinik des Zentralinstituts für Seelische Gesundheit, Mannheim
(Direktor: Prof. Dr. Dr. H. Häfner!
Summary
ThirtV acutely hospitalized schizophrenic patients ware
treated under double blind conditions with either haloperidol (40-60 mg/day) or pimozide (40-60 mg/dayl
for 30 days.
Ten patients in the pimozide and eleven in the haloperidol
group showad a very good or good clinical response. There
ware no definite differences of treatment results es assessed
by the Global Clinical Impression. Both groups showad a
statistically significant decrease of the global scores of the
Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (p < 0.01). There was a significant decrease of affective bluntedness and anergia in the
pimozide but not in the haloperidol group.
Extrapyramidal side effects ware more pronounced in patients on pimozide who therefore needed more anticholinergic drugs.
There was no consistent correlation betwaen drug serum
levels and global scores or single factors of the BPRS in
either treatment group.
It is concluded that pimozide in dose ranges from 40-60
mg has powarful antipsychotic properties indistinguishable
from those of haloperidol but exerts stronger extrapyramidal side effects.
Vergleich zwischen Pimozide und Haloperidol bei akuter
Schizophrenie. Eine kontrollierte Doppelblindstudie
30 akut hospitalisierte Schizophrene wurden unter Doppelblindbedingungen mit Haloperidol (40-60 mg/die)
oder Pimozide (40-60 mg/die) für 30 Tage behandelt.
In der Pimozidegruppe sprachen zehn, in der Haloperidolgruppe elf Patienten sehr gut oder gut an. Es ergaben sich
keine therapeutischen Unterschiede gemäß einer globalen
klinischen Einschätzung. Bei beiden Gruppen fand sich
ein statistisch signifikanter Rückgang der Globalwarte
auf der Brief Psychiatrie Rating Scale ( p < 0.01). In der
Pimozidegruppe war eine deutliche Abnahme affektiver
Abgestumpftheit und Anergie festzustellen.
Extrapyramidalmotorische Nebenwirkungen traten häufiger unter Pimozide auf.
Eine zuverlässige Korrelation zwischen 5erumspiegeln der
Substanzen und Globaleinschätzung sowie einzelnen Faktoren der BPRS fehlte.
Aus den Ergebnissen ist zu schließen, daß Pimozide in der
Dosierung 40-60 mg/die starke, dem Haloperidol vergleichbare antipsychotische Eigenschaften besitzt, jedoch vermehrt extrapyramidalmotorische Nebenwirkungen hat.
in the maintenance therapy of chronic schizophrenia
(Pinder et al. 1976, for review).
The pharmaco1ogical profile is similar to that of the butyrophenones. Pimozide has specific effects at dopamine receptor sites (Janssen 1968, Anden et al. 1970) but blocks also
the increase of limbic fore brain cyc1ic AMP induced by noradrenaline (Blumberg et al. 1975, Sawaya et al. 1977)
suggesting certain NA-receptor b10cking effects. Puech et
al. (1978) suggested from their behavioral studies that
pimozide may act more se1ective1y on pre-compared to postsynaptic receptors which is not supported by as one biochemical investigation (Gianutsos et al. 1976).
Pimozide is c1inical1y used in doses from 2 to 6 mg once
daily and it is feIt by most psychiatrists that it has a weak
antipsychotic efficacy combined with certain activating
and/or drive-enhancing properties.
Several open studies have recently been published which
reported that doses up to 60 mg/day were usefu1 in the
treatment of acute schizophrenia (Piyakulmala et al. 1977,
Shopsin and Selzer 1977, Garton and Silverstone 1979)
and in mania (Post et al. 1980). Chouinard and Annable
(1979) compared pimozide and ch1orpromazine under
double blind conditions in the treatment of acute schizophrenia and found that pimozide had 1ess of an overall sedative effect than chlorpromazine and induced more parkinsonian side effects.
The purpose of this controlled study was to compare pimozide's neuro1eptic profile and side effects with those of
haloperidol and further to corre1ate plasma levels with
c1inical efficacy.
Patients and Methods

The Clinical Global Impressions (CGI, 1970), the Brief Psychiatrie
Rating Scale (Overall and Gorham 1962) and the AMDP-system
(Angst et al. 1969) were used for documentation of psychopathological change and occurrence of side effects on days 0, 1, 3, 5,
10, 20, and 30 of the study.
Blood plasma levels of both compounds were measured on days
5, 10, 20, and 30 at identical times (9 a.m.) after morning medication at 7 a.m. Laboratory work was done by Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Beerse, Belgium. A radioimmunoassay was used to measure
both pimozide and haloperidoJ. The interassay variability under
standardized conditions was ± 15% for both methods.
Regular laboratory checkups including EEG and ECG were performed before ttle study and thereafter weekly throughout the
study.
After informed consent had been obtained haloperidol or pimozide
were administered in a double blind method. Presentation of the
drugs was identical in liquid form. Initial dose for both drugs was
10-40 mg/day (2.5 mg in 1 ml). This was increased up to the fifth
day to 60 mg and then continued according to clinical needs.
Chloral hydrate (1,5 g/day) or, if necessary, promethazine (100 mg/
day) were given as sleep medication. Biperiden (2 mg tablets) was
given if extrapyramidal signs were observed.
Analysis of variance (ANOVA, program BNDP2V, VCLA 1977)
and Spearman's correlation coefficient were used for statistieal
analyses.

Results
28 patients completed the study. Two patients (both in
the pimozide group) had to be withdrawn. One expressed
the wish to quit (day 10), the other developed serious and
unmanageable extrapyramidal side effects.
The overall c1inieal assessment at day 30 found ten patients
in the pimozide and eleven in the haloperidol group with
a very good or good c1inical response whereas five in the
pimozide and four in the haloperidol group showed only
moderate or no c1inieal effect at all.
Table 1 shows the ratings of Global Clinieal Impressions
("severity of illness") for day 0, 15 and 30 for both treat·
ment groups. As can be seen, no definite differences of
treatment results became apparent.
Fig. 1 depicts the decrease of the global scores of the
Brief Psychiatrie Rating Scale for both the pimozide and
the haloperidol group. Both groups showed a statistieally
significant decrease during the four weeks' trial (p < 0.01,
ANOVA) and there was no significant group difference.
Comparison of item change as measured on the BPRS is
summarized on Table 2 for both groups. Only affective
bluntedness decreased significantly in the pimozide but not
in the haloperidol group. There was a group difference in
item "emotional withdrawal" in favor of the pimozide

group. In the same line are the results of the analysis of
the five factors of the BPRS indicating a highly significant decrease of the factor "anergia" in the pirnozide
group with a significant group difference (Fig. 2).
Occurrence of extrapyramidal side effects, graded mild,
moderate and marked, was throughout the study more
pronounced in the pimozide group as compared to the
patients treated with haloperidol. This is also evidenced
by the higher need of the antiparkinson drug biperiden in
the pimozide group (Table 3). Need of medium doses of
additive sedative medication such as promethazine (four
patients in either group) or chloral hydrate (five in the
pimozide and four in the haloperidol group) was generally
low and comparable in both groups.
Psychic, autonomie, cardiovascular and gastrointestinal
side effects were low and not different in either group.
The average oral doses and the plasma levels on days 5,
10, 20 and 30 for both compounds are summarized in
table 5. A large standard deviation is obvious in pimozide
plasma levels.
There was no clear correlation OOtween oral dose and
plasma level neither for pirnozide nor for haloperidol
(except for pimozide on day 5; P < 0.05).
Further, there was no significant negative correlation OOtween drug plasma levels and global scores of the BPRS
on days 5, 10, 20, and 30 in either treatment group. There was only some correlation between single factors of
the BPRS in the pimozide group on day 5 (activation
p < 0.05; hostility P < 0.05) and on day 10 (anxietydepression p < 0.05; thought disturbances p < 0.01; activation p < 0.05; hostility P < 0.05) but not on the other
days. No correlations were found in the haloperidol group.
Discussion
Results of this study indicate that pimozide in daily
doses of 40 to 60 mg has powerful antipsychotic properties which are comparable to those of haloperidol.
This is in line with results of various open studies (Piyakulmala et al. 1977, Shopsin and Selzer 1977, Garton
and Silverstone 1979) and was to be expected from the
pharmacological profile.
The influence on symptoms as thought disorder, hostility,
aggressiveness, uncooperativeness and hallucinations was
especially marked whereas the factor anxiety/depression
was significantly improved by haloperidol only.
The positive influence on anergia (factor 3 of the BPRS)
is of interest as it is in keeping with clinical findings
from therapy with rather low doses. It must 00 pointed
out that Shopsin and Selzer (1977) did not see any influence on the factor "anergia" in their study. In this
context it may not 00 irrelevant that patients in the pimozide group received by far more of the antiparkinsonian drug biperiden which has OOen shown to possess certain drive-enhancing and mood-elevating properties (Beckmann and Moises, in prep.).
The more frequent occurrence of extrapyramidal side
effects is clearly a disadvantage of pirnozide. Chouinard
and Annable (1980) reported a higher incidence of extrapyramidal side effects, too. Thus, one serious parkinsonian
syndrome persisted more than 10 days even after with·
drawal of pimozide and adequate anticholinergic medication.
Interindividual plasma levels were rather consistent in the
haloperidol treated patients and varied greatly in the pimozide group. As compliance was equally controlled. difDownloaded by: National University of Singapore. Copyrighted material.

ferent resorption of either drug may be responsible for
this fmding.
It is of note that the lack of reliable correlations between
plasma levels of haloperidol and acute antipsychotic and
side effects agrees with some findings from literature
(Fjörndal et al. 1980) but not with others (Calil et al.
1979). Absence of correlations between serum levels of
various neuroleptics and c1inical response have been reported by other research groups (Curry et al. 1968, Al/redsan and Sedvall 1976) and point to considerable divergence between measurable serum levels, effects at specific receptor sites, and c1inical change.

In conc1usion, the present study suggests that pimozide
is a reliable and safe antipsychotic drug at least for acute
forms of schizophrenia. The frequent appearance of extrapyramidal side effects might conceivably be circumvented by using lower doses or combining with anticholinergic drugs.
