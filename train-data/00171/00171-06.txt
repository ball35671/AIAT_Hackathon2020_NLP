A blind social assessment at home was carried out twice during a year's follow-up of 41 patients on continuation therapy, 21 randomly allocated to pimozide tablets and 20 to fluphenazine decanoate injections. Patients on pimozide were significantly more favourably rated on aspects of sociability, use of leisure, warmth of personal relationships, household tasks and child-rearing. The mode of production of this result is discussed.
