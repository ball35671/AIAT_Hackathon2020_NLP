Intermittent Pimozide versus Fluphenazine Decanoate as
Maintenance Therapy in Chronic Schizophrenia
By R. G. McCREADIE, J. M. DINGWALL, D. H. WILES and J. J. P. HEYKANTS
SUMMARY In a double-blind trial, 34 male chronic schizophrenic
day-patients or in-patients in a hostel ward continued on fluphenazine
decanoate given mostly once fortnightly or were switched to pimozide,
given on four days each week. Over nine months relapse rates were
similar for both groups, and while fewer patients on pimozide were
prescribed antiparkinsonian drugs one quarter developed buccolingual
masticatory dyskinesia. Plasma pimozide levels suggested satisfactory
drug compliance. Average plasma prolactin levels were within the
normal range for untreated men in one quarter of non-relapsing
patients on pimozide and three quarters on fluphenazine.
The intermittent administration of neuro
leptics in chronic schizophrenia has practical
and economic advantages and can be as
effective as the same medication given con
tinuously (reviewed by Prien and Klett, 1972).
As there has been no study of intermittent
pimozide it was decided to examine the effect
iveness of this drug, given orally four days a week
to chronic schizophrenics previously well main
tained on intramuscular antipsychotic medi
cation. Recent work on pimozide provided a
further impetus to the present study. Firstly,
given continuously it can be as effective in out
patient schizophrenics as the standard main
tenance therapy, intramuscular fluphenazine
decanoate (Falloon et a!, 1978a and b). Second
ly, a pharmacokinetic study (McCreadie cCal,
1979) has shown that pimozide has an extremely
long plasma half-life, over 50 hours; this
suggests that, week after week on an inter
mittent four-days-a-week regime, there may be
during the three days when pimozide is not
administereda sufficientamount of drug in
plasma, and by extrapolation at the site of
action,topreventrelapse.
Patient selection
rehabilitation unit of Gartnavel Royal Hos
pital, Glasgow (N = 19) and male day patients
attending the hospital's industrial and occu
pational therapy departments (N = 44) were
considered. A patient entered the trial if: (i) he
was physically fit; (ii) he fulfilled the Feighner
criteria for â€˜¿definiteschizophrenia' (Feighner ci
al, 1972); (iii) in the opinion of both medical
and nursing staff he was well controlled on and
benefitingfrom long-actingintramuscularanti
psychotic medication; (iv) he, and where
traceable his next-of-kin, gave consent.
Clinical experience over the five years which
followed a detailed review of the work of the
rehabilitation unit (McCreadie, 1973) deter
mined which patients fulfilled criterion (iii). The
review showed that considerable quantities of
neuroleptics were being prescribed to many
patients.Strenuouseffortswere thereforemade
in the following five years to reduce and where
possible discontinue such medication. At the
time of the presentstudynursingand medical
staffbelieved that patientsremaining on
neuroleptics did need such medication.
Nine inpatients (average age 55, range 3 1â€”70
years; average length of illness as estimated from
first hospital admission 26 years, range 10â€”39)
and 26 day patients (average age 47, range

range 1â€”43)fulfilledthecriteria.
Medication
Patients on intramuscular antipsychotic medi
cation which was not fiuphenazine decanoate
(N = 9) were switched to thisdrug at least
three months before the trial began. No patient
was also receiving oral neuroleptics.
With the stipulations that 17 patients should
receive one drug and 18 the other, and that
approximately equal numbers of inpatients and
day patients should receive each drug, patients
were randomly and blindly allocated either to
continue on fluphenazine decanoate (given,
though not necessarily weekly, on Fridays) or to
receive the approximate therapeutic equivalent
of pimozide (12.5 mg fiuphenazinedecanoate
intramuscularly weekly equivalent to 8 mg
pimozide orally daily) which was given four
days each week (Mondayâ€”Thursdayinclusive).
To ensure double-blind conditions patients
received active fiuphenazine injections and
placebo pimozide tablets, or placebo injections
and active tablets. The dose could be altered to a
maximum of 50 mg fiuphenazine weekly (32 mg
pimozide daily). If patients were on anti
parkinsonianmedication at the startof the trial
the dose of thiswas steadilyreduced, and the
drug eventually discontinued, if symptoms of
parkinsonism were no more than mild (see
below).
Assessment
The triallastednine months. Beforeitbegan
(week 0) and during weeks 4, 12, 24 and 36, and
at time ofrelapse,the patient'smental statewas
assessed independently by two psychiatrists
using the Hamilton-Lorr scale (Hamilton et al,
1960); depression and anxiety were also
assessed using the relevant sections of the
Krawiecka scale (Krawiecka et al, 1977).
Inpatientbehaviour was assessedby a charge
nurse using the Wing ward behaviour scale
(Wing, 1961). The behaviour at home of day
patients living with relatives was assessed by
community nurses through interviews with the
relatives,alsousing the Wing scalewith minor
modifications.The abilityto work of patients
who attended the industrial and occupational
therapy units was assessed jointly by senior
nurses and occupational therapists uaing a
standardized work report (Griffiths, 1973).
Parkinsonian side effects (tremor, rigidity,
dystonia, akathisia) were assessed jointly by the
two psychiatrists using a 5-point scale (0 =
absent, 1 = doubtful, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate,
4 = severe).Dyskinesiawas assessedin seven
areas (upper face,lips,jaw, tongue,arms, legs,
trunk) using the same 5-pointscale.A patient
was deemed to have relapsedif,in the opinion of
either the psychiatrists, nurses, or relatives,
there was a reappearance or exacerbation of
symptoms which led to withdrawal from the
trial, whether or not in the case of day patients it
resultedinreadmissiontohospital.
Before the trial began, and during the third,
sixth and ninth months, the patients' weights
were measured and blood withdrawn on the
Thursday evening beforean injectionof medi
cation to measure full blood count, liver
function tests, and plasma prolactin, pimozide
and fluphenazine. The time of sampling was
such as to give a fluphenazine concentration
representative of the average drug level for the
interval between injections (Wiles and Gelder,
1979), but a peak plasma pimozide level
(McCreadie et al, 1979). If a plasma pimozide
half-life of 50 hours is assumed then by Saturday
afternoon plasma concentrations would be 50
per cent below peak levels. For the neuroleptic
and prolactin estimations blood was centrifuged
at 3000 rpm for seven minutes and plasma stored
at â€”¿20Â°C until plasma levels could be esti
mated by radioimmunoassay techniques for
pimozide (Michiels ci al, 1975) and fluphenazine
(Wiles and Franklin, 1978). Prolactin was deter
mined by radioimmunoassay using a modi
fication of the method of McNeilly and Hagen
(1974). Prolactin standard MRC 75/504 was
used. Results are expressed as international
units/litre (IU/l). The prolactin range in 10 un
treated male controls was 0.083 to 0.467 IU/l
(N = 10).
Statistics
As itcould not be assumed that the clinical
data were normally distributed nonparametric
tests were used. Between-group differences in
final scores were assessed by the Mann-Whitney

U test or the x2 test and within-group differences
pre- and post-treatment by the Walsh or bino
mial test. Correlations between final clinical
scores and plasma neuroleptic and prolactin
measurements were calculated by the Spearman
rank correlation coefficient. Two-tailed tests
were used throughout (Siegel, 1956). Within the
pimozide group correlations were also examined
separately for those patients with presumed
intermittent treatment adherence (N = 5) and
those with good adherence (N = 8).
Results
At the beginning of the trial there were no
statistically significant differences in the two
groups with respect to age, length of illness,
length of time on and dose of fiuphenazine
decanoate, and severity of illness, as measured by
the Hamiiton-Lorr, Wing and Griffiths scales.
At week 0 the average dose of fluphenazine
was 14 mg weekly (range: 6â€”50mg) and the
average length of time the patients had been on
intramuscular antipsychotic medication was
four years (range: 1 to 10 years). At week 36 the
average dose of fiuphenazine was 14 mg weekly
(range:8â€”37.5mg) and of pimozide 9 mg daily
(range: 4â€”32mg). Neither group showed any
significantchange in body weight, blood
count, or liver function tests over the nine
month period.
One patient on pimozide refused all medi
cation from the sixth month and was therefore
withdrawn from the trial; he was counted
neither as a relapse nor as a non-relapse.

514 INTERMITTENT PIMOZIDE VERSUS FLUPHENAZINE IN SCHIZOPHRENIA
assessment to be made. In both groups there
was a significant deterioration in work perform
ance (P <0.01, P <0.02, respectively), but it
occurred only over the last three months
(January to March, when climatic and econ
omic conditions in Glasgow were harsh). The
workscale is divided on the basis of a factor
analysis into four subscales: task competence,
response to supervision, social relationships,
and enthusiasm for work (Watts, 1978). It was
only enthusiasm for work that diminished
significantly (P <0.01 in both groups). At week
36 there were no significant between-group
differences in work performance.
Extrapyramidal side effects. Fewer patients on
pimozide were receiving antiparkinsonian drugs
at theend than at thestartofthetrial(1com
pared with 8: P <0.02); whereas for flu
phenazine there was no change (5 compared
with 6). Those with variable plasma pimozide
levels did not differ from the others. Tremor
was noted in all six patients with a pimozide
levelgreaterthan8.6ng/mlbutinonly2 ofthe7
witha levelessthanthis(P <0.025).
On pimozide the number of patients with
buccolinguomasticatory (BLM) dyskinesia de
fined as at least moderate in one of the three
areas tongue lip and jaw rose over the nine
months from 1 to 4 whereas only one patient on
fluphenazine showed this in the same period.
Definite dyskinesia in non-BLM areas was
found in one patient on fluphenazine at week 0
and in one patient on pimozide at week 36.
There were no significant between-group differ
ences in dyskinesia.
Discussion
The composition of the population studied
must be emphasized. The patients were chronic
schizophrenics who had been on intramuscular
antipsychotic drugs on average for four years.
The population did not contain patients who
could not be established or maintained on
long-acting neuroleptics, nor those who were
considered well enough not to need maintenance
therapy. They belonged probably to the group
of schizophrenics with an intermediate prog
nosis (Leff, 1973).
The patients were expected to show treatment
adherence (Blackwell, 1976), since they were
Relapsers
Three of the 16 patients on pimozide (19 per
cent) and three of the 18 on fluphenazine (17 per
cent) relapsed over the nine months; all de
veloped an exacerbation of positive psychotic
symptoms such as auditory hallucinations. The
average time to relapse was five months (range:
1â€”8months). Of the six, one was an inpatient,
and fiveoutpatients.Removal from the trial
was at the instigation of the nurses in three
cases,therelativesin two,and thepsychiatrists
in one. Assessment at relapse showed that in
comparison with week 0 the mental state and
behaviour of all six had deteriorated (P <0.03),
as had the work performancein the fivewho
attended the therapy units (P <0.06). There
were no significantchangesin extrapyramidal
sideeffectsordyskinesia.
Plasma measurements (Tables I and II),
which were inevitably scantier than in the non
relapsers, did not suggest that neuroleptic or
prolactin levels were lower or fluctuated more
than in those who remained well.
Non-relapsers
In five patients in the pimozide group (pat
ients C, I, K, L, and M) there was considerable
intra-individual variation in pimozide levels
over the 9 months, which suggests that treat
ment adherence in these five was at least inter
mittently poor, but there were no signs of re
lapse, and no correlation with prolactin levels.
The daily dose and average peak plasma
pimozide levels correlated significantly for the
group (P <0.001), as did the weekly dose and
average basal plasma level for the fluphenazine
group, who however as individuals showed less
variation in levels.
Average plasma prolactin levels exceeded the
upper limit for untreated men in 10 out of 13
who receivedpimozidebutonlyin4 outof15on
fluphenazine (P <0.05). Average prolactin and
fluphenazinelevelscorrelatedsignificantly(P
<0.05) but prolactin and pimozide levels did
not; prolactin levels during pimozide treatment
fluctuated more widely.
Work performance. Eleven patients on pimozide
and ten on fluphenazine attended the work
shops on a sufficiently regular basis to allow an
R. G. MCCREADIE, J. M. DINGWALL, D. H. WILES AND J. J. P. HEYKANTS 515
seen almost daily and co-operated well with
staff. However, the plasma pimozide levels were
irregular in several suggesting non-compliance,
but in spite of this they showed no evidence of
deterioration. It has recently been shown
(Wiles, D, unpublished) that in some instances
small quantities of fluphenazine can be de
tected in plasma up to approximately three
months after a depot injection. It is therefore
possible that the pimozide group at the begin
ning of the study had some residual protection
from fluphenazine, but this should have dis
appeared long before the end of the trial.
With these reservations, the study suggests
that in a fairly compliant group of chronic
schizophrenics with an intermediate prognosis
intermittent administration of pimozide is as
effective as fluphenazine decanoate in pre
venting relapse over a nine month period.
Moreover, at the end of the study significantly
fewer patients on pimozide needed anti
parkinsonian drugs. The benefits of inter
mittent as opposed to continuous medication
are obvious; a drug holiday three days a week
resultsina 40 percentreductionintheamount
of medication.
The relapserateon activemedication(less
than 1 in 5) was broadly similar to that found in
other studies of maintenance therapy in chronic
schizophrenia (reviewed by Davis, 1975) and
was considerably less than the rate following
drug withdrawalin recentstudiesof chronic
schizophrenicswho successfullycompletedtwo
years(Hogartyetal,1976)or up to fouryears
(Johnson, 1979) of maintenance therapy.
There was littleevidenceofdepressioninour
patients (compare Hirsch et al, 1973). This
contrastswiththefindingby Fallooneta!,l978a,
who compared continuous pimozide with flu
phenazine decanoate injections in acute schizo
phrenic episodes and after, when depression was
an important late effect. Tardive dyskinesia
(bucco-linguo-masticatory movements) in
creased in our patients put on pimozide, how
ever. Possibly intermittent pimozide has a
similar effect to a discontinuation of treatment
which can make dyskinesiashow itself(re
viewed by Crane, 1973), or it may have resulted
from a decrease in parkinsonism, the tremor and
rigidity of which could mask underlying
dyskinesia.Certainlyswitchingpatientswell
established on continuous medication to inter
mittent medication hardly reduces the amount
of dyskinesia. Jeste et at (1979) recently showed
that patients with persistent dyskinesia had had
a greater number of neuroleptic drug inter
ruptions of at least two months duration than
had those with reversible dyskinesia.
The lack of correlation between clinical data
and drug plasma concentrations in these
chronic patients is hardly surprising as a similar
lack of correlation was found in acute schizo
phrenia (Kolakowska ci al, 1979).
Plasma prolactin is said to be a measurement
of dopamine blockade, which is now thought to
be the way that anti-schizophrenic drugs exert
theireffectin acutelyillpatients(Johnstoneci
at, 1978). The mode of action in maintenance
therapy is less clear. In half the non-relapsing
patients in the present study average prolactin
levels were never above the upper limit for
untreated males. It cannot be assumed, though,
that there was no dopaminergic receptor block
ade as Beumont et at (1974) showed that pro
lactin levels were within the normal untreated
range in male schizophrenics who had received
neuroleptic treatment for long periods but
dropped to lower levelsin fourout of fiveof
these patients when medication was withdrawn.
Our previous study of the pharmacokinetics
of pimozide(McCreadieciat,1979)suggested
thata single24 mg dosewould lastforfourdays.
This, and the present study, suggest that a once
weekly higher-than-usual dose of pimozide
might also be effective as maintenance therapy.
This requires clinical assessment: a once weekly
oral neurolepticmight have a place in the
management ofchronicschizophrenics,especial
ly as penfluridol,usuallygiven once weekly
(Quitkin ci at, 1978), is not available in the
United Kingdom.
