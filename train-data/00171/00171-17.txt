Introduction: A substantial number of patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia respond only partially
to clozapine. Therefore, it has been common practice to use augmentation strategies to maximize clozapine's
effect. But the efficacy of this strategy remains poorly established. We have conducted a randomized
double-blind placebo controlled clinical trial in patients with schizophrenia currently receiving clozapine
with partial response, and tested the efficacy of pimozide augmentation on positive and negative symptoms
and also on neurocognitive measures.
Methods: Thirty-two outpatients enrolled in the clinical trial and 28 completed. Patients with adequate blood
levels of clozapine were randomized to pimozide vs placebo and participated in the trial for 12 weeks receiving
monthly assessments for Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) and Schedule for Assessment of Negative Symptoms
(SANS), and weekly assessments for electrocardiogram (EKG), and side effects. Neurocognitive tests measuring
verbal fluency, working memory, motor and attention/executive function were obtained at study entry and
end of the trial.
Results:We found no significant effect of pimozide on BPRS total, psychosis and depression subscale items, SANS
scores or QTc interval. Neurocognitive measures did not show significant improvement either.
Discussion: In this well controlled clinical trial of patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia currently
receiving clozapine, pimozide augmentation was not an effective strategy to maximize the benefit for better
control of positive and negative symptoms or improving neurocognitive function.

1. Introduction
Treatment resistant schizophrenia continues to represent a challenge
in psychiatric practice. Clozapine, the prototypic new generation antipsychotic, offers benefit to this population with response rates of 30–57%
(Rosenheck et al., 1997; Kane et al., 2001). This still leaves about 30% of
patients for whom there is no consensus for treatment.
In this environment, a frequent practice has been to add high potency
dopamine blockers to clozapine. Almost 50% of clozapine-treated
patients receive adjunctive medications (Buckley et al., 2001) with
about 18% receiving a second antipsychotic. European surveys reported
up to 55% of adjunct antipsychotic use (Peacock and Gerlach, 1994).
An open label clinical trial reported a large effect size with pimozide
augmentation (Friedman et al., 1997). Double-blind augmentation
trials with atypical antipsychotics have been more variable (Shiloh et
al., 1997; Honer et al., 2006; Freudenreich et al., 2007; Fleischhacker
et al., 2010). However, a double-blind clinical trial of pimozide augmentation in clozapine non-responders recently reported negative results
(Friedman et al., 2011). In this study more inpatients than outpatients
participated and no neurocognitive data were collected. We recruited
exclusively outpatients who may be considered less impaired than inpatients, and also included neurocognitive measures due to pimozide's
affinity for calcium channels (Gould et al., 1983) and earlier reports
showing beneficial effects in memory (Sallee et al., 1994).
Pimozide is a conventional antipsychotic which is effective for
schizophrenia as monotherapy (Opler and Feinberg, 1991). Pimozide
is a strong antagonist at the postsynaptic D2 receptors unlike clozapine,
thus it could augment clozapine's effect via a different mechanism of
action.

Psychiatry, and the Zucker-Hillside Hospital of Long Island Jewish Health
Care System, and approved by the respective Institutional Review
Boards. The study was conducted in full accordance with the Good
Clinical Practice Consolidated Guideline approved by the International
Conference on Harmonization, and was registered on the “www.
ClinicalTrials.gov” website (NCT00374244). Written informed consent
was obtained from each participant.
Baseline procedures included a medical evaluation, comprehensive
metabolic panel, thyroid function, urine analysis, toxicology and
pregnancy tests. Prior to randomization, a stable dose of clozapine
for the past 2 weeks with a blood level of at least 350 ng/ml was
targeted (Perry et al., 1991; Potkin et al., 1994; Kronig et al., 1995).
Subjects with baseline QTc values greater than 450 ms were not
permitted because pimozide can increase the QTc interval.
Inclusion criteria comprised male or female patients with a diagnosis
of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder between the ages of 18 and
60 from all ethnic backgrounds. A minimum Brief Psychiatric Rating
Scale (BPRS) score of 35 and a BPRS psychotic symptom cluster score of
at least 8 were required. Exclusion criteria included a history of significant
medical/neurological disease, current substance abuse and QTc greater
than 450 ms. Medications with a risk of QTc prolongation were not
permitted. Patients receiving antipsychotics in addition to clozapine
were excluded.
Subjects were stratified as to whether they were receiving psychoactive medications such as mood stabilizers, to ensure that about equal
numbers of subjects were randomized to pimozide/placebo based on
this treatment profile.
2.1. Clinical assessments and outcome measures
The diagnostic assessment was performed using Structured Clinical
Interview for Axis I DSM-IV Disorders (SCID DSM-IV). The main outcome
measures, BPRS total, BPRS positive symptom cluster score (suspiciousness, hallucinations, unusual thought content, conceptual disorganization), negative symptom scores as measured by the Schedule for the
Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) were administered at baseline
and every 4 weeks. Other outcome measures including the Clinical Global
Impression (CGI) rating (severity and improvement subscales), extrapyramidal system (EPS) side effects and tardive dyskinesia (TD) were administered at baseline and every 4 weeks as well. EPS was assessed by
the Simpson-Angus Scale for extrapyramidal symptoms, and TD was
assessed by the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS). Verbal
fluency was measured using the Controlled Word Association Test
(COWAT), and processing speed using Digit Symbol Coding (WAIS-R).
Verbal learning and memory were assessed by the Rey Auditory Verbal
Learning Test (RAVLT), working memory by Digit Span and LetterNumber Sequencing, and attention/executive functions were measured
by the Trail Making Test (Parts A and B).
Clozapine levels were obtained at baseline and every 4 weeks.
Medication side effects and QTc were monitored on a weekly basis.
2.2. Study design
This was a 12 week, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled
augmentation trial. Patients were randomized to identical looking
pimozide or placebo capsules by the research pharmacist who was
not involved with the subjects. Study medication was started at
1 mg/day and the maximum dose of 4 mg/day was reached by the
end of week 7, allowing for evaluation for at least 5 weeks.
2.3. Statistical analyses
All variables were examined for normality. Transformations were
applied as necessary. Mixed effects models were fitted to examine
the effects of pimozide augmentation on each of the response measures except the two CGI measures (severity and improvement).
Due to the ordinal nature of the CGI outcomes, we used GEE approach
with cumulative logit link and multinomial distribution. In both the
mixed models and the GEE models, treatment (clozapine+pimozide
vs. clozapine+placebo) was a fixed between-subject factor, time (all
time points when the response variable was measured) was a fixed
within-subject factor and we also examined the interaction between
treatment and time. In the mixed models the best fitting variance
variance–covariance structure was selected based on Schwarz-Bayesian
Information Criterion (BIC). To explain significant effects in the model,
post-hoc tests were performed.
3. Results
A total of 46 patients consented and 32 were randomized (Fig. 1).
Prior to randomization, one subject developed a sudden sickness and
died, and another subject was terminated due to pneumonia. The
remaining 12 subjects were either ineligible or withdrew consent.

of the 5 subjects who withdrew consent did so before starting study
medications. After the start of study medications, there were 4 reportable
adverse events, involving brief hospitalizations in 2 subjects unrelated to
study participation, and 2 others related to QTc prolongation, one of
which necessitated early termination. Demographic characteristics of
the groups are provided in Table 1.
For BPRS total scores, there was only a significant main effect of time
[F(3,71)=5.45, p=0.002], (Table 2). BPRS scores at weeks 8 and 12
were significantly lower than the scores at baseline. There was no
treatment× time interaction [F(3,71)=0.88, p=0.46], indicating that
both the placebo and pimozide groups significantly improved over
time (Fig. 2). BPRS psychosis subscale items followed the same pattern,
with a significant main effect of time [F(3,71)=4.47, p=0.006], but no
treatment× time interaction (Fig. 3). Depression items of BPRS (somatic
concern, anxiety, guilt, depressed mood) did not show any effects of
time or treatment. Similarly, SANS total scores also showed a significant
main effect of time [F(3,70)=4.67, p=0.005] but no main effect of
treatment (Fig. 4). CGI severity scores did not show any treatment
effects. Consistent with the BPRS total score changes, CGI improvement
scores showed a significant main effect of time [F(2,11.01)=0.004] but
there were no treatment effects.
There were no significant medication effects for AIMS, Simpson-Angus
scores, systolic or diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, weight or QTc
values over time.
There was a significant main effect of treatment [F(1,25)= 5.16,
p=0.03] on clozapine blood levels, subjects in the augmentation arm
showing significantly higher clozapine levels. However, when the mixed
model analysis was run with baseline clozapine levels as a covariate,
there were no significant treatment differences [F(1,22)=0.31, p=0.58].
Digit symbol, letter-number sequencing, Trails A and B, RAVLT
(list A and B), and verbal fluency measures did not reveal significant
treatment effects. For digit span, there was a significant main effect of
type (forward vs backward) [F(1,25)=124.64, pb0.0001], showing
better performance for the forward version, but no main effect of treatment [F(1,25)=0.0, p=0.98] and no interaction between treatment
and week [F(1,25)=5.26, uncorrected p=0.03] after correction for
multiple tests.
4. Discussion
Our findings do not suggest a beneficial effect of pimozide augmentation for clozapine partial responders with schizophrenia. Interestingly,
this seems to be due to a significant placebo response that mimicked
the response pattern in the active group. Our results parallel another
recently published study with similar aims (Friedman et al., 2011),
highlighting the importance of controlled clinical trials due to considerable placebo response rates even in highly treatment resistant
populations.
We need to acknowledge that this is a relatively small-scale trial.
But the strengths include a double-blind, placebo controlled design
and inclusion of patients with adequate blood levels of clozapine
prior to augmentation.
Several previous augmentation strategies using antipsychotics
offered limited benefit (Honer et al., 2006; Freudenreich et al., 2007;
Fleischhacker et al., 2010; Friedman et al., 2011). Our findings together

with these studies suggest that clozapine monotherapy in optimum
doses already maximizes pharmacologic response leaving little room
for dopamine blockers for further improvement in this population.
Therefore, clinicians should carefully consider the necessity of adding
a second potent dopamine blocker in patients with clozapine-resistant
schizophrenia.
