ABSTRACT - Of 49 schizophrenic patients followed up 2 years after their first
admission to hospital, 37% were well, 47% had been readmitted to hospital at some
time over the 2 years, and 38% showed schizophrenic symptoms at follow-up. A
poor outcome at 2 years was associated with male sex, poor outcome after the first 5
weeks of the first admission, negative schizophrenic symptoms on first admission,
and a diagnosis of definite or probable schizophrenia using the Feighner criteria.
Only 23Vo were in employment. A small double-blind discontinuation study of
maintenance antipsychotic medication during the second year found more relapses in
those switched to placebo medication. Repeat psychometric assessment at 2 years
confirmed modest improvements found at 12 months; that is, there was no evidence
of intellectual decline. Relatives showed no more psychosocial distress than that
found in a normal community sample; what distress there was correlated with
patients’ schizophrenic symptoms.
Received April 28, 1989; accepted for publication June 28, 1989
A cohort of 49 first-episode schizophrenics was
identified. The project aims to chart the clinical
course of the illness (l), to assess the efficacy of
drug treatment (2), to examine intellectual (3) and
radiological (4) changes, and to measure the impact
of the illness on patients’ relatives (5). Progress
over the 12 months following their first admission
has been described (6); the present study describes
progress over the first 2 years. A subsequent report
will describe progress over the first 5 years.
Material and methods
The acute course of the patients’ first episode has
been described in detail elsewhere (1-3, 5). Briefly, 49 patients received a clinical diagnosis of
schizophrenia but were also assessed by the Present State Examination (7) and Feighner (8) and
Research Diagnostic Criteria (RDC) (9). Social
and demographic data were recorded and patients were psychometrically assessed by Raven’s

Each symptom on the Krawiecka Scale had to be rated at least

Progressive Matrices (lo), Mill Hill Vocabulary
Scale (ll), the block design and similarities subtests of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (12)
and the Digit Copying Test (13). Changes in
mental state were assessed by the Krawiecka
Scale (14) and parkinsonism (15) and abnormal
movements (16) were also measured. At the same
time the patient’s main caregiver, defined as the
parent or sibling of a single patient or the spouse
of a married patient who lived with that patient,
was assessed through the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28) (17) and the Social Adjustment Scale Self-Report (SAS-SR) (18).
Progress over the 12 months following the first
admission (6) was measured in the following
way: mental state, parkinsonism and abnormal
movements were assessed at 3, 6, 9 and 12
months after the first admission, and at relapse.
Patients’ relatives were also reassessed at 6 and
12 months; at 12 months social and demographic
data were recorded and repeat psychometric assessment carried out.
Two-year follow-up
Patient and relative characteristics assessed during the first year were reassessed during the second year at the same time intervals.
Medication
During the acute first episode patients received
either pimozide or oral flupenthixol. Those who

responded satisfactorily to drug treatment and
gave consent received in the first year in a double-blind study either once-weekly pimozide or
intramuscular flupenthixol decanoate as maintenance therapy. The other patients were treated
with neuroleptics of the clinicians’ choice. During the second year, patients who took part in the
first year’s double-blind study, had not experienced a relapse (defined as a deterioration in
schizophrenic symptoms or behaviour sufficient
to warrant the patient’s withdrawal from the
study), and gave consent entered a double-blind
study of active medication (either once-weekly
pimozide or intramuscular flupenthixol decanoate) vs placebo medication. The other patients
were again treated with neuroleptics of the clinicians’ choice. Antiparkinsonian medication was
prescribed as required.
Results
There are considerable gaps in the results because
of lack of cooperation or loss of contact with
both patients and relatives, either intermittent or
complete; however, only 2 patients were completely lost to follow-up.
After 24 months there were no significant
changes in patients’ domiciliary status, but the
level of unemployment had risen from 21% on
first admission to 58%.
At 24 months, the mental state of 32 patients
was rated by the Krawiecka Scale. Seven patients
(22%) showed positive schizophrenic symptoms,
8 (25%) negative symptoms and 9 (28Vo) non-

schizophrenic symptoms; 17 (53%) showed no
symptoms at all (Table 1). Forty-one percent had
been readmitted to hospital on at least one occasion during the second year on account of a
worsening of schizophrenic symptoms or a further schizophrenic episode (Table 2). Outcome
over 2 years was assessed in a way broadly similar to another first episode study (19). Patients
were categorized as having a good outcome (no
readmissions and neither positive nor negative
schizophrenic symptoms at 24-month follow-up),
or poor outcome (readmission and/or negative
symptoms at follow-up (Table 3). Information
was obtained on 38 patients: 14 (37%) had a
good and 24 (63%) a poor outcome. The numbers in the poor outcome group may have been
iatrogenically increased by the drug study (see
below). There were more males in the poor outcome group (63% vs 21%; x2 = 4.49, P < 0.05).
In the good outcome group there were more who
responded to treatment during the first 5 weeks
of their first admission and were subsequently
switched to maintenance therapy (79% vs 33%;
x2 = 5.54, P < 0.02). More patients in the poor
outcome group had negative schizophrenic symptoms on first admission (39% vs 14vo) and fulfilled the Feighner criteria for definite or probable schizophrenia (33% vs 14%) (NS).
Medication
Fifteen patients successfully completed the first
year’s double-blind study and cooperated with
the second year’s study, also double-blind, of
active vs placebo medication. Eight patients received active medication and none were readTable 3

mitted to hospital during the second 12 months;
7 received placebo medication and 4 (57%) were
readmitted. This difference in relapse rates just
failed to reach statistical significance (Fisher exact probability test). Thirty-six percent of patients in the good outcome group and 32% in the
poor outcome group received antipsychotic medication throughout the 2 years.
In 39 patients, the prescriptions of antiparkinsonian medication were known both at the beginning and end of the second year. Fewer patients
at the end were receiving antiparkinsonian drugs
(21% vs 33%) (NS; McNemar test).
One patient at the end of the 2 years had
moderately abnormal involuntary movements on
the global scale of the AIMS (16); however, she
had had abnormal movements before drug treatment of her first acute episode.
Psyc hornet ry
Of the 46 patients who were treated on first
admission, 21 (46%) were retested at 24 months.
Those retested at 24 months did not differ from
the others on the 5 tests administered on admission. Table 4 shows the changes in test performance over time in patients who were assessed
on all 3 occasions (n = 18); significant improvement was shown on matrices, block design and
digits while scores on vocabulary and similarities
were unchanged.
There were no significant associations between
improvement in mental state scores assessed by
the Krawiecka Scale on admission and at 2-year
follow-up and changes in test scores between
admission and 2-year assessment.
Relatives’ psychological and
social adjustment
Thirty-one main caregivers were assessed during
the patients’ first admission, but only 10 at 18-
and 11 at 24-month follow-up. Those who were
and were not followed up did not differ significantly in age, sex distribution, social class, relationship to patient or psychosocial status.
Psychological adjustment
On first admission relatives’ psychological distress as assessed by the GHQ-28 was greater than

that of a normal community sample; 77% of
relatives were above the threshold score (4/5) for
case identification (17). This persisted, but to a
lesser extent, at 12 months; 40% were cases. At
24 months, however, only 18% were categorized
as exhibiting psychological distress, a figure similar to the expected population norm for the United Kingdom (20). The mean score in relatives
assessed both on admission and at follow-up was
lower at 24 months (2.7 (SD 4.2) vs 4.6 (7.4))
(NS; paired t-test).
Social adjustment
On first admission, relatives’ social functioning
was poorer than that of a normal community
sample (21); this persisted at 12 months. At 24
months, however, mean global social adjustment
scores were similar to that of the normal sample.
The mean score in relatives assessed both on
admission and follow-up was lower at 24 months
(1.53 (0.33) vs 1.72 (0.48)), indicating an improvement in social adjustment (NS).
The relatives’ responses on the GHQ and SASSR were positively correlated with the patients’
symptoms measured by the Krawiecka Scale.
This applied to positive and negative but not
nonschizophrenic symptoms.
Discussion
The difficulties encountered during the first 12
months after admission in adequately following a
cohort of 49 first-episode schizophrenic patients
and their relatives persisted over the second 12
months. Not only did a small number of patients
default and more keep outpatient appointments
irregularly, but many patients resented (and refused) further psychometric assessment; similarly, a number of relatives refused reassessment of
their own psychosocial status. Thus the results
over 2 years must be treated with caution; however, on a more positive note, only 2 patients
were completely lost to follow-up and patients
and relatives, where reassessed, did not differ
obviously from those who were not interviewed.
At 2 years only 23% were in employment, a
considerably lower percentage than in the recent
Northwick Park study, in which 2 years after
discharge, 50% were employed (22); however,
general unemployment in Scotland has been
higher than in the southeast of England for many
decades. A good clinical outcome at 2 years
(neither readmission nor schizophrenic symptoms
at follow-up) was found in only 37% of patients;
this observation is similar to the Northwick Park
findings, as 60% had relapsed over 2 years, but
lower than the 1 year findings in an American
study (19) where the outcome for 56% of patients was good. The numbers in the poor outcome group may have been influenced by the
switch to placebo of 7 patients, 4 of whom
subsequently relapsed. If all 4 had not relapsed
during the second year, then the percentage with
a good clinical outcome would have risen to 47vo
- still less than a half.
Poor outcome was associated with a number
of patient characteristics. More in the poor outcome group tended to fulfil the Feighner criteria
for probable or definite schizophrenia. A principal difference between Feighner positive and negative patients is that positive patients must have
shown symptoms for at least 6 months. The
Northwick Park group (22) has suggested that
failure to institute early treatment is associated
with susceptibility to relapse.
The association of poor outcome with male sex
has recently been comprehensively reviewed (23).
The cause of the association is not clear but it
may be that premorbid functioning is poorer in 
FIRST EPISODE SCHIZOPHRENICS: FOLLOW-UP 601
schizophrenic men, and that a poor premorbid
history leads to a poorer outcome.
Negative symptoms did not respond to drug
treatment during the acute first episode (2); it is
therefore not surprising that patients with such
symptoms did poorly at follow-up, as the presence of negative symptoms was by definition a
sign of poor outcome. Negative schizophrenic
symptoms are commonly associated with chronic
schizophrenia; however, it is noteworthy that, in
the present series of studies, negative symptoms
were most commonly found during the patient’s
admission for the first acute episode.
Perhaps the most interesting association with
outcome at 2 years was outcome after 5 weeks of
drug treatment in the first acute episode. Patients
who did poorly in the first 5 weeks and were not
deemed suitable for transfer to maintenance antipsychotic medication did poorly over 2 years.
Patients who were switched to maintenance therapy after 5 weeks subsequently did well. Those
who did well may have done so for 2 reasons.
Some may have had only one acute episode anyway, and others may have been protected by
maintenance therapy. This is supported by the
double-blind discontinuation study in the second
year; none who continued on therapy but most
who were switched to placebo were readmitted to
hospital. Perhaps those who do poorly in the
first 5 weeks have to be monitored carefully and
treated more vigorously; only 32% in the poor
outcome group received antipsychotic medication
continuously throughout the 2 years.
The use of antiparkinsonian drugs fell slowly
over the 2 years, from administration to 80% of
patients during treatment of the first acute episode to 21% by the end of 2 years; this is
presumably caused by the much lower dose of
antipsychotic drugs in the maintenance period.
Abnormal movements, as assessed by AIMS,
were found in only one patient at the end of 2
years, a patient who had such movements before
drug treatment of the acute first episode. Tardive
dyskinesia does not yet appear to be a problem in
the present cohort.
Psychometric findings at 2 years’ follow-up
consolidate the findings at 12 months (6). Where
improvement took place, it happened comparatively early, as there was little change between
the 2 follow-up assessments. There is a clear
message for those who would seek to assess intellectual deterioration in persons suffering from
schizophrenia; assessment in the ward when the
illness is in an acute phase gives a poor indication
of baseline intelligence. There is no evidence in
the present cohort of intellectual deterioration at
the end of 2 years, apparent in more chronic
schizophrenics (24); speculatively, is treatment
preventing it from occurring?
Findings at first admission and at 1-year follow-up revealed considerable psychosocial distress among relatives, assessed by the GHQ and
SAS-SR. After 2 years, relatives who were reassessed did not differ from a normal community
population. In another study of chronic schizophrenics living with relatives (25), 32% of primary supporters were cases as assessed by the
GHQ-28; numbers are small, but perhaps the
lower figure in the present study is a reflection of
interest and support given by professionals in the
setting of a research project. However, there is
no room for complacency for, as with the 12-
month follow-up results, relatives’ psychosocial
distress remained positively correlated with
symptoms of schizophrenia as rated by the Krawiecka Scale. This suggests that relatives are still
responding, albeit at a lower lever, to patients’
psychopathology and may need continuing help
to come to terms with the distressing symptoms
of schizophrenia.
We conclude, as we did after one year (6), that
the management and outcome of schizophrenia
leaves a lot to be desired. Good clinical outcome
was achieved in about a third of the present
cohort and less that a quarter were in open
employment. On the credit side, there was no
evidence of intellectual deterioration among patients, and relatives’ distress had diminished
greatly.
