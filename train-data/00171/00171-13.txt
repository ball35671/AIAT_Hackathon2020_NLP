A comparative controlled trial of
pimozide and fluphenazine decanoate in the
continuation therapy of schizophrenia

SYNOPSrs Evidence from a controlled, comparative trial indicates that oral pimozide is clinically
at least as effective as depot injections of fluphenazine decanoate in the continuation therapy of a
group of schizophrenic patients discharged from hospital. The administration of pimozide was
associated with fewer unwanted effects. The implications of the findings are discussed.
INTRODUCTION
A decade ago the advent of depot injections of
neuroleptic medication was hailed as a major
breakthrough in the maintenance treatment of
schizophrenia. A number of inadequately controlled studies with these compounds have since
purported to demonstrate that a greater number
of schizophrenic patients could be maintained
in the community for a greater length of time
(Crumpton, 1968; Denham & Adamson, 1971;
Johnson & Freeman, 1972; Imlah & Murphy,
1970). Clinics managed by community psychiatric nurses have been established to administer injections and to supervise care and support.
In a well-designed double-blind trial Hirsch et
al. (1973) confirmed the efficacy of probably the
most widely used long-acting phenothiazine,
fluphenazine decanoate, suggesting that the drug
not only counteracted the relapse of florid
schizophrenic symptoms but also appeared to
prevent social deterioration (Stevens, 1972). The
results of a similar study by Crawford & Forrest
(1974) indicated that fluphenazine decanoate was
superior to oral trifluoperazine. In both these
studies the populations were drawn from patients
already receiving injections regularly at followup clinics.
Questions of pharmacological action apart,
the use of depot injections has also been attended
by debates about the route of administration
and the associated side-effects. The ability to

control levels of medication has been advanced
as the major advantage of parenteral administration over oral preparations. Much less has been
made of the difficulties in establishing and maintaining patients on injections. Nor has there
been any rigorous test of the assumption that
patients who refuse oral medication are more
willing to accept injections. Indeed, although a
high rate of defaulting on oral medication has
been publicized (Blackwell, 1976), it is noteworthy that 2 carefully conducted studies (Leff &
Wing, 1971; Rifkin et al. 1977) reported adequate ingestion by out-patients who were
closely supervised.
The unwanted clinical effects of these compounds have attracted much attention in their
own right. Increasing concern has recently been
expressed over the adverse effects of prolonged
neuroleptic administration, particularly those
suggesting irreversible brain damage (Hunter et
al. 1964; Kazamatsuri et al 1972; Ayd, 1974), a
possible association with depression (de Alarcon
& Carney, 1969) and the lack of adequate drive
and poor social functioning (Andrews, 1973).
Such clinically important phenomena have
raised the question of how far any benefits
afforded by long-acting phenothiazine injections
may be limited by side-effects. They also point
to the need for examining carefully new pharmacological compounds which may be superior by
virtue of therapeutic action, mode of administration or paucity of undesired effects.
One new preparation for which several
advantages have been claimed is the oral diphenylbutylpiperidine derivative, pimozide. In a
59
60 /. Falloon, D. C. Watt and Michael Shepherd
comprehensive review Pinder et al. (1976) conclude that pimozide is as effective as other forms
of oral continuation therapy; that it is more
effective in the apathetic, withdrawn patient,
than the hyperactive, aggressive type; that
extrapyramidal side-effects, predominantly akathisia, occur infrequently; and that other sideeffects, including sedation, are rare in doses of
less than 10 mg daily. In addition, pimozide can
be administered once daily, a mode of prescription which is said to improve the regularity of
ingestion.
The therapeutic actions of this oral neuroleptic have not hitherto been compared directly
with those of the well-established long-acting
phenothiazine regime. In this study a comparative trial of pimozide and fluphenazine decanoate
in the treatment of schizophrenia was carried
out with the aim of assessing the relative
efficacy of the 2 compounds in respect of (1)
relapse and rate of relapse of florid schizophrenic
symptomatology, (2) depressive symptomatology, (3) admission to hospital, (4) adverse
effects, frequency and severity, (5) regularity of
medication, (6) social functioning.
This paper is concerned principally with
clinical aspects of the investigation. A more
detailed account of the social aspects is to be
presented in a subsequent paper.
METHOD
Design
The study was designed to compare the effectiveness of 2 forms of continuation therapy in a
population of schizophrenic patients returning
to the community following hospital treatment
of an acute schizophrenic episode. The 2 drugs
employed were the oral preparation, pimozide,
and injectable fluphenazine decanoate. In order
to preserve double-blind conditions patients
were required to take both an injection and a
tablet (cf. Crawford & Forrest, 1974). Fig. 1
depicts the overall design of the study diagrammatically.
Procedure
Part I. Pimozide vs. fluphenazine decanoate
Over a period of 20 months a clinical assessment
was made of all patients aged 17-60 years with a
suspected diagnosis of schizophrenia who were
admitted to the acute wards of St John's Hospital, Stone. Shortly after their admission an
abbreviated version of the Present State Examination (PSE) (Wing et al. 1974) was administered by one investigator (I.F.). A diagnosis of
'definite' schizophrenia was made in the presence of either 1 or more 'first rank' symptoms,
in the absence of persistent mood disturbance,
using the classification of Schneider (1959); or
of 2 or more other symptoms associated with
florid schizophrenia, e.g. delusions (not 'first
rank'), hallucinations (visual, olfactory, touch,
'dissociative'), catatonic behaviour, idiosyncratic or incoherent speech in the absence of
persistent mood disturbance; or of 3 or more
florid symptoms accompanied by a persistent
mood disturbance. If 1 symptom other than
'first rank' was elicited in the absence of persistent mood disturbance, or 2 such symptoms
plus a persistent mood disturbance, then a

diagnosis of 'probable' schizophrenia was
made. Patients in both categories were
considered suitable for entry to the trial.
Prior to leaving hospital and returning to the
community patients meeting the criteria for
inclusion in the trial were randomly allocated
to one of the following medication regimes
under double-blind control conditions:
(A) Active pimozide tablets + inert fluphenazine injections, or
(B) Active fluphenazine injections + inert pimozide tablets.
A flexible drug-dosage was employed. The
majority of patients were taking a constant
dosage of 25 mg fluphenazine fortnightly or 8
mg pimozide daily. The maximum dose of fluphenazine was 50 mg weekly, and the maximum
dose of pimozide was 16 mg daily. When considered necessary on clinical grounds both
active substance and placebo were altered proportionately in a ratio of 8 mg pimozide (or
inert tablets) per day to 25 mg fluphenazine (or
inert injection) per 2 weeks. Additional neuroleptic medication was prohibited, but minor
tranquillizers, sedatives, anti-depressants and
anti-parkinsonian preparations were administered when indicated.
At the time of discharge from hospital patients
were stabilized on the trial drugs only. One
month after discharge a clinical and a social
assessment were made independently by the
research clinician and a social worker employing
a standardized interview. Both assessments
were repeated either 12 months later or earlier
if the patient relapsed. The definition of relapse
is given below.
Part II. Withdrawal of injections: pimozide vs.
placebo
The very strong belief in parenteral maintenance therapy prevalent among most participating consultant physicians with clinical responsibility for the trial patients rendered it
impossible to include a group receiving active
pimozide tablets only. Since it has been asserted
that injections exert a more potent placebo
effect than tablets it might be suggested that a
placebo injection could contribute more to the
action of active pimozode than an inert tablet
to that of the active fluphenazine. To examine
this question indirectly we obtained consent to
withdraw injections (both active and inert) from
a cohort of patients who had remained well
throughout the previous 12-month period of the
trial. The 20 patients in this group continued to
receive tablets from the follow-up clinic under
double-blind conditions. Twelve were receiving
active pimozide, and 8 inert tablets. All were
followed up for a further 6 months.
Out-patient management
All trial medication was dispensed by a community nursing sister at a schizophrenic followup clinic. The community nurse briefly examined
the patients on each clinic attendance and informed the psychiatrists supervising out-patient
management of any significant changes in
clinical state that might require further consultation. Records of all clinic attendances were kept.
When patients failed to attend the clinic the
community nurse made contact with them at
their homes and arranged to dispense the
prescribed medication. All these procedures
were identical to those commonly practised at
the schizophrenic clinic except for the dispensing
of the tablets required by the conditions of the
trial. Patients were asked to return tablet containers and the regularity of their tablet-taking
was noted. The community nurse prompted
regular drug ingestion whenever necessary, and
a further check was provided by the incorporation of 2 mg of riboflavin in each tablet, both
active and inert. When absorbed, the riboflavine
can be detected in urine as a green fluorescence
by a beam of light (Jones & Letemendia, 1966;
Leff & Wing, 1971). Random urine checks were
made throughout the trial on each patient.
The prescription of additional medication was
usually carried out by the patient's general
practitioner to whom a letter was sent explaining
that the patient was taking part in a controlled
trial and requesting that other neuroleptic
drugs be withheld.
Methods of assessment
Schizophrenic relapse/deterioration
A schizophrenic relapse was defined as a reappearance or exacerbation of schizophrenic
symptoms that led to withdrawal from the trial,
whether or not it resulted in re-admission to
hospital. This decision was made by the supervising clinician.
62 /. Falloon, D. C. Watt and Michael Shepherd
Schizophrenic and depressive phenomenology
One month after discharge on trial medication
all patients were assessed for the presence of
schizophrenic or depressive symptoms on the
abbreviated PSE schedule. This assessment was
repeated at the time of relapse, or 12 months
after the initial assessment on patients who did
not relapse. Whenever possible these assessments were carried out in the patient's home.
Adverse effects
Adverse effects were assessed at each clinical
examination. A check-list of common sideeffects was used as a guide, and the severity of
each symptom was assessed on a 3-point scale
(0 = absent; 1 = present; 2 = severe). A score
of overall severity was obtained by combining
the scores, and the change in severity was
evaluated. In addition, discomfort attributed to
the medication was rated on a 0-8 scale.
Social assessment
The MRC Social Performance Schedule (Stevens,
1972) was administered by a specially trained
research worker at the same time as clinical
assessment. Details and results are reported in
a separate paper. The social assessments were
usually made in the patient's home.
RESULTS
Characteristics of the patient-population
Because only about one third of the 136 eligible
patients entered the trial it is important to
examine the mechanism of selection (Leff, 1973).

Remained in hospital 7
Table 1 summarizes this process. Seven patients
were destined to remain in hospital throughout
the duration of the trial and were therefore
excluded from selection for the trial. Of the
remainder, the main reasons for failure to enter
the study were an unwillingness on the part of
responsible physicians to employ the trial
medication (44 %) and of patients to participate
(15%). The physicians' decisions were based (a)
on a preference for an oral preparation (19%),
(b) an opinion that patients were suitable for
maintenance therapy with depot preparations
only (12%), and (c) a disagreement with the
diagnosis of schizophrenia (7%). A history of
tablet-defaulting by the patient and a personal
preference for combined oral and injectable
medication were also relevant to the clinical
decisions. In sum, about one-fifth of the patients
were considered too ill to enter the trial, and a
further one-fifth were regarded as more suitable
for oral preparations. A few patients were withdrawn at a later stage of the trial because of an
unsatisfactory response to treatment. When
patients rejected the trial they did so chiefly
because of a disinclination for any form of
maintenance therapy or a dislike of injections.
Only one patient expressed a preference for
injections. A further group of patients (7%)
commenced the trial regime in hospital, but did
not continue the medication after the first
monthly follow-up; a small number refused to
continue treatment or relapsed soon after discharge.
Table 2 shows the principal socio-demographic characteristics of the 44 patients who
entered the trial from a total potential population of 136. Forty-three were classified 'definitely' schizophrenic and 1 'probably' schizophrenic. In terms of the Catego classification
system (Wing et al. 1974) 40 fitted the category
'schizophrenic psychosis' (class S), and 4 that of
'delusional psychosis' (class D): 3 of the latter
group relapsed with a diagnosed 'schizophrenic
psychosis' during the trial. A past history of
non-schizophrenic illness, it should be noted,
did not exclude patients from the trial.
For the purpose of comparison, patients with
the same symptomatology were selected from a
cohort taken from those who were considered
eligible for the trial over a period of 1 year but
were eventually excluded. As may be seen from
Table 2, the patients entering the trial differed

significantly (using chi-square or Student's /
tests where appropriate) only in that among the
excluded patients there were more first admissions where, as was to be expected, continuation
treatment was less frequently indicated. The
excluded patients were therefore younger, more
often single and more often living with parents
(only the last was significant, however). There
was no material difference between the trial and
excluded groups in respect of age of onset,
previous employment, or duration of hospitalization.
Within the 2 trial groups, the patients treated
by fluphenazine included significantly more first
admissions (P < 005), and a greater number
with a duration of illness of less than 1 year
(P < 005). In all other respects there were no
significant differences (Table 3).

Three patients on pimozide had to be withdrawn
from the trial, 2 refusing to continue medication
and the third suffering from an overdose of antidepressants.

Schizophrenic relapse
Of the 21 patients receiving pimozide who completed the trial 5 (24%) relapsed with schizophrenic symptoms, compared with 8 (40%) of
the 20 patients receiving fluphenazine. The
difference is not statistically significant. A survival curve (Fig. 2) indicated that there was no
difference in the rate of relapse on the 2 drugs
(log-rank test, chi-square = 1-43; df = 1; P>
0-2).
About half the trial population displayed
schizophrenic symptoms at the 1-month assessment, the proportions being similar for both
drugs. All the relapses represented an exacerbation of persistent symptomatology rather than
the reappearance of symptoms from a symptomfree state. Eleven of the 13 relapsing patients
(85%) had exhibited 'first rank' Schneiderian
symptoms at the 1-month follow-up, compared
with only 4 of the 28 (14%) patients who did not
relapse. Thus the presence of 'first rank' symptoms at the 1-month assessment was strongly
associated with subsequent relapse (P < 0-005).
However, fewer than half of the patients who
relapsed in this way needed admission to hospital.
Depression and relapse
From Table 4 it is apparent that depression was
the principal reason for readmission to hospital
during the follow-up period. Readmission was
necessary for the treatment of depressive symptoms in 7 patients. In 4 of these no schizophrenic
symptoms at all were evident on admission; the
schizophrenic symptoms exhibited by the other

3 patients did not call for any change in treatment and the therapeutic regime in hospital was
directed towards the affective component of the
clinical picture. Readmission was not associated
with either drug regime.
Eighteen patients were recorded as having
had depressive symptoms when seen originally
in hospital, and the same number (though not
the same patients) suffered episodes of significant
depression during the trial. Depression was
recorded of 8 patients at the 1-month follow-up,
and of 12 patients at the 12-month follow-up
period, in conjunction with schizophrenia symptoms and regardless of medication. Depressive
symptoms were significantly associated with
schizophrenic relapse (P < 0-05), but it may be
observed that while one quarter of the population displayed depressive symptomatology at the
second clinical assessment they exhibited no
schizophrenic symptoms at that time.
Of the 2 drug-regimes, fluphenazine was
associated with a greater proportion of depressed
patients at 1 year (P < 005), and this was more
prominent among the group without schizophrenic symptoms. Anti-depressant medication,
as already mentioned, was prescribed at the
discretion of the supervising clinician. After 1
year or at the time of relapse only 7 patients on
fluphenazine and 3 on pimozide were taking
anti-depressants so that the preponderance of
depression among patients treated with fluphenazine cannot be attributed to a greater modification of depressive symptoms in pimozide-treated
patients through the use of anti-depressants.
However, there was also an association between
depressive symptomatology, drug and certain
social factors, in that less satisfactory interpersonal contacts were significantly associated
with both the fluphenazine group of patients
and a depressive symptomatology (Falloon et al.
1978).
Adverse effects
A comparison of adverse effects showed that the
pattern was very similar with both drugs (Table
5, Fig. 3), most frequently including extrapyramidal symptoms, blurred vision, drowsiness
and depressed mood. The high estimate of
akathisia is probably explained by the fact that
this symptom included either overt restlessness
or the subjective experience of restlessness.
However, whereas the frequency of extrapyramidal symptoms tended to decrease after a
1-year follow-up on pimozide, they tended to
increase with fluphenazine. Oral dyskinesia was
noted in 3 patients on each drug but was not

prominent. The excitable states reported in
some studies of pimozide (Marshall, 1971) were
not encountered. Blurred vision was associated
with anti-parkinsonian medication in more than
half the patients (P < 001). As more patients
on fluphenazine were taking anti-parkinsonian
drugs this contributed to the greater adverse
effects total found among patients in the
fluphenazine group.
The quantitative ratings of severity and discomfort showed significantly greater reductions
among patients on pimozide than on fluphenazine after 1 year (P < 002). Discomfort ratings
showed a significant positive association with
irregularity of tablet taking (Table 6).
Sixty per cent of patients were taking antiparkinsonian medication after 1 year. The
proportion of patients on pimozide who assessed
this medication as helpful was similar to that of
the fluphenazine group.
Drug-taking and drug-defaulting
Only 4 patients were adjudged to have refused
to take medication at the time of relapse, 2 on
each drug regime. The remainder, whether
receiving pimozide or fluphenazine, took an
adequate dosage of the prescribed medication.
Twenty-two patients (50%) showed evidence of
irregular tablet-taking at some stage of the trial,

was similar for both drugs (46 % pimozide; 55 %
fluphenazine). Sixteen patients (36 %) missed at
least one injection during the trial in spite of
domiciliary visits by the community nurse and
again the proportions were similar (42%
pimozide; 30% fluphenazine); all these patients
were also tablet-defaulters. There was a significant association between irregularity of medication and the presence of schizophrenic symptoms
at the 1-year follow-up or at relapse, regardless
of the nature of the medication (P < 0-05).

significantly more first admissions (P < 0-01),

durations of hospitalization (P < 005), and
employment (P < 005) than in the remaining
trial patients.
During the additional 6-month follow-up of
these patients, who had discontinued their
injections and continued on active pimozide or
placebo tablets, 4 further relapses occurred: 3
among the 8 patients taking placebo and 1 of the
12 on pimozide (Table 7). The numbers are small
but the placebo data indicate that a substantial
proportion of patients are not then in need of
medication.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
The results of this study favour the conclusion
that oral pimozide given once daily is clinically
at least as effective as depot injections of fluphenazine decanoate during 1 year of continuation therapy administered to a representative
group of recently discharged schizophrenic
patients. The principal criteria of outcome were a
schizophrenic relapse, the rate of relapse, depressive symptomatology, adverse effects and the
regularity of medication.
A third of the patients who entered the trial
relapsed during the 12 months, a substantially
higher proportion than those reported in studies
of long-acting phenothiazines based on patients
who are already established attenders at followup clinics (Hirsch et al. 1973; Crawford & Forrest, 1974; Rifkin et al. 1977) and one which
resembles the relapse rate reported in another
study on a comparable population receiving oral
phenothiazines (Leff & Wing, 1971). This
finding suggests that results derived from patientpopulations already stablized in attendance at a
clinic may fail to do justice to the difficulties
encountered in establishing patients on maintenance therapy. In the present study several
patients considered suitable for long-acting
medication refused injections, while others
commenced their trial regime in hospital but
were withdrawn, or did not attend the clinic on
discharge.
The suggestion that the apparent effectiveness
of pimozide might have been due in part to a
placebo effect of the concurrent inert injections
is contradicted by the finding that discontinuation of the injection did not increase the relapse
rate. On the other hand, the significance of the
supervision, support and continuity of care provided by the community nurses cannot be discounted and might well be usefully extended to
the administration of oral medication as well as
injections. Though withdrawal of active maintenance therapy after 1 year without relapse was
associated with infrequent relapse, this finding
does little to shed light on the dilemma of when
to discontinue long-term medication.
The difficulties encountered in the assessment
of the clinical outcome of the treatment of
schizophrenia are well illustrated by this study.
If, as Leff (1976) has concluded, there are no
altogether satisfactory methods of measuring
Pimozide and fluphenazine decanoate in continuation therapy 69
schizophrenic symptomatology, it becomes imperative to supplement this index with relatively
gross indicators of change, such as readmission
to hospital. The most striking fact about the
readmitted patients, however, turned out to be
that more than half were completely free of
schizophrenic symptoms. The general use of the
reappearance of schizophrenic symptoms as a
measure of change was vitiated by the finding
that half the patients had overt symptoms 1
month after discharge. The presence of these
symptoms so soon after discharge frequently
went undetected by psychiatrists at routine outpatient examinations, but became apparent
when a full mental state assessment was made by
the research psychiatrist in the patient's home.
Many patients, it seems, may show greater
openness in the security of their homes and may
be less willing to reveal symptoms on clinic visits,
particularly if the symptoms do not handicap
them at the time. In practice, therefore, relapse
was most frequently equated, with an exacerbation of symptoms already present. Sometimes
this was associated with a stressful event, or a
crisis within the patient's living group that
reduced their tolerance towards the disorder;
it was then not always clear whether a true
exacerbation had occurred or whether social
circumstances had merely highlighted persistent
symptoms.
Schizophrenic syndromes often preoccupy
clinicians to such an extent that other severe
psychopathology is disregarded; this is especially
true of depressive phenomena. Almost half the
patients in this study experienced depressive
episodes and more were readmitted to hospital
for treatment of depression than for schizophrenic relapses. McGlashan & Carpenter
(1976), in a review of post-psychotic depression,
drew attention to the lack of interest by psychiatrists in this important aspect of the course of a
schizophrenic illness since Mayer-Gross (1920)
originally described the state of despair of patients
that follows recovery from a psychotic illness,
and Sheldrick et al. (1977) have shown that
schizophrenia can be succeeded by an unequivocal affective disorder. The aetiology of
depressive symptoms in schizophrenia is probably multi-factorial and, although this study
suggests that fluphenazine decanoate may be
associated with depression more frequently than
pimozide, it is not clear whether this is a direct
effect of the drug; an effect mediated through
social and environmental variables; or a consequence of persistent schizophrenic symptoms.
Alternatively, it may be argued that pimozide
possesses anti-depressant properties. Not only
was pimozide as effective as fluphenazine decanoate in treating. symptomatology, it was
associated with fewer unwanted effects. Rifkin
et al. (1977) found a similar superiority of oral
fluphenazine over the depot preparation, though
it should be pointed out that, in a local survey,
Johnson (1975) found that the most frequently
used dose of fluphenazine after 1 year is lower
than that generally employed in this trial.
Pimozide side-effects tended to diminish with
time; akathisia, for example, was prominent at
an early stage but much less so later (Fig. 3).
One possible explanation for this reduction of
adverse effects over time could be a tendency
for patients who experienced them to take less
of the self-administered preparation. This hypothesis was supported by a significant association between marked side-effect discomfort
1 month after discharge from hospital and subsequent irregular ingestion (P < 0-5) followed
by a considerable reduction in the discomfort
attributed to pimozide on later assessment. Van
Putten (1974) has claimed that certain sideeffects tend to be associated with drug refusal,
most notably akathisia. In this trial there was
evidence to suggest that it was the patients
taking their pimozide tablets less regularly who
experienced akathisia and later tended to lose
this symptom. There was, however, only a slight
excess of relapses in those patients who failed
to ingest their pimozide tablets as prescribed. It
could therefore be suggested that self-adjustment
of dosage may constitute a useful self-regulative
mechanism, particularly when the patient is
supervised at a follow-up clinic and refusal to
take tablets can be forestalled. The association
of oral dyskinesia with pimozide administration
has not been previously reported and pimozide
has even been used in the treatment of phenothiazine-induced tardive dyskinesia (Claveria et
al. 1975). Although none of the dyskinesias were
severe this finding detracts from more optimistic
claims concerning side-effects.
