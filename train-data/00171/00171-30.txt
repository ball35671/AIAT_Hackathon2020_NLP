Summary-Pimozide and haloperidol were found to be equally effective in the treatment of acute
schizophrenia in a double-blind clinical trial involving 22 patients. Drug plasma levels measured
by radioimmunoassay (RIA) did not correlate with clinical response following either drug. Nor
was there any correlation between clinical response and the dopamine receptor blocking activity
of either drug as measured by radio receptor assay (RRA).
Following pimozide plasma prolactin (PRL) levels correlated with clinical change, although the
time courses of response of PRL and clinical response were dissimilar. There was no correlation
between PRL and clinical response to haloperidol.
RRA and RIA values correlated highly following pimozide but not haloperidol.
Our findings lead us to conclude that the RRA technique reflects the plasma level of a drug
rather than its central dopamine blocking activity. We also consider that the clinical response to
antipsychotic drugs in schizophrenia may be less directly linked to dopamine receptor blockade
than has previously been supposed.
INTRODUCTION
ACCORDING to the dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia, the psychotic symptoms observed
in this condition are thought to be related to alteration in central dopaminergic pathways
(CARLSSON, 1977). This view is based in part on the observation that drugs which are
effective in the treatment of acute schizophrenia share the property of inhibiting brain
dopamine pathways in experimental animals (CAIUSSON and L~NDQ~IST, 1963), and that
the dose required clinically correlates with the degree of DA receptor binding in vitro
(CREESE et al., 1976).
If central DA receptor blockade in vivo underlies the clinical efficacy of antipsychotic
drugs in schizophrenia, then drugs which are pharmacologically relatively specific DA
receptor blockers, such as pimozide, should be as effective clinically as compounds such
as chlorpromazine and haloperidol which have a wide spectrum of pharmacological
activities (ANDI%N, 1970). In addition, the degree of clinical improvement observed should
correspond with other indicators of DA receptor blockade, such as the plasma level of
prolactin (PRL), a hormone under tonic dopaminergic inhibition. LAMER et al. (1975)
did find a close correlation among a series of ‘classical’ neuroleptic drugs between their

clinical potency in schizophrenia and their potency in raising circulating prolactin levels
in normal subjects.
In previous studies, pimozide was indeed found to be as effective as haloperidol
(HMS and BECKMAN, 1982) and chlorpromazine (PECKNOLD et al., 1982) in relieving
symptoms in patients suffering from schizophrenia, although in another study the sedative
properties of chlorpromazine were thought to give it a therapeutic advantage (CHOUINARD
and ANNABLE, 1982).
The relationship between clinical improvement and plasma PRL has been less clear-cut.
While the therapeutic efficacy of chlorpromazine was accompanied by a rise in PRL,
the degree of clinical response was not consistently related to the degree of elevation of
PRL (WILES et al., 1976; KOLAKOWSKA et al., 1979; RAo et al., 1980). In a placebocontrolled study of a-flupenthixol in acute schizophrenia, clinical response took place
over a longer time course than the rise in plasma PRL (COTES et a/., 1978), suggesting
that effective DA receptor blockade may occur long before full clinical resolution.
A radio receptor assay (RRA) has been developed to measure the dopamine receptor
binding activity of antipsychotic drugs in plasma (CREESE and SNYDER, 1977); this
allows the relationship between dopamine receptor blockade and clinical response to be
examined in another way. For, if clinical response to antipsychotic drugs depends on
central DA receptor blockade, then the DA receptor binding activity of such drugs in the
plasma of patients (as measured by RRA) should correlate with clinical response, assuming
that the degree of receptor binding in the periphery reflects that in the brain. Preliminary
studies have indicated that patients with low plasma RRA values are likely to show a poor
response to the antipsychotic drugs in question as predicted by the dopamine hypothesis
(CALIL et al., 1979; COHEN et al., 1980; TUNE et al., 1981); but in at least one series
(COHEN et al., 1980) there was considerable overlap between plasma RRA levels of
responders and non-responders.
The present study was undertaken to measure, under double-blind conditions, two
putative indicators of DA receptor blockade, (i) the rise in plasma PRL and, (ii) RRA,
and to compare them with each other and with the clinical response following treatment
with pimozide or haloperidol.
METHODS
Twenty-two patients with acute schizophrenic illness (SPITZER et al., 1978) participated.
They all signed consent forms, having had the nature of the study explained to them.
There were 11 females and 11 males aged 19-68 yr (see Table 1). None had received more
than one dose of an antipsychotic drug within the previous week, or had been given an
injection of a long-acting ‘depot’ drug within the previous 4 weeks. Three of the females
in the pimozide group, and none in the haloperidol group were premenopausal. Patients
were randomly allocated to receive either pimozide or haloperidol in matching capsules
containing 5 mg of active drug. Ten patients received pimozide and 12 haloperidol;
there was reasonable matching between groups for sex, age, presenting symptoms and
number of previous episodes (see Table 1).
The severity of symptoms was rated on the Montgomery Rating Scale (MRS) (MONTGOMERY et al., 1978). Ratings were made on entry and after 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days’

treatment, generally by the same investigator. When the clinical situation demanded
urgent parenteral administration of an antipsychotic drug, intramuscular chlorpromazine
was used. Extrapyramidal side effects were treated with procyclidine. Temazepam or
nitrazepam was prescribed if night sedation was required.
Blood samples were collected in the mornings after each rating for determination of
drug levels, prolactin (PRL) and dopamine receptor blocking activity (RRA). Plasma for
assay was separated and stored at -20°C.
Prolactin was measured by radioimmunoassay using an anti-prolactin serum from
Dr. H. Friesen, ‘251-labelled prolactin (I.R.E., Fleurus, Belgium) and the International
Reference Preparation of prolactin, 75/504, as standard. Separation was carried out using
a solid phase second antibody (Sac-Cel, Wellcome Diagnostics). The within-assay precision
of this assay was 5% and the between-assay precision 1Ocrlo.
Dopamine receptor blocking activity was measured using a modification of the method
described by CREESE and SNYDER (1977) (LADER, 1980); 100 1.11 of sample was incubated at
37’C for 30 min with dopamine receptors derived from calf caudate and 3H-spiperone.
The final concentration of 3H-spiperone in the incubation mixture was 0.3 nmol/l.
Receptor-bound drug was separated by centrifugation, the resulting tissue pellet dissolved
in a scintillation fluid and radioactivity determined in a liquid scintillation counter.
Dopamine receptor-blocking activity of the plasma samples was expressed as nmol/l
equivalents in terms of a reference haloperidol standard. The within-assay precision was
17% and the between-assay precision 23%. Samples were analysed on one occasion only,
three measurements being made on each. All the samples from an individual patient were
included in a single assay run to limit variability. Non-specific binding was calculated
by blocking the specific binding sites with excess haloperidol (100 pmol/l) and regarding
the remaining binding of tracer as non-specific binding. This was less than 10% of the total
counts added.
Pimozide was assayed by radioimmunoassay at Janssen Pharmaceuticals (MICHIELS
et al., 1975). Haloperidol was assayed using a commercial radioimmunoassay kit (I.R.E.,
Fleurus, Belgium).
Statistical analysis of the clinical ratings was done using the Wilcoxon matched pairs
signed rank test for within-group changes, and the Mann-Whitney U test for difference
between the two treatment groups. Analysis of the inter-correlations between plasma
prolactin, drug levels, dopamine receptor blocking activity and clinical ratings was
performed using the Spearman rank correlation coefficient.
RESULTS
1. Clinical response
Eighteen patients completed 28 days of treatment. Three patients were withdrawn from
the haloperidol group (11, 25 and 28); two were unwilling to continue after developing
extrapyramidal symptoms and the other left hospital against advice. One patient on
pimozide (14) was withdrawn because of intercurrent illness.
The doses of pimozide or haloperidol administered to these 18 patients are shown in
Table 2; they ranged from 5 to 50 mg per day.

The MRS scores are given in Table 3. There was a significant improvement in scores
in both groups by day 7 0, < 0.05). By 28 days, three patients in each group had become
vitrually sympton-free (i.e. scored 2 or less). There were no significant differences between
the two groups in total ratings or in any separate symptoms with one exception. The
pimozide group showed a marked improvement in the “lack of appropriate emotion”
symptom @ < 0.02 from day 7); however, the pimozide group had had significantly
higher scores for this symptom at day 0 @ < 0.05).
There were no significant differences between the groups in any other symptom category.
Extrapyramidal side effects were common in both groups (see Table 4). Acute dystonic
reactions occurred in three patients on pimozide and in four on haloperidol. Parkinsonism
occurred in five patients on pimozide and in two on haloperidol.

All the patients on pimozide received antiparkinsonian medication from the times
indicated in Table 2. Four were started within the first two days. Those patients in the
haloperidol group who continued on the trial and who required procyclidine are also
indicated in Table 2; all were started within the first week.
In the haloperidol group, patients receiving procyclidine improved more slowly than
those who did not. In the case of pimozide, the clinical improvement in the first week in
those patients who had received procyclidine before day 7 tended to be slightly greater
than in those who had not.
Other reported side effects are shown in Table 4. Some of these may have been due to
the concurrent administration of procyclidine.
It was necessary to administer parenteral chlorpromazine on at least one occasion to
two patients in the haloperidol group and to one in the pimozide group.
2. Drug plasma levels measured by radioimmunoassy (Table 5)
Plasma samples were obtained from five patients on haloperidol and seven on pimozide.
With haloperidol, the plasma level reached a plateau by the end of the first week, whereas
with pimozide the levels continued to rise until the end of the third week. The values on
day 0 reflect non-specific serum effects in the assay rather than prior drug administration.

3. Dopamine receptor blocking activity as measured by plasma radio receptor assay
(RRA) (Table 6)
The mean RRA after haloperidol rose sharply within the first day and remained
more or less stable until the end of the second week when it tended to rise again. By
contrast, the mean RRA for pimozide continued to rise steadily throughout the 28 days
of the study and reached a much higher value although, as with haloperidol, there was
marked individual variation.
4. Plasmaprolactin (Table 7)
Prolactin levels were within the normal range before starting medication in all but one
patient (19) whose PRL values were excluded from the analysis.
In the haloperidol group, mean plasma PRL reached a plateau by the end of the first
week. Similarly, in the pimozide group, mean plasma PRL tended to plateau after the
first week. The higher levels of plasma PRL in the pimozide group as compared to
haloperidol reflect the greater number of females on pimozide.
5. Inter-relationships of clinical response, drug plasma level, receptor blockade and
prolactin rise
(i) Clinical response and drug plasma level. There was no significant correlation between
drug plasma level (RIA) and clinical response.
(ii) Drug plasma level (RZA) and DA receptor blocking activity (RRA). With pimozide,
there was a highly significant correlation between RRA and RIA values (r= 0.84, p < O.CNIl),
with close correspondence between the two in alrbut the last week (Fig. 1).
For haloperidol, there was no significant correlation between RIA and RRA values.
Changes in RIA and RRA did not appear to be congruent at any time during the 28 days
(Fig. 2).
(iii) Plasmaprolactin and clinical response. Plasma prolactin rose faster than improvement in clinical ratings in both groups (Figs 1 and 2) with improvement in clinical state
continuing for 2-3 weeks after the plasma PRL had reached a plateau. In spite of this
disparity in time course, there was a significant correlation between PRL and improvement
in the pimozide group (r= 0.55, p < 0.01).
(iv) DA receptor blocking activity and clinical response. There was no significant
correlation between RRA and clinical improvement.
(v) Plasma prolactin, drug plasma levels and receptor blocking activity. The only
significant correlation was for haloperidol between PRL and RIA level (r=0.48, p < 0.01).
DISCUSSION
As expected from the results of previous trials of pimozide in acute schizophrenia
(SHOPSIN and SELZER, 1977; PIYAKULMALA et al., 1977; CARTON and SILVERSTONE, 1979;
HAAS and BECKMANN, 1982; PECKNOLD et al., 1982; ~HOUINARD and ANNABLE, 1982), most
patients receiving pimozide improved and there was no difference in efficacy from
haloperidol.
Side-effects were similar in the two groups, although parkinsonian symptoms were
commoner after pimozide than haloperidol; HAAS and BECKMANN (1982) had also noted

this. Similarly PECKNOLD et al. (1982) and G~JOINARD and ANNABLE (1982) found pimozide
more prone to cause extrapyramidal symptoms than chlorpromazine.
All patients showed a rise in plasma PRL during treatment but there was no correlation
between elevation of plasma PRL and clinical response in the haloperidol group. This is
in keeping with the earlier findings of KOLAKOWSKA et al. (1979). A correlation was found
between PRL level and clinical improvement after pimozide, although the pattern of
response in terms of their time courses appeared to be different; PRL rose to a maximum
by the end of the first week while mean clinical ratings continued to improve for 21 days.
One possible explanation for this difference may have been the concurrent administration of an antiparkinsonian drug which could have affected the clinical response to
haloperidol and pimozide (CROW et al., 1981). Analysis of our findings tends to support
this possibility with haloperidol where improvement was more rapid in those patients who
did not receive added procyclidine, but this did not appear to be the case with pimozide.
The observation that DA receptor blocking activity, as measured by RRA in plasma
samples, bore no relationship to changes in PRL, was perhaps surprising. Changes in
PRL as a biological marker of DA activity might have been expected to rise in parallel
with an increase in RRA. However, it is likely that a ceiling to PRL responses had been
reached within the first week. Relatively small doses of haloperidol produced a maximal
rise in prolactin levels in drug-naive patients, and manic patients treated with haloperidol
show no further rise in PRL in response to additional intravenous doses of haloperidol
until after several days of treatment (COOKSON et al., 1983).
RRA and RIA values for pimozide closely correspond one to the other, as expected if
both are valid measures of drug plasma level. The lack of correspondence for haloperidol
between the RRA and RIA may be due to metabolites recognised to different extents by
the binding agents in the RRA and RIA. The RIA is thought to overestimate levels of
haloperidol in patients stabilised on the drug (RUBIN and HAYS, 1980) but this does not
occur at the start of treatment (COOKSON et al., 1983). The accumulation of pimozide
in plasma as measured by RIA is accompanied by a corresponding rise in the RRA,
compatible with a long plasma half-life of pimozide (MCCREADIE et al., 1979).
Plasma drug level, measured by RIA, showed no significant correlation with clinical
response in either drug group, a finding similar to that of others (BJORNDAL. et al., 1980;
HAAS and BECKMANN, 1982; MOULIN et al., 1982), although MAGLIOZZI et al. (1981) were
able to define a therapeutic range of haloperidol concentrations in acute schizophrenia after
3 to 12 weeks treatment. NEBORSKY et al. (1982) found no relationship of haloperidol
plasma level to clinical response in a study of high and low dose treatment with haloperidol
in acutely psychotic patients; there was, however, a significant correlation of the plasma/
red blood cell ratio of haloperidol to clinical improvement. The doses of both pimozide
and haloperidol were on the high side, and it is possible that they may have been supramaximal, thereby obscuring any correlation between dose and clinical response. However,
as stated above, most of the other investigators who have addressed this question have
failed to find a relationship betwen plasma levels and clinical response.
In our study, the RRA values for pimozide and haloperidol were similar in the first 3
days, but after 1 week the values for pimozide were 4-5 times higher than for haloperidol.
With neither drug was there a significant correlation between RRA and clinical improvement. This is somewhat at variance with previous reports. In their study of a mixed group 
DA. SCHIZOPHRENIA AND Cmmu RESPONSE 267
of schizophrenic and manic-depressive patients, CALIL et al. (1979) found a significant
relationship between the ratings observed after at least 2 weeks of treatment and steady
state RRA values in the 22 patients who had been treated with haloperidol. COHEN et a/.
(1980) categorised similarly mixed groups of patients as either ‘responders’ or ‘nonresponders’, according to degree of improvement observed following treatment with a
variety of antipsychotic drugs for a variable period. The mean RRA level was lower in
the non-responders, although there was an overlap between the RRA values for the two
groups. TUNE et al. (1982) followed the changes in clinical ratings in a mixed group of 10
patients during a variable treatment period with a number of antipsychotic drugs. They
concluded, with some caution, that there might be a relationship of serum levels to
clinical state.
Our study differed from the previous investigations in following the changes in clinical
status and RRA more frequently, particularly in the early stages of treatment. The
results, taken together with the finding that RRA correlated highly with RIA for pimozide,
lead us to regard the RRA as a method for determining the plasma level of a drug rather
than a method of assessing its central pharmacological activity.
The observation that clinical improvement tended to occur with a delay after the other
measures of drug activity (RIA, PRL and RRA) suggests that clinical response in acute
schizophrenia to treatment with antipsychotic drugs is less directly linked to DA receptor
blockade than has been previously thought.
