The social outcome of patients
in a trial of long-term continuation therapy in
schizophrenia: pimozide vs. fluphenazine
I. FALLOON, D. C. WATT AND M. SHEPHERD1
From St John's Hospital, Stone, Aylesbury and the Institute of Psychiatry, London
SYNOPSIS A blind social assessment at home was carried out twice during a year's follow-up of
41 patients on continuation therapy, 21 randomly allocated to pimozide tablets and 20 to fluphenazine decanoate injections. Patients on pimozide were significantly more favourably rated on aspects
of sociability, use of leisure, warmth of personal relationships, household tasks and child-rearing.
The mode of production of this result is discussed.
INTRODUCTION
Any drug that is employed on a long-term basis
to control psychological symptoms can be expected to affect behaviour. This leads to changes
in social functioning, some beneficial, some
detrimental. Well-designed placebo trials suggest
that the benefits of maintenance therapy with
long-acting depot phenothiazines include improved relationships with parents and spouses,
a diminished burden on the patient's family or
living group (Stevens, 1973), and a reduction
in aggressive behaviour (Engelhardt & Freedman, 1970). On the clinical side there is a reduced relapse rate (Vaughn & Leff, 1976) and
longer stay in the community, but the discomfort and disablement of side-effects may prove a
considerable social handicap, while diminished
drive (Andrews, 1973) with subsequent social
withdrawal would indicate a less satisfactory
aspect of outcome for evaluation of social
performance.
The advent of a clinically effective neuroleptic
drug without adverse effects on social functioning
would carry potential advantages for the management of schizophrenics in the community.
Pimozide has been shown to control psychotic
symptoms as effectively as phenothiazine preparations commonly used as continuation therapy for schizophrenic patients (Pinder et al. 1976;

Falloon et al. 1978). In addition, several studies
have indicated that pimozide may exert a
less deleterious effect on social functioning.
Thus, in two double-blind trials, pimozide has
improved emotional withdrawal more than oral
phenothiazines among chronic schizophrenic outpatients (Kolivakis et al. 1974) and in-patients
(Chouinard et al. 1970). Lapierre & Lavallee
(1975) have compared pimozide with oral
fluphenazine in a double-blind trial with schizophrenic out-patients over a 16-week period.
Social adjustment was measured by the Katz
Social Adjustment Scales (Katz & Lyerly, 1963)
and a detailed analysis of social interaction was
performed during weekly group therapy sessions. No clear-cut differences were found on
the Katz scales, but the patients receiving pimozide became more affectively involved in the
group sessions. In their 2-year trial of continuation therapy for community-based schizophrenics, Abuzzahab & Zimmerman (1976) found
that after 15 months the social adjustment of
pimozide patients (on Katz Scales) was superior
to that of patients receiving oral fluphenazine.
Baro et al. (1972) showed in an open trial of
matched long-stay schizophrenics that pimozide
was superior to haloperidol and penfluridol in
terms of the nurses' observations of social function over a 3-month period. A particular feature
of this study was the finding that gestures and
movements appeared to be more appropriate
among the patients receiving pimozide.
The aim of the present investigation was to
265
266 /. Falloon, D. C. Watt and M. Shepherd
compare the social outcome of clearly defined
schizophrenic patients who were participating
in a double-blind trial of pimozide (oral) and
fluphenazine decanoate (injection) as long-term
continuation therapy. Both the short-term (1
month) and the longer term (1 year) outcome
were evaluated following discharge after a
clearly defined schizophrenic breakdown.
METHOD
Patient population
The 44 patients who entered the trial were aged
between 17 and 60 years and were selected
following an admission to psychiatric hospital
with acute schizophrenic symptoms. The details
of selection, the total schizophrenic population
from which they were chosen, and of their sociodemographic characteristics are described elsewhere (Falloon et al. 1978).
All the patients were resident within a defined
area of the county of Buckinghamshire for
which one hospital provides all the psychiatric
services for about 450000 people. This area
includes both rural and urban areas, with a
broad cross-section of social class and employment opportunities. In the group of patients
who entered the trial the sexes were equally
distributed; two-thirds were either married or
had been married (separated, divorced, widowed); at the time of admission to hospital
over half were living with their spouses, only a
fifth were single adults living with parents, and
2 were living in unsupervised hostel accommodation. The 7 immigrants (16%) included 4 West
Indians, 1 Indian, 1 Chinese, and 1 German.
The majority were employed in unskilled jobs,
although a third were in professional, clerical
or skilled employment. A quarter of the total
were housewives. Thirty per cent (excluding
housewives) were unemployed prior to their
hospital admission. A third were admitted to
hospital involuntarily for observation or treatment under the Mental Health Act (1959).
On most socio-demographic features the trial
population was well matched with those members of the base population who did not enter
the study. However, there was a significant
excess of first admissions among the excluded
patients for whom continuation therapy was not
indicated. Patients for whom continuation
therapy was indicated, but who were excluded

from the trial for other reasons, were more
often single and living with their parents than
those included in the trial.
The patients selected for the trial were randomly allocated to drug therapy, receiving either
pimozide tablets or fluphenazine decanoate injections. As is detailed elsewhere (Falloon et al.
1978), the 2 groups were well matched in respect
of clinical history, age, marital status, race, occupation, employment record, and type of living
group. There was a non-significant excess of
single men among the patients receiving pimozide; 3 of these patients dropped out of the
trial, leaving the remaining 21 very closely
matched with the 20 patients on fluphenazine.
Among patients completing the trial, the
stressful factors reported by patients, their
families and employers to the interviewing doctor and social worker during the 6 months
before the key admission were very similar in
each group (see Table 1). Family and marital
difficulties were the most frequently reported
forms of stress, followed by work, social and
interpersonal difficulties. Financial stress was
reported less frequently. In 3 cases marital
conflict involved separation and divorce proceedings.
Out-patient management
Trial medication was started before the patient
was discharged from hospital, but the initial
assessment was delayed until a month after discharge to give time for stabilization on treatment.
In order to preserve double-blind conditions
inert injections and tablets were also given so
that each patient received both tablets and injections. This medication was dispensed by
specially trained community nurses at followup clinics in 4 towns in the area. The nurses
Social outcome of patients on long-term continuation therapy 267
monitored the clinical state of the patients, the
majority of whom visited the clinic fortnightly
to obtain an injection and supplies of tablets.
The patients were reviewed regularly by the
referring psychiatrists and the nurses were able
to obtain psychiatric advice about dosage
change, or the patients' clinical and social condition. The nurses paid home visits to patients
who were unable to attend, failed appointments,
or were known to require attention. Clinics were
held in the afternoon and early evening to
accommodate people with occupational or
domestic responsibilities.
Assessment
Social adjustment was assessed at interviews
with patients and their relatives or closest associates, by means of the Medical Research Council
Social Performance Schedule (Stevens, 1972,
1973). This instrument was developed specifically
for use in studies of the social adjustment of
schizophrenic subjects in Great Britain, and has
been shown to be a reliable measure where
raters are using the same material (Stevens,
1972). In our case our reliability estimates were
based on the agreement on individual items of 3
raters rating simultaneously. The interview
focuses on social behaviour in the previous 1-
month period. It was chosen because it covers a
broad range of interpersonal and social functioning, including intimate relationships, leisure
activity, sociability, employment, and household
activities, child-rearing, and heterosexual
adjustment. In addition, relatives rated the
patients' abnormal behaviour and the limitations and strain that they experienced as a result
of living with the patient. The interviews
were conducted 1 month after discharge and
12 months later, or at the time of relapse.
Because this study was designed primarily to
assess differences in actual social performance
rather than family attitudes towards the performance, the subjective ratings concerning
relatives' satisfaction were not employed. However, as Katz & Lyerly (1963) point out, objective ratings of social performance are difficult to
obtain from people emotionally concerned about
the patient. The interviewers therefore took great
care to obtain detailed information on actual
performance and to be specific about the social
aspect of patient's activities. They encouraged
open discussion with the close associates and
patients, both separately and in the family
setting. This procedure enabled them to obtain
a picture which, although at times confusing,
led to a fuller understanding of actual performance. Useful information was sometimes obtained from visits to friends or relatives, and
even from children in the family discussions.
Three trained interviewers administered the
Social Performance Schedule independently of
the clinical assessment, and under similar
double-blind conditions. One interviewer was a
social worker, 2 were sociologists employed in
social research. On 6 tape-recorded interviews
rated by 2 raters and a live interview rated by a
third there was a consensus between all three on
the presence of impairment on 80% of the 55
items rated on each interview. The residual disagreement can be attributed partly to the difficulty of rating from recorded interviews. The
greatest discrepancy was in the sociability
section where interpretation played a larger part
than elsewhere.
RESULTS
Forty-four patients and their relatives were interviewed after 1 month on continuation therapy
following discharge. Twenty-eight were interviewed again 12 months later. Three patients
were excluded from the trial before 12 months
had been completed. Thirteen had relapsed
clinically before the 12 month's assessment, and
were interviewed at the time of relapse. Of these,
5 (24%) were among 21 patients receiving pimozide and 8 (40%) among the 20 receiving fluphenazine: a statistically non-significant difference.
Details of these results are contained in a
separate publication dealing with the clinical
outcome of the trial (Falloon et al. 1978). A
social assessment interview was completed prior
to discontinuing the trial medication.
2 x 2 contingency tables were used to analyse
the difference in the proportions of patients on
pimozide or fluphenazine who were impaired on
each item of social functioning (Finney et al.
1963).

with phenothiazines, the most pronounced effects
would be expected to be an increase in sociability
and leisure activity. The results, summarized in
Tables 2 and 3, lend support to this hypothesis.
The majority of patients on fluphenazine were
given a low rating on most aspects of leisure
activity and sociability which were assessed. On
general items of social behaviour, such as
'getting on with others', 'preferring company',
and 'having friends', the patients receiving
pimozide were more favourably rated. At the
time of the first monthly assessment this trend
was significant in respect of the items 'getting
on with others' (P < 005), and 'preferring
company' (P < 005), and at 1 year the difference extended to the item, 'having friends'
(P < 0-025). As noted above, the greatest discrepancy between raters on the recorded and
live interviews was in the sociability section.
However, the consistent variance on items
between the 2 drug groups at 1 month and over
the 12-month period strongly suggests that the
differences we have observed in the sociability
of the 2 drug groups are valid. Little difference
was evident on the items that involved group
participation, where a high level of impairment
was reported at the time of both assessments.
Patients receiving pimozide were observed to
Social outcome of patients on long-term continuation therapy 269
spend their leisure time in a more constructive
fashion than those on fluphenazine (P < 0-005
at 1 month) and to tackle more specific leisure
activities more adequately. Thus, after 1 year,
the responses on items concerning participation
in hobbies and going out of the home were
significant at the 5% level. Again there was a
low level of group activities, e.g. sports, evening
classes and clubs, among patients receiving both
drugs.
(b) Relationships with parents, spouse or close
associate
The behavioural interactions between patients
and their next-of-kin or close associates are
summarized in Table 4. At the time of both
assessments the patients receiving pimozide
were assessed as superior on the 5 items rated.
This superiority was greatest in respect of items
concerning communication and expression of
feelings, and least on the less emotionally toned
item, 'household chores'. The difference was
significant at 1 month on' expression of affection
and support' (P < 0025), and at 1 year on
'tension' (P < 0-05), 'communication on a
personal level' (P < 0-01) and 'expression of
affection' (P < 0-005). Between 1 month and 1
year there was improvement in 4 subjects with
deterioration in 5 on global ratings in the fluphenazine group, and improvement in 6 subjects
with deterioration in 4 in the pimozide group.
It must be borne in mind that the 1-month
rating was made after the patients had been on
the trial drugs for some time - after about 2
months. Improvement will have occurred in the
pre-assessment period and a stable drug effect
would not be expected to show remarkable
social changes over a subsequent year. It was
obviously not possible to carry out ratings until
patients had left hospital and sufficient time had
elapsed for evidence of the level of their close
relationships to become apparent. At the time
of the 1-month rating, the fluphenazine group
was more impaired than the pimozide group
and it is not feasible to say whether this was so
before the trial started. While the evidence is
suggestive, it is not possible therefore to reach a
firm conclusion about the relative effect of the 2
drugs in this area.
In marital relationships a lack of communication and expression of feelings between partners
was often quite striking. Spouses commonly
complained that patients were 'in a world of
their own' and that they regretted their apparent
loss of affection. Half the patients on pimozide
and 80% on fluphenazine reported difficulty in
their sexual relationships at the 1-year assessment. Severe marital disharmony was often
evident. Three patients were divorced before
starting the trial; one patient divorced her
husband during the trial and another had separated ; the spouses of 5 others spoke openly of

the possibility of divorce in the near future.
The main reason for considering divorce was
the inability of the female schizophrenic spouse
to function adequately as a wife and mother,
and the considerable support she required.
Fewer patients on pimozide were severely impaired in this regard and 2 husbands reported
striking improvements after many years of
difficulty while their wives were on phenothiazine continuation therapy.
There were only 9 single patients living with
their parents. On the whole, their relationships
with parents were good, although there were a
few notable exceptions. An after-care hostel
was opened while the trial was in progress.
Two of the 3 patients who were admitted to the
hostel were divorced, and unsuccessful attempts
were made to encourage several unmarried
patients to stay at the hostel. Two other men
lived in an unsupervised working man's hostel
under spartan conditions. Although surrounded
by many men of similar age and interests, their
social isolation was extreme.
(c) Heterosexual relationships
All except one of the 11 unmarried young adult
patients complained of great difficulties in
forming relationships with members of the
opposite sex. The main difficulty was shyness
and a lack of conversational skills that affected
their social interaction in other situations as well.
There was no indication of any direct drug
effects.
(d) Household-work and child-rearing
Of 22 female patients who were primarily
housewives, only 7 at the 1-month assessment
and 5 at the 1-year assessment were handicapped
to any great extent in their housewife roles but
on both assessments a significantly greater
proportion of these was having fluphenazine. A
similar trend was seen with child-rearing where,
among 9 mothers, about half were impaired
but a greater proportion of those receiving
pimozide was free from any impairment in this
role (P < 005). Two women on fluphenazine
were reported as staying in bed most of the day
and showing little interest in caring for their
children, their husbands, or their homes. One
woman receiving pimozide developed a severe
hand tremor that made it difficult to hold objects steadily. This proved a considerable handicap in her household tasks, but improved following a reduction of her dosage.
(e) Employment
Before the key admission to hospital, 10 (30%)
patients who started the trial were unemployed.
At the 1-year assessment, 12 (38%) were unemployed. There was no difference between the
2 groups in this respect. Prolonged unemployment was deemed a major source of stress for
only 1 patient. Most of the others accepted lack
of employment as inevitable at a time of high
regional unemployment. Three single males had
never been able to work. The father of one tried
to employ his son in his own draftsman's
business with limited success. Six unemployed
patients attended either a rehabilitation workshop or a day centre where training in work
skills was carried out.
Information on the work output of patients
who were gainfully employed was difficult to
obtain. In most cases patients in full employment
Social outcome of patients on long-term continuation therapy 271
appeared to maintain their previous level of
function at their jobs.
(f) Family burden
The return of patients to their families was
usually desired by both patients and relatives.
Nineteen patients on pimozide and 17 on fluphenazine were living with parents, spouses, or
adult offspring during the trial. Untoward
effects on the family were assessed in terms of
restriction of relatives' leisure activities and
an impairment of relatives' health attributed to
caring for the patient, as well as the reported
strain of living with the patient. A summation
of these three ratings gave a measure of'family
burden'.
While the 'burden' reported by families of
patients who relapsed clinically was considerable on both drugs, there was a suggestion of
a reduced 'family burden' among patients on
pimozide. Thus, among the families of patients
who did not relapse during the 12-month period,
64% (TV = 9) of families with members on
pimozide were free of 'burden', but only 20%
(N = 2) of families with patients receiving
fluphenazine were reported as 'burden-free'.
Among all families, at 1-year follow-up or relapse, relatives showed significantly more stress
in the fluphenazine group (P < 005). This result is consistent with the finding that family
relationships were less impaired among patients
receiving pimozide.
(g) Behaviour disturbance
There was no difference in either the frequency
with which behaviour disturbance was reported
by the relatives of patients in the 2 groups or
in the patterns of disturbance. Depressed mood
and social withdrawal were reported in approximately one-third of the patients. Although
clinical examination of patients revealed an
excess of depressive symptoms among patients
on fluphenazine at 1 year, this was not reflected
in the relatives' reports of depressed mood. The
overt expression of strange ideas tended to be
reported more frequently by patients on fluphenazine, a finding which is consistent with the
greater proportion of florid schizophrenic relapses associated with this medication. Overactivity and aggressive behaviour were infrequently reported, and there was no evidence to
suggest that pimozide promoted these forms of
conduct. On the whole, the relatives' reports
were consistent with the concurrent assessment
of the patient's mental state by the clinician and
they supported the principal finding of the

The reduced impairment in patients on pimozide might be wholly accounted for by patients
who relapsed if social impairment were closely
associated with clinical relapse. The opposite
is the case, however: when the ratings for relapsed patients are excluded from the items
comprised under the headings sociability, use of
leisure and personal relations, the advantage for
pimozide is, in the majority of instances, increased (Table 6).
DISCUSSION
The claim that pimozide enables communitybased schizophrenic patients to function more
effectively in their social environment than longacting phenothiazines receives some support from
this study. Patients who were treated with pimozide were reported as superior to those on
fluphenazine decanoate in respect of several
aspects of social adjustment, e.g. sociability,
leisure activities, relationships with close associates, house-keeping and child-rearing. These
results are similar to those obtained by Stevens
(1973), whose study was based on a somewhat
different population and on a trial that involved
the withdrawal of active medication to demonstrate that fluphenazine decanoate was superior
to a placebo injection. Thus, it may be argued
that, if pimozide helps to reduce social impairment more effectively than fluphenazine, it may
represent a significant advance in continuation
therapy.
In the present study, the differences in favour
of pimozide were present at the 1-month assessment as well as 1 year later. This may have
reflected poor matching of the 2 treatment
conditions on social variables, for no pretreatment assessment of social adjustment was
possible as patients were in hospital and their
treatment was started before discharge. It may
be recalled, however, that the study of social
stresses experienced in the 6 months preceding
the key admission revealed a very similar pattern
of reported family, marital, interpersonal, work
and financial stresses among patients later assigned to the 2 drug groups.
In the series of studies in which pimozide has
proved superior to oral phenothiazine preparations on measures of social functioning (Kolivakis et al. 1974; Chouinard et al. 1970;
Lapierre & Lavallee, 1975), it has usually been
suggested that this advantage could be due to
its comparative lack of sedation. In the present
study, by contrast, there was no relationship
between reports of drowsiness and impaired
sociability and leisure activity. It seems, therefore, that the advantages of pimozide may be
mediated differently.
One possible mode of action of pimozide
might be in the sphere of psychomotor activity.
Investigations employing objective measurements of ambulatory phenomena have failed to
demonstrate any increase in motor behaviour
(Espvall et al. 191 A; Sims & Burnside, 1975),
while in the present study psychomotor overactivity was reported infrequently with both
drugs. Psychomotor behaviour, however, also
includes non-verbal communication, the importance of which through body movement,
posture, facial expression and vocal tone has
been stressed by some social psychologists
(Argyle et al. 1974). One study by Baro et al.
(1972) has reported improvement in the gesture
and movement of patients taking pimozide.
Accordingly, an examination of the possible
association between the side-effect of rigidity
and sociability and leisure activity was undertaken on the present data. It suggested that
impaired social functioning was associated
with the presence of rigidity at 12-month assessment. Further, rigidity proved to be more
commonly experienced by fluphenazine patients
at both assessments (P < 0025) (Falloon et al.
1978). Stevens (1976) points out that in an MRC
trial (Hirsch et al. 1973) a substantial proportion
of patients on fluphenazine decanoate experienced
akathisia and nearly two-thirds had antiparkinsonian medication: affective reactions to
these effects were reported by their relatives.
It is conceivable, therefore, that the reduction
in this aspect of personal interaction attributable
to extrapyramidal side-effects may contribute
to difficulties in social adjustment. The relatives
of 3 patients on pimozide, who had previously
received phenothiazines, reported changes in
facial expressiveness and posture which they
described as a return to 'normality'. Clearly a
more extensive examination of these phenomena
is necessary before firm conclusions can be
drawn.
Social outcome of patients on long-term continuation therapy 273
A marked reduction in overt schizophrenic
symptoms could furnish another possible explanation for improved social functioning.
Patients who demonstrated persistent symptomatology while on drug treatment tended to be
rated lower in their reported sociability and
leisure activities than symptom-free individuals.
The association with leisure activity was significant at the 5% level, and almost achieved
significance with sociability. However, there
was no difference between the schizophrenic
symptomatology of the 2 populations at either
assessment. The greater number of relapses
associated with fluphenazine might have contributed to social impairment but when the
non-relapsing subjects were evaluated separately,
the greater social impairment with fluphenazine
remained apparent.
The drowsiness, flatness of expression, and
psychomotor retardation, which are reported
more often in patients on fluphenazine, together
constitute a picture commonly seen with depression and could perhaps account for the greater
social impairment on this medication. However,
there is a discrepancy in the data bearing on
this point in that whereas the clinical interviews
suggest that depression was more evident in
patients taking fluphenazine at 1-year follow-up,
but not at 1 month, relatives did not report a
greater mood disturbance at this time. Elucidation of this difficulty requires further enquiry: the
full relationship between medication, social outcome and clinical states is too complex for conclusions to be drawn from a sample of this size.
Several patients rejected medication that produced unpleasant side-effects. While a possible
advantage of a self-administered oral drug is
the ability of the patient to control the dosage
so that unpleasant effects are minimized, there
was no evidence in this trial that irregular pimozide ingestion was associated with improved
social function. On the contrary, the overall
trend suggested that irregularity of tablettaking, both active and inert, was associated with
social impairment and with clinical relapse
within the 12-month trial period.
Although the findings suggest that pimozide
may represent an advance in continuation
therapy, it is clear that many patients exhibited
considerable impairment in social functioning.
Normative data on social functioning are difficult to obtain, so that it is not easy to decide
18
which criteria to adopt as a goal of treatment.
The norms are possibly best determined by
individual patients, and family groups. For
example, in several families social activity was
restricted to the family circle, and contacts
outside the family were relatively few. Spouses
and parents were often shy and retiring, with
low expectations of sociability and group activities. They were prepared to tolerate a very
low level of social functioning and sometimes
appeared to derive considerable satisfaction
from adopting a caring role for the impaired
family member. The f.nancial limitations and
loss of social contact that result from prolonged unemployment often prevented more
active socializing.
There were several areas where social adjustment was grossly impaired among patients on
both drugs. These included heterosexual contact
in unmarried subjects and lack of conversational
skills and/or the confidence to form relationships
with members of the opposite sex. Anxiety and
lack of confidence about returning to the
family, the community, and to employment was
particularly common in patients who had exhibited disturbed behaviour in these situations
before admission. Several patients were extremely
anxious about going out and were virtually
housebound. Severe family or marital conflict,
and impaired sexual functioning, were common.
The most common conflict in family groups
centred around the lack of independence of the
adult unmarried patient. This problem cannot
be resolved merely by providing supervised
hostel accommodation as many of these people
lack the necessary skills to lead an independent
existence. Training, not only in work skills,
but also in other practical skills essential to
community life, e.g. handling finances, shopping,
cooking, appears to be necessary. Along with
training in social skills, marital counselling
and social support is needed for this group.
The emotional separation from families may
also present difficulties, particularly where overinvolved relationships exist.
CONCLUSION
It may be concluded that in spite of the difficulties in the objective assessment of social adjustment, there was a consistent trend in favour of
pimozide. Some of the possible mechanisms for
PSM 8

this advantage have been discussed. A reduction
in Parkinsonian rigidity that enabled a greater
degree of non-verbal expression appears to be
most favoured, but this study did not make it
possible to explore the impact of environmental
stress, life events, or family relationships in the
patients studied. It is not clear whether less
impairment in the relationships and social
functioning of pimozide patients was a function
of the action of the drug or the environment, or
whether the relationships had always been better in
this group. The complexity of these issues suggests
that choice of medication is only one factor among
many that determine the outcome of treatment (Hogarty et al. 1974 a, b). Meanwhile, however, studies designed to elucidate specifically the
advantages and disadvantages of oral medication are needed. Lack of clear and consistent
advice about medication highlighted the need
for efforts to educate both the patients and their
relatives. Very few patients or relatives understood the rationale for maintenance therapy or
the nature of the disorder from which they were
suffering.
This study was supported by a research grant from
the Oxford Regional Health Authority. Social
assessments were made by Mr James Robinson and
Mr Paul Fletcher, of Buckinghamshire Social Services Department Research Unit, and Mrs Christine
Lipson, social worker at St John's Hospital. We
are grateful to Mr A. Johnson of the MRC Statistical Unit for assistance with the analysis and presentation of data, and to Mrs Barbara Ridsdale for
advice and help in the application of the social
performance schedule. We also gratefully acknowledge the help of Dr Julian Candy in the initiation
and design of the clinical trial.
