Abstract
Compared the effectiveness and safety of pimozide and chlorpromazine in the maintenance therapy of chronic schizophrenic outpatients. 43 patients (24–60 yrs) were assigned in double-blind fashion to 1 of the drugs. Both medication groups showed a general pattern of improvement over the 52-wk study, but there was no significant difference between the 2 groups. Results demonstrate the effectiveness and safety of pimozide in once daily administration. Previous research results showing the special utility of pimozide for the reduction of emotional withdrawal and the improvement of social competence in schizophrenia were not replicated.
