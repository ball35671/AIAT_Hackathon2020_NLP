 Integration of Depression and Hypertension Treatment: A Pilot, Randomized
Controlled Trial
ABSTRACT
PURPOSE We wanted to examine whether integrating depression treatment into
care for hypertension improved adherence to antidepressant and antihypertensive medications, depression outcomes, and blood pressure control among older
primary care patients.
METHODS Older adults prescribed pharmacotherapy for depression and hypertension from physicians at a large primary care practice in West Philadelphia
were randomly assigned to an integrated care intervention or usual care. Outcomes were assessed at baseline, 2, 4, and 6 weeks using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) to assess depression, an electronic monitor to measure blood pressure, and the Medication Event Monitoring System to
assess adherence.
RESULTS In all, 64 participants aged 50 to 80 years participated. Participants in
the integrated care intervention had fewer depressive symptoms (CES-D mean
scores, intervention 9.9 vs usual care 19.3; P <.01), lower systolic blood pressure
(intervention 127.3 mm Hg vs usual care 141.3 mm Hg; P <.01), and lower diastolic blood pressure (intervention 75.8 mm Hg vs usual care 85.0 mm Hg;
P <.01) compared with participants in the usual care group at 6 weeks. Compared
with the usual care group, the proportion of participants in the intervention group
who had 80% or greater adherence to an antidepressant medication (intervention
71.9% vs usual care 31.3%; P <.01) and to an antihypertensive medication (intervention 78.1% vs usual care 31.3%; P <.001) was greater at 6 weeks.
CONCLUSION A pilot, randomized controlled trial integrating depression and
hypertension treatment was successful in improving patient outcomes. Integrated
interventions may be more feasible and effective in real-world practices, where
there are competing demands for limited resources.

INTRODUCTION
Primary care occupies a strategic position in the evaluation and
treatment of depression among older adults,1
 and enhancing depression management in primary care appears to be a promising use of
health care resources.2
 To have an impact on public health, advances in
the treatment of depression must be realized in primary care. Although
recent studies have shown that a variety of primary care interventions can
improve depression outcomes among older adults,3,4 these interventions
are not being widely implemented in practice. Some evidence indicates
that addressing medical comorbidity, especially cardiovascular disease
(CVD), may be essential in managing depression.5-7 In addition, managing
depression in the context of medical comorbidity may be more acceptable to patients than managing depression alone.8
 Despite these fi ndings,
no known trials have been conducted in primary care integrating the

DEPRESSION AND HYPERTENSION TREATMENT
management of depression with management of medical comorbidity.
In this trial, we focused on integrating depression
management into care for hypertension. Hypertension affects between 20% to 50% of adults in most
countries9
 and is a major risk factor for cardiovascular
morbidity and mortality,10 representing two-thirds of
all strokes and one-half of all ischemic heart disease.11
Depression is a risk factor for hypertension,12 and it is
associated with poor adherence to antihypertensive
medications.13 We chose an adherence-based approach
because, although effi cacious pharmacotherapy for
many chronic medical conditions exists, many patients
are not adherent to treatment and are therefore at
increased risk for a variety of complications.14 Poor
adherence to treatment remains a serious impediment
to improving care.15,16 Our conceptual framework,
adapted from Cooper and colleagues,17 is practical in
its approach and provided a framework that allowed for
fl exible, tailored interventions (Figure 1). Our intervention addressed each factor resulting in nonadherence
in the conceptual model by means of a multifaceted,
individualized approach in which participants worked
with the integrated care manager to develop strategies
to overcome barriers to adherence to medications.
We hypothesized that in a sample of older primary care patients with depression and hypertension,
patients who were randomized to receive the intervention compared with usual care would have the
following outcomes after a 4-week period: (1) fewer
depressive symptoms, (2) lower systolic blood pressure
and diastolic blood pressure, (3) a greater proportion
with 80% or greater adherence to an antidepressant
medication, and (4) a greater proportion with 80% or
greater adherence to an antihypertensive medication.
The research protocols were approved by the University of Pennsylvania Institutional Review Board, and
all participants gave written informed consent.
METHODS
Recruitment Procedures
Patients were recruited from a community-based primary care practice in West Philadelphia with 12 family
physicians. More than 30,000 patient visits occur each
year at the practice. From December 2005 to August
2006, depressed older adults with hypertension and
upcoming appointments were recruited into the study.
Patients were initially identifi ed through an electronic
medical record with the following inclusion criteria: (1)
aged 50 years and older; (2) a systolic blood pressure
of 140 mm Hg or greater or diastolic blood pressure
of 90 mm Hg or greater for nondiabetic patients, or a
systolic blood pressure of 130 mm Hg or greater or a
diastolic blood pressure of 80 mm Hg or greater for
patients with diabetes on at least 2 visits in the previous year, or a prescription for an antihypertensive
medication within the past year; and (3) a diagnosis

of depression or a prescription for an antidepressant
medication within the past year.
In all, 109 patients identifi ed by electronic medical records as potentially eligible were approached for
further screening. Of those approached, 73 (67.0%)
provided oral consent for screening. At the baseline
visit, to be eligible for the study, patients had to meet
the entry criteria for the study. To enroll as many
older persons as possible who were willing and able
to participate, we included participants with a range
of depressive symptoms refl ecting the concept of
the relapsing, remitting nature of depression in primary care.18 Nine patients were excluded: 4 were
cognitively impaired, 2 were unable to communicate
in English, 2 resided in a care facility that provides
medications on a schedule, and 1 was unable to use
Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS) caps
(AARDEX, Zug, Switzerland), which are microelectionic monitoring devices. The remaining 64 eligible
patients completed enrollment procedures and were
randomly assigned to an integrated care intervention
(n = 32) or to usual care (n = 32).
Intervention
Integrated care can be defi ned as a set of techniques
and organizational models to create connectivity,
alignment, and collaboration within and between the
cure and care sectors at the funding, administrative,
and/or clinician levels.19 The goals of integrated care
are to enhance quality of care and quality of life, consumer satisfaction, and system effi ciency for patients
with complex problems, cutting across multiple sectors
and clinicians.20,21 Relying on this framework, we carried out an integrated care intervention to promote
patients’ adherence to antihypertensive and antidepressant treatment. Our study differed from other studies
by focusing on the integrated care manager’s unique
role as an intermediary or liaison between the physician and the elderly depressed patient with hypertension. The integrated care manager collaborated with
physicians to help participating patients recognize
depression in the context of hypertension, offered the
patients guideline-based treatment recommendations,
monitored the patients’ treatment adherence and clinical status, and provided appropriate follow-up. The
key components of this integrated care intervention
were (1) providing the patient with an individualized
program that is congruent with patients’ social and cultural context; and (2) integrating depression treatment
with hypertension management.
The integrated care manager worked individually
with patients to address the factors involved in adherence as displayed in our conceptual model (Figure 1).
Through in-person sessions and telephone conversations, the integrated care manager provided education about depression and hypertension, emphasizing
the importance of controlling depression to manage
hypertension; offered encouragement and relief from
stigma; helped to identify target symptoms for both
conditions; explained the rationale for antidepressant
and antihypertensive medication usage; assessed for
side-effects and assisted in their management; assessed
progress (eg, reduction in depressive symptoms);
assisted with referrals; and monitored and responded
to life-threatening symptoms (eg, chest pain, suicidality). The intervention was offered to patients as a
supplement to, rather than a replacement for, existing
primary care treatment. We chose this multifaceted
approach because education alone has not been found
to be effective for improving adherence.22
The intervention consisted of 3, 30-minute in-person
sessions and 2, 15-minute telephone-monitoring contacts
during a 4-week period. A master’s level research coordinator was trained as an integrated care manager and
administered all study activities. Before the trial started,
the integrated care manager received training on pharmacotherapy for depression and hypertension management during weekly clinical sessions with the principal
investigator. While under the supervision of the principal investigator, the integrated care manager conducted
mock study activities with 2 participants and thereafter
received ongoing weekly supervision for all study activities, with the principal investigator monitoring 25% of
weekly sessions to ensure the integrated care manager
adhered to study protocols.
Usual Care
At baseline, 2, 4, and 6 weeks, usual care participants
underwent the same assessments as participants in the
integrated care intervention. Assessments were conducted in person (as were assessments in the integrated
care intervention). The principal investigator randomly
monitored 25% of sessions weekly to ensure that there
was no carryover of the intervention into the usual
care group.
Measurement Strategy
To screen potential participants, we used the Mini
International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) to
assess for mania or hypomania, psychotic syndrome,
alcohol abuse or dependence, and acutely suicidal
or psychotic thoughts,23 and the Mini-Mental State
Examination (MMSE), a short standardized mental
status examination,24 to evaluate cognitive impairment
(defi ned as a MMSE score of less than 21).25 We asked
patients whether they resided in a care facility that
provided their medications on a schedule and whether
they were unwilling or unable to use the MEMS caps.

DEPRESSION AND HYPERTENSION TREATMENT
At baseline sociodemographic characteristics
were assessed using standard questions. We measured
patients’ functional status using the Medical Outcomes
Study Short Form (SF-36).26,27 Depression, blood
pressure, and adherence were measured at baseline, 2,
4, and 6 weeks. The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) was used to measure
depression. This scale was developed by the National
Institute of Mental Health and has been used widely
in research among the elderly.28,29 Patients’ blood
pressure was assessed in accordance with American
Heart Association Guidelines30 using the BpTRU
(BpTRU Medical Devices, Coquitlam, British Columbia, Canada), an automated device that is designed for
clinical settings and avoids observer bias. Unlike the
traditional mercury technique, the BpTRU is an oscillometric monitor that takes 6 consecutive blood pressure readings, drops the fi rst reading, and averages the
remaining 5. Adherence to antidepressant and antihypertensive medications was measured using electronicmonitoring data obtained from MEMS caps.
Analytic Strategy
We compared characteristics of participants at baseline
using the t test and Fisher’s exact test (for continuous or
categorical variables as appropriate). In addition, characteristics of patients who refused
to participate in the study were
compared with those who participated using t tests and Fisher’s
exact tests. Blood pressure and
depressive symptoms were compared between the intervention
group and usual care groups using
t tests at 6 weeks. Adherence
was defi ned as the percentage of
prescribed doses taken and was
calculated as the number of doses
taken divided by the number
of doses prescribed during the
observation period multiplied by
100%. Because the proportion
of pills taken was highly skewed
and failed normality assumptions,
adherence was dichotomized at a
threshold of 80%, a level used to
assess adherence to medication
regimens.31 We used Fisher’s exact
test to compare the proportions
of participants who were adherent
to antidepressant and antihypertensive medications in the intervention group and the usual care
group at 6 weeks. Analysis was
conducted using SPSS version 12.0 (SPSS, Chicago, Ilinois). We set statistical signifi cance at α = .05, recognizing that tests of statistical signifi cance are approximations and serve as aids to interpretation and inference.
RESULTS
Sample Characteristics
Participants ranged from age 50 to 80 years, with an
average age of 58.6 years (SD = 6.8 years). Forty-nine
(76.6%) of the 64 participants were women. Fifty-two
(81.2%) participants self-identifi ed as African-American,
11 (17.2%) self-identifi ed as white, and 1 (1.6%) selfidentifi ed as “other.” Characteristics of the integrated
care participants did not differ signifi cantly from those
of the usual care participants (Table 1). There were no
statistically signifi cant differences in characteristics
when comparing patients who agreed to participate
in the study with those who did not. All participants
attended the required sessions at baseline, 2, 4, and 6
weeks and continued to receive regular care from their
primary care physician and other medical specialists.

fewer depressive symptoms at 6 weeks (CES-D mean
scores, intervention 9.9 vs usual care 19.3; P <.01).
Systolic blood pressure at 6 weeks was also lower for
the intervention group than for the usual care group
(127.3 mm Hg vs 141.3 mm Hg, respectively; P <.01);
the same was true for diastolic blood pressure (75.8
mm Hg vs 85.0 mm Hg, respectively; P <.01). The
proportion of participants at 6 weeks who had 80% or
greater adherence to an antidepressant medication was
71.9% in the intervention group and 31.3% in the usual
care group (P <.01), and the proportion of participants
who had 80% or greater adherence to an antihypertensive medication was 78.1% in the intervention group
and 31.3% in the usual care group (P <.001) (Table 2).
DISCUSSION
Our preliminary study offers support for the usefulness of an integrated care intervention to improve
adherence to antihypertensive and antidepressant
medications, to increase blood pressure control, and
to reduce depression symptoms among older primary
care patients. Primary care patients randomized to an
integrated care intervention, when compared with participants randomized to usual care, showed higher rates
of adherence to antihypertensive and antidepressant
medications, greater blood pressure control, and fewer
depressive symptoms at the fi nal study visit (6 weeks).
This study has several limitations. The fi rst is
that we used MEMS caps to measure adherence. All
methods for assessing adherence have limitations: selfreports may be insensitive,32 drug levels may be infl uenced by factors other than treatment adherence,33
pill counts are subject erratic patient behaviors,34
verifi cation of pharmacy records may be useful only
for extended time frames,35 and MEMS caps may be
expensive and opening pill bottles is assumed to be
synonymous with medication ingestion.36 We chose to
use MEMS caps as our primary measure of adherence
because MEMS caps have a low failure rate31 and may
be more sensitive than other adherence measures.37,38
In addition, prior studies have shown that MEMS caps
do not signifi cantly infl uence adherence.31,39 Also, any
effect of MEMS caps on medication adherence would
be experienced equally in both groups and, therefore,
would not infl uence a comparative assessment by randomization assignment.
Second, we have defi ned an adherence threshold
of 80% in our analysis. Although this threshold has
been assessed in some clinical research,31 the clinical relevance of this threshold has not been tested for
many medications. Third, our results were obtained
from patients who received care at one primary care
site that might not be representative of most primary
care practices. This practice was probably similar to
other primary care practices in the region, however.
Fourth, our preliminary investigation was limited to
64 participants, but participants were randomized to
the intervention or usual care. Fifth, participants in
the intervention group may have been subject to the
Hawthorne effect, in which patients are more likely
to adhere to their medical regimens than they would
if they were not participating in the study.40 We suspect the Hawthorne effect would be minimal in this
intervention, however, as participants in the usual care
group had the same number of in-person contacts as
participants in the integrated care intervention. Lastly,
our intervention would require additional resources
in primary care settings. Even so, we have designed
a simple intervention, and future implementation will
explore whether ancillary health personnel could be
trained to carry out the intervention.
Despite the limitations of this study, our results
deserve attention because previous intervention trials in
primary care have addressed depression41 and hypertension42 separately. Integrated interventions may be more
feasible and effective in real-world practices, where
there are competing demands for limited resources.43
In our intervention, we integrated
depression treatment into care for
hypertension so a single program
could assist patients with depression and hypertension. Consistent
with our hypothesis, patients
randomized to the integrated
intervention had fewer depressive
symptoms, lower systolic blood
pressure, lower diastolic blood
pressure, and a greater proportion of participants with 80% or
greater adherence to antidepressant and antihypertensive medications at 6 weeks. Of note, this

intervention had a high retention rate of study participants. These fi ndings are aligned with recent fi ndings
that older primary care patients are more likely to be
engaged in integrated care than other forms of care
provision,44 and integrated care models are particularly
effective in improving access to and participation in
mental health services among African American primary care patients.45
Many large-scale, randomized controlled trials
using complex, multimodel, care management interventions have been successful in improving depression
outcomes,43,46 but they have not integrated depression
treatment with chronic medical conditions. We sought
to evaluate the effectiveness of a relatively brief, pilot,
randomized controlled trial with a focus on adherence
for the management of depression, as well as hypertension, in primary care. Further research is needed to
evaluate this intervention in a larger, more representative sample with longer periods of follow-up. Future
investigations could explore the training of ancillary
health personnel who are already working in primary
care practices to carry out the intervention.
