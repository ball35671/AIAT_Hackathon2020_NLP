BACKGROUND
Patients with depression and poorly controlled diabetes, coronary heart disease, or
both have an increased risk of adverse outcomes and high health care costs. We
conducted a study to determine whether coordinated care management of multiple
conditions improves disease control in these patients.
METHODS
We conducted a single-blind, randomized, controlled trial in 14 primary care clinics in an integrated health care system in Washington State, involving 214 participants with poorly controlled diabetes, coronary heart disease, or both and coexisting depression. Patients were randomly assigned to the usual-care group or to the
intervention group, in which a medically supervised nurse, working with each patient’s primary care physician, provided guideline-based, collaborative care management, with the goal of controlling risk factors associated with multiple diseases.
The primary outcome was based on simultaneous modeling of glycated hemoglobin, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and systolic blood-pressure levels
and Symptom Checklist–20 (SCL-20) depression outcomes at 12 months; this modeling allowed estimation of a single overall treatment effect.
RESULTS
As compared with controls, patients in the intervention group had greater overall
12-month improvement across glycated hemoglobin levels (difference, 0.58%), LDL
cholesterol levels (difference, 6.9 mg per deciliter [0.2 mmol per liter]), systolic blood
pressure (difference, 5.1 mm Hg), and SCL-20 depression scores (difference, 0.40
points) (P<0.001). Patients in the intervention group also were more likely to have one
or more adjustments of insulin (P=0.006), antihypertensive medications (P<0.001),
and antidepressant medications (P<0.001), and they had better quality of life
(P<0.001) and greater satisfaction with care for diabetes, coronary heart disease, or
both (P<0.001) and with care for depression (P<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS
As compared with usual care, an intervention involving nurses who provided guideline-based, patient-centered management of depression and chronic disease significantly improved control of medical disease and depression. (Funded by the National
Institute of Mental Health; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00468676.)

Evidence-based care management for
single conditions improves outcomes among
patients with diabetes,1 coronary heart disease,2 and depression,3 but organizing diagnosis-specific programs is complex and costly, so
such programs are not routinely available.4,5 Care
for patients with multiple chronic illnesses is expensive, and coordination of care among specialties can be inadequate.5,6 In previous trials involving high-risk Medicare patients with diabetes,
heart disease, or both, nurse care-management
interventions did not improve patient outcomes.7
However, these interventions were primarily delivered by telephone, had no physician supervision,
did not include medication recommendations to
primary care physicians, and were not integrated
into primary care.
Since the care of patients with multiple chronic
diseases accounts for the majority of health care
costs, effective approaches to managing such
complex care in primary care are needed, particularly when psychological and physical disorders coexist.4,5 A possible approach to organizing services for patients with multiple conditions
is to identify clusters of coexisting illnesses with
compatible management guidelines (e.g., diabetes
and coronary heart disease).8,9 Major depression
is prevalent among patients with diabetes and
coronary heart disease10,11 and is a risk factor for
poor self-care,12,13 complications, and death.14,15
We conducted a randomized, controlled trial
to determine whether a primary care-based, caremanagement intervention for multiple conditions
would improve medical outcomes and depression scores among patients with major depression and poorly controlled diabetes, coronary
heart disease, or both.

Study Participants
Participants were recruited from May 2007 through
October 2009. Patients and primary care physicians
in 14 primary care clinics in the Group Health
Cooperative in Washington State participated.
Using electronic medical records, we identified
patients with diagnoses of diabetes, coronary
heart disease, or both coded according to the
International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, or
Current Procedural Terminology codes for coronary-artery interventions (Appendix 1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text
of this article at NEJM.org). These patients had
one or more measures of poor disease control
within the previous 12 months, including: blood
pressure above 140/90 mm Hg (based on two
blood-pressure readings at separate visits within
12 months), a low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level above 130 mg per deciliter (>3.4 mmol
per liter), or a glycated hemoglobin level of 8.5%
or higher. We recruited patients who were ambulatory, spoke English, and planned to be enrolled
in a health-maintenance-organization (HMO) plan
for 12 months. Exclusion criteria were the following: terminal illness, residence in a long-term
care facility, severe hearing loss, planned bariatric
surgery within 3 months, pregnancy or breastfeeding, ongoing psychiatric care, bipolar disorder or schizophrenia, use of an antipsychotic or
mood-stabilizer medication, and observed mental confusion suggesting dementia.
Eligible patients received the Patient Health
Questionnaire–2 (PHQ-2)16 depression screening
by mail or telephone. Patients with PHQ-2 scores
of 3 or more (on a scale of 0 to 6, with higher
scores indicating a greater severity of depression)
completed the Patient Health Questionnaire–9
(PHQ-9) (with scores ranging from 0 to 27 and
higher scores indicating a greater severity of depression) by telephone interview. We used cutoff
points of 3 or higher on the PHQ-2 and 10 or
higher on the PHQ-9 to identify patients who
were eligible for the trial; scores in this range have
high sensitivity and specificity for major depression.16 Eligible patients completed a baseline interview and gave oral consent for laboratory tests
before an in-person visit, at which they provided
written informed consent.
Study Procedures
Research assistants who were unaware of the intervention status implemented study procedures.
At baseline, 6 months, and 12 months, telephone
interviewers assessed depression symptoms, health
risk behaviors, and satisfaction with the care of
depression and diabetes, coronary heart disease,
or both. Blood-pressure and glycated hemoglobin levels were measured in person at baseline,
6 months, and 12 months, and fasting LDL cholesterol levels were measured at baseline and 12
months. Blood pressure was measured three times
after 20 minutes of rest in a sitting position, with
the mean of the latter two blood-pressure readings used in the analyses. Laboratory tests were

performed at the laboratories of the health plan,
and the results entered into the electronic medical record.
Randomization
Patients were assigned to a treatment group with
the use of a permuted-block design, with randomly selected block sizes of 4, 6, and 8 patients.
After the baseline evaluation, a study nurse contacted patients assigned to the intervention to initiate treatment.
Study Design
Three part-time registered nurses with experience
in diabetes education collaborated with primary
care physicians to implement the intervention.
Study nurses attended a 2-day training course
on depression management, behavioral strategies,
and glycemic, blood-pressure, and lipid control.
A psychiatrist, a family physician, an internist who
specialized in nephrology, an endocrinologist, a
psychologist, and a nurse provided the training
materials that were developed for the trial (Appendix 2 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Intervention Program
A 12-month intervention aimed to manage depression and improve glycemic, blood-pressure,
and lipid control by integrating a treat-to-target
program for diabetes and coronary heart disease
with collaborative care for depression.17 The intervention combined support for self-care with
pharmacotherapy to control depression, hyperglycemia, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. Patients
worked collaboratively with nurses and primary
care physicians to establish individualized clinical and self-care goals. In structured visits in each
patient’s primary care clinic every 2 to 3 weeks,
nurses monitored the patient’s progress with respect to management of depression (according to
the PHQ-9 score), control of medical disease, and
self-care activities. Treatment protocols guided
adjustments of commonly used medicines in patients who did not achieve specific goals (Appendix 3 in the Supplementary Appendix). First-line
agents included diuretics and angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors for hypertension, statins
for hyperlipidemia, metformin for hyperglycemia, and citalopram or sustained-release bupropion for depression. Nurses followed patients
proactively to provide support for medication adherence.
Using motivational and encouraging coaching,18 nurses helped patients solve problems and
set goals for improved medication adherence and
self-care (e.g., exercising and self-monitoring of
blood-pressure and glucose levels). Patients received self-care materials, including The Depression
Helpbook,
19 a video compact disk on depression
care, a booklet and other materials on chronic
disease management, and self-monitoring devices (e.g., blood-pressure or blood-glucose meters) appropriate to their condition.
Supervision
Nurses received weekly supervision with a psychiatrist, primary care physician, and psychologist to review new cases and patient progress. An
electronic registry was used to track PHQ-9 scores
and glycated hemoglobin, LDL cholesterol, and
blood-pressure levels. The supervising physicians
recommended initial choices and changes in
medications tailored to the patient’s history and
clinical response. The nurse communicated recommended medication changes to the primary
care physician responsible for medication management.
Maintenance Plan
Once a patient achieved targeted levels for relevant measures, the nurse and patient developed a
maintenance plan that included stress reduction,
behavioral goals, continued use of medications,
and identification of prodromal symptoms associated with worsening depression and glycemic
control. The nurses then followed patients with
telephone calls every 4 weeks to complete a PHQ-9
and review adherence and laboratory test results.
Patients with disease control that worsened were
offered follow-up visits or telephone calls and protocol-based intensification of treatment regimens.
Outcome Measures
The initial primary outcome was the percentage
of patients achieving disease control at 12 months
on all three disease-control measures (glycated hemoglobin level, <7.0% or decrease of ≥0.5 percentage point; systolic blood pressure, <130 mm Hg
or decrease of ≥10 mm Hg; and LDL cholesterol
level, <100 mg per deciliter [<2.6 mmol per liter] or
decrease of ≥15%). This outcome was changed in
August 2009 (before study data became available
for analysis in November 2009) to a multivariate
primary outcome with simultaneous modeling of

four separate 12-month outcomes (depression according to the Symptom Checklist–20 [SCL-20]
score,20 glycated hemoglobin level, systolic blood
pressure, and LDL cholesterol level) allowing estimation of a single overall treatment effect (see
the Statistical Analysis section). Secondary measures included the originally proposed composite
measure of medical control at 12 months based on
the three disease-control factors, Patient Global
Rating of Improvement for depression (on a scale
of 1 to 7, with higher scores indicating improvement in symptoms),21 satisfaction with care for
depression and for diabetes, coronary heart disease, or both based on a 5-point scale (from poor
to excellent), quality of life over the previous
1-month period (on a scale from 0 to 10, with
higher scores indicating improved quality of life),
days of adherence to diet and exercise regimens
in the previous week, and health care costs.22 In
post hoc analyses, we assessed the proportion of
patients with a decrease in systolic blood pressure of 10 mm Hg or more from baseline and a
decrease in the glycated hemoglobin level of
1.0% or more.
Medication adjustments were defined by the
following treatment changes over a 12-month period: an increase in the number of medication
classes prescribed, a change in the daily dosage
of at least one ongoing medication, a switch to
a medication in a different class, or a switch to
a different medication within the same class23
(Appendix 4 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Enhanced Usual Care
Primary care physicians at the HMO plan provided
medical services for patients with diabetes, depression, and coronary heart disease. Patients
could self-refer to mental health care or primary
care physicians could refer them. After randomization, patients in the usual-care group were
advised to consult with their primary care physician to receive care for depression and for diabetes, coronary heart disease, or both. With the patients’ permission, primary care physicians were
notified about depression and poor control of
medical disease and received laboratory test results at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months.
Study Oversight
A data and safety monitoring board reviewed
methods initially and outcomes every 6 months
thereafter. The trial was approved by the institutional review board of the Group Health Research
Institute.
Statistical Analysis
We estimated that 145 patients would be needed
per group, assuming 15% attrition, to provide
80% power to detect a mean (±SD) difference in
SCL-20 depression scores of 0.165±0.5 points and
a 15% difference in patients achieving disease
control on all three measures (glycated hemoglobin level, <7.0% or decrease of ≥0.5%; systolic
blood pressure, <130 mm Hg or decrease of
≥10 mm Hg; and LDL cholesterol level, <100 mg
per deciliter [<2.6 mmol per liter] or decrease
of ≥15%) with a two-tailed alpha value of less
than 0.05.
While data collection was under way, we considered more efficient methods for estimating the
overall intervention effect that were consistent
with our goal of assessing the combined effect
on the four primary study outcomes. As a result,
in August 2009, we revised our analysis plans to
describe study outcomes at 12 months after randomization, using a scaled marginal model24; this
change was made before study data became available for analysis. Although the recruitment target of 290 patients was not reached, the use of
the scaled marginal model24 was considerably
more powerful than the analytic approach used to
plan sample size. This multivariate model jointly
described the four 12-month outcomes (SCL-20
score, glycated hemoglobin level, systolic blood
pressure, and LDL cholesterol level) and allowed
us to test for a primary effect of the intervention
among outcomes, scaling each outcome by its
standard error, so that intervention effects could
be interpreted as effect sizes. The model was estimated by iterating between estimation of the
covariance associated with outcomes and generalized-estimating-equation estimation of scaled
outcomes. All observations were used in the generalized-estimating-equation step, but only observations with complete covariate and outcome
data were used to update the standard-error estimate. We used a score test to assess the equality
of the intervention effect among outcomes. We
carried out post hoc analyses to assess the intervention effect on SCL-20 scores alone and on the
glycated hemoglobin level, systolic blood pressure, and LDL cholesterol level as a group.
Logistic regression was used to assess associations between intervention status and the Patient

Global Rating of Improvement score, clinical depression response (i.e., ≥50% decrease in the SCL20 score), and satisfaction with care at 6 and 12
months. Linear regression was used to assess the
relationship between intervention status and
quality of life at 6 and 12 months. Analyses
across time points were performed with the use
of regression models to adjust for baseline measures, with generalized estimating equations to
account for correlation over time. Pearson’s chisquare test was used to evaluate between-group
differences in the proportion of patients with
overall medical improvement, one or more adjustments in each of five classes of medications,
and 2 or more days per week of adherence to diet

Study Participants
Of 164 primary care physicians invited, 151 (92%)
agreed to participate. Of 214 patients enrolled
(106 in the intervention group and 108 in the
usual-care group), 88% completed all 6-month
telephone and laboratory assessments and 83%
completed all 12-month assessments (Fig. 1). The
characteristics of the patients in the intervention
group and the usual-care group were similar at
baseline (Table 1).
More than 99% of patients in the intervention
group completed an initial visit, and 82% had at
least four in-person visits with the nurse. Patients
in the intervention group had a mean of 10.0 inperson and 10.8 telephone visits with the nurse
care manager over the 12-month period. The
estimated mean cost per patient, including all
nurse contacts, physician supervision, and information system support, was $1,224 (Appendix 5
in the Supplementary Appendix).
Primary and Secondary Outcomes
At 12 months, patients in the intervention group
had significantly greater overall improvement
than controls with respect to the glycated hemoglobin, LDL cholesterol, systolic blood pressure,
and SCL-20 depression outcomes (Table 2). Post
hoc tests showed significant differences between
the intervention group and the control group on
the SCL-20 score alone and the joint 12-month
glycated hemoglobin, LDL cholesterol, and systolic blood-pressure outcomes, as well as significant between-group differences on three of the
four disease-control measures. Post hoc analyses
also showed that patients in the intervention
group had significant improvement on the joint
primary outcome as compared with controls with
each of the three nurses who provided the intervention (P<0.05). The unadjusted differences between the intervention and control groups in
individual outcomes were as follows: glycated
hemoglobin level, 0.58 percentage points; LDL
cholesterol level, 6.9 mg per deciliter (0.2 mmol
per liter); systolic blood pressure, 5.1 mm Hg;
and SCL-20 score, 0.40 (effect size, 0.67) (Appendix 6 in the Supplementary Appendix).
At 12 months, patients in the intervention
group had significantly greater improvement than

controls on the Patient Global Rating of Improvement, and a higher proportion had a 50% or
greater reduction in the SCL-20 depression score
(Table 3). At the 12-month follow-up, a significantly higher percentage of patients in the intervention group than in the control group had
values on all three medical risk factors that were
either below guidelines or showed clinically significant improvement. Patients in the intervention group also had greater improvement in quality of life, were more satisfied with the care that
they received for depression and for diabetes,
coronary heart disease, or both, and were more
likely to have a decrease of 1.0% or greater in the
glycated hemoglobin level from baseline and a
decrease of 10 mm Hg or greater in systolic blood
pressure (Appendix 7 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Quality of Care
As compared with controls, patients in the intervention group were significantly more likely to
have one or more changes in the insulin dose and
in antihypertensive and antidepressant medications over the 12-month period. There was no significant difference between groups in the proportion of patients adhering to recommended diet
and exercise at least 2 days per week (Table 4,
and Appendix 8 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Adverse Events
Over the 12-month trial, 27 patients in the intervention group and 23 patients in the control group
had at least one hospitalization, and 1 patient in

Discussion
The intervention was associated with improved
outcomes among the joint primary disease-control measures in depressed patients with poorly
controlled diabetes, coronary heart disease, or
both. These four disease-control measures are associated with an increased risk of complications
and death among patients with diabetes, coronary heart disease, or both.9,14,15,25-28 Patients in
the intervention group (37%) were also more likely than patients who received usual care (22%) to
meet guideline criteria or achieve clinically significant improvement from baseline values for
control of glycated hemoglobin, LDL cholesterol,
and systolic blood pressure and to have a decrease in systolic blood pressure of 10 mm Hg or
more and a 1.0% or greater decrease in the glycated hemoglobin level.
Improvements in the primary outcomes in our
study compared favorably with changes in single-condition quality-improvement trials. For example, a meta-analysis of 37 trials of collaborative care for depression showed an effect size of

0.25 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.18 to 0.31)3
versus 0.67 in this trial. In a meta-analysis of 66
trials of diabetes care, the glycated hemoglobin
level decreased by a mean of 0.42% (95% CI,
0.29 to 0.54)1 versus 0.58% in this study. In a
systematic review of 44 trials, systolic blood pressure decreased by a mean of 4.5 mm Hg (95%
CI, 1.8 to 6.6)29 versus 5.1 mm Hg in this trial.
Although effects on the glycated hemoglobin level,
LDL cholesterol level, and systolic blood pressure
were modest, on a population level they may
meaningfully decrease the risks of macrovascular and microvascular disease.28,30
Patients in the intervention group were more
satisfied than controls with the care that they
received for medical and psychological disorders.
Satisfaction with care predicts enhanced self-care
and more favorable outcomes.31 The intervention
may have improved patient outcomes and satisfaction by systematically supporting both patients
and the primary care team. Nurses enhanced patient self-care with education encompassing selfmonitoring, behavioral activation (increase in enjoyable activities), goal setting, and problem solving
to improve medication adherence. Weekly supervision and case reviews by attending physicians
and nurses provided timely support for the primary care physician in adjusting medications to
achieve specific clinical goals. These intervention components are consistent with evidencebased changes in primary care systems that are
essential for improving outcomes in patients with
chronic conditions.32
Patients with multiple medical conditions and
depression have high health care costs.33 Those
with three or more chronic conditions (43% of
Medicare beneficiaries) account for more than
80% of Medicare health care costs.34 Coexisting
depression is associated with increased morbidity, disability, and mortality and reduced quality
of life.12,14,15 Developing effective models of care
for such patients is a key challenge in improving
the performance of health care systems.35 Our
results suggest that an intervention involving coordinated efforts of physicians and nurses may
facilitate the care of patients with multiple conditions within a primary care medical home.
The limitations of the present study include
the lack of a control group with the same number of visits as the intervention group and inadequate power to examine between-group differences in rates of hospitalization or cardiovascular
events. This trial was conducted in one health
plan and used highly experienced nurses, potentially limiting generalizability. “Spillover” of the
intervention is possible, since primary care physicians cared for patients in both the intervention
and control groups; usual care was enhanced in
the trial by notification of primary care physicians about depressive illness and the results of
baseline, 6-month, and 12-month laboratory tests.
Nevertheless, improvements in outcomes were
significantly greater among patients in the intervention group (Appendix 10 in the Supplementary Appendix).
In summary, an intervention involving proactive follow-up by nurse care managers working
closely with physicians, integrating the management of medical and psychological illnesses, and
using individualized treatment regimens guided
by treat-to-target principles improved both medical outcomes and depression in depressed patients
with diabetes, coronary heart disease, or both.
