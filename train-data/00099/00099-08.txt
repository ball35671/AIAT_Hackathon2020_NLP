1. Introduction
Active participation in healthcare, patient engagement, includes
preparing for appointments, exchanging relevant information with
clinicians, shared decision making, and adherence to agreed upon
plans of care [1]. More active patient engagement is associated
with better health behaviors, improved health outcomes, and more
efficient healthcare utilization [2,3]. Although the important role of
patients is recognized in widely accepted models such as the
Chronic Care Model [4,5], few interventions are available to
prepare patients for this role.
Older adults are at risk for inadequate patient engagement [6]
due to factors including some older adults’ preference for passive
involvement in care or leaving decisions to physicians [6–8]. Older
adults also face specific challenges that can make engagement
more difficult, including insufficient health literacy [9] and
complex medical needs related to chronic illnesses [10–12].
Unfortunately, the consequences of passive engagement can be
serious. Lack of patient engagement introduces opportunities for
breakdowns in healthcare communication, insufficient knowledge
to manage one’s health and negative impacts on patient
satisfaction, patient safety and health [3,13,14].
Patient-friendly educational materials about the importance of
active healthcare engagement are widely available [15]. However,
the potential benefits of mass distribution of these materials have
not been established. There is some evidence that simple and
minimally intense interventions such as encouraging question
listing in waiting rooms before appointments or providing
education on communication with physicians in community
settings can improve aspects of patient engagement and perceptions of control during appointments [16,17]. It is important to
note, however, that several studies of low-intensity interventions
(e.g., 10 min to 2 h of education, videos and/or face-to-face
coaching) have documented fewer behavior changes than
expected [18–20].
We designed and tested a patient engagement intervention for
older adults with multiple chronic illnesses called Making the Most
of Your Healthcare. The intervention content, distributed by the
National Institute on Aging, was delivered using evidence based
behavior change techniques over the course of three contacts: one
workshop and two telephone calls. Contacts were designed to
motivate behaviors that characterize active patient engagement,

ABSTRACT
Objective: This study tested the efficacy of a patient engagement intervention for older adults with
multiple chronic illnesses.
Methods: Seventy-nine participants were randomly assigned to receive the intervention (Intervention
Group), contacts on a different topic (Safety Group), or Usual Care. The Intervention and Safety Groups
attended a 2-h workshop and participated in phone calls; one before and one after a naturally-occurring
medical encounter. The Intervention Group discussed patient engagement concepts from publicly
distributed content. The Safety Group discussed general safety (e.g., fire safety, identity theft). Self-report
measures were gathered by telephone interview at Baseline and 6-months following Baseline.
Results: We did not find expected improvements in patient activation and health-related quality of life.
However, the Intervention Group was the only group to show a statistically significant improvement in
self-efficacy for self-management.
Conclusion: The intervention shows promise for improving quality of life and/or health, but requires
refinement to reach persons not already engaged in their healthcare and to strengthen its effects.
Practice implications: Patient-directed skills training interventions may be a successful way to support
clinicians’ and others’ efforts to encourage older patients to be actively involved in their care.

and were developed using Self-Determination Theory of motivation as a guide.
Self-Determination Theory suggests that patient engagement
interventions must address why patients chose to become and
remain active in their own care [21]. The theory delineates types of
motivation, which are influenced by one’s perceived competence
for a behavior, whether the behavior is perceived as one’s choice
(autonomy), and the relevance of the behavior for meeting
personal goals (relatedness) [22]. Accordingly, the theory suggests
that interventions to change health-related behavior, including
engagement in healthcare, should generate extrinsic motivation by
making patients feel like they can do what is asked of them, feel
like their health behaviors are autonomous and lead to outcomes
that are personally relevant [22,23].
The purpose of this paper is to describe the intervention and an
initial test of its efficacy.
2. Methods
This study was supported by a grant from the Scott & White
Healthcare Research Foundation and conducted in collaboration
with physicians, nurses and other personnel at the Scott & White
Center for Diagnostic Medicine. Funding was granted following a
thorough peer review process by an internal review board. The
Foundation did not dictate research methods or have influence
over research findings.
2.1. Participants
Primary care patients in a large Internal Medicine clinic were
eligible to participate if they were 65 years of age or older and had
been treated for at least two of seven qualifying chronic illnesses,
including (1) arthritis, (2) lung disease, (3) heart disease, (4)
diabetes, (5) hypertension, (6) depression, and (7) osteoporosis
defined by International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9) codes.
Participants had received treatment for the qualifying illnesses in
the 12 months prior to Baseline, communicated in English for
healthcare interactions, had access to a telephone, and expected to
receive most of their care within the healthcare system for at least
8 months following Baseline. Potential participants diagnosed with
dementia, receiving hospice care, unable to travel to the clinic for a
workshop or living outside of the recruitment area were excluded.
Potential participants were identified through a two-step
screening process. First, electronic billing data were scanned to
identify persons likely to meet inclusion criteria. Second, a subset
of those identified was randomly selected for additional screening
by medical chart review to confirm eligibility, identify a primary
care physician, and extract contact information. Primary care
physicians co-signed invitation letters and excluded patients they
felt should not be contacted.
An invitation and brochure invited patients to contact the study
office via mail (self-addressed stamped envelopes) or by telephone.
Additional screening and the informed consent process were then
conducted by telephone. Consent forms were mailed for participants’ signature and returned to the study office. The study was
approved by the Scott & White Healthcare Institutional Review
Board (IRB), which approved a waiver of authorization in order for
the research team to access the minimal amount of patient health
information required to identify potentially eligible participants and
mail invitations to participate in the study. Participants authorized
access to private health information during the informed consent
process, allowing study personnel to gather additional study-related
information from medical records.
Seventy-nine older adults enrolled and were randomly assigned
to the Intervention Group (n = 26), Safety Group (n = 27) or Usual
Care Group (n = 26). Fig. 1 describes the flow of participants through
the study protocol. The sample was predominantly female (65.8%),
non-Hispanic/Latino (98%), white (92.4%), married or living as
married (70.9%), had attended at least some college (84.6%), and had
an annual household income of $50,000 or more (60.6%).
2.2. Making the Most of Your Healthcare intervention
The intervention offered tools and taught skills to (a) prepare
for healthcare appointments, (b) communicate effectively and
gather information and support during healthcare appointments,
and (c) follow through on plans of care. Intervention contacts
included a 2-h workshop and two telephone calls individualized to
the patient’s pre- and post-healthcare appointment needs. During
the workshop, a group of participants and one leader (‘‘coach’’)
discussed content from A Guide for Older People: Talking with Your
Doctor [15]. Following the workshop, coaches monitored participants’ upcoming healthcare appointments using electronic records
available in the integrated healthcare system in which the
intervention was implemented. Coaches and participants took
part in a brief coaching phone call within a week before a
scheduled appointment and another call within a week after that
appointment. They discussed the workshop content in the context
of each participant’s unique circumstances during these calls.
To enhance coach adherence to the intervention, detailed
protocols were used for workshops and coaching calls. The PI or
other observers occasionally completed a workshop fidelity
checklist or telephone protocol checklist while a coach delivered
sessions and then provided feedback on the degree to which
fidelity was achieved. Checklists and protocols were used to
encourage ongoing adherence to protocols but were not gathered
on a random basis as would be required to quantify adherence
because of the small number of sessions completed for this
relatively small study.
2.2.1. Workshop
Workshops were offered at convenient times in the clinic
participants accessed for primary care. Participants received print
copies of A Guide for Older People: Talking with Your Doctor, Bound
Fig. 1. Flow of participants through the study.
208 A.K. Hochhalter et al. / Patient Education and Counseling 81 (2010) 207–213
for Your Good Health (also an NIA publication) and a list of local
community resources upon arrival at the workshop.
The workshop was divided into four sections—introduction and
breaking the ice, giving information and getting ready for
appointments, getting information at appointments, and following
through after appointments. Group sharing, role play, practice with
individual feedback, and support from peers and leaders were used
to teach materials. Fig. 2 outlines the topics covered and teaching
techniques employed.
2.2.2. Coaching telephone calls
Appointments following the workshop were tracked through
electronic appointment records for up to 3 months after Baseline.
Within 5 days before (pre-appointment call) and 5 days after
(follow-up call), coaches contacted participants by telephone for
sessions that lasted approximately 15 min. On the pre-appointment
call, the coach and participant reviewed workshop materials related
to preparing for the upcoming appointment. On the follow-up call,
they discussed the participant’s of how planning and appointment
interactions worked and talked about plans for following through on
the plan of care. Calls adhered to the Five As framework for
behavioral counseling (assess, advise, agree, assist, arrange) [24,25].
In this framework, the coach and participant agree to the specific
content they will cover following an initial assessment and the
coach’s advice. Calls ended with arrangements to either talk again
following the appointment or suggestions from the coach for
continuing to use the tools and skills learned in the intervention.
2.3. Safety intervention
The safety intervention was used as an attention control
condition. It employed the same types and number of contacts as
the intervention, the only difference being that the content of the
safety contacts was general safety for older adults. The content
included arranging the home environment to avoid fall risks and
fire risks, identify theft and caregiver stress.
2.4. Objectives and measures
Our objective was to test the feasibility of delivering the
intervention (e.g., will patients enroll and attend workshops?) and
the efficacy of the intervention for improving patient engagement
and health-related quality of life. Participants completed selfreport assessments by telephone at Baseline and again 6-month
later. Study contacts for the Intervention Group and Safety Group
occurred in the first 3 months after Baseline. Telephone interviews
were conducted by a research assistant who was blinded to group
assignment.
2.4.1. Patient Activation Measure [26,27]
The Patient Activation Measure is a 13-item assessment of
knowledge and confidence related to participation in care.
Responses fall on a 4-point scale (Disagree strongly to Agree
strongly) and are summed to generate a raw score, which is then
converted to an ‘‘Activation Score’’ that falls between 0 and 100.
Higher scores represent more active patient engagement [28].
Change in Patient Activation Measure scores was our primary
outcome.
2.4.2. Communication with physicians scale [29]
This 3-item scale collects participants’ ratings of the frequency
with which they (a) list questions for appointments, (b) ask
questions of physicians and (c) discuss personal problems related
to illness on a scale from Never (0) to Always (5). It yields a single
average score ranging from 0 to 5, with higher scores indicating
better communication with physicians.
2.4.3. Health-related quality of life
Health-related quality of life was measured with the CDC
Healthy Days Measure (HRQOL-14) [30]. We were particularly
interested in self-rated health and the unhealthy days composite
measures within this module. Self-rated health is reported on a 5-
item ordinal scale from Poor [1] to Excellent [5]. Scores were
dichotomized as Low [1–3] and High [4,5]. Unhealthy mental days
and unhealthy physical days in the past 30 days are reported
separately. They can then be totaled with a maximum score of 30
(‘‘Total Unhealthy Days’’).
2.4.4. Self-Efficacy for Managing Chronic Disease [29]
The Self-Efficacy for Managing Chronic Disease assessment uses
six items to measure confidence for self-managing chronic
conditions. Responses fall on a 10-point scale (not at all confident

A.K. Hochhalter et al. / Patient Education and Counseling 81 (2010) 207–213 209
to totally confident). A mean score is calculated, yielding a single
score ranging from 1 to 10. Higher scores indicate higher selfefficacy.
2.4.5. Self-reported health care utilization [29]
Participants reported their number of outpatient/clinic visits,
emergency room visits, hospitalizations, and nights spent in the
hospital in the previous 6 months. Electronic health records were
also queried to document emergency room and hospital admissions at Scott & White Healthcare, but the record data are not
included in this paper and did not include healthcare utilization
outside of the integrated healthcare system.
2.4.6. Medical chart review
Study personnel gathered information from participants’
electronic medical records on number of chronic illness diagnoses
(of the seven qualifying illnesses listed in the Section 2.1) and
information required to calculate a score on the Charlson
Comorbidity Index [31]. The index score ranges from 0 to 43
and indicates severity of one’s combination of diagnoses given his
or her age. Severity is based on risk of mortality and was calculated
using a publicly available algorithm [32].
2.5. Sample size calculation, randomization sequence and data
analysis
We calculated the sample size required to achieve at least 80%
power using a 5% significance criterion. A sample size of at least 20
subjects per group, a total of 60, achieved this criterion for testing
an effect size of 0.42 for between, within, and the between by
within interaction in our repeated measures design. The calculation was based on estimated mean and change scores for the
Patient Activation Measure derived from the literature and our
‘best guess’ for expected changes with intervention because one
purpose of this small study was to better define expected changes
in the measure with intervention. To allow for approximately 20%
attrition, we recruited at least 25 participants per group but did not
turn away willing participants after they had been contacted.
The randomization schedule was generated using SAS version
9.1.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) with an equal proportion
assigned to each of the three groups in the master list. Following
Baseline, a study coordinator who also served as a coach requested
group assignment from the biostatistics office for each participant.
Interviewers were blinded to group assignment.
An intention-to-treat analysis was conducted. All variables
were summarized at Baseline and post-intervention using
descriptive statistics (Table 1). Groups were compared at Baseline
using Anova or Kruskal–Wallis test for continuous variables and
Chi-square test or Fisher’s Exact test for categorical variables.
Mixed effects linear models and the Generalized Estimating
Equation (GEE) model were utilized to assess changes in
standardized Patient Activation Measure scores and binary SelfRated Health scores (Low = 1–3; High = 4–5). A mixed effects
Poisson model was used to assess the effects of the intervention on
Total Unhealthy Days. All other variables were entered into the
models initially as potential predictors. Intervention Group and
assessment time (Baseline or 6-month Follow-Up) were entered
into each model. Reduced models were tested by entering
significant predictors from the initial full models that adjusted
for all potential covariate predictors. A p-value of 0.05 indicated
statistical significance. SAS 9.1.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) was
used for data management and statistical analysis.
3. Results
3.1. Hypothesis testing
There were no significant differences detected at Baseline
among the groups for any of the variables. We tested three a priori
hypotheses about change from Baseline to Follow-Up (6 months
interval) for our three primary outcome measures; standardized
Patient Activation Measure scores, Unhealthy Days, and Low
versus High Self-Rated Health. For all three health-related
outcomes we predicted the most improvement for participants
in the Appointments Group, which participated in our Making the
Most of Your Healthcare intervention. Parameter estimates
and other descriptors for the final models are presented in
Tables 2 and 3.
3.1.1. Patient Activation Measure scores
Across the three groups there was a significant increase in
standardized mean Patient Activation Measure score from Baseline
to Follow-Up (p < 0.0001). Mean scores increased significantly
from Baseline to Follow-Up for the Appointments Group
(p = 0.002), but also for the Safety and Usual Care Groups.
Compared to the Appointments Group, there was no statistical
difference in the magnitude of change from Baseline to Follow-Up
for the Usual Care or Safety Groups. Self-Efficacy was a significant
predictor of Patient Activation Scores (p < 0.001).
3.1.2. Total Unhealthy Days
No significant effects or interactions of Group or Time were
observed in Total Unhealthy Days after accounting for the
significant effects of Self-Efficacy (p < 0.001) and Low Self-Rated
Health (p = 0.018).
3.1.3. Low versus High Self-Rated Health
Initially Low and High Self-Rated Health were entered as levels
of a binary variable into a logistic regression for mixed effects. That
model did not fully converge, so the Generalized Estimating

Equation (GEE) method for binary outcomes was employed. Only
the Safety Group showed a significant change from Baseline to
Follow-Up in the percent of group members reporting High SelfRated Health (p = 0.013), although the change observed in the
Appointment Group did approach significance (p = 0.075). Three
predictors had significant effects on Self-Rated Health classification—Self-Efficacy, reporting 14 or more mentally unhealthy days
in the past 30 days, and number of chronic conditions (i.e., of the
seven qualifying conditions). Higher self-efficacy was associated
with increased likelihood of High Self-Rated Health. More mentally
unhealthy days and more chronic conditions were associated with
increased likelihood of Low Self-Rated Health.
3.1.4. Post hoc analyses of self-efficacy for self-management
We conceptualized self-efficacy as a potential predictor of
change in patient activation and health-related quality of life.
Holding all other variables constant, Self-Efficacy for SelfManagement was a significant predictor in our models of all three
primary outcomes as expected. We therefore hypothesized that
the intervention may have impacted self-efficacy despite having
no consistent effect on patient activation, unhealthy days per
month or self-rated health. We investigated this post hoc
hypothesis, we fit an additional mixed effects linear model with
self-efficacy as the outcome of interest. Self-efficacy score was
significantly higher at Follow-Up than at Baseline for the
Appointment Group (p = 0.042). Although the Safety Group also
had a higher mean score at Follow-Up compared to Baseline, this
difference did not achieve statistical significance (p = 0.16); the
Usual Care Group score decreased slightly and insignificantly from
Baseline to Follow-Up (p = 0.686). Although the Appointment
Group was the only group that showed significant improvement in
mean self-efficacy scores from Baseline to Follow-Up, the model
did not yield significant differences between improvement for
Safety Group and improvement for Appointment Group or
between improvement for Usual Care Group and improvement
for Appointment Group.
4. Discussion and conclusion
4.1. Discussion
Contrary to our expectations, the Making the Most of Your
Healthcare (Appointment Group) did not improve patient activation, self-rated health or reported unhealthy days. Despite the lack
of support for our hypotheses, self-efficacy for managing one’s
chronic illnesses was consistently identified as a predictor of our
primary outcomes for the three groups. The Appointment Group
was the only group that showed a significant improvement in
mean self-efficacy scores from Baseline to Follow-Up assessment
times. We initially hypothesized that self-efficacy would predict of
changes in our main outcomes because self-efficacy is key to
motivating patients to actively engage in their healthcare [33–35].
Given the close connection between self-efficacy and health
behaviors, we believe our finding is promising but that there is a
need to strengthen the intervention.
The effects of the intervention were not strong, despite having
adequate power to test our hypotheses. We believe this is due in
part to improvements on outcome measures in the attention
control group. Although the content delivered to that group was
not related to healthcare engagement, it is possible that this group

benefited from interacting with study personnel associated with
their healthcare system and affiliated with their healthcare
providers. In addition, those who enrolled had long-standing
relationships with their physicians and may have been more likely
to engage in healthcare than those who did not enroll. This
happened in part because of our efforts to invite a large and diverse
group of patients to participate. Recruitment through letters from
the study director and physicians likely appealed to persons most
interested in being involved in healthcare and other types of
community activities, making the intervention less influential than
it may be with other more targeted groups.
Although we did not find expected differences, our sense is that
participants benefited most from (a) discussing their healthcare
experiences peers and coaches, (b) interacting with the healthcare
system for educational purposes in addition to medical visits, and (c)
using tools to documentmedications, prioritize questions, and record
changes insymptoms.Wewillmodify the intervention to incorporate
feedback from study personnel and participants. For example, some
participants told personnel that they did not need the intervention
but wanted to participate to help others. Attrition from the study was
higher than expected. Some participants did not attend a workshop
due to time constraints or unreported reasons; possibly discomfort
with the group format. Others did not have a primary care visit during
the intervention period. We also learned that the intervention
coaching calls were well-received, but likely unnecessary. In all but
one intervention call, participants expressed no need to discuss the
intervention content. Intervention contacts are likely only needed to
introduce the concept of active patient engagement, develop skills for
using the tools, and encourage tool use.
A refined intervention must (a) be easily accessed by persons
who are not already engaged in care, (b) available in either
multiple formats or a single format that is convenient and
attractive to all, and (c) flexible enough to allow natural variation
in when content is delivered.
Although we are cognizant of the important role clinicians play in
the patient–clinician relationship, the intervention was designed to
be patient-directed and not to deliver content to physicians for two
reasons. First, patient behavior influences physician behavior during
medical encounters [14,36]. More engaged patient behaviors may
improve the quality of patient–physician interactions without
additional interventions for physicians. Second, we were particularly interested in whether patient-directed interventions alone can
increase patient engagement. Studies of less intense interventions
have documented fewer behavior changes than expected [18–
20,37,38]. This intervention was a more intense patient-directed
intervention, with a strong focus on skill building rather than cuing
patient behaviors. Encouraging physician receptiveness to new
patient skills and tools may be required for this skills building
intervention to show strong benefits.
4.2. Conclusion
Based on positive feedback from participants and the finding
that the Appointment group showed significant improvement in
self-efficacy for managing their chronic illnesses, we conclude that
the Making the Most of Your Healthcare intervention holds promise
for improving engagement in healthcare among older adults.
However, refinements to the intervention are necessary to target
an appropriate audience for the intervention and deliver the
content in ways that reach most persons with skills training that
can be of benefit.
4.3. Practice implications
Few resources are currently directed at preparing these adults
with the skills needed for their unique role in their own healthcare.
This study provides evidence that simple skills training interventions might increase older adults’ confidence for managing their
chronic illnesses and might therefore hold potential for helping
prepare older adults to actively engage in care. However, a refined
intervention is required to attract persons who are not currently
engaged in care and to successfully deliver content that meets the
needs and preferences of older adults with chronic illness.
