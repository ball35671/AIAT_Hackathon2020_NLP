OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the long-term mortality effect
of a home-based intervention previously shown to reduce
functional difficulties and whether survivorship benefits
differ according to initial mortality risk level.
DESIGN: Two-group randomized trial with survivorship
followed up to 4 years from study entry.
SETTING: Homes of urban community-living elderly people.
PARTICIPANTS: Three hundred nineteen adults aged 70
and older with difficulties performing daily activities.
INTERVENTION: Occupational and physical therapy
sessions to instruct participants in compensatory strategies,
home modifications, home safety, fall recovery techniques,
and balance and muscle strength exercises.
MEASUREMENTS: Survival time was number of days
between baseline interview and date of death, as determined using data from the National Death Index or
December 31, 2005. Participants were stratified according
to baseline mortality risk (low, moderate, high) using a
prognostic indicator.
RESULTS: At 2 years, intervention participants (n 5 160)
had a 5.6% mortality rate (n 5 9 deaths) and controls
(n 5 159) a 13.2% rate (n 5 21 deaths; P 5.02). Mortality
rates remained lower for intervention participants up to 3.5
years from study entry. At 2 years, intervention participants
with moderate mortality risk had a 16.7% mortality rate
(n 5 16 deaths/96), compared with 28.2% for equivalent
control group participants (n 5 24 deaths/85; P 5.02). By 3
years, mortality rates were not statistically significantly
different between the experimental and control groups.
CONCLUSIONS: The intervention extended survivorship
up to 3.5 years and maintained statistically significant
differences for 2 years. Subjects at moderate mortality risk
derived the most intervention benefit. Findings suggest that
the intervention could be a low-cost clinical tool to
delay functional decline and mortality. J Am Geriatr Soc

Functional disability due to age-related chronic or debilitating conditions is common in older adults, and its
prevalence is expected to increase as the population ages,
particularly in the oldest old.1 As a marker of frailty, functional difficulties have significant negative consequences,
including social disengagement, fall risk, depression, reliance on personal assistance, relocation, and high service
utilization and healthcare costs.2,3 Moreover, functional
disability is predictive of mortality.4
Numerous interventions to address disability have been
evaluated, with most studies showing small to no treatment
effects.5,6 Studies examining mortality effects of interventions designed to reduce disability have been conducted
mostly in countries other than the United States, focused on
specific diseases or clinical populations, or reported inconsistent results.7–9 Thus, the best treatment for minimizing
disability, and whether this reduces mortality, is unclear.
It was previously reported that a home-based occupational (OT) and physical therapy (PT) intervention (Advancing Better Living for Elders (ABLE) program), tested in
a randomized controlled trial, reduced functional difficulties, fear of falling, and home hazards and enhanced selfefficacy and use of control-oriented strategies (e.g., assistive
devices, home modifications, energy conservation techniques).10,11 It was also found that, by 12 months, ABLE
participants had a 1% mortality rate, compared with a 10%
mortality rate in control group participants, with subjects
who were hospitalized before study enrollment having a
greater survivorship advantage (0% mortality rate for
ABLE participants vs 21% mortality rate for control group

participants).12 These statistically significant differences in
mortality rates at 12 months suggested the possibility of a
survivorship effect beyond this initial study period and the
importance of evaluating how long the intervention benefit
lasted.
This follow-up study examined National Death Index
(NDI) records to determine length of time ABLE participants sustained a survivorship benefit and whether survivorship benefits differed according to level of risk for
mortality at time of study enrollment.13 As an exploratory
study, there was no prediction concerning length of time of
survivorship, but based on the initial findings concerning
the benefits conferred for participants hospitalized before
study enrollment, it was expected that the ABLE program
would have the strongest effect on those entering the study
with a moderate mortality risk level. Alternately, less intervention benefit was expected for those at high risk who, it
was reasoned, would require medical intervention beyond
the scope of ABLE. It was also anticipated that subjects at
low mortality risk would enter the study with a survivorship
advantage such that ABLE would have minimal effect on
survivorship.
METHODS
Study Sample and Procedures
All study procedures including Consolidated Standards of
Reporting Trials flow chart, recruitment, and randomization are reported elsewhere.10 Briefly, participants were recruited from the community, ambulatory, aged 70 and
older, English-speaking, and cognitively intact (Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score 423)14 and reported
one or more functional difficulties. Participants were randomized to treatment (the ABLE program) or to a usual
care control group. Baseline interviews were conducted
from September 14, 2000, to July 14, 2003. NDI records
were obtained for deaths up to December 31, 2005. Thus,
follow-up ranged from 2.5 to 5.25 years from study entry.
ABLE Intervention
As described elsewhere,10–12 the ABLE program compensated for declining abilities by introducing modifications to
home environments and task performance. The active phase
consisted of five OT contacts (four 90-minute visits and one
brief telephone contact) and one 90-minute PT visit during
the first 6 months. Occupational therapists worked with
participants to identify and prioritize problem areas. For
each identified targeted area, occupational therapists observed and evaluated performance for safety, efficiency,
difficulty level, environmental barriers and supports. Occupational therapists problem-solved with participants to
refine personal goals, and identify behavioral and environmental contributors to performance difficulties. They then
instructed subjects in strategies customized to needs, preferences, and environmental contingencies. Strategies included cognitive (e.g., reframing), behavioral (e.g., pace
self), and environmental (e.g., grab bars) modifications.
Physical therapists provided balance and muscle strengthening exercises to support participation in targeted areas,
fall recovery techniques to reduce fear of falling, and referrals for additional therapy if necessary.
The maintenance phase (from 6–12 months), consisted
of three brief OT telephone calls to reinforce strategy use
and help generalize use to newly identified problems. In a
final home visit, occupational therapists reviewed and reinforced strategies and obtained closure.
Control group participants did not receive intervention
contact but, at study completion (12 months), received a
home safety education booklet.
Measures
Background characteristics included age, sex, education
(ohigh school, high school, 4high school), living arrangement (alone, with others), race (white, African American,
other), and financial difficulty (0–4, higher scores representing greater difficulty).
Risk Groups
To categorize participants according to mortality risk level,
11 of a 12-item validated prognostic indicator was used and
its scoring approach followed.15 One prognostic item, body
mass (point 5 1 for high body mass), derived from weight
and height information, was not included because these
data were not collected in the trial. The 11 items and assigned risk points were age (70–74 5 3 points; 75–79 5 4
points; 80–84 5 5 points; 85 5 5 points), sex (male 5 2),
comorbidities and health behavior (diabetes mellitus 5 1;
cancer 5 2; lung disease 5 2; heart failure 5 2; current
smoker 5 2), and functional difficulties (bathing 5 2; managing finances 5 2; walking several blocks 5 2; pushing/
pulling heavy objects 5 1). Higher scores indicated greater
mortality risk.
A risk score (range 1–15) was calculated for each participant by adding points for each risk factor and then categorizing overall risk scores into three groups: low risk
(Group I) (1–5), moderate risk (Group II) (6–9), and high
risk (Group III) ( 10), based on the previous study.15
Whereas the previous study had a fourth risk group (414),
only two individuals had these scores, and thus they were
included in risk Group III. Average mortality risk scores
were 4.1 for the low-risk group, 7.8 for the moderate-risk
group, 11.3 for the high-risk group, and 8.1 for the entire
sample. Similar to the original 12-item index, it was found
that the 11-item version differentiated between risk groups.
Although the mortality risk scores from the current study
were slightly higher for each risk group than those of the
previous study, this was expected given that the sample in
the current study was older.
The three risk groups were compared on each risk factor and demographic characteristics using chi-square (w2)
procedures. As in the previous study, statistically significant
differences emerged between risk groups in the expected
direction for each health and functional risk item except for
smoking. The high-risk group had greater functional difficulties in all areas and a higher proportion of health conditions than the moderate- and low-risk groups (P 5.001–
.003 for each item). Risk groups also differed in terms of
education (w2 5 16.1, P 5.003) and income (w2 5 5 10.2,
P 5.04), with greater risk for those with less than a high
school education and annual income less than $20,000.
As expected and similar to the previous study, risk
groups differed in terms of mortality rate. At 2 years, the
mortality rate for low-risk participants was 5.9% (n 5 3/51
JAGS MARCH 2009–VOL. 57, NO. 3 LONG-TERM MORTALITY EFFECTS OF A HOME INTERVENTION 477
deaths), compared with 8.3% (n 5 15/181 deaths) for moderate-risk participants, and 13.8% (n 5 12/87 deaths) for
those at highest mortality risk.
Data Analysis
The dependent variable, survival time, was defined as number of days between baseline interview (randomization
date) and date of death or censoring. The only censoring
was administrative; all participants’ follow-up was administratively censored at December 31, 2005, corresponding
to the last date for which NDI information was available.
The main effects of treatment and risk level were analyzed
using standard statistical methods for censored data, with
graphs of survival plotted using the Kaplan-Meier method.
Statistical significance of treatment and risk level was determined using log rank tests. Survival rates were estimated
for treatment condition at 2, 3, and 4 years from date of
study entry and risk level at 2 years from study entry. There
was no censoring before 2 years of follow-up. Rates reported for time periods longer than 2 years were based on
the Kaplan-Meier analyses. SPSS version 15.0 (SPSS Inc.,
Chicago, IL) was used with significance level set at .05.
RESULTS
A detailed description of the study sample has been presented elsewhere.10,11 Briefly, at baseline, participants
(N 5 319) were on average 79 years old, primarily female
(81.8%), living alone (61.8%), and reporting low income.
Thirty-one percent of participants had less than a high
school education, 52.7% were white, and 45.5% were African American. At baseline, participants reported some to
a lot of difficulty ambulating (mean 2.5  0.8) and performing self-care (1.8  0.6) and instrumental activities
(2.1  0.6). Also at baseline, participants reported a mean
of seven health conditions, the most common being arthritis
(84.3%), hypertension (70.5%), cataracts or macular degeneration (43.0%), cardiovascular problems (39.0%), and
diabetes mellitus (23.3%). Furthermore, at baseline, 69.6%
of participants rated their health as fair to poor, and 51.9%
indicated their health was not as good as 1 year before. As
previously reported, there were no large or statistically significant differences between treatment (n 5 160) and control group (n 5 159) participants in terms of these
background characteristics, health status indices, or primary outcome measures.10
Long-Term Mortality Effects
Overall, as of the administrative cutoff (December 31,
2005), 76 (24.0%) of 319 participants had died, of whom
42 (55.0%) were control group participants and 34
(45.0%) treatment participants. By 4 years from study entry, 74 or 319 individuals had died (40 control; 34 treatment). Two additional deaths occurred in the control group
after 4 years but before the administrative cut off.
Figure 1 presents an estimate of a life table to 4 years
from baseline interview for participants according to treatment assignment without stratification according to level of
risk. As shown, the survival curves separate and then come
together, with an initial survival benefit for the treatment
group remaining up to 3.5 years. However, the statistical
significance of the comparison depends on the point at
which the data are examined. At 2 years, the treatment
condition had a substantial and statistically significant
effect (according to log-rank test) on survival (w2 5 5.4,
P 5.02) such that only 5.6% (n 5 9/160) of intervention
participants had died, compared with 13.2% (n 5 21/159)
of control participants. At 3 years, intervention participants
exhibited a 16.2% Kaplan-Meier mortality rate and controls a 20.2% rate (P 5.25); at 4 years, intervention participants exhibited a 24.0% Kaplan-Meier mortality rate
and controls, a 28.7% rate (P 5.24).
The curves presented in Figure 1 suggest a postponement of some mortality in the intervention group, with a
later catch-up period. To examine this further, conditional
6-month mortality rates for up to 2 years were determined.
These are rates of dying in the next 6 months in those alive
at the start of that 6-month period. The 6-month mortality
rate in the control group remained at approximately 4.0%
throughout the first 2 years of follow-up. In the intervention
group, the mortality rate was near 0 for 1 year and then
began increasing. Before 18 months, the 6-month mortality
rate was lower in the intervention group. Beginning at 18
months, the 6-month mortality rate was higher in the intervention group (4.0% in intervention vs 3.0% in control),
corresponding to the point in Figure 1 where the curves
begin to come together.
Treatment Benefits According to Risk Groups
Given that a statistically significant difference in mortality
rates was found at 2 than at 3 or 4 years, this time frame was
used to examine whether there was a treatment effect
within each risk group. Table 1 shows that the estimated 2-
year mortality rate for treatment participants was 0.0% in
Group I, 3.0% in Group II, and 15.0% in Group III. This is
in comparison with control participants, for whom rates
were 11.0% in Group I, 14.0% in Group II, and 13.0% in
Group III.
Figures 2A–C present 2-year life table survival estimates for participants at each risk level stratified according
to treatment condition. The general trend for all three risk
groups was similar to that of Figure 1, with survival curves
separating for each level of risk and favoring the intervention group. According to log rank test, treatment assignment had a statistically significant effect on survival for
participants who were at moderate risk of mortality
(w2 5 5.3, P 5.02). However, no statistically significant

differences were observed between groups at the lowest and
highest levels of risk, although the magnitude of the difference in rates was similar in Group I to that of Group II.
DISCUSSION
This study builds upon previous findings that the ABLE
program reduced functional difficulties and conferred a 1-
year survivorship benefit. This study showed that mortality
rates were statistically significantly lower for the intervention group than for the control group for up to 2 years, with
mortality rates remaining lower for ABLE participants for
up to 3.5 years from study entry. The risk of dying within 2
years from study entry was close to 8 times as high in control group participants as in ABLE participants.
The mortality benefit to 2 years was similar in low and
moderate mortality risk groups, although this attained statistical significance only in the moderate group (the largest
of the three groups in the sample). This may be partially due
to the small sample size in the low-risk group. For this
moderate-risk group, risk of dying within 2 years from
study entry was close to 11 times as high in control group
participants as in ABLE participants. The pattern was
slightly different in the high-risk group, in which there was
an early benefit for ABLE participants, although that benefit
did not last to the 2-year point. Although ABLE participants
at each level of mortality risk (low, moderate, high) derived
some intervention benefit, intervention participants at moderate risk sustained a statistically significant 2-year survival
advantage over their control-group counterparts.
These findings suggest that a relatively brief, nonpharmacological intervention that helps older people use cognitive, behavioral, and environmental strategies to reach
self-identified functional goals has survivorship benefits
that persist. The survivorship advantage extended well beyond ABLE’s 6-month active phase of hands-on intensive
skills-training.
Reasons for prolonged survivorship are unclear. One
explanation may be ABLE’s preventive home safety and
referral functions. Previous research has shown that health
professional visits reduce mortality.7,9,16 Nevertheless,
medical referrals were not typical in ABLE. Another explanation may be social attention, although it seems unlikely
that approximately 10 professional contacts explains survivorship extending 3.5 years from study entry.
A more plausible explanation is that ABLE offered
strategies that helped participants achieve personal functional goals. As reported previously, ABLE participants reported greater use of control-oriented strategies than
control group participants at 6- and 12-month followups.10 The Life Span Theory of Control suggests that, as
impairments encroach on performance abilities, individuals
experience heightened vulnerability to environmental complexities and threats to personal control.17 Threats to or
loss of control have significant negative health consequences; alternatively, enhancing control contributes to
well-being and survivorship.18–20
How does enhancing control support survivorship?
Control-oriented strategies enable continued engagement in
everyday activities, which may have some physiological and
psychosocial benefits. Although pathophysiological mechanisms are unclear,21 the findings of the current study are
consistent with recent evidence on the dynamic interaction
between frailty and living environments.22
There are other competing explanations than the
benefits conferred by ABLE. Findings may be a result of
attrition bias or selective mortality in the intervention group
such that the highest-risk patients died early, leaving
a remaining pool of lower risk patients. Mortality rates
are higher in the higher-risk group, so the baseline risk

distribution of those remaining alive slowly moved toward
the lower-risk groups, but because there was little mortality
in the intervention group early on, this effect was not seen in
the intervention group in the early period. However, this
does not explain the increase in the 6-month rates in the
intervention group. Also, as a randomized study, any attrition effect should be the same in both groups in the absence
of an intervention effect. It appears that the intervention
delays mortality in a subset but that medical problems
eventually take over.
A potential limitation is that the database does not allow for multivariate risk adjustments or control of clinical
variables (e.g., comorbidities, health service utilization,
hospitalizations). Also, survival analyses were unplanned
and post hoc. Nevertheless, these are minor limitations,
given that the original study was a randomized trial with
no large or statistically significant differences between
treatment and control groups on study outcomes or health
variables.
Another issue is representativeness. Similar to population-based studies of older adults with similar ages and
functional problems, a 10% mortality rate was found at 2
years for the study sample overall.4 This suggests that the
sample may be representative of the larger population of
elderly people living at home with performance difficulties.
ABLE participants had a mortality rate of 5.6%, below the
rate for the control group (13.2%) and those in representative studies (10%). Although not the main focus, in the
current sample, individuals with low income and education
were at the highest risk of mortality. This association is consistent with population-based health disparities research,
again suggesting the representativeness of the sample.23,24
Several clinical implications can be derived. Interventions addressing disability are not typically part of medical
management. Evidence from other studies shows that those
most in need (frail, post-hospitalized, vulnerable elderly
people) receive inadequate follow-up care.25–27 ABLE may
be most beneficial for these groups who have been previously identified as most at risk for functional decline.
Nevertheless, older adults with no functional difficulties also report using accommodations to perform activities.
Use of accommodations by this independent group has been
shown to reflect a subclinical stage predictive of frailty.28
Therefore, older adults with incipient functional difficulties
may also benefit from ABLE, as suggested by the slight intervention advantage afforded to the low-mortality-risk
group.
Essential to ABLE is its client-centered focus; use of
problem-solving; active engagement of older adults in
problem-identification and strategy-generating processes;
and individualizing of strategies to fit needs, cultural preferences, and environments. These elements resonate with
an emerging vision for geriatric care,29,30 which emphasizes
that patient-centered care and symptom management
should be integrated with medical management and become standard practice.
Overall, ABLE demonstrated that teaching elderly people new approaches to performing valued activities resulted
in additional years of life. Further research is necessary to
substantiate mortality findings using a preplanned, hypothesis-driven randomized trial. Equally important is determining why ABLE lost its benefit; whether different dose,
intensity, or boosters prolong benefit; and how to integrate
ABLE into other proven interventions (e.g., physical activity) to extend positive effects. Future research should clarify
physiological mechanisms by which survivorship benefits
are conferred, effects of ABLE on health utilization, and
cost and cost-effectiveness of this promising program.
