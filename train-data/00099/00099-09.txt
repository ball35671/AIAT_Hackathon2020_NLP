ABSTRACT
OBJECTIVE To examine whether quality of care (QOC) improves when nurse practitioners and
pharmacists work with family physicians in community practice and focus their work on patients who are
50 years of age and older and considered to be at risk of experiencing adverse health outcomes.
DESIGN Randomized controlled trial.
SETTING A family health network with 8 family physicians, 5 nurses, and 11 administrative personnel
serving 10000 patients in a rural area near Ottawa, Ont.
PARTICIPANTS Patients 50 years of age and older at risk of experiencing adverse health outcomes
(N=241).
INTERVENTIONS At-risk patients were randomly assigned to receive usual care from their family
physicians or Anticipatory and Preventive Team Care (APTCare) from a collaborative team composed of
their physicians, 1 of 3 nurse practitioners, and a pharmacist.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Quality of care for chronic disease management (CDM) for diabetes, coronary
artery disease, congestive heart failure, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
RESULTS Controlling for baseline demographic characteristics, the APTCare approach improved CDM
QOC by 9.2% (P<.001) compared with traditional care. The APTCare intervention also improved
preventive care by 16.5% (P<.001). We did not
observe significant differences in other secondary
outcome measures (intermediate clinical outcomes,
quality of life [Short-Form 36 and health-related
quality of life scales], functional status [instrumental
activities of daily living scale] and service usage).
CONCLUSION Additional resources in the form of
collaborative multidisciplinary care teams with
intensive interventions in primary care can improve
QOC for CDM in a population of older at-risk patients.
The appropriateness of this intervention will depend
on its cost-effectiveness.

Research Randomized controlled trial
Reforming the delivery of primary care services has
become a high priority in Canada as a result of
problems with access to care, reports of care gaps,
and concerns about the aging population.1 The reforms
represent a substantial new investment in primary care
and require information on how best to deploy these new
resources. In 2002, the Primary Health Care Transition
Fund was established to help inform and enable this
change, a key element of which was the introduction of
multidisciplinary team care in family practices.2
In response to this, in 2004 we initiated a $1.2 million
study evaluating the effect of multidisciplinary team care
focused on the most vulnerable patients in a family practice. At that time, there was some evidence suggesting
that intensifying management of patients with chronic illnesses by channeling multidisciplinary resources toward
their care was effective. In these studies team composition
varied, but the intervention usually involved care planning and management of elderly patients, sometimes with
emphasis on self-care. For example, in one study, timely
evaluation and management of high-risk elderly patients
by a team composed of a social worker, nurse practitioner
(NP), geriatrician, and nurse was associated with reduced
functional decline.3 Similarly, a geriatric assessment and
provision of team care involving a physician, NP, social
worker, and clinical psychologist was found to improve
health perception, general sense of well-being, and functional status in veterans, and was associated with fewer
clinic visits compared with usual care.4 In another study,
which was focused on elderly patients with chronic illnesses, team care involving the family physician, a nurse,
and a social worker reduced hospitalizations and office
visits while enhancing patients’ participation in social
activities.5 Other multidisciplinary teams were also successful in improving outcomes in specifically targeted conditions.6,7 There was also some evidence that bringing
multidisciplinary team care to patients’ homes was effective. One study, in which care was provided by family
physicians, nurses, and social workers to elderly patients
in their homes, demonstrated improved patient and caregiver quality of life, reduced emergency service use, and
high satisfaction with care.8
We evaluated the benefits of home-based multidisciplinary team management involving an NP, a pharmacist, and a general practitioner working collaboratively
within a family practice and focusing on providing care
to community-dwelling patients who were considered
to be at risk of poor health outcomes. This paper reports
on the outcomes of this randomized controlled study.
METHODS
Design
This is a randomized controlled trial of Anticipatory and
Preventive Team Care (APTCare) with new additional
allied health providers compared with usual care (1:1).
The random treatment allocation list was generated
electronically by TrialStat Corporation and was concealed from all study personnel. Patients were randomized during a home visit by a research associate through
an automated central telephone system. All care providers and patients were blind to the primary outcome
measure of the study. Where more than 1 individual in
a household was enrolled, all were randomized together
to the same arm.
Setting
The study was conducted in a family health network
with 8 family physicians, 5 nurses, and 11 administrative personnel serving 10 000 patients in a rural area
near Ottawa, Ont. Physicians in the practice were remunerated by the publicly funded Medicare system through
a blended payment formula of capitation (principally),
fee-for-service, and incentives.
Selection of participants
Details of the study methodology are provided in a companion article.9 Briefly, patients were eligible if they were
50 years of age or older, rostered in the practice, and
considered by their family physicians to be good candidates to benefit from additional medical resources and
at risk of functional decline, physical deterioration, or
experiencing an event requiring emergency services.
There were no restrictions on diagnoses. Exclusion criteria included substantial cognitive impairment, language or cultural barriers, life expectancy less than 6
months, and plans to move or to be away for more than
6 weeks during the study period.
Sample size calculation
The trial was originally designed to detect a difference
in emergency department visits between the APTCare
and the usual care groups. Based on our original postulation, we required 120 patients in each arm. However,
5 months after the trial was initiated and before any
outcome data were available, the primary outcome
was deemed inappropriate owing to the low observed
baseline rate of emergency department visits. Instead
the objective was altered to examine differences in the
quality of care (QOC) for chronic disease management
(CDM) in 4 conditions (ie, diabetes, coronary artery disease [CAD], congestive heart failure [CHF], and chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD]). To estimate the
power of the study given a sample of 240 patients, several Monte Carlo simulations were repeated, each with
10000 iterations of 3400 observations, yielding similar
results. For these simulations, at random, 10% of the
patients were assumed to be eligible for each of the
maneuvers based on probabilities estimated by clinical
experts. A Kruskal-Wallis test (a nonparametric test for
estimating equality of medians)10 was then performed

Randomized controlled trial Research
to test the difference between the 2 arms. It was determined that a sample size of 200 (allowing for dropouts)
would provide 99% power to detect an absolute average
difference of 25% between the 2 arms.
Intervention
The intervention consisted of care provided by a multidisciplinary team. One pharmacist and 3 NPs were added
to the family practice. The pharmacist worked full-time
for the first 9 months and 1 NP worked full-time for 5.4
months, after which all worked half-time. Patients allocated to the intervention group were assigned to 1 of
3 NPs. The NPs provided coverage for one anothers’
patients when an NP was absent. The pharmacist and
NPs delivered their care almost exclusively in the patients’
homes or by telephone. Both performed comprehensive
chart reviews and home visits for each patient at the
start of the study. The pharmacist then conducted a medication management review, identifying potential drugrelated problems and actions required to address such
issues. She then worked directly with the patients and
in collaboration with the NPs and family physicians to
address these and new drug-related problems as they
arose. Each patient’s NP developed an individualized care
plan in collaboration with the patient and in consultation
with the pharmacist and the patient’s family physician.
The care plan identified the patient’s active health issues
and outlined the management goals that the patient and
the team of providers would work toward over the course
of the intervention.
Recruitment of patients took place between October
2004 and March 2005 and all patients were followed
until March 31, 2006, for total intervention durations
of 12 to 18 months (mean of 14.9 months in each arm).
The study received approval from the Ottawa Hospital
Research Ethics Board and is registered with CONSORT
as NCT00238836.
Data collection
Chart audits were performed to review the quality of
CDM, using 12 indicator chronic disease maneuvers
and 6 indicator prevention maneuvers, and to evaluate the use of emergency services and hospitalization.
Chart reviews for baseline and end-of-study QOC measures were performed by a foreign-trained physician.
Instances in both arms in which a QOC maneuver was
coded as not having been performed were reviewed
by a nurse, and consensus was obtained between the
2 coders.
Outcome questionnaires were administered by a
research associate in each patient’s home at baseline before randomization and again at the end of the
study before withdrawing the services. Questionnaires
captured quality of life (Short-Form 36 [SF-36] and
health-related quality-of-life scales, both of which
indicate better status with higher scores), instrumental
activities of daily living evaluations (with higher
scores showing more limitations in activity), and selfreported emergency department visits and hospitalization. The latter 2 items were also assessed at the
midpoint to reduce recall bias, and a research associate, blinded to the treatment arm, integrated the
information with that derived from the chart to obtain
a final measure of service utilization. A caregiver burden questionnaire was left with each patient’s identified informal caregiver at the home visit following
randomization and was mailed to the same individuals at the end of the study (higher scores indicated
greater burden). Data entry of questionnaire results
was performed by a research associate. Baseline data
entry was validated using double data entry methods
(error rate < 1%).
Analysis
Intention-to-treat analysis was performed. Patients who
withdrew during the study were not contacted for surveys but were included in the QOC measures.
Primary outcome measure
Chronic disease management score. A CDM QOC
composite score based on 12 indicator maneuvers for
4 chronic diseases (CAD,11,12 diabetes,13,14 CHF,15,16 and
COPD17) was developed to measure adherence to guidelines at study start and study end. Indicators were based
on the guideline recommendations shown in Table 1.1-7
This could only be evaluated in the subset of patients
with at least 1 of these chronic conditions. Normalized
scores were computed by dividing the number of appropriately performed maneuvers by the number of maneuvers for which that patient was eligible. Quality-of-care
scores were calculated for individual diseases, then combined to create an overall score for CDM in which each
chronic disease had equal weight. The differences in the
end-of-study and baseline normalized scores for individual patients were computed and compared between
the treatment and control arms using independent t tests.
All patients having at least 1 of the 4 indicator diagnoses,
including those who withdrew and those who died during the study, were included in this analysis.
Secondary outcome measures
Intermediate clinical outcomes. We evaluated mean
hemoglobin A1c and blood pressure in the 2 study
groups and compared the changes from baseline to endof-study measurements in each individual using independent t tests.
Quality of preventive care. We evaluated adherence
to the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care
recommendations for 6 preventive indicator maneuvers over the previous 24 months at baseline and again
at the end of the study (Table 28-13). Normalized scores 
e80 Canadian Family Physician • Le Médecin de famille canadien Vol 55: december • décembre 2009
Research Randomized controlled trial
for individual maneuvers and overall prevention were
analyzed using the same approach as for CDM.
Additional secondary outcomes. Independent t tests
and χ2 tests were used where appropriate to evaluate SF-36 scores, health-related quality of life, activities of daily living, hospitalization, and emergency use.
Deceased patients were assumed to have each had
1 emergency department visit. For quality-of-life and
functional status evaluation, sensitivity analyses were
performed in which deceased patients and those who
withdrew were assigned the lowest score on the scale.
The calculation of the mental and physical component
summary scores of the SF-36 was performed using
SF Health Outcomes Scoring software (Basic Version),
which follows the computation methodology presented
by Ware et al.18
Multivariate analyses
Multivariate linear regression models were performed
for each continuous outcome measure, adjusted for age;
sex; baseline measures of self-assessed health, estimated risk level, polypharmacy, frequent visits to the
office in the previous year, multiple health conditions,

emergency department visits in the previous year, education level, living accommodations, household income,
main activities, having someone to confide in, and registration as a client of home care services; the presence of
diabetes, CAD, COPD, or CHD; and baseline QOC scores.
RESULTS
Of the 316 patients contacted, 241 participated (response
rate of 76%); 8 of these had been deemed low risk but
were enrolled with their at-risk partners. Patients who
declined participation were dealing with personal or
health issues (n= 16), were too busy or active (n= 10),
thought they were receiving enough care or did not
want additional individuals involved in their care (n=8),
or did not provide reasons for refusing to participate
(n=41). In the intervention arm, 5 participants withdrew
and 3 died. In the control arm, 4 withdrew and 1 moved.
Table 3 depicts the baseline patient profile. Patients in
the APTCare arm were younger by 3.2 years (P=.018).
The 2 groups were otherwise similar.
Outcome measures
Unadjusted analysis. Chronic disease could be
evaluated in 152 patients, 45 of whom had multiple
chronic conditions. Table 4 represents comparisons
of the unadjusted CDM QOC scores between the 2
arms. For both arms, baseline estimates and differences between end points and baseline values are
reported. The last section represents the difference
between the 2 arms and their corresponding confidence intervals (CIs) and P values. Patients in the
intervention arm had a significant increase in the
quality of CDM (absolute difference of 9.1%, 95% CI
3.7% to 14.4%). Improvement in CDM appears to be
driven by enhanced adherence to guidelines, primarily for diabetes management. We did not observe
significant differences in intermediate clinical outcome measures (P ≥ .071). An 18.1% (95% CI 10.8% to
25.5%) absolute difference in prevention (Table 5)
was observed between the 2 arms. Improvement was
detected for all indicator maneuvers except 2 for
which performance was relatively high (> 85%) before
the intervention.
Adjusted analysis. The duration of the intervention was
not significantly associated with the QOC score (data
not shown). However, improvements in CDM and prevention scores were greater for individuals with lower
baseline CDM scores. For CDM, the β value for baseline
scores was -28.8% (95% CI -39.3% to -18.2%); for prevention it was -57.5% (95% CI -69.0% to 46.0%). After adjusting for potential confounders, including baseline scores,
the intervention arm remained associated with a significant improvement in CDM QOC (β coefficient 9.2%; 95%
CI 4.1% to 14.4%) and disease prevention (β coefficient
16.5%; 95% CI 10.1% to 22.9%).
At baseline, the caregiver burden score in the control arm was significantly higher than that in the intervention arm (scores of 18.0 vs 12.6 out of a possible
88). This was consistent for most questions throughout the 22-item survey. At the end of the study, the
scores in the 2 arms were 14.6 and 14.2, respectively,
reflecting a significant drop in the control arm burden assessment (P = .0070 ). We did not observe any
differences between the 2 arms in quality of life or
functional status. Sensitivity analyses in which nonrespondents were assigned the lowest score were
consistent with these results. Use of emergency
department services or hospitalization did not differ
between the 2 arms.

Research Randomized controlled trial
DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this is the first report of a randomized controlled trial evaluating the effects of a multidisciplinary team in which a pharmacist and NPs are added
to a family practice. We found significant enhancements
in the CDM QOC processes, especially for diabetes care.
There is evidence supporting the notion that it is beneficial to add pharmacists6,19-22 or NPs22 who focus on
the management of a special population to a traditional
family practice. There is additional evidence that interdisciplinary primary care teams that include NPs and
other health workers are associated with improved outcomes in the elderly.3,4 Of these studies, only 2 measured QOC processes, some of which could be related to
our study. One trial that compared pharmacist-led case
management with standard care reported an intervention effect similar to ours on 3 common indicators for
quality of diabetes care (eg, foot care, eye care, hemoglobin A1c assessment).21 The second trial evaluated an
NP–family physician team in the care of patients with
diabetes and hypertension and found improvement in
the likelihood of the patients receiving foot care (51%
absolute difference) but not eye care (9% absolute difference).23

Research Randomized controlled trial
We did not detect improvements in the 2 clinical outcome measures: glycemic control and hypertension. In
contrast most studies have demonstrated that the addition of pharmacists7,20-22 or NPs23 to the primary care
team was associated with better clinical outcomes,
including improved glucose control, blood pressure, and
cholesterol levels in patients with diabetes, hypertension, or both. In all of these studies, the clinical team
was specifically focused on the management of these 2
conditions and their indicators. In contrast, in our study
the clinicians were blinded to the indicator diseases and
maneuvers. Their mandate was more general: improve
the management of the chronic diseases of individuals
in their care. The heterogeneity of the population also
meant that fewer individuals with each disease were
available for each analysis, limiting the study power to
detect a difference.
We did not observe improvements in quality-of-life
or functional status measures. Studies of multidisciplinary teams focusing on elderly or at-risk populations
have focused primarily on the more general measures
of patient well-being, such as activities of daily living
and quality of life. For example, 2 trials of geriatric management involving the primary care physician, a social
worker, and an NP found improvements in quality of
life4 and functional status,3,4 while results from trials of
multidisciplinary teams in the management of diabetes
are conflicting.8,22,23 A meta-analysis of trials evaluating
home visits in preventing functional deterioration concluded that this strategy could be useful in maintaining
functional levels, but that such programs were only effective when targeting patients who were relatively young
and at lower risk of death.24 Our population had been
identified by their physicians to be at substantial risk of
functional decline. The potential increased risk of irreversible functional decline associated with complex older
patients25 might have been a limitation of this study.
We did not observe a significant reduction in service
use. Approaches used to measure emergency department visits and hospitalization have limitations, such as
recall bias for surveys and incomplete information for
chart reviews. However, we complemented the information we obtained from the survey and chart reviews
with data from the Ministry of Health and Long-Term
Care health care service utilization database for all emergency department encounters and hospital admissions.
Despite this, our study found no significant difference
between the 2 arms. Previous studies of multidisciplinary
care showing a reduction in emergency department visits focused on patients with high use of these services
before the studies.6,26 Also, our study might not have had
sufficient power to detect meaningful changes in this
service utilization, or longer follow-up might have been
required to observe the effect on this parameter.
Caregiver burden scores were markedly different between groups at baseline. The caregiver burden
survey was the only survey administered after patients
were informed of their randomization status. This might
have influenced the perceptions of caregivers at that
time. When surveys were readministered at the end of
the intervention, the level of burden in both arms was
similar, reflecting a significant drop in the control arm
(P = .0070). This change might, therefore, represent a
correction of the potential bias introduced at baseline.
The main strength of this study is that it was a randomized controlled trial with a good response rate
(76%). The effect of the intervention might have been
hampered by the limited intervention period and
time-intensive initial care planning, as well as contamination of the control arm by enhanced practice
by family physicians working in the multidisciplinary
team. However, the fact that the QOC level did not
rise in the control arm during the duration of the study
intervention does not support the latter. Our study was
powered to detect differences in the composite score
for CDM QOC but not to draw inferences for individual
chronic conditions, although the results suggest that
the approach yielded considerable changes in diabetes care. Further investigation is required to ascertain
which patients would benefit most from this type of
intervention and evaluate the generalizability of our
findings. The findings of this study suggest that additional care in the form of multidisciplinary teams for
complex community-dwelling patients can increase
adherence to evidence-based guidelines. However,
these additional resources are provided at a substantial
additional cost. The appropriateness of the intervention will ultimately depend on its associated costs and
the value that society places on its effect.
Conclusion
We found that a multidisciplinary care management
with NPs, a pharmacist, and the general practitioner
improved the quality of chronic care delivered to older,
complex patients. While the quality of preventive care
also improved, patients did not experience changes in
their quality of life, functional status, or in their use of
emergency department or hospital services. The intervention was delivered exclusively in the patients’ home
with some telephone contacts. We recommend that further research be conducted to evaluate whether the
same intervention could be delivered in the practice setting without compromising effectiveness to improve efficiency. The intervention also needs to be evaluated at
multiple practice sites to enhance generalizability.
