OBJECTIVES. This study evaluated the effectiveness (changes in health behaviors, health
status, and health service utilization) of a
self-management program for chronic disease designed for use with a heterogeneous
group of chronic disease patients. It also explored the differential effectiveness of the intervention for subjects with specific diseases
and comorbidities.
METHODS. The study was a six-month randomized, controlled trial at communitybased sites comparing treatment subjects
with wait-list control subjects. Participants
were 952 patients 40 years of age or older with
a physician-confirmed diagnosis of heart disease, lung disease, stroke, or arthritis. Health
behaviors, health status, and health service
utilization, as determined by mailed, self-administered questionnaires, were measured.
RESULTS. Treatment subjects, when compared with control subjects, demonstrated
As the average age of our population increases,
so does the prevalence of chronic disease. It is
now estimated that people aged 60 years and
older have, on average, 2.2 chronic conditions.1
Chronic disease is responsible for almost 70% of
health care expenditures.2

limitations. They also had fewer hospitalizations and days in the hospital. No differences
were found in pain/physical discomfort,
shortness of breath, or psychological well-being.
CONCLUSIONS. An intervention designed
specifically to meet the needs of a heterogeneous group of chronic disease patients, including those with comorbid conditions, was
feasible and beneficial beyond usual care in
terms of improved health behaviors and
health status. It also resulted in fewer hospitalizations and days of hospitalization.

been published recently.3 To date, few of the studies have dealt with more than one disease or with
the problems of comorbidity. Rather, each patient
education intervention has been disease-specific.
With the emergence of chronic disease as the
largest threat to health status and the largest
cause of health care expenditures, the potential
role of patient self-management assumes increased importance. If benefits can be shown
from an inexpensive, replicable self-management
program, such programs might be a useful part of
a therapeutic regime. Our study explored this
possibility. It differed from previous self-management studies in that it: (1) placed subjects with
different chronic diseases and different combinations of comorbid diseases in the same program at
the same time; (2) utilized a randomized, controlled design; and (3) measured outcomes in terms
of behaviors, health status, and health service
utilization. Although former patient self-management education studies had one or more of these
attributes, none have had all three.
The objectives of the study were to evaluate the
effectiveness (changes in health behaviors, health
status, and health service utilization) of a selfmanagement program for chronic disease designed for use with a heterogeneous group of
chronic disease patients and to explore the differential effectiveness of the intervention for subjects with specific diseases and comorbidities. The
experience during 6 months with the 952 patients
with heart disease, lung disease, stroke, or arthritis is reported here.
Methods
The Chronic Disease Self-Management Program (CDSMP) is a community-based patient
self-management education course. Three principal assumptions underlie the CDSMP: (1) patients with different chronic diseases have similar
self-management problems and disease-related
tasks; (2) patients can learn to take responsibility
for the day-to-day management of their disease(s); and (3) confident, knowledgeable patients practicing self-management will experience
improved health status and will utilize fewer
health care resources. Other assumptions that
shaped the program were that: (1) patient selfmanagement education should be inexpensive
and widely available; (2) trained lay persons with
chronic conditions could effectively deliver a
structured patient education program; and (3)
such lay instructors would be acceptable to both
patients and health professionals. There is research evidence that positive role models (in this
case, lay leaders with similar backgrounds and
disease problems) increase patients'self-efficacy
or confidence in their ability to manage their disease.4
Needs A msrtment
The content and methodology of the CDSMP
were based on two needs assessments. The first
was a literature review of existing chronic disease
patient education programs.5 The purpose of this
review was to identify common topics taught
across chronic disease courses. In a review of
more than 70 articles, the authors found 12 common tasks: recognizing and acting on symptoms,
using medication correctly, managing emergencies, maintaining nutrition and diet, maintaining
adequate exercise, giving up smoking, using stress
reduction techniques, interacting effectively with
health care providers, using community resources, adapting to work, managing relations
with significant others, and managing psychological responses to illness.
The second needs assessment sought information from 11 focus groups.6 Participants included
people older than 40 years with chronic diseases.
Participants were invited to: (1) describe their disease(s) and what they thought caused them; (2)
explain their feelings and beliefs about getting
older; (3) describe the physical, social, and emotional impacts of chronic disease on their lives
and the lives of their families; (4) describe how
they coped with the problems caused by their disease(s); and (5) elaborate on their fears, hopes,
and wishes for the future. Theme analysis from
these groups' responses was used to shape both
the content of the CDSMP and the process of instruction.
Chronic Disease Self-Management
Program Design
The topics covered in the CDSMP included: exercise; use of cognitive symptom management
techniques; nutrition; fatigue and sleep management; use of community resources; use of medications; dealing with the emotions of fear, anger,
and depression; communication with others including health professionals; problem-solving;
and decision-making. The content of the course

CHRONIC DISEASE SELF-MANAGEMENT
has been published as Living a Healthy Life with
Chronic Conditions.7 This book was used as a text
for course participants.
The process of teaching the course is based on
Self-Efficacy Theory. It incorporates strategies
suggested by Bandura to enhance self-efficacy.8
These include weekly action planning and feedback, modeling of behaviors and problem-solving
by participants for one another, reinterpretation
of symptoms by giving many possible causes for
each symptom as well as several different management techniques, group problem-solving, and
individual decision-making. The leaders act more
as facilitators than as lecturers. For example,
rather than prescribing specific behavior changes,
they assist participants in making management
choices and achieving success in reaching self-selected goals. The process is documented in a detailed protocol, Chronic Disease Self-Management Leader's Manual.9
Each course had 10 to 15 participants of mixed
ages and diagnoses, including family members if
they wished to attend. Each course was taught by
a pair of trained, volunteer lay leaders. The 87
leaders received 20 hours of training with the detailed teaching manual. They ranged in age from
21 to 80 years (82% were older than 40).9 Seventy-one percent of the leaders had one or more
chronic diseases, 23% were health professionals,
and 15% were students. Few had previous experience in health education. On average, leaders
taught 2.4 courses. The program was given in
seven weekly 2.5-hour sessions.
Entry Criteria
To enter the study, subjects had their physician
confirm a diagnosis of chronic lung disease
(asthma, chronic bronchitis, or emphysema),
heart disease (coronary artery disease or congestive heart failure), stroke (completed cerebrovascular accident with neurologic handicap and normal mentation), or chronic arthritis. In addition to
at least one of the above conditions, they could
have other conditions. Patients with compromised mentation, cancer patients who received
chemotherapy or radiation within the past year,
and persons younger than 40 years of age were
excluded. Subjects'physicians and hospitals were
not informed as to their study status (treatment or
control).
Recruitment and Randomization
Subjects were recruited using public service announcements in the mass media, referrals from
flyers left in physicians' offices and community
clinics, posters at senior citizen centers, announcements in health maintenance organization (HMO) patient newsletters, and referrals
from county government employers. Before filling
out their initial questionnaire and before randomization, all subjects were told they would
either receive the course immediately or after
serving as a control for 6 months.
To assure that the program would be easily accessible to patients, it was held in multiple community sites in a four county area. Programs were
held in churches, senior and community centers,
public libraries, and health care facilities. In addition, programs were planned at varied times for
the convenience of patients including late mornings, early afternoons, evenings, and Saturday
mornings. The project was approved by the institutional Committee for the Protection of Human
Subjects in Research. All participants gave written
informed consent. After each subject's physician(s) had supplied a diagnosis and after each
subject had completed a consent form and baseline questionnaire, participants were randomized
to treatment or control status. Randomization
was conducted serially. After all subjects had applied to a specific site, typically 16 to 30 subjects,
the randomization ratio (treatment versus controls) was determined so as to assure no fewer
than 10 and no more than 15 treatment subjects.
Thus, in some sites the ratio of treatment-to-control subjects was 4:6, whereas in others it was 7:3.
This randomization method resulted in an overall
6:4 ratio.
Outcome Measures
There were three primary classifications of outcome variables: health behaviors, health status, and
health service utilization. Data were collected by
previously tested self-administered, mailed questionnaires. To minimize acquiescent response, data
collection was completely separate from the intervention and carried out by persons who did not
know the subjects or their treatment status. Measures included the self-rated health scale used in the
National Health Interview Survey and a modified
version of the Health Assessment Questionnaire
(HAQ) disability scale.10,11 The psychological

well-being scale, also known as the MHI-5, which
is part of the SF-36, as well as the SF-20, was
used.12'13 The pain and physical discomfort scale
was an adaptation of the Medical Outcomes
Study (MOS) pain scale; it was modified to include physical discomfort.14 The energy/fatigue
scale was the scale used in the long-form MOS,
and the health distress scale was a slightly modified version of the MOS health distress scale.15
The remaining measures (ie, duration of exercise,
use of cognitive symptom management, communication with physicians, social/role activity limitations, shortness of breath, and utilization measures) were developed and tested for this study.
Definitions of all measures and information on
their reliability and validity are presented elsewhere.6 The magnitude of the correlations among
the health status scales ranged from 0.14 to 0.60
(median, 0.43). The highest correlation was between psychological well-being and health distress (0.60).
Subjects were assessed for three types of health
utilization: visits to physicians, including visits to
the emergency room (ER), visits to hospitals during the past 6 months, and the number of nights
spent in a hospital. For each category, they reported how often they used these health services.
The self-reported data for 200 subjects who were
HMO members were validated against automated medical records. Outpatient self-reported
visits were associated with the medical record visits (r = 0.64) and ER visits (r = 0.60). We found that
patients often included urgent care and after-hour
visits with ER visits instead of counting these as
outpatient visits. Thus, the data for all subjects'ER
visits were combined with data for outpatient
physician visits. When combined, the self-reported data for outpatient visits correlated (r =
0.70) with medical records. We found errors made
both by patients and by the automated record system. Patients tended to underreport recorded visits by approximately 17%. Conversely, the system
sometimes overreported visits. For example, a
subject who received numerous allergy injections
from a nurse was reported by the system to have
had a physician visit for each injection. For days in
hospital, medical records correlated with patient
self-report (r = 0.83).
Analyses
The primary analysis compared 6-month outcomes between the treatment and control groups
on each outcome variable using analysis of covariance on endpoint scores, controlling for the
baseline value of the study variable, as well as age,
sex, education, and marital status. The endpoint
data were examined by analysis of covariance for
variation among the 108 CDSM programs in
which participants were taught; between-program variation in effects was found to be minimal
and did not influence overall conclusions. Therefore, treatment and control data were aggregated
across programs of instruction.
The secondary analyses determined if the intervention had different outcomes for those with
different diseases. Two-way analyses of variance
were utilized, testing for the interaction of disease
by treatment status (treatment/control).
Results
Primary Results
Of the 1,140 subjects who entered the study (ie,
were randomized to treatment [n = 664] or to
control status [n = 476]), 952 [83%] completed the
6-month study. Of the treatment subjects, 84%
completed 6 months compared with 82% of the
control subjects. Treatment subjects completing 6-
month data attended an average of 5.5 of the
seven program sessions. Of those treatment subjects not completing 6-month data, 1.2% had
died, 3.4% were too ill to continue, and 11.4% had
unknown reasons. For the control subjects, the respective percentages were 0.81, 7.8, and 9.4.
Comparing baseline data for subjects who completed 6-month data with those who did not, the
noncompleters had significantly fewer minutes of
aerobic exercise per week and higher levels of activity limitation, pain/physical discomfort, fatigue,
and health distress than did those who completed
the 6 months (P < 0.05); however, there were no
statistically significant differences between the
treatment and control subjects at study entry on
any variable. Table 1 presents the demographic
and disease characteristics of study participants
completing the study. Only marital status was significantly different (P < 0.05). Table 2 gives baseline data and mean 6-month uncorrected change
scores for the CDSMP treatment subjects and
the control subjects. As compared with controls,
the treatment group demonstrated significant
improvement in all four health behavior variables (P < 0.01; number of minutes per week of

creased practice of cognitive symptom management; and improved communication with their
physician). They also demonstrated significant
improvement in five of the health status variables
(self-rated health, disability, social/role activities
limitation, energy/fatigue, and health distress; P <
0.02). No significant differences were demonstrated for pain and physical discomfort, shortness of breath, or for psychological well-being.
The treatment group, as compared with the control group, had fewer hospitalizations (P < 0.05)
and spent, on average, 0.8 fewer nights in the
hospital (P = 0.01). There were no significant differences in visits to physicians (P = 0.11).
An intent to treat analysis also was conducted
that included 1,128 subjects. Baseline (entry) data
were used at 6 months for the 176 subjects (drop
outs) who did not complete 6-month data. (The
eight treatment and four control subjects who
died were excluded.) In this analysis, all probability values remained unchanged, although the
change scores were reduced slightly for both the
treatment and control groups. For example, the
changes in communication with physicians were
0.22 for treatment subjects compared with 0.09
for controls, health distress was -0.20 for the
treatment subjects compared with -0.06 for controls, and nights in hospital was -0.22 for treatment subjects compared with 0.46 for controls.
Of the 391 control subjects who completed the
6-month randomized study, 283 (72%) chose to
take the CDSMP. Of these, 237 provided 6-month
post-CDSMP endpoint data. Using matched pair
t tests comparing data before starting the CDSMP
and 6 months after starting the program, this
group increased their aerobic exercise and use of
coping strategies (P < 0.05). They also decreased
their disability and health distress while increasing their social and role activities (P < 0.05). Visits
to physicians decreased by 0.98 (P < 0.05). The
group had fewer visits to hospitals and 0.65 fewer
days in hospital (P < 0.05). Changes in other study
variables listed in Table 2 were not significant, although all demonstrated a trend toward improvement. Thus, it appears that by taking the CDSMP,
control subjects reversed many of the trends toward worsening health demonstrated during the
6-month randomized trial.
Secondary Results
Tables 3 and 4 present baseline data and 6-
month change scores for treatment and control
subjects in the various disease categories: those
whose only disease was arthritis, heart disease, or
lung disease, and those with comorbidities. Subjects who only had a stroke were not included in
this analysis because of small numbers. A twoway analysis of covariance, controlling for baseline status, examined main treatment effects and
interactions among the four disease categories
and found no significant interactions for any of
the 20 outcome variables. Examination of the 6-
month change scores confirmed the tendency for
the change scores to reflect program effects similarly across all four diagnostic subgroups.
Program costs versus savings also were examined. Although the treatment group reduced their
visits to physicians slightly more than did the
control group, the difference was not significant.
The decrease in the number of hospitalizations
and in the number of nights of hospitalization
were significant (P < 0.05, Table 2). Assuming a

CHRONIC DISEASE SELF-MANAGEMENT
each leader teaches only one course), $14 for volunteer leader stipend (assuming $100 per leader
per course of 15 participants), $15 for course materials (book and audio tape), and $15 administrative costs. This analysis does not take into account
the cost of space (which was donated for this
study) or indirect costs. Assuming that these figures reflect current costs, the health care expenditure savings (savings in hospital nights minus
program costs) approximated $750 per participant, more than 10 times the cost of the intervention.
Discussion
This study was an evaluation of a self-management education intervention for persons with one
or more different conditions. The format of the intervention had the attributes of medium-sized
classes, lay leaders, and heterogeneity of participants in terms of type and severity of disease(s).
Overall, the intervention was successful in increasing healthful behaviors, maintaining or improving health status, and decreasing rates of
hospitalization (Table 2). These results indicate
that it is possible to educate patients with different chronic diseases successfully in the same intervention at the same time. Because most
chronic disease patient education programs have
not been formally evaluated, it is difficult to determine if heterogeneous educational interventions
such as the CDSMP are more or less effective
than homogeneous, single disease-oriented programs. Because people 60 years of age and older
have, on average, two or more chronic conditions,
it would seem that a program focused on the
problems common to the various comorbidities
would be a reasonable substitute for, or adjunct
to, the more traditional single disease programs.
One key question concerns the generalizability
of the findings. As in nearly all such studies, the
subjects self-selected to be in the study and may
have been more motivated than most chronic disease patients. From past arthritis self-management studies, we have evidence that when patients in a closed HMO rheumatology practice
were repeatedly offered an opportunity to participate in an intervention similar to the CDSMP,
47% chose to do so.16 Men and non-English
speakers were less likely to attend. Glascow and
Litzelman17'18 have found similar participation in
a diabetes self-management intervention. Studies
now being conducted with the Kaiser system and
with Latinos should offer more information about
the generalizability of CDSMP.
The subjects in our study had a high mean level
of education. It is noteworthy that approximately
27% of the subjects had 12 years of education or
less and 29% had 16 years or more. When education was entered into the analysis as a covariant of
outcomes,however, it did not affect them.
Because of the heterogeneous mix of patients,
not all patients had the same symptoms, nor did
they all need to change the same behaviors. Thus,
the results of the primary analysis of specific outcomes may have underestimated somewhat the
individual improvements because they contained
data from subjects who either did not have a target symptom or who already had achieved acceptable levels on that outcome. Although we do
not have a definitive answer about clinical significance, activity limitation, health distress, and disability were all improved. This suggests that the
CDSMP affected important physical and mental
aspects of participants'lives.
Tables 3 and 4 explore the effectiveness of the
intervention for various subsets of patients. Because these are secondary analyses, we cannot
draw definitive conclusions from these data. The
findings, however, may be helpful in guiding future studies. Although all of the subgroups appear
to have made changes in healthful behaviors,
these changes varied by group, as might be expected. For example, the group with heart disease
reported the most aerobic exercise at baseline
(122.3 and 126.8 minutes/week for the treatment
and control groups, respectively), the lung disease
group reported the least (80.2 and 67.5), and the
arthritis group was intermediate (107.4 and 89.5;
Table 4). The treatment participants with arthritis
and those with lung disease increased their exercise more than the control subjects did (Table 4).
The treatment group with heart disease remained
the same, and the control group decreased their
exercise. Thus, for patients with low baseline activity levels, the intervention increased activity,
whereas for patients with relatively high activity
level, this level was maintained. The results concerning the practice of cognitive symptom management techniques and communication with
their physicians were uniform across all subgroups.
That the intervention had some differential effects on different subsets of patients is not surprising. Although chronic diseases create similar
problems, these problems are more or less salient

for an individual patient at different times across
diseases. The CDSMP was designed to meet such
a challenge by aiding patients to identify their
own individual needs and problems and then assisting them to work most intensively in those areas. In addition, it was designed to meet the
needs of the many older patients who have more
than one chronic condition.
It is important to note that participants in this
study were volunteers, recruited largely by word
of mouth and by various forms of public announcement. Although their physicians confirmed their diagnoses and knew of their participation, there was no linkage between the CDSMP
content and the individual treatment plans. The
CDSMP did not alter participants' treatment.
Therefore, the benefits that were achieved were
additional to those achieved by usual care. Conceivably, integration of a CDSMP with usual care,
perhaps at the outset of a chronic disease, would
further enhance the benefits.
Conclusion
The Chronic Disease Self-Management Program is a program designed specifically to meet
the needs of a heterogeneous group of chronic
disease patients, including those with comorbid
conditions. The results of this study suggest that
such an intervention is feasible, is beneficial beyond usual care in terms of improved health
status, and can decrease hospitalization with a
potential of substantial savings in health care
costs. If replicated in similar studies, a program
such as the CDSMP deserves a place in the treatment regime of patients with chronic disease.
