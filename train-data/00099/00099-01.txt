Abstract
Background: Depression is common in people with coronary heart disease (CHD) and associated with worse outcome. This
study explored the acceptability and feasibility of procedures for a trial and for an intervention, including its potential costs,
to inform a definitive randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a nurse-led personalised care intervention for primary care CHD
patients with current chest pain and probable depression.
Methods: Multi-centre, outcome assessor-blinded, randomized parallel group study. CHD patients reporting chest pain and
scoring 8 or more on the HADS were randomized to personalized care (PC) or treatment as usual (TAU) for 6 months and
followed for 1 year. Primary outcome was acceptability and feasibility of procedures; secondary outcomes included mood,
chest pain, functional status, well being and psychological process variables.
Result: 1001 people from 17 General Practice CHD registers in South London consented to be contacted; out of 126 who
were potentially eligible, 81 (35% female, mean age = 65 SD11 years) were randomized. PC participants (n = 41) identified
wide ranging problems to work on with nurse-case managers. Good acceptability and feasibility was indicated by low
attrition (9%), high engagement and minimal nurse time used (mean/SD = 78/19 mins assessment, 125/91 mins telephone
follow up). Both groups improved on all outcomes. The largest between group difference was in the proportion no longer
reporting chest pain (PC 37% vs TAU 18%; mixed effects model OR 2.21 95% CI 0.69, 7.03). Some evidence was seen that self
efficacy (mean scale increase of 2.5 vs 0.9) and illness perceptions (mean scale increase of 7.8 vs 2.5) had improved in PC vs
TAU participants at 1 year. PC appeared to be more cost effective up to a QALY threshold of approximately £3,000.
Conclusions: Trial and intervention procedures appeared to be feasible and acceptable. PC allowed patients to work on
unaddressed problems and appears cheaper than TAU.

Introduction
The point prevalence of depression in coronary heart disease
(CHD) patients has been estimated at 20% in patients with acute
myocardial infarction[1] and 9% in a community sample of people
with chronic disease[2]. Depression increases the incidence of
coronary symptoms and death in CHD patients[3]. Established
depression treatments (antidepressants and psychotherapies) have
only a moderate effect on improving mood and reducing cardiac
events but no effect on mortality[4]. More complex systems
approaches, such as collaborative care, may be more successful[5].
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 June 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 6 | e98704
Collaborative care involves structured management plans, scheduled follow-ups and enhanced inter-professional working, i.e. case
manager/practice nurse, primary care practitioner and mental
health specialist working together [6], and has been shown to
improve indirect cardiac outcomes such as disease control and 10-
year cardiovascular disease risk as well as depression[6], [7] in
people with CHD and/or diabetes.
The above trials were conducted in the USA[6] and
Australia[7]where healthcare systems differ from the NHS, in
particular, there is less interprofessional working[8]. The UPBEAT-UK programme of research[9] was funded by the National
Institute for Health Research (NIHR) to explore the relationship
between CHD and depression and to develop a new intervention
feasible for use in UK primary care.
The intervention examined in this pilot study was developed in
line with accepted guidance that interventions for health
improvement should be informed by evidence and based on a
theory of how they cause change ‘‘so that weak links in the causal
chain can be identified and strengthened’’ [10]. Using guidelines
for developing and evaluating complex interventions[11], we
conducted and published a systematic review[12] and qualitative
research with patients[13] and primary care staff[8] to develop a
novel intervention. We used iterative literature review to synthesise
our empirical work and to identify evidence and theory to inform
the intervention, which was modified following a patient focus
group; this process has been reported[11].
In summary, our development studies were consistent in
indicating that there is wide variation in the problems that
depressed people with CHD report as contributing to their low
mood, but that social problems are very common and that primary
care staff are unsure how to manage them. Another key finding
was that GPs reported having no time to deliver depression
interventions; this was similarly the case for practice nurses, who
also reported a lack of confidence in depression management[8,11,12]. It was clear from these findings that the UPBEAT
intervention needed to be tailored to individual need, brief to
deliver and compatible with current practice.
An established component of chronic disease management in
primary care is the provision of self management support; this
means enabling patients to take better care of themselves, for
instance by providing information and helping them to change
unhealthy behaviours. Our literature review showed that accepted
health psychology models agree on two factors important for
behaviour change: belief in the importance of an outcome and
belief in capacity to succeed (self efficacy)[11]; we therefore
incorporated established behaviour change techniques, such as
goal setting and action planning, which aim to enhance the
patient’s self efficacy to achieve their desired outcomes.
In line with our aim to develop an intervention feasible for UK
primary care, our intervention is designed to enhance usual care.
Practice nurses are already responsible for supporting CHD
patients’ self management and have been found to be effective case
managers in the treatment of chronic depression[14]. In our
intervention, the practice nurse helps the patient to identify
problems important to them and then draws on a ‘tool box’ of
techniques to help the patient address these problems. The nurse
also sign posts the patient to relevant existing sources of help and
makes referrals to other agencies where appropriate. Hence the
practice nurses, acting as case managers, deliver care that is more
holistic than that currently provided.
Our findings of uncertainty around the needs of depressed
CHD patients and lack of confidence in managing them led us to
conduct a pilot study, in which the intervention was delivered by
nurse researchers, that would inform the best methods for a
definitive RCT[9]. We knew, from our cross-sectional analyses of
the UPBEAT cohort study [15], that CHD patients have high
levels of co-morbidity and that for some patients on GP CHD
registers any cardiac event would have been several years
previously; we therefore only recruited those patients with
symptomatic CHD (i.e. reporting current chest pain) in order to
ensure that they would understand the intervention in terms of
their heart disease. The current study therefore explored the
acceptability and feasibility of procedures for a trial and for the
intervention, including its potential costs, to inform a definitive
RCT of a novel, practice nurse-led personalised care intervention
for CHD patients who have at least probable depression and
current chest pain.
To this end, we examined: a) the rate of participant recruitment
and reasons for non-participation; b) research procedures including randomization, blinding and data collection; c) the acceptability and feasibility of the intervention; d) potential costs of the
intervention; and e) the appropriateness of primary outcome and
secondary outcome measures in relation to patients’ reported
problems. Mediator analyses were conducted to identify trends
between the groups in changes in self efficacy and illness beliefs
and the impact of these on depression outcomes and to determine
whether therapist effects or intervention intensity (nurse time) are
likely to be important.
Methods
The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist
are available as supporting information; see Checklist S1 and
Protocol S1.
Ethics Statement
The study was reviewed and approved by the South East
London Research Ethics Committee (REC Ref no: 10/H0808/5).
Written informed consent was obtained from all study participants.
Pilot study design
This was a multi-centre, outcome assessor blinded, parallel
group study with randomisation at the patient level with 1:1
allocation. The study protocol has been published [16] and the
pilot trial is registered with Current Controlled Trials: ISRCTN
21615909.
Deviations from original protocol
The original protocol is available as online supporting
information (Protocol S1). In this and the published protocol
[15], one aim was to explore potential primary outcomes, we
focused on depression as measured by the Hospital Anxiety and
Depression scale (HADS). In this report, since we also had
collected another measure of depression - the PHQ-9 (as per
protocol), we also explored this as a primary outcome as a further
examination of the appropriateness of the HADS as a primary
outcome for a future trial. In addition, during the pilot study the
intervention group participants identified pain as an important
problem contributing to their depression; in this report, we
therefore also examined our measure of chest pain as a potential
primary outcome. In our original protocol, we referred to our
intervention as ‘case management’, however following our
intervention development process, summarized here and reported
in detail elsewhere [10], the term ‘personalised care’ was
considered more appropriate. Finally, our original protocol does
not detail the specific analysis plan reported here. All data will be
deposited in an accessible archive at King’s College London.
Nurse-Led Personalised Care for Depression in Symptomatic CHD
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 June 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 6 | e98704
Study setting
Practices in South London were recruited via the Greater
London Primary Care Research Network (PCRN-GL). To be
included, the practice had to keep a register of patients with CHD
for the Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF)[17] and be
willing to liaise over patients in the PC arm when necessary.
Participants
Adults with symptomatic CHD (registered on GP CHD QOF
register and reporting chest pain), reporting depression symptoms
were eligible. All patients on practice case registers for CHD were
asked by their GP for consent to contact from a researcher. Those
consenting were contacted by a researcher and assessed for
depressive symptoms using the PHQ-2[18] and for symptoms of
current chest pain using the Modified Rose Angina Questionnaire[19]. Patients scoring 3 or more on the PHQ-2 (i.e. a score of
3 is considered the optimal cut point for depression screening and
which indicates further screening is necessary), and who reported
current chest pain were assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and
Depression Scale (HADS)[20]. If they scored $8 on the depression
scale of HADS (HADS-D)(i.e. the score validated to indicate
probable depression caseness) they were eligible to participate.
Patients who were temporary registrants, actively suicidal,
suffering from psychotic depression, non-English speaking or
currently hospitalised were excluded. Other physical and mental
co-morbidities were allowed. Participants were recruited between
October 2010 and June 2011.
Intervention: Personalised care (PC)
Full details have been reported[11]. In brief, the nurse acting as
case manager conducts a standardised, face to face, biopsychosocial assessment (including physical and mental health,
difficulties with current treatment regimens, problems with daily
activities and social problems). Patients are then helped to identify
up to three problems which they consider contribute to their
depression and which they most want to address. The nurse-case
managers provide information, sign-post patients to existing
resources (e.g. leisure centres, social clubs, Improving Access to
Psychological Therapy (IAPT) services) and use evidence based
behaviour change techniques to help patients set and achieve
goals. The underlying intention of the intervention is to increase
the patient’s self-efficacy to achieve their desired goals (as opposed
to goals determined by others such as symptom management or
reduction of cardiac risk factors).
Details of the assessment and action plan are recorded in a
‘personalised health plan’ which the patient holds. Follow up
interviews to determine progress and/or set new goals are
conducted via telephone. Calls are planned to last 15 minutes
and are scheduled weekly initially then at increasing intervals
according to patient need. During the 6 month intervention period
weekly meetings were held with research team clinicians (a GP
academic (AT) and two psychiatrists (AM, PW) to ensure fidelity to
the intervention.
Control: treatment as usual (TAU)
All patients received primary care TAU from their GP and/or
Practice Nurse (PN); this may include specific depression
intervention such as antidepressant prescription or referral to
talking therapy.
Measurement
Data were collected face to face at baseline and via telephone at
1, 6 and 12 months post randomisation. Data collection was
completed by July 2012.
Acceptability and Feasibility
The primary outcome for this study was acceptability and
feasibility of procedures for a trial and for the intervention. We
recorded recruitment rates, the number of participants at each
stage of the pilot study, reasons for attrition, randomisation errors
and missing data for outcome measure at each time point. The
time taken for assessment and the number and duration of follow
up telephone calls per patient were recorded.
Outcomes
We explored two potential primary outcomes for a definitive
trial: depression and chest pain.
Depression. HADS-D[20] scores were used to calculate
response ($50% decrease in score from baseline at follow up),
remission (score , 8 at follow up) and severity (continuous score).
We also explored the PHQ-9[21] as an alternative measure of
depression severity and extracted the number of GP/PN
consultations for depression, antidepressant prescriptions and
referrals to talking therapy during the 12 month study period
from participants’ medical records.
Chest pain. Self reported chest pain was measured using the
Modified Rose Angina Questionnaire[19]. The number of GP/
PN consultations for heart-related problems during the 12 month
study period was extracted from participants’ medical records as
proxy measure of participants’ cardiac status.
Potential secondary outcomes explored were: anxiety, (HADSanxiety subscale)[20], well being (Warwick-Edinburgh Mental
Well-being Scale)[22], quality of life (Short Form-12 (SF-12))[23],
functional status (Specific Activity Schedule)[24], number of
reported social problems (social problems questionnaire)[25],
adherence to antidepressant medication (if relevant - Adapted
version of Morisky Adherence Index)[26], and patient reported
problems and needs (PSYCHLOPs)[27].
Self efficacy was measured using the General Self Efficacy Scale
(GSES)[28] and illness beliefs using the Brief Illness Perceptions
Questionnaire (BIPQ)[29]. The latter assesses changes in perceptions about illness along the following dimensions: Consequences,
Timeline (anticipated duration of illness), Personal control,
Treatment Control, Identity (symptoms associated with the illness),
Illness Concern, Illness Coherence (understanding of CHD) and
Emotional Representations (emotional impact of CHD).
The types of needs and problems identified by PC group
patients in collaboration with their nurse-case manager as
contributing to depression was extracted from nurse-case manager
notes made during consultations. The BIPQ asks participants to
‘‘Please list in rank-order the three most important factors that you
believe caused your illness’’ we also explored these responses.
Baseline demographic data including gender, age, ethnicity,
socio-economic status (Index of multiple deprivation)[30], employment and relationship status, living arrangement and cardiac
risk factors (smoking status, alcohol consumption, body mass
index) were recorded.
Costs of PC
Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were measured using the
EQ-5D[31]; UK values were applied to the derived health states to
estimate the utility value for each patient at each time point[32].
Economic costs were calculated from a healthcare plus informal
Nurse-Led Personalised Care for Depression in Symptomatic CHD
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 June 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 6 | e98704
care perspective. PC costs included the time spent by practice
nurses with patients in face-to-face assessments and subsequent
telephone reviews. A unit cost of £36 per hour was attached to the
average intervention duration for each patient. Other service use
was recorded using the Client Service Receipt Inventory[33] for
the 6-month period preceding baseline, and 6- and 12-month
follow-ups. Health services included hospital inpatient and
outpatient visits, GPs, psychiatrists, psychologists, physiotherapists,
counsellors, nurses and other therapists. Unit costs were applied to
service use data using the NHS reference costs in 2009-10
prices[34] and the 2010 Unit Costs of Health & Social Care[35].
In addition, data were collected on the weekly number of hours of
help (i.e. personal or child care, help in/around and outside the
house) received from friends and relatives of the patient. The unit
cost of a home care worker was used as a proxy for costing
informal care.
Sample size
Estimation of an effect size was not the focus of this pilot study.
We aimed to recruit 80 participants (40 per arm) into the pilot
study, we considered, based on past experience of recruitment
from this population, that this would be feasible in the time
available. We estimated from the results of the UPBEAT cohort
study[9] that 10-15 practices each with around 10,000 patients
would be needed.
Randomisation
Randomisation at patient level was conducted independently by
the Mental Health and Neurosciences Clinical Trials Unit (CTU)
at King’s College London. A random permuted block design was
used to balance the numbers between groups. PC group
participants were randomly allocated to one of two nurse
researchers acting as case-managers.
Blinding
Participants were asked at the beginning of each follow up
interview not to mention whether they had been in contact with
other study staff. The statistician was also kept uninformed of
allocation status.
Statistical analyses
Analyses were exploratory and were conducted using STATA
verson 11[36]; the intention to treat principle was used.
Descriptive statistics were used to describe the characteristics of
the sample and the acceptability and feasibility data.
We developed a single statistical model to estimate the
difference in mean scores between participants randomised to
PC and TAU across the three follow-up points (one, six and twelve
months). A linear mixed effect model for longitudinal data
(random intercept model) was used to estimate (using maximum
likelihood) the difference between treatment arms in scores at 1, 6
and 12 months overall. The assumption of normality for the
residuals was checked visually from probability plots. The prespecified covariates that were included in the model consisted of
the baseline outcome score and the randomisation group. Time
was included to estimate the time trends over the whole sample.
An interaction between time and intervention was also examined
for evidence of a differential effect over time. All tests of
hypotheses were two-tailed and associated 95% Confidence
Intervals (CI) are reported; due to the exploratory nature of the
analysis, p-values are reported for the preliminary primary
outcome (HADS-D) only.
The median number of responders ($50% decrease in score
from baseline at follow up) and remitters (score ,8 at follow up)
according to the HADS-D score was compared between groups
using chi-square tests. We compared mean scores for self efficacy
and illness perceptions between groups using independent twosample t-tests. We controlled for the effects of self efficacy and
illness perceptions on changes in depression severity using a linear
mixed effect model for longitudinal data (random intercept model)
to estimate (using maximum likelihood) the difference between
treatment arms. We repeated these analyses to explore nurse
(therapist) effects.
We used multiple regression analysis to estimate mean
differences in costs and QALYs. Baseline and follow-up data were
used as the dependent variables and the group identifier as an
independent variable. The models for follow-up costs and QALYs
were adjusted for baseline costs and utility scores. Cost-effectiveness comparisons were made using incremental cost-effectiveness
ratios (ICERs) and the net benefit (NB) approach. incremental
cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated by dividing the difference
in mean total costs between the PC and TAU groups by the
difference in mean QALYs. Net Benefit from the intervention to
society was defined as the product of the willingness-to-pay for a
QALY (within a range of £0 to £60,000) and the actual QALY
gain minus the service costs (NB~l  DE{DCw0). Net benefits
were then compared between the PC and TAU groups for each
willingness-to-pay value. Missing utilities at follow-up were
imputed using the last value carried forward (LVCF) method[37].
To account for the highly skewed distribution of the cost data,
the non-parametric bootstrap method was used to make cost
comparisons between the two groups[38]. Bootstrapping involved
repeatedly estimating the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio to
account for the uncertainty surrounding the estimates of costs and
benefits. Likewise, estimates of the proportion of iterations in
which the intervention of interest had the maximum expected net
benefit (NB), or equivalently, a positive incremental net benefit
(INB) was determined for a range of willingness-to-pay thresholds.
The estimates were produced by repeatedly sampling with
replacement (1000 times) from the existing pilot study population[39]. The results of the bootstrap analyses were plotted on a
cost-effectiveness plane (CEP) and used to estimate cost-effectiveness acceptability curves (CEACs). CEACs show the probability
that each of the treatment options is optimal, subject to a range of
ceiling ratios, which represent the maximum amount society
would pay for a one unit improvement in QALYs[39].
Results
17 practices were approached by the Greater London Primary
Care Research Network (PCRN) and agreed to participate.
Practices were recruited between October 2010 and June 2011;
practice recruitment was therefore completed in considerably less
than the 12 months planned in the study proposal indicating that
recruitment of practices for a definitive trial would be feasible.
Data collection was completed by July 2012.
Participant recruitment is detailed elsewhere[16]. In summary,
3325 persons on the 17 GP CHD registers, 1001 consented to be
contacted. 126 were eligible for assessment (PHQ2 score $3 and
reporting current chest pain). Of the 126, 40 had a HADS score 8,
2 had experienced hallucinations, 2 had no current chest pain and
1 did not have sufficient English. Following interview, 81 were
found to be eligible, consented and randomised (41 to PC, 40 to
TAU). Recruitment of patients for a definitive RCT therefore
seems promising.
Nurse-Led Personalised Care for Depression in Symptomatic CHD
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 4 June 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 6 | e98704
Fifty-two male and 29 female patients were enrolled. Ages
ranged 38 to 95 years (mean 65 SD11), 83% were white. Fortyeight participants reported having ever been diagnosed with
depression (21/41 = 51% PC, 27/40 = 67% TAU) of these 12 had
had one episode, 7 had had two episodes, 4 had had three
episodes, and 23 reported having had 4 or more episodes (data on
number of episodes were missing for 2 participants). Forty-six
participants had previously received treatment for depression; of
these 41 had taken antidepressants and 29 had had talking
therapy. Eighteen reported having received other treatment such
as ‘anger management’, seeing a psychiatrist, ECT, inpatient
psychiatric care and relaxation and assertiveness courses. Our
participants therefore represent a chronic and severe group.
Twenty-four participants reported that they were currently
receiving treatment for depression (9 in PC, 22%, 15 in TAU,
38%). According to the medical notes data, 13 in PC (32%) and 17
in TAU (43%) were taking some form of antidepressant
medication at baseline. Despite being prescribed antidepressants,
these participants were still reporting depressive symptoms.
Nineteen participants reported their current episode had lasted
more than 12 months, 2 said it had lasted between 6 and 12
months, and 3 said it had lasted less than 6 months.
Mean baseline HADS-D scores (PC 12, SD3; TAU 11, SD3)
indicated moderate depression and mean PHQ9 scores (PC 16,
SD5; TAU 15, SD6) indicated moderately severe depression in
both groups. At baseline, according to the HADS-D, 21 (51%)
participants in the PC group could be considered mild, 14 (34%)
moderate, 6 (15%) severe; in the TAU group there were 19 (47%)
mild, 15 (37%) moderate, 6 (15.0%) severe. For the PHQ9, 3 (7%)
were mild, 10 (24%) moderate, 14 (34%) moderately severe, 12
(29%) severe in the PC group and 8 (20%) were mild, 8 (20%)
moderate, 14 (35%) moderately severe, 9 (22%) severe in the TAU
group. The correlation between baseline HADS D and PHQ9 was
r = 0.48.
Baseline characteristics of intervention (PC) and control
(TAU) groups
Participants in each group had similar mean age, mean years in
education and mean BMI score compared. The PC group had
more males, people of non-white ethnicity and people in paid
employment compared to the TAU group. The TAU group had
more females, more non-drinkers and more people in this group
lived alone compared to the PC group. Those randomised to PC
had marginally greater IMD scores than those in the TAU group
indicating slightly higher levels of deprivation. However differences between the groups appeared small. Due to an oversight, 3
patients who were ineligible due to no current chest pain were
randomised in error (2 in the PC group). Based on the intention to
treat principle these were included in all analyses; a sensitivity
analysis found that our conclusions were unaffected when these
patients were omitted from the analyses. Table 1 shows the
baseline demographic and lifestyle data by group and Table 2
shows baseline scores for all outcome measures by group. The
groups appear to be balanced indicating that our randomisation
process was successful.
Procedures and participation
The consort diagram for the pilot study is shown in Figure 1. By
12 months, 6 people in the PC group had dropped out (2 because
they found participation upsetting, 2 because they felt too
physically unwell to continue, 2 gave no reason) and 1 from the
TAU group had dropped out (because they found participation
upsetting). Two PC group participants received baseline assessment but no intervention as the nurses were subsequently unable
to contact them. Overall, attrition was low (7/81 = 9%), with data
collected at one or more follow up points for 79 people (98%).
Data collection
The maximum number of observations available was 81 at
baseline, 77 at 1 month, 74 at 6 months and 69 at 12 months. Two
of our outcome measures had no missing scores at any point: the
modified Rose Angina Questionnaire and the Specific Activity
Schedule. The BIPQ had the most missing scores, with 14%
missing at 6 months. At one or more assessment points, between
5% and 10% of scores were missing for the General Self Efficacy
Scale, the BIPQ (items 3 and 4), the WEMWBS; all other
measures had fewer than 5% of scores missing at any time.
Therefore, these outcome measures appear to be acceptable to
participants and would be feasible to use in definitive trial.
Changes in outcomes
Depression severity. Both groups showed improvement in
depression symptoms (Tables 2 and 3)) at all time points. Mean
HADS-D score in both groups moved from indicating moderate
depression at baseline to mild depression at 12 months; mean
PHQ9 scores in both groups indicated moderately severe
depression at baseline reducing to moderate depression at 12
months.
Depression remission (HADS-D). There was a greater
percentage of remitters in the TAU (36%, 14/39) compared with
the PC group (24%, 8/34) at 6 months, and at 12 months (TAU:
41%, 15/37 versus PC 34%, 11/32).
Depression response. At 6 months there was greater
percentage of responders in the TAU (21%, 8/37) compared
with the PC group (15%, 5/34), but by 12 months more PC group
participants had responded (TAU = 24%, 9/37, PC = 28%, 9/
32).
However, the mixed effects models showed no significant
differences between groups over time for any measure of
depression and confidence intervals were wide so an effect in
favour of either group cannot be ruled out (PC-TAU severity:
mean diff 20.73, 95% CI 22.08, 0.62, p = 0.29); remission: OR
2.67, 95% CI 0.71, 10.4, p = 0.15; response: OR 1.33, 95% CI
0.38, 4.61, p = 0.65).
Receipt of depression treatment (medical notes). Across
the 12 month pilot study period, in the PC group, 31 participants
(76%) saw their GP or PN regarding their mental health (total of
101 consultations recorded); in the TAU group, 29 participants
(73%) made a mental health consultation (total of 102 mental
health consultations recorded). Of those participants who were not
treated for depression at baseline (i.e. no record of antidepressant
prescription or talking therapy referral), 3 PC participants had
received a prescription for an antidepressant (Citalopram 62,
Mirtazepine 61, one of these participants was also referred for
‘counselling’) and 1 additional PC group participant had been
referred to a ‘psychiatric clinic’ by 12 months; no participants in
the TAU group had a new referral for depression treatment or a
new prescription for an antidepressant at the end of the pilot study.
Chest pain. At 6 months the proportion of patients who no

and at 12 months it was 31% in the PC group versus 19% in the
TAU group. From the medical notes across the 12 month pilot
study period, in the PC group, 34 participants (83%) saw their GP
or PN regarding their CHD (total of 158 consultations recorded);
in the TAU group, 29 participants (73%) made a CHD
consultation (total of 170 consultations recorded); it was unclear
whether these were routine or emergency visits.

A&E attendances over the 12 month study period were
identified from medical notes. Ten PC group participants (6 for
heart problems, 2 for other state reasons, 2 no reason recorded)
visited A&E (total 13 visits: 9 heart problems, 2 other stated
reasons, 2 no reason recorded); 15 TAU group participants (4 for
heart problems, 5 for other state reasons, 6 no reason recorded)
visited A & E (total 26 visits: 7 heart problems, 6 other stated
reasons, 13 no reason recorded). PC participants therefore made
fewer A&E visits (24% in PC versus 38% in TAU), although
missing data concerning the reason for these visits makes this
information difficult to interpret.
Preliminary secondary outcomes. At 6 and 12 months
both groups improved on all outcomes (Table 3). There was no
evidence for an interaction between time point and study arm for
any outcome.
Appropriateness of study outcomes
All participants were asked to list the 3 most important
problems which they felt had caused their CHD; 61 gave at least
one reason. The most common reason was ‘genetics or heredity’,
followed by lifestyle factors such as smoking, poor diet and lack of
exercise. Mood problems, especially stress and work-related stress
were also mentioned, and co-morbid or past health problems were
also blamed. Four patients mentioned relationship problems and 1
mentioned financial problems (a full list of responses is given in
Appendix S1 online).
Participants in the PC group (N = 41) identified 21 types of
problem as contributing to their depression and which were
addressed during the intervention (up to 3 problems per patient);
most common were (patients): pain (chest and other pain e.g.
arthritis) (18), lack of exercise (17), difficulty sleeping (13), anxiety
(11), overweight (11). Reported problems and whether or not they

were addressed during the intervention are listed in Appendix S2
online.
Participants therefore explained both their CHD and their
depression in terms of wide ranging problems; lifestyle and mood
problems, in particular, were commonly associated with both.
Within our pilot study, mood outcomes were assessed using the
HADS and the PHQ9, however we had no measure of change in
lifestyle-related outcomes. The PC intervention was aimed at
tackling the problems that each participant felt were important
rather than addressing specific cardiac risk factors as has been
tested in other trials, however it appears that patients consider
CHD-related lifestyle factors to contribute to their depression, so
inclusion of a measure of these factors should be considered for a
definitive trial of PC. It will be important to select a measure which
captures the variation between participants in terms of which risk
factors they want to address; a validated measure of goal
attainment may therefore be appropriate.
Intervention procedures
There was considerable variation between patients in the
number of failed follow up contact attempts by nurses over the 6
month intervention period (range: 0 to 32), but on average nurses
made 2.8 calls for every successful contact. PC participants (n = 41)
received a mean 203 SD100 mins of nurse time (78 SD19 for
assessment; 125 SD91 in telephone follow up calls) over 6 months.
Mean number of follow up calls was 9 SD5; the mean duration of
calls was 14 SD4 minutes.
Mediator Analyses
Self-efficacy for self management and illness
perceptions. At 12 months, the PC group had a mean increase
in self-efficacy of 2.5 points versus 0.9 points in the TAU group.
Similarly, mean improvement in overall illness perceptions score
was greater in the PC compared with the TAU group: 7.8 points
versus 2.5 points. The biggest difference in mean improvement
between the PC and TAU groups was in ‘‘Personal Control’’
(mean change in BIPQ from baseline = 1.1 for PC versus 0.1 for
TAU at 12 months). Controlling for changes in self efficacy or
overall illness perceptions had little effect on change in depression
over time, whether considering depression (mean diff, 95% CI)
severity (self-efficacy 20.88, 95% CI 22.11, 0.36; illness
perceptions 20.57, 95% CI-1.9, 0.77), remission (OR) (selfefficacy 3.15, 95% CI 0.64, 15.50; illness perceptions 3.26, 95%
CI 0.94, 11.24) or response (OR) (self-efficacy 1.02, 95% CI 0.26,
3.95; illness perceptions 1.27, 95% CI 0.34, 4.66).
Anxiety. Since anxiety symptoms were high at baseline, in a
post hoc analysis, we explored HADS-A score as mediator for
improvement in depression. Controlling for anxiety slightly
reduced the difference in depression symptoms between the
groups over time: mean difference = 20.43 95% CI 21.48, 0.63,
p = 0.43. Controlling for anxiety considerably reduced the odds of
remission in the TAU versus PC group in favour of the PC group:
OR remission in TAU versus PC group = 0.42, 95% CI 0.10, 1.68,
p = 0.22 which suggests that changes in anxiety symptoms may be
a mediator for depression remission. The odds of depression
response in the TAU group compared with the PC group were
also slightly reduced when anxiety scores were controlled,
although the odds were still in favour of TAU: OR 1.12 95%
CI 0.32, 3.9.
Therapist effects. The random effects model (combining
data from 1, 6 and 12 months) indicated little difference in the
average therapist effect on the HADS-D score across the time
points (adjusting for baseline HADS depression score): mean
difference = 20.86 (22.81 to 1.10).
Regarding self reported chest pain, of Nurse 1’s (registered
general nurse and health psychologist) patients, 44% continued to
report chest pain at 6 months compared with 79% of Nurse 2’s
(registered general and mental health nurse) patients at 6 months
(p = 0.03). In the random effects model, the odds of reporting chest
pain across the study period were higher for Nurse 2 compared
with Nurse 1: OR = 7.80 (0.88 to 69.40). Therefore, a therapist
effect cannot be ruled out.

Intervention intensity. The amount of time spent talking to
the nurse varied considerably between patients (range 74 to 406
minutes), so we used the median duration (167 minutes) to divide
the participants into high (n = 20) and low (n = 19) ‘dose’ groups.
There were no significant differences (p.0.05) between the groups
at baseline in depression (HADS-D mean: low dose group 11.0 SD
3; high dose group 12 SD 3.7). The magnitude of improvement in
depression over time was greater for the high compared to the low
dose group and fewer high dose patients had chest pain at 6 and
12 months, although the mixed effects models indicated little
difference between the groups: depression mean difference 20.72
95% CI 23.03 to 1.60; chest pain OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.53.
QALY gains
The average EQ-5D utility scores at baseline were slightly
higher for the PC group (see Appendix S3), although the difference
between groups was not statistically significant (95% CI 20.98 to
0.25, p = 0.40). By the 1-month follow-up the TAU group had a
higher utility score and this difference was maintained up to 12-
month follow-up (95% CI 0.26 to 0.11, p= 0.422, at 6-month
follow-up: 95% CI 0.27 to 0.11, p = 0.408). In terms of QALYs,
the control group showed an incremental QALY gain of 0.038
compared to personalised care over the 12-month treatment
period.
Service use and costs. Service use was fairly similar between
the intervention and the control groups during the study period
(Total cost PC vs TAU, mean (SD): baseline 1,773 (2,498) vs 3,604
(7,852); 6 months 832 (1,383) vs 1,191(1,168); 12 months 1,088
(1,320) vs 2,014 (3,246); details are shown in Appendix S4).
Hospital services were used more intensively by the TAU group
than the PC group at all time points, with inpatient and outpatient
care being the most frequently used services. The TAU group
incurred higher inpatient costs than the PC group at each time
point (particularly baseline and at 12-month follow-up). Few
patients used day hospital services, but the costs incurred were
high for both groups. The majority of patients received care from
GPs and the costs of this were similar between the groups.
Informal care was used slightly more among patients in the PC
group compared with the TAU group. Average total costs at each
time point were lower for the PC group compared to the TAU
group. However, the differences were not statistically significant.
For the PC group, the intervention itself accounted only for 6.7%
of total costs.
Cost-utility analysis. Of the total 81 participants, cost and
QALY data at each time point were available for 68 patients
(84%). Cost-utility results yielded an incremental cost-effectiveness
ratio (ICER) of £29,921 per additional QALY. Cost-effectiveness
plane and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves (CEACs) were
produced from bootstrapped resamples. The distribution of the
cost-effectiveness point estimates on the cost-effectiveness plane
(Appendix S5) indicated a strong likelihood of cost savings for the
PC group compared with the TAU group. The point estimate of
the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio falls in the south-western
(SW) quadrant, representing the situation where the PC group has
reduced costs and worse outcomes. The second most likely result is
that PC results in lower costs and better outcomes (SE quadrant).
The CEAC (Figure 3) for the PC group compared to the TAU
group was downward sloping. There is a greater likelihood of PC
being the most cost-effective option up to a QALY threshold of
£3,035.
Discussion
This study explored the feasibility and acceptability of trial and
intervention procedures for an RCT of a practice nurse-delivered
personalized care intervention for primary care CHD patients who
have probable depression and current chest pain. We also
examined the potential costs of the intervention.
Feasibility and Acceptability of Personalised Care and
Appropriateness of Study Outcomes
The PC intervention appeared to be feasible and acceptable for
use in current primary care: little nurse time was needed,
engagement with the nurse-case managers was high and drop
out was low. The findings of our qualitative work[8,13] that
patients with CHD and probable depression report a wide range
of problems which they consider contribute to their low mood
were confirmed. The PC intervention enabled patients to identify
and address these problems with the nurse-case managers. This is
an improvement on current care for these patients since
management of depression and/or psychosocial problems is not
routinely addressed in this population[8]. Compared to the
widespread organizational change which would be needed for
collaborative care interventions as trialled in the USA[6], our
personalized care intervention appears to offer an enhanced form
of treatment as usual which could be implemented easily in current
primary care practice. Evidence from the UK-based ProCEED
trial[40] that care reviews delivered by practice nurses acting as
case managers were acceptable to patients with long-term
depression supports this[14].
We explored a wide range of outcomes focusing on depression
as measured by the HADS-D as a potential primary outcome.
Both groups improved on all measured outcomes, since depression
and functional status outcomes changed in the same direction, we
see little reason to change to a different primary outcome for a
definitive trial. Our mixed effects model indicated that PC would
be unlikely to do much harm compared with TAU (mean
difference 20.73), but could improve symptoms up to 2.1 points
on the HADS-D (95% CI 22.08, 0.62).
There were no large differences between groups, except in self
reported chest pain, which was also an inclusion criterion for the
study. We are unable to determine whether self-reported chest
pain in our study participants was of cardiac origin. It is estimated
that in half of all patients presenting with chest pain, the pain is of
non-cardiac origin(i.e. no physiological cause can be identified)[41]. A systematic review (15 studies, 803 participants) [42]
of psychological interventions for chest pain in patients with
normal coronary anatomy suggests a modest to moderate
benefit[43]. Our pilot study indicates that non-pharmacological
intervention may also be effective for chest pain in patients with
CHD. Our cohort study[15] indicated that chest pain has a range
of negative impacts; chest pain therefore remains an important
outcome for a future trial but self-report should be supported by a
more objective measure of cardiac status.
As predicted, our data indicated that self efficacy and illness
perceptions, especially personal control which is closely related to
self efficacy, were increased in those receiving PC. A difference
between our intervention and that of others which have not found
improved self efficacy[44] following self management intervention
is that our participants chose the outcomes on which to work, that
isthey identified the factors they felt contributed to their low mood,
rather than being required to work directly on their depression. A
better examination of the theory behind our PC intervention
would be to explore the effect of changes in self efficacy on a
measure of goal attainment, then test the effects of goal attainment
Nurse-Led Personalised Care for Depression in Symptomatic CHD
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 11 June 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 6 | e98704
on depression over the long term, although this would require a
complex trial. Fewer PC compared with TAU participants visited
A&E (24% versus 38%), which may indicate increased self efficacy
in self management in the PC group, though in a future trial a
more robust measure than self report of A&E attendance should
be used to examine this, for instance Hospital Episode Statistics
(ref health and social care information center)[45].
Acceptability and feasibility of the study protocol
Our findings suggest that the study protocol was feasible and
acceptable. Attrition was below 10% and rates of missing data for
most outcomes were low, despite the large number of measures.
The Greater London Primary Care Research Network was
responsible for practice recruitment which was achieved well
within our predicted time-frame. Patient recruitment was in line
with other studies of depression interventions in primary
care[7,46,47]. Only around a third of patients invited to
participate by their GP provided consent to contact. Use of this
‘opt in’ system appears to result in substantial loss of potential
participants; however this is the usual method of recruitment for
studies conducted in UK primary care. All of the patients meeting
our inclusion criteria at baseline agreed to be randomised.
Implications of clinical findings for a future trial of PC
An implication of the limited difference between PC and TAU
and the small degree of change in depression symptoms detected
over time, is that a sample size would be required (e.g. using the
HADS-D mean PC 10.3 SD 4.6, TAU 9.2SD 4.6 at 6 months) of
368 per group for 90% power at a 5% significance level (twosided). The sample size would be increased to some extent if a
cluster design were employed, which would be necessary to reduce
contamination if PC were tested using PNs based in practice.
To increase the expected effect size, the intervention could be
given to a group that is more responsive. Our sample appears to
represent a hard to treat group: the level of depression symptoms
was high, more than half reported recurrent depression and more
than a quarter reported that they were receiving depression
treatment at baseline and yet still reported depression symptoms.
In addition, we included only those patients with current chest
pain and pain has been found to predict a worse course of mood
disorders[48].
Alternatively, our finding that receipt of more nurse time was
associated with greater improvement in depression and self
reported chest pain suggests that more intensive intervention
may be needed for the type of patient we recruited. Depression in
older adults in primary care is increasingly conceptualized as a
chronic illness[49]. In people with CHD[4,50], even intensive
treatments, such as CBT, problem solving and SSRIs have only a
small effect on depression. Interprofessional working to ensure
receipt of guideline informed treatment has been a key element in
a number of successful trials of complex interventions for
depression in primary care patients[6,7,51]. In this pilot study,
four participants in the PC group compared with none in the TAU
group received new depression treatment (antidepressant treatment or psychological treatment) by the end of the pilot study. The
nurse-case managers contacted the GP or PN of the majority of
PC group participants; however they reported difficulties: several
telephone attempts needed, lack of response to emails, and even
when contact was made, guideline informed treatment was not
necessarily delivered (e.g. due to anxiety concerning multipharmacy and IAPT services being unavailable in some areas).
Difficulties in implementing collaborative working for comorbid
problems such as depression and CHD and uncertainties about
the best service delivery approaches have been identified by other
researchers[52]. In a future trial procedures for delivering
guideline informed treatment should be pre-determined and case
managers should be embedded within practices to increase
interprofessional working (e.g. by having planned times for
discussion of cases). In addition, in a future trial, more active
treatment of anxiety should be tested. Anxiety is associated with
worse depression outcome[53]; our participants reported high

anxiety levels and we found some evidence of anxiety as a
mediator for depression improvement.
The potential to detect differences between PC and TAU in our
pilot study may have been reduced because TAU is itself an active
intervention: at baseline 43% of the TAU group versus 32% of the
PC group was prescribed antidepressants (according to their
medical notes), we were unable to control for this difference in our
analyses. It is also possible that TAU may have been intensified
during the pilot study: during our qualitative work GPs and PNs
reported greater awareness of the problem of co-morbid depression and CHD as a result of participation in our cohort study, the
same may apply to participation in our pilot study, although from
the medical notes it appeared that the number of mental health
consultations were similar for both groups. In a future trial,
changes in TAU during the trial should be recorded.
A PC manual (available from the authors) was produced and, in
weekly study group meetings, the multidisciplinary clinical team
was satisfied that the intervention was delivered as planned.
Nevertheless our findings of potential therapist effects suggest that
training in the behaviour change aspects of the intervention is
important. However, other studies have shown that nurses and
GPs trained in behaviour change techniques may have difficulty
applying them[44,54,55]. Further research into how non-psychologists can be trained to work more psychologically is needed.
Implementation of self management support interventions within
primary care is known to be problematic[44]; a strength of our
intervention compared with that of others[44]is the very short
amount of nurse time required and the lack of need for specialist
materials to be used or developed.
Potential costs of PC
There were no great differences in service use and costs between
PC and TAU, with the exception of inpatient care, which also
accounted for a substantial proportion of total costs. Overall, it
appears that PC reduced costs compared with TAU, but produced
slightly lower benefits. However, costs may have been underestimated due to reliance on patient self-report in service use, the lack
of medication and sick-leave data at all time points and the
approach used to quantify informal care. Informal care constitutes
a major cost driver in chronically ill populations. In this analysis,
the ‘‘proxy good method’’ [56]and the unit cost of home care
worker was used to calculate informal care. However, in a future
trial, an alternative cost, such as the national minimum wage,
could be used to quantify informal care in the context of a
sensitivity analysis. A future trial should also test whether a longer
time-horizon is needed for this particular patient group to benefit
from an intervention of this kind.
Conclusions
We have developed an intervention for primary care CHD
patients with probable depression and current chest pain. We
found that this intervention and our study protocol were feasible
and acceptable for an RCT in this population. This pilot study was
not powered to detect between group differences over time, but
our data suggests that to be more effective case managers should
be trained in behaviour change techniques, the intervention
should be more focused on delivering guideline informed care, do
more to address anxiety and include more intensive follow up.
Collaborative working will be more feasible with case managers
based within trial practices. The effects of differences in TAU will
need to be considered in a future RCT. In addition, careful
thought should be given to which primary outcome to use to
reflect differences between patients in their desired outcomes,
depression outcomes may only improve in the longer term. The
UPBEAT personalized care intervention helps patients to address
a wide range of problems which are not currently managed in
primary care and appears to be cheaper than TAU.
