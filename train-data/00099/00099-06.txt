Abstract
Background: We investigated the effectiveness of an occupational therapy led self-management support programme,
OPTIMAL, designed to address the challenges of living with multiple chronic conditions or multimorbidity in a primary
care setting.
Methods: Pragmatic feasibility randomised controlled trial including fifty participants with multimorbidity recruited from
family practice and primary care settings. OPTIMAL is a six-week community-based programme, led by occupational
therapy facilitators and focuses on problems associated with managing multimorbidity. The primary outcome was
frequency of activity participation. Secondary outcomes included self-perception of, satisfaction with and ability to
perform daily activities, independence in activities of daily living, anxiety and depression, self-efficacy, health-related quality
of life, self-management support, healthcare utilisation and individualised goal attainment. Outcomes were collected
within two weeks of intervention completion.
Results: There was a significant improvement in frequency of activity participation, measured using the Frenchay
Activities Index, for the intervention group compared to the control group (Adjusted Mean Difference at follow up
4.22. 95% Confidence Interval 1.59-6.85). There were also significant improvements in perceptions of activity
performance and satisfaction, self-efficacy, independence in daily activities and quality of life. Additionally, the
intervention group demonstrated significantly higher levels of goal achievement, following the intervention. No
significant differences were found between the two groups in anxiety, depression, self-management scores or
healthcare utilisation.
Conclusions: OPTIMAL significantly improved frequency of activity participation, self-efficacy and quality of life for
patients with multimorbidity. Further work is required to test the sustainability of these effects over time but this
study indicates that it is a promising intervention that can be delivered in primary care and community settings.

Background
Multimorbidity is now considered the norm, rather than
the exception, in primary care settings [1,2]. It is an independent predictor of adverse outcomes, including
poor quality of life (QoL), mortality and disability [3]. It
is also linked to psychological distress, lower levels of
functioning, financial difficulties, restrictions in work,
leisure and social activities, multiple symptoms and increased healthcare utilization (HCU) [4-7]. Qualitative
research indicates that individuals with multimorbidity
have concerns over functional limitations and interference
with daily routines [8]. Despite this, there is limited evidence regarding the potential effectiveness of interventions designed to improve outcomes in multimorbidity. A
Cochrane review of such interventions found ten randomised controlled trials and results were mixed. The review
suggested that interventions targeting functional limitations that are common across conditions had potential to
improve outcomes [9]. Occupational therapy was identified as a discipline that incorporates the skills and techniques to address these difficulties [10].
We used the UK Medical Research Council Framework
for the design and evaluation of complex interventions to
improve health outcomes to develop the intervention and
after two initial pilot studies, the intervention was refined to
a six-week occupation-based self-management programme,
OPTIMAL, specifically designed to target individuals with
multimorbidity [11]. Self-management, sometimes referred
to as self-care has been defined as the actions taken by individuals to lead a healthy lifestyle, to meet their needs
and to care for their long-term conditions to prevent
further future illness [12]. Full details of the OPTIMAL
programme content and delivery have been described previously following the initial development and pilot study
[11]. The programme was based on the Stanford Chronic
Disease Self-Management Programme (CDSMP) [13] with
the key adaptations being an occupational therapy focus,
groups being professionally led and a clear focus on the
specific challenges of multimorbidity identified from the
qualitative literature in this area [8]. We adapted this
programme based on the need to develop effective interventions for patients with multimorbidity as existing evidence suggests that the CDSMP has modest effects [14],
particularly when delivered in settings outside the USA
[15]. The intervention was designed to be professionally
led, with the aim of harnessing the effective elements of
other successful professional-led interventions such as
cardiac and pulmonary rehabilitation [16]. The theoretical
underpinning for the OPTIMAL Intervention is Bandura’s
Theory of Self-Efficacy. Bandura defined self-efficacy as
“…peoples judgment of their capacity to organise and
execute courses of action required to attain designated
types of performances” (pg. 391) [17]. In the context of
the OPTIMAL intervention, the proposed improvement
in self-efficacy would be expected to enhance selfmanagement and confidence, which would in turn enable
patients to manage their symptoms and have improved
performance of daily activities and improved well-being.
Patients with multimorbidity may particularly benefit from
such programmes as they have been shown to have low
levels of self-efficacy and poor quality of life, both of which
worsens with increasing numbers of conditions. This likely
relates to the increasing complexity of managing additional conditions and the increasing burden of symptoms
and of treatment [18]. These considerations have driven
intervention design and development.
We aimed to undertake a pragmatic feasibility randomised controlled trial to determine the effectiveness of
OPTIMAL for increasing activity participation in individuals with multimorbidity.
Methods
We undertook a pragmatic feasibility randomised controlled
trial using the CONSORT Guidelines to ensure accurate
and complete reporting of the design, conduct and analysis
of the study (www.consort-statement.org). The study was
approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Trinity
College Dublin (Study reference: 21 November, 2012).
Setting and patients
Participants with multimorbidity were identified opportunistically during routine encounters by their Family
Practitioner and other primary care clinicians and referred
to the occupational therapists running the programme
until a sufficient number of participants were recruited.
Contextual details of the Irish health system are provided
in Table 1. Given the pragmatic nature of this feasibility
trial there was no clear denominator of all eligible patients. Patients were recruited across three community
care areas in which participating occupational therapists
were based and these areas cover a population of approximately 67,000 people. Clinicians (family practitioners or
any other primary care clinicians in the areas) were
emailed with information and study inclusion criteria and
encouraged to refer any eligible patients over a threemonth period (December 2012 to February 2013). This
replicates how an intervention such as OPTIMAL would
be offered and delivered in clinical practice but means it is
not possible to calculate the numbers of potentially eligible patients in the population. However, given the prevalence of multimorbidity this would be far higher than the
numbers that were needed for this feasibility trial. The following inclusion criteria were applied: age over 18 years;
patients with two or more chronic conditions and a minimum of four repeat medications. There has been much
discussion in the literature on definitions of multimorbidity with variation in criteria applied across studies [19].
We used a broad inclusive definition of two chronic
Garvey et al. BMC Family Practice (2015) 16:59 Page 2 of 11
conditions applying the WHO definition of a chronic condition which is a condition likely to persist for longer than six
months and need life long intervention [20]. However, as
the prevalence studies suggest this represents the norm in
older population so we also added matched criteria that patients should be receiving at least four repeat prescriptions.
This was to ensure that individuals with more manageable
combinations of relatively asymptomatic conditions, for example hyperlipidaemia and well-controlled hypertension
were not targeted. For pragmatic reasons this also enabled
clinicians to focus on referring individuals who were more
likely to need support managing their conditions. We excluded patients who were unable to travel to the community
centre where groups were delivered or who had participated
in the initial pilot study and referring practitioners were
aware of this exclusion criterion. Written consent was obtained from all participants who took part in the trial. The
trial began in November 2012 and ended in June 2013.
Randomisation and allocation concealment
This study was an individually randomised trial, where participants were randomly allocated to receive the intervention
or to remain on the waiting list and receive usual care [21].
Patients were randomised when baseline data collection was
complete. The randomisation and allocation were carried
out remotely by a statistician, independent of the trial management team with no involvement in patient recruitment,
using a computer generated sequence. The researcher informed participants of their group assignment one to two
weeks prior to intervention commencement by telephone. It
took between four to eight weeks to fill a group.
Intervention
The intervention was the six-week OPTIMAL programme
and intervention elements are summarised in Table 2. It
was delivered in three different primary care centres in
local communities near where patients lived. In total,
three OPTIMAL programmes were delivered, staggered
over a three month period. The overall aims of OPTIMAL
are to improve performance, satisfaction and frequency of
activity participation, increase self-efficacy in managing
multimorbidity, improve quality of life, reduce anxiety and
depression, and improve multimorbidity self-management
skills. The OPTIMAL programme is professionally led
Table 1 Key features of healthcare systems in the Republic of Ireland
Irish healthcare system In the Irish healthcare system there is mixed public and private funding. Primary health care is free through
the Primary Care Reimbursement Scheme (PCRS) only to those judged less able to pay and covers approximately
35% of the population. Registration with a family practice is required only if the patient belongs to the PCRS.
PCRS supports the delivery of primary healthcare by providing reimbursement services to primary care
contractors for the provision of health services to members of the public in their own community. Patients
not eligible for this scheme pay approximately €50 ($69) per visit.
Primary care in Ireland is an inter-disciplinary team-based approach. Primary care services are provided by
family practitioners, nurses, health care assistants, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, social workers,
speech and language therapists and pharmacists. The model of primary care supported by government but
not yet fully implemented. The proposed model emphasises a change from secondary care to more appropriate
primary care services, to provide a single point of entry for all health and personal social services.
Table 2 Elements of the OPTIMAL Intervention
Breakdown of OPTIMAL Programme OPTIMAL has the following elements:
1. Weekly group meetings for a six-week period held in local community health centres
2. Occupational Therapy focus
3. Peer support
4. Goal setting and prioritization based on patient preferences
OT interventions to support patient self-management used in the groups include:
• Self-management
• Fatigue and energy management
• Managing stress and anxiety and maintaining mental health and well-being
• Keeping physically active
• Healthy eating
• Managing medications
• Effective communication strategies
• Goal setting
One of the weekly sessions incorporates education on physical activity delivered by a
physiotherapist and another incorporates medicines management, delivered by a pharmacist
Garvey et al. BMC Family Practice (2015) 16:59 Page 3 of 11
and facilitated by occupational therapists but incorporates
elements of peer support available through the group format. Prior to programme delivery OPTIMAL facilitators
received two training sessions from the study team (DC
and JG) and a group leader manual to standardise
programme delivery. Full details of the course content are
available in the published pilot study [11]. In summary,
the group meetings were held weekly over a six-week
period with each meeting lasting three hours. The meetings were led by a local community based occupational
therapist (OT) working with the research OT (JG). The
sessions covered the following topics: Fatigue management; healthy eating; maintaining physical activity (delivered by a community physiotherapist); maintaining
mental health; managing medications (delivered by a
pharmacist) and communicating effectively with health
professionals. Individual goal setting was a key element
with goals discussed and revised at each session.
Control
All 50 participants underwent assessment and baseline
data collection prior to randomisation. Patients allocated
to control were placed on a waiting list and were invited
to attend an OPTIMAL course following trial completion in their local Occupational Therapy Department.
Outcomes
Primary outcome
The Frenchay Activities Index (FAI) was used to measure
the primary outcome, frequency of activity participation
[22]. The FAI was chosen as the primary outcome as previous research has indicated that those with multimorbidity engage less frequently in productive and leisure
activities despite having the ability to do so [23]. One of
the primary objectives of the programme therefore is to
increase frequency of activity engagement. Although originally designed to measure changes in activities after
stroke, it has been identified as valid and reliable with a
variety of health conditions and in community dwelling
populations. The score range is 0–45, with higher scores
indicating higher frequency of activity participation. It is
divided into three categories of activities (domestic chores,
leisure/work and outdoor activities), with each category
scoring 0–15 [22].
Secondary outcomes
Patient-based secondary outcome measures included: the
Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM)
[24]; the Nottingham Extended Activities of Daily Living
(NEADL) [25]; the Hospital Anxiety and Depression
Scale (HADS) [26]; the Stanford Chronic Disease SelfEfficacy 6-item Scale (SSE) [27]; the EQ-5D [28]; the
Health Education Impact Questionnaire (HeiQ) [29];
and Goal attainment scaling (GAS) [30]. Health care
utilisation including number of family practitioner visits,
practice nurse visits and hospital admissions were collected directly from family practice medical records.
Sample size
Sample size calculation was based on the primary outcome, the Frenchay Activities Index. Improvements of
four points in FAI total scores have been reported as
clinically significant [31]. The pilot study revealed baseline
FAI scores of 26.5 (SD 3.23) [11]. To improve these scores
by 4 points, with 90% power, allowing for a 20% loss to
follow up, a total sample of 34 participants was required.
We aimed to recruit 60 participants in total, 30 in each
arm with three groups running for intervention group
participants in the three primary care centres involved,
and 10–12 patients per group as some variation in group
attendance over the programme was anticipated.
Data collection
Data were collected two weeks prior and two weeks post
intervention in primary care centres or participants’
homes, depending on participants’ preferences. All outcome measures were conducted face to face with participants. Baseline data were collected prior to allocation to
minimise ascertainment bias. Due to the nature of the
intervention it was not possible to blind follow up data
collection.
Data analysis
For the primary outcome, a multiple linear regression
model was used to examine the relationship between
FAI follow-up scores and group allocation (intervention
or control). Baseline FAI scores, age, sex, marital status,
occupational status and number of chronic conditions
were controlled for as potential confounding variables
[4,32-35]. P-values <0.05 were deemed statistically significant. An intention to treat (ITT) analysis was conducted which included only individuals with complete
baseline and follow-up data, i.e. complete case analysis.
An additional sensitivity analysis was conducted imputing missing values using the method of ‘last observation
carried forward’ [36].
The differences for all FAI subscales and secondary
outcomes between baseline and follow-up for the intervention and control group were examined. For continuous outcomes the mean and standard deviation were
calculated and for categorical outcomes frequencies and
percentages were calculated. Shapiro-Wilk tests of normality were conducted to determine appropriate parametric and non-parametric statistical tests. Independent
sample t-tests, Mann Whitney U tests and proportions
tests were selected accordingly. Linear regression models,
adjusting for baseline values, age, sex, marital status, occupational status and number of chronic conditions were
Garvey et al. BMC Family Practice (2015) 16:59 Page 4 of 11
used where appropriate. The Bonferroni correction was
used to adjust for multiple comparisons for the secondary
outcome measures. Including all secondary outcomes
measures and subscales, 23 tests were run. We multiplied
all the unadjusted p-values by 23 and compared these adjusted p-values to 0.05.
Results
Patient flow and characteristics
Sixty-three individuals were referred to the programme
within the study time frame, which was limited as this
work was undertaken as part of a postgraduate Research
Masters degree (JG). Patients were referred by family
practitioners and other primary care clinicians from
three defined Primary Care Network areas in Dublin,
covering a population of approximately 67,000 people.
Thirteen participants dropped out prior to baseline data
collection due to lack of interest, busy schedules or recent hospitalisations. Hence, fifty participants completed
baseline assessment and were included in the study.
Figure 1 presents an overview of participant follow up
during the trial. Of the fifty participants recruited into the
study, 44/50 (88%) had complete baseline and follow-up
data sets. In total, 6/50 (12%) participants were lost to
follow-up; four from the intervention group and two from
the control group. The majority of the intervention group
(20/26: 76%) attended three or more of the six sessions
but 6/26 (13%) never attended any session.
The median age of participants was 66 years and the
majority were married, living with a family member and
retired. Participants had a median number of four conditions and were taking a median number of eight medications. In total, 43 chronic conditions were identified, the
most common being arthritis, congestive cardiac failure,
diabetes, depression and hypertension (Table 3).
Primary outcome: frequency of activity participation
The multiple linear regression model, having adjusted for
baseline values, age, sex, marital status, occupational status
and number of chronic conditions, indicated significant

differences in the total FAI scores between the intervention
and control group at follow up (Adjusted MD at follow up
4.22 (95% CI 1.59-6.85), (see Table 4). The Adjusted R
Squared value was 0.705, indicating that 70.5% of the variation in FAI outcomes was explained by group allocation.
The only significant difference in FAI subscales, between
the intervention and control group, was the domestic subscale (p < 0.01).
Secondary outcomes
There were significant differences in a range of secondary
outcomes (see Table 5). Having adjusted for baseline
values, age, sex, marital status, occupational status and
number of chronic conditions, there was a significant difference between the intervention and control groups for
the COPM-P (p = 0.02), COPM-S (p = 0.02), NEADL total
score (p = 0.02), SSE (p = 0.02) and EQ-VAS (p = 0.02). No
significant difference was seen for the HADS at follow-up
(p = 0.49). Health care utilisation data revealed high levels
of service utilisation, particularly family practice services.
No significant differences were identified in HCU between
the two groups, however, the follow-up time period was
very short and the study was not powered to detect differences. The positive and active engagement in life domain
was significantly higher for the intervention group than
for the control group (p = 0.04) in the HeiQ scores. No

significant findings were identified for the other seven
domains.
The results relating to health related QoL showed a
trend towards improvement in a number of EQ-5D domains (mobility, usual activities, anxiety/depression) in
the intervention group (see Table 6). However, having
adjusted for multiple comparisons no significant differences between the intervention and control group were
seen for any of the domains.
Goal Attainment Scoring (GAS) was used only with
intervention group participants and significant differences
were found between baseline and follow-up (p ≤ 0.01). Results showed that 19/20 participants had significant levels
of achievement in their identified goals. Commonly cited
goals included improving fitness levels, losing weight, increasing confidence levels, improving diet and developing
a more structured, daily routine. The median number of
goals set was three.
Discussion
This study showed that OPTIMAL, an occupational
therapy–led self-management programme, is effective in
improving activity participation and performance, and
leads to improvements in self-efficacy, health related
quality of life and goal attainment. OPTIMAL also increased participants’ frequency of engagement in daily activities such as household chores and meal preparation.
These improvements have the potential to improve outcomes for patients through more effective management of
long-term conditions. To our knowledge, it is the first fully
professionally led self-management programme designed
specifically for patients with multimorbidity rather than the
more general concept of self-management for chronic conditions. This is conceptually different due to the specific
focus on improving activity participation and functional
abilities of participants as identified in qualitative studies. It
also addresses generic self-management knowledge and

skills across different conditions and the need for prioritisation of health problems through techniques such as goal
setting. Existing Chronic Disease Self-Management Programmes focus on living with chronic conditions and generally include people with single conditions and have
presented sub-group analyses on outcomes in participants
with multimorbidity attending the same programmes
[13,37]. Qualitative work with patients and practitioners
suggest that multimorbidity, particularly for patients with
higher numbers of conditions as included in this study, has
additional challenges especially around treatment burden
and the need to prioritise management of health problems
based on patient preferences [38]. This study matches the
eligibility criteria for inclusion in the planned update of the
Cochrane Review of Interventions to Improve Outcomes
for Patients with Multimorbidity and will add to the growing evidence base needed to support multimorbidity management [37].
OPTIMAL has a strong focus on improving and increasing activity participation. Areas identified as problematic for people with multimorbidity are discussed
including, fatigue, anxiety, communicating with health
professional and medication management [4,7]. Through
active group discussion, participants examine how these
issues can impact on activity performance and participation. The facilitators provide practical strategies on how to
maintain participation in valued activities. There are also
important inputs from a physiotherapist and pharmacist
on managing physical activity and medications. Weekly
goal-setting is another key aspect of OPTIMAL and each
week participants set realistic and achievable goals to work
on over the following week. Goal-setting has been shown
in previous studies to be an effective mechanism to enhance self-management strategies [39,40].
There were significant differences between intervention and control groups in self-efficacy which is defined
as the confidence in capacity to undertake complex steps
required to effectively self-manage chronic conditions.
Self-efficacy has been suggested as one of the main underpinnings of successful self-management programmes
[41,42]. There is a potential bidirectional relationship
here that as individuals increase their frequency of activity participation, their confidence in their abilities may
improve and vice versa. There were also trends in improvements in health related quality of life. Research has
highlighted the importance of control and choice on
quality of life [43,44]. Giving participants autonomy to
choose not only empowers individuals to make decisions
about their own health management, but reflects current
policy for health services to be person-centred [45,46].
On referral to the study 12% of the sample had a confirmed diagnosis of anxiety. However, baseline Hospital
Anxiety and Depression Scale scores revealed 36% of the
overall sample presented with “caseness” levels on the
anxiety scale. While one of the weekly OPTIMAL sessions
focuses on stress and anxiety management, this may not
be enough to address these challenging symptoms. As
discussed, only one of the eight Health Education Impact Questionnaire domains was found to be significant.

for self-management programmes these findings may indicate it does not reflect the aims of OPTIMAL.
There were no significant differences in healthcare
utilisation between the two groups, which likely reflects
the short follow-up period and lack of power to detect
such changes. To date, studies investigating the impact
of self-management programmes have reported inconsistent findings on healthcare utilisation [47,48]. When
improvements were noted, minimum follow-up was generally six months. However, healthcare utilisation is a
complex outcome and it may be appropriate for it to increase or decrease depending on baseline utilisation.
The programme content of OPTIMAL includes the development of effective communication skills and having
the confidence to discuss issues with healthcare professionals. Such skill development may not necessarily result in decreased utilization, but may result in more
efficient and effective use of services which may take
time to develop and stabilise.
Both, the Stanford Chronic Disease Self-Management
Programme and the UK Expert Patient Programme are
either peer-led or have a combination of professional
and peer led sessions, whereas OPTIMAL is completely
professionally led by occupational therapists with no
peer leadership roles. Although the benefits of peer support are frequently reported, such as sharing of experiences and feelings of empowerment, there are potential
adverse effects, such as how peer support can increase
feelings of isolation if participants perceive their peers as
having dissimilar lifestyles [49]. Individual negativity in
the group can adversely impact on group dynamics and
increase the potential for negative social comparisons
[49]. Another identified disadvantage of peer-led groups
is a lack of control over interactions in the group, providing no guarantee that the support given is beneficial
[50]. Professionally-led groups can address these potential difficulties while also harnessing the potential benefits of peer support and interactions, and have also been
found to be effective in other areas such as cardiac and
pulmonary rehabilitation [51-53].
As outlined in the results, low attendance was an issue
and a number of participants missed sessions. In other
self-management programme studies the number of participants per group ranged from 8 to 15 [13,54]. Initially
the aim in this study was to recruit a minimum of 10
participants for each group, however due to lower than
anticipated recruitment rates and low attendance six or
less participants consistently attended each of the three
separate programmes. The time between baseline data
collection and group commencement (up to eight weeks
later) may have been a contributing factor to nonattendance. Of the 26 participants in the intervention
group, 20 (77%) attended one session and 16 (62%)
attended 3 or more sessions. A Cochrane review found
similar results, finding that between 51% and 87% of layled self-management programme participants attended
at least half the self-management programme sessions,
and between 8% and 29% never attended any sessions
[55]. A larger study is needed to assess the effect of attendance on outcomes, and examine differences based
on age, gender and whether participants are engaged in
paid employment.
This was a pragmatic feasibility trial that included patients commonly seen in clinical practice and referral to
the study was designed to reflect current referral pathways for additional primary care services. However, due
to the relatively short timeframe involved in undertaking
the study, this may have led to some selection bias as clinicians may have been more likely to refer patients that
were better known to them. On the other hand, this
does reflect the pragmatic nature of the study as this is
how referral would operate were the OPTIMAL intervention to be normalised into routine practice. A further
limitation of this research is its small sample size and
short follow-up period. Hence, it is not possible to ascertain whether benefits were sustained over time. Additionally, study participants were aware of their group
allocation and some participant ascertainment bias may
have occurred. A further limitation relates to the lack of
blinding of outcome assessors. This is challenging in trials
testing complex interventions as participants are likely to
talk about their intervention experiences but this could be
addressed in a larger trial with more resources for independent data collection. A strength of the OPTIMAL
intervention is that it requires minimal training and resources to deliver and could be used in any primary care
setting where occupational therapists are available. It is
also possible that other primary care professionals could
lead this programme with appropriate training and this
would improve OPTIMAL generalizability across settings.
Conclusion
This study has provided preliminary evidence that OPTIMAL is effective in improving a range of outcomes for individuals with multimorbidity and contributes towards the
evidence base on the effectiveness of interventions for
people with multimorbidity. We now need a definitive
trial that will test the cost effectiveness and sustainability
of the OPTIMAL programme over a longer time period
and across a wider range of primary care settings.
