Abstract
Background: Home telehealth programs often focus on a single
disease, yet many patients who need monitoring have multiple
conditions. This study evaluated secondary outcomes from a clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of home telehealth to improve
outcomes of patients with co-morbid diabetes and hypertension.
Subjects and Methods: A single-center randomized controlled
clinical trial compared two remote monitoring intensity levels (low
and high) and usual care in patients with type 2 diabetes and
hypertension being treated in primary care. Secondary outcomes
assessed were knowledge (diabetes, hypertension, medications),
self-efficacy, adherence (diabetes, medications), and patient perceptions of the intervention mode. Results: Knowledge scores improved in the high-intensity intervention group participants, but
upon further analysis, we found the intervention effect was not
mediated by gain in knowledge. No significant differences were
found across the groups in self-efficacy, adherence, or patient
perceptions of the intervention mode. Conclusions: Home telehealth
can enhance detection of key clinical symptoms that occur between
regular physician visits. While our intervention improved glycemic
and blood pressure control, the mechanism of the effect for this
improvement was not clear.

Introduction
Diabetes mellitus (DM) and hypertension (HTN) are prevalent and costly illnesses. Self-management support can be
provided by using home-based technologies (i.e., remote
monitoring) to enable healthcare professionals to monitor
patients more routinely than is possible through face-to-face office
visits. Prior work has evaluated the use of remote monitoring to manage
DM,1,2 but most projects have focused on single-disease populations.
The data reported in this article are drawn from a randomized controlled clinical trial that evaluated the efficacy of a low- and highintensity remote monitoring intervention compared with usual care for
improving outcomes of patients with co-morbid DM and HTN.3 This
article reports on patient outcomes of knowledge, self-efficacy, and
adherence and patient perceptions of the technology.
Subjects and Methods
Details of the clinical trial are reported elsewhere.3 In brief, the
parent study was a single-center randomized controlled clinical trial
design comparing three groups, two remote monitoring intensity
levels and usual care, with respect to improvement in hemoglobin
A1c (A1c) and systolic blood pressure (SBP) in participants with comorbid DM and HTN. The local institutional review board approved
the study prior to data collection.
The study was conducted at the Iowa City VA Medical Center,
which provides primary, secondary, and tertiary medical, surgical,
psychiatric, and neurological care to more than 36,000 veterans residing in eastern Iowa and western Illinois. The target population
comprised patients with Type 2 DM and HTN being treated by a VA
primary care provider. Patients were mailed a study invitation letter
in advance of a scheduled primary care appointment that included a
description of the study, a copy of the consent form, and contact
information for study personnel; letters were followed up with a
phone call from study staff. Study nurses met with patients who
expressed interest at a scheduled Primary Care Clinic appointment to
review the study and obtain written informed consent. Three hundred
two subjects were randomized to three groups: 107 to usual care, 102
to the low-intensity group, and 93 to the high-intensity group. Of
these, 85% (n = 257) completed 6-month data collection, and 81%
(n = 246) completed 12-month data collection.
The intervention combined close surveillance via a home telehealth device and nurse care management over a 6-month time period. The home telehealth device (Viterion; Bayer/Panasonic) used a

standard telephone line to enable data transmission between the
patient’s home and the study center. Using the device, intervention
participants in both groups manually entered blood pressure (BP) and
blood glucose (BG) measurements. In addition to uploading BG and
BP, each day the high-intensity group received health information
tips and questions using a branching algorithm programmed into the
device that focused on diet, exercise, smoking cessation, foot care,
advice for sick days, medications, weight management, preventive
care, and behavior modification and lifestyle adjustments. The lowintensity group uploaded BG and BP and responded to two daily
questions but did not receive the informational tips and questions
from the algorithm. Participants received appropriate automated
responses depending on how they answered the device prompt, individualized messages from the study nurses, or follow-up telephone
or mailed information as needed. Usual-care subjects were followed
in the Primary Care Clinic per standard protocol and had access to a
nurse care manager employed by the Medical Center.
Data were collected at baseline, 6 months (end of intervention
period), and 12 months (to determine maintenance of outcomes
following completion of the intervention).
MEASURES
Baseline demographic information included age, gender, race,
education, marital status, and body mass index. We also asked
whether participants received assistance in managing their illness
(for example, preparing meals, setting up medications, measuring
BG/BP, transportation assistance).
Knowledge was assessed in two ways. First, we used a 16-item
multiple choice test focused on DM and HTN. The test contained 13
items specific to DM developed by a co-investigator (M.A.) for a
clinical diabetes education program; we added 3 items on hypertension. The test was administered at baseline and at 6 and 12
months. One point was assigned for each correct answer; thus scores
could range from 0 to 16. Second, we asked participants about
medications, an important variable affecting control of DM and HTN.
At baseline, 6 months, and 12 months participants were asked, ‘‘Do
you understand what your medications are for and their side effects?’’
This question was scored as percentage correct responses.
Self-efficacy was measured using the Self-Efficacy to Manage Disease in General scale.4 This scale contains 5 items that rate the patient’s
confidence in managing a chronic illness using Likert-type scale responses. Developed by the Stanford Patient Education Research Center,
initial scale items were constructed using items from existing measures,
investigator experience, and focus groups. The scale was tested using
multitrait scaling in a large sample of health maintenance organization
clinic patients (n = 1,130). All item-scale correlations (internal consistency reliability) exceeded 0.50. Scores range from 1 to 10, with higher
scores indicating greater confidence in managing disease.
Adherence was measured in two ways. First, we used a validated
DM regimen adherence scale5 that addresses medication, diet,
exercise, and BG testing. This scale was validated in a sample of 181
patients (95% white, 46% male, 60% type 1 DM). All 6 items were
combined into one scale score with moderate reliability (alpha =
0.73). Each item is measured using a scale that ranges from 1 = never
to 5 = always adherent. Mean scores were calculated for each participant; higher scores indicate greater adherence with recommendations. Because the Edwards Regimen Adherence Scale5 only
addressed DM and because medications are an important therapy
for HTN, at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months participants were
asked, ‘‘Are you taking your medications as prescribed?’’ Adherence
scores represent the proportion of medications for which the responses agreed with the directions for use on the VA Pharmacy
medication profile. This approach has been successfully used in prior
studies and was found to be comparable to examining the timeliness
of medication refills.6
Perceptions of the technology were assessed using the Telemedicine Patient Questionnaire (TMPQ).7 Participants in the two
intervention groups completed this home telehealth-specific survey
at the end of the 6-month intervention period. The survey is a 17-item
instrument with Likert-type scales. Each item was rated on a scale
from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). In preliminary testing
on 32 patients, a 20-item form of the instrument had acceptable
reliability (Cronbach’s alpha of 0.8), but three items were redundant.
The revised 17-item instrument tested on 10 patients had high test–
retest reliability (r = 0.98).
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Data were double-entered, and discrepancies were reconciled.
Descriptive statistics were calculated for continuous variables, and
the three groups were compared using analysis of variance with respect to demographics. Data for the three groups were compared
using Kruskal–Wallis tests for receipt of assistance, knowledge, selfefficacy, and adherence. TMPQ scores between the low- and highintensity groups were compared using a t test.
Results
Study subjects were mostly male (98%), white (96%), and married
(66%) with a mean age of 68 years (standard deviation = 10 years;
range, 40–89 years). Most had a high school education or higher
(89%). Body mass index was high across all participants at baseline
(33.9, 33.1, and 33.2 kg/m2 for control and low- and high-intensity
groups, respectively). There were no statistically significant differences across the three groups for any baseline measure.
Intervention subjects (low and high intensity) had significantly
decreased A1c during the 6-month intervention period compared
with the control group, but 6 months after the intervention was
withdrawn the intervention groups were comparable with the control
group. For SBP the high-intensity subjects had a significant decrease
in SBP compared with the other groups at 6 months, and this pattern
was maintained at 12 months.
Regarding questions on assistance received, in response to the
question, ‘‘Do you have someone who helps take care of your DM
and/or HTN,’’ 131 participants (45%) responded yes; of those,
most helpers were spouses (n = 112). Of all 302 respondents, the
percentages of those receiving help were as follows: preparing meals,
33% (n = 101); setting up medications, 15% (n = 45); help with

transportation, 15% (n = 44); measuring BP, 11% (n = 33); and measuring BG, 7% (n = 20), indicating a relatively independent group of
participants. There were no significant differences across groups for
these tasks.
Knowledge scores using the multiple-choice test were comparable at baseline. There were significant differences at 6 months,
with the high-intensity group scoring higher compared with the
other two groups (see Knowledge scores in Table 1); however,
these differences were not maintained at 12 months. In our previous work we found that change-score means for A1c at 6
months and for SBP at 6 and 12 months statistically differed
between the intervention groups ( p = 0.03, 0.004, and 0.02, respectively).3 Motivated by the significant associations between
knowledge score outcomes and intervention group, we investigated if the significant outcome–intervention associations might
be mediated by knowledge. Specifically, we investigated if the
effect of the intervention on change in SBP from baseline to 6
months was mediated by the change in composite knowledge
between baseline and 6 months, and whether the effect of the
intervention on change in SBP from baseline to 12 months was
mediated by the change in composite knowledge from baseline to
either 6 or 12 months.
We tested for mediation by estimating three linear regression
models: (1) composite knowledge change score on intervention; (2)
SBP change score on intervention; and (3) SBP change score on
intervention and composite knowledge change score. According to
Baron and Kenny,8 composite knowledge change score is a mediator
if there are significant associations from the first two regressions and
if the association between SBP and intervention in the third regression, adjusted for composite knowledge, is noticeably decreased in
comparison with the (unadjusted) association between SPB and intervention in the second model.
From estimating the first regression model we found that 6-month
and 12-month composite knowledge change-score variables were
significantly associated with the 12-month SBP change-score variable, but 6-month composite knowledge change was not associated
with 6-month SBP change. From our previous work we had already
estimated the second regression model and found both 6- and 12-
month SBP change to be significantly associated with intervention.
Based on these results we need only consider if 6- and 12-month
knowledge change is a mediator for 12-month SBP change for the
third regression model. We regressed 12-month SBP on intervention
and 6-month composite knowledge change, and we regressed 12-
month SBP on intervention and 12-month composite knowledge
change. For both of the estimated models, intervention remained
significantly associated with 12-month SBP ( p = 0.007 and 0.02, respectively, for the intervention effect, corresponding to having 6- and
12-month knowledge change in the model). Because the intervention
p values for Model 3 are similar to those for Model 2, we conclude that
the intervention effect was not mediated by gain in knowledge.
Regarding medication knowledge, on average, participants in all
three groups could correctly list all of their current medications (data
not shown), but slightly fewer than 90% of participants in each group
correctly reported the purpose and side effects of their medications
(see Medication knowledge in Table 1). However, there were no significant differences across the three groups in medication knowledge
at any time point.
Self-efficacy scores were higher in the control and low-intensity
groups compared with the high-intensity group at all three measurement points (baseline, 6 months, and 12 months (Table 1).
However, none of these differences was significant.
Scores on the Edwards Regimen Adherence Scale were not significantly different across groups at any of the three time points
(Table 1). Reported medication adherence was high across the groups

OUTCOMES OF A HOME TELEHEALTH INTERVENTION

at all three times points, but there were no significant differences
across the three groups (see Medication-taking adherence in Table 1).
Comparing only the low- and high-intensity intervention participants, there were no significant differences between the two
groups in TMPQ scores (low-intensity mean = 3.8; high-intensity
mean = 3.7).
Discussion
Although the intervention subjects had improved A1c at 6 months
and the high-intensity subjects had a significant decrease in SBP at
both 6 and 12 months, there were few differences across the groups in
knowledge, and knowledge did not act as a mediator in explaining
the intervention effect. There were no differences in self-efficacy or
adherence across the groups at any time point.
The high-intensity group received daily educational tips and a
greater number of DM and HTN questions daily, and knowledge
scores in this group improved significantly at 6 months. Although we
did not directly ask participants if they incorporated information
from the daily information and questions to make changes in their
disease management, the high-intensity group improved in both A1c
and SBP at 6 months and maintained improvement in SBP at 12
months. DM education is beneficial and cost-effective9 but is generally not sufficient alone to change health behaviors. Interventions
using regular reinforcement, such as this study where participants
sent data on a daily basis and received feedback, may be more effective in improving glycemic control.10
Self-efficacy did not improve significantly during the study, even
though study nurses used self-efficacy enhancement strategies during the contacts with the intervention participants. Self-efficacy
scores in our sample were relatively high at baseline (ranging from
7.6 to 8.1 on a 10-point scale); thus there was little room for improvement. Other studies in veterans have found an association between higher self-efficacy and better adherence to diabetes
management behaviors such as medications, exercise, and a low fat
diet.11 Thus we believe that interventions focused on enhancing selfefficacy warrant further attention.
Studies have shown an association between adherence and
patient–provider communication.12 Prior work in a similar nonveteran population found that adherence with antihypertensive
medication was associated with patient–provider communication
(i.e., nonadherent participants reported discomfort asking questions
and were more likely to report that healthcare visits were stressful).13 Another study, conducted in the veteran population, found
that collaborative and proactive communication between patients
and providers was associated with improved HTN control in patients with diabetes, independent of medication adherence.14 Studies assessing the relationship between outcomes such as
adherence and communication with clinicians have almost exclusively focused on physicians. Healthcare is increasingly adopting
alternatives to the traditional office visit such as disease-focused
collaboratives15 and the patient-centered medical home where the
roles of nonphysician providers such as nurses and pharmacists are
being expanded to include chronic disease management. Our participants reported relatively high adherence with their self-management regimen and especially with medication-taking behavior
throughout the study period, but the role of nurse–patient communication in enhancing adherence in this sample is not clear.
Given the expanding role of nurses and pharmacists in chronic
disease management approaches such as the patient-centered
medical home, future studies should focus on how communication
with providers other than physicians affect adherence in patients
with chronic disease.
Although the high-intensity group received more information and
questions daily on the home telehealth device, there were no differences between the two intervention groups in perceptions of the
intervention using TMPQ scores. Intervention participants rated the
program positively with a few criticisms and suggestions for improvement mostly related to the technology.16 These findings are
consistent with perceptions of participants enrolled in the VA remote
monitoring program.17
In conclusion, participants in both intervention groups improved glycemic control, and the high-intensity group also improved
BP control. Although knowledge scores improved in the highintensity group, it is unlikely that improved knowledge was the sole
reason for improvement in clinical outcomes, and our mediation
analysis supports that conclusion. Home telehealth can facilitate
detection of key clinical symptoms that occur between regular physician visits. Several studies have evaluated the effectiveness of home
telehealth in chronic disease management, and results have been
mixed.1,2 Thus, the mechanism of effect for improvement in our study
is not clear. Future studies should provide detailed descriptions of
intervention components in order to determine how and why these
interventions work.
