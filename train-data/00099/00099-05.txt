Objective: The Resources for Health trial evaluates a social-ecologically based lifestyle (physical activity
and diet) intervention targeting low-income, largely Spanish-speaking patients with multiple chronic
conditions. Design: A randomized controlled trial was conducted with 200 patients recruited from an
urban community health center and assigned to intervention and usual care conditions. Intervention
involved 2 face-to-face, self-management support and community linkage sessions with a health
educator, 3 follow-up phone calls, and 3 tailored newsletters. Main Outcome Measures: Primary
outcomes measured at 6-months were changes in dietary behavior and physical activity. Changes in
multilevel support for healthy living were evaluated as a secondary outcome. Results: After adjustment
for age, sex, language, and number of chronic conditions, significant intervention effects were observed
for dietary behavior and multilevel support for healthy lifestyles but not for physical activity. Conclusion: The Resources for Health intervention provides an effective and practical model for improving
health behavior among low-income, Spanish-speaking patients with multiple chronic conditions.

There is widespread agreement that patient involvement in
disease management (referred to as self-management or collaborative management) is required for control of chronic disease and
for prevention of disease complications (Von Korff, Glasgow, &
Sharpe, 2002; Wagner & Groves, 2002). For the majority of
chronic conditions, this involves addressing multiple behavioral
risk factors (i.e., physical activity, diet, smoking and alcohol), as
well as monitoring and managing the signs of symptoms of disease, taking medications appropriately, maintaining regular contact with health care providers, and managing emotional and social
sequelae (Clark, Becker, Lorig, Rakowski, & Anderson, 1991;
Lorig et al., 1999; Wagner, 2001).
The past two decades have witnessed a wealth of research
demonstrating the efficacy of chronic disease self-management
interventions (Barlow, Wright, Sheasby, Turner, & Hainsworth,
2002; Goldstein, Whitlock, & DePue, 2004; Norris et al., 2002;
Von Korff, Gruman, Schaefer, & Curry, 1997). These interventions have most often focused on key lifestyle behaviors, and on
medication adherence, and have targeted patients with a range of
chronic conditions, with an emphasis on asthma, arthritis, and
diabetes (Barlow, Wright, Sheasby, Turner, & Hainsworth, 2002).
Despite the growing evidence base, some key gaps remain. The
better part of this literature has focused on White, middle class
samples, thus telling us little about how best to deliver chronic
disease self-management interventions to low-income, ethnic minority and underserved patients, who bear the largest burden of
disease and often have more than one chronic condition and
multiple self-management behaviors that need to be addressed

Glasgow, & Mason, 2002; Institute of Medicine Committee on
Quality of Health Care in America, 2001). Members of these
special populations often do not or cannot access traditional health
care settings where self-management supports are more likely to
be offered (Brown, Long, Gould, Weitz, & Milliken, 2000;
Levkoff & Sanchez, 2003; Sorensen et al., 2003).
Self-management interventions have largely been guided by
intervention models that emphasize the individual, often ignoring
the socialenvironmental context in which patients live (Glasgow
& Eakin, 2000; Orleans, 2000; Sorensen et al., 2003). In addition,
the evaluation of self-management interventions has tended to
occur in the context of efficacy trials with an emphasis on issues
of internal validity. The conduct of practical behavioral trials that
address the generalizability of findings, the reach and representativeness of study participants, the feasibility of implementation in
the real-world context of primary care, and the institutionalization
of interventions at the systems level, lags far behind (Glasgow,
Bull, Gillette, Klesges, & Dzewaltowski, 2002; Glasgow, Davidson, Dobkin, Ockene, & Spring, 2006; Glasgow, Klesges, Dzewaltowski, Bull, & Estabrooks, 2004).
The Resources for Health study evaluates a physical activity and
diet intervention targeting low-income, largely Spanish-speaking
patients with multiple chronic conditions. It adds to the literature
on self-management interventions by: (a) targeting an underserved,
minority subgroup; (b) extending the largely individually focused
interventions in this area to include an emphasis on participants’
social environment consistent with the socialecological model;
(c) addressing multiple risk behaviors in patients with multiple
comorbid conditions; and (d) using the RE-AIM framework
(reach, efficacy, adoption, implementation, maintenance) (Glasgow, Vogt, & Boles, 1999) to guide an approach to evaluation of
outcomes that balances both internal and external validity in the
context of a practical behavioral trial.
Method
Study Design
This was a randomized controlled trial of a lifestyle intervention
evaluating short-term (6 weeks) and medium-term (6 months)
outcomes on the primary behavioral targets of physical activity,
dietary behavior, and the secondary outcome of multilevel support
for healthy lifestyles. Participants were randomly assigned to intervention or usual care conditions, with stratification on gender
and primary language.
Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval was initially received from the AMC Cancer Research Center IRB in January
2001 and renewed by the Colorado Multiple IRB (COMIRB #
02-789) in December 2002.
Setting and Participants
The study was conducted at Clinica Campesina Family Health
Services, a community health center that provides primary health
care services to low-income and medically underserved individuals in the Denver Metro area. The study took place at the urban
North Denver clinic, the one with the largest percentage of
Spanish-speaking clientele. Although the acculturation of the sample was not formally assessed, the sample is primarily Spanish
speaking, and the population served by Clinica Campesina have
generally spent fewer than 5 years living in the United States.
While there are other measures of acculturation that are more
precise (Cuellar, Arnold, & Maldonado, 1995), researchers have
commonly used both English language and number of years of
U.S. residency as a proxy for acculturation (Bethel & Schenker,
2005; Grunbaum, Kann, & Kinchen, 2004; Minnis & Padian,
2001).
Study participants were adults with greater than one or more
chronic conditions for which a lifestyle intervention focused on
physical activity and diet would be appropriate (i.e., hypertension,
chronic pain, hypercholesterolemia, depression, type 2 diabetes,
osteoarthritis, obesity, chronic lung disease, heart disease, osteoporosis, hepatitis, history of cancer, previous stroke, multiple
sclerosis). Inclusion criteria were diagnosis of one or more chronic
conditions as above, age 30 years and over, having a telephone,
and not planning to move from the area during the study’s time
frame.
Recruitment
Study recruitment began in February 2002 and concluded in
August 2003. Names and contact information for all patients
meeting age and chronic condition eligibility criteria were obtained from the clinic medical records database (n  605). Letters
were sent from clinic providers to patients describing the study and
recommending their participation. Included with the letter was a
stamped, self-addressed postcard for patients to return to the clinic
if they wanted to decline being contacted about the study. Patients
for whom postcards had not been returned were followed up with
a phone call.
Recruitment calls were made by a bilingual research assistant,
with study consent and baseline data collected over the phone.
Randomization occurred following collection of baseline data and
was determined on the basis of a computer-generated randomization scheme and the opening of sequentially numbered envelopes.
Intervention
The conceptual framework underpinning the intervention was
based on a behavioralecological approach to chronic disease
self-management that emphasizes assessment, feedback, goal setting, and problem solving (Glasgow & Eakin, 2000), as well as on
socialecological theory with a focus on identification of multilevel/community supports for health behavior change (Green,
Richard, & Potvin, 1996; Stokols, 1992).
The intervention was culturally adapted and translated into
Spanish for an urban, low-income, largely Latino patient population (Riley, Glasgow, & Eakin, 2001). The adaptation included the
translation and validation of measures and intervention materials.
The intervention was conducted by an experienced, bilingual,
health educator, and involved two face-to-face visits (6090 min)
3 months apart, three follow-up phone calls, and three newsletters
tailored to the behavioral goals of each participant. The face-toface visits took place either at the clinic or in the participant’s
home, based on participant preference. Because of the very low
literacy levels of study participants, and the fact that some were not
able to read and write in either Spanish or English, the use of visual
aids was emphasized throughout the intervention.

The intervention protocol followed the 5 As approach advocated
in multiple behavioral risk factor interventions (Ask, Assess, Advise, Agree, Arrange; Glasgow et al., 2002; Glasgow, Toobert, &
Hampson, 1996; Goldstein et al., 2004). Participants received
education on national physical activity (U.S. Department of Health
and Human Services, 1996) and dietary recommendations (U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services and U.S. Department
of Agriculture, 2005) along with feedback from their baseline
assessment. Participants then chose a self-management goal related to physical activity or healthy eating, and— key to the emphasis on external resources—identified one or two types of
socialenvironmental resources they could use to help them reach
their goal (e.g., family and friends, health care team, neighborhood
resources). At the conclusion of the session, participants received
a one-page goal sheet summarizing their personal action plan.
At 2 and 6 weeks after the initial visit, the health educator made
a brief follow-up phone call to reinforce progress toward goal
attainment and to problem-solve barriers. During the second faceto-face visit, participants were encouraged to consider setting a
goal for the second target behavior. A third follow-up phone call,
the last point of contact, occurred 2 weeks after this visit to address
the goals and barriers again, and to discuss strategies for maintenance of behavior change, with an emphasis on use of multilevel
support resources. To reinforce behavior change goals, three tailored newsletters were mailed to participants over the course of the
6-month intervention. The low-literacyfocused newsletters reminded participants of their physical activity or diet goals, addressed participant-reported barriers and suggested examples of
multilevel support resources that could be used. Patients in the
usual care condition were mailed a local area community resources
guide and three newsletters on basic financial management (i.e.,
careers and employment, budgeting skills, and establishing credit).
Measures
The RE-AIM (Dzewaltowski, Glasgow, Klesges, & Estabrooks,
2004; Goldstein et al., 1999) framework was used to guide evaluation of study outcomes.
Reach. Reach was calculated as the percentage and representativeness of eligible patients who took part in the study. Patient
characteristics were assessed using a short set of self-reported
demographic items, including gender, age, education, income,
race, primary language, marital status, smoking status, and number
and type of chronic conditions.
Efficacy. Efficacy was evaluated by improvement from baseline on two primary outcome measures (physical activity and
dietary behavior) and one secondary outcome measure (multilevel
support for healthy lifestyles) at 6 weeks and 6 months. Data were
collected by a bilingual research assistant over the telephone.
Physical activity was measured using the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey Physical Activity items (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2000). This set of 15 items assesses
total minutes of vigorous and moderate activity and walking in the
past week and has been shown to correlate highly with other
measures of physical activity (Brownson et al., 2004; Brownson,
Jones, Pratt, Blanton, & Heath, 2000). Two physical activity
outcome variables were calculated: (a) total minutes of walking
per week (as walking is the preferred activity of most middle-aged
and older adults; Simpson et al., 2003), and (b) consistent with
U.S. physical activity guidelines, a dichotomous variable indicating whether participants met the guidelines (i.e., 30 min/day of
moderate physical activity on at least 5 days/week or 20 min/day
of vigorous activity on at least 3 days/week), although statistical
power was not based on this dichotomous variable. A Spanish
language version of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey Physical Activity items was obtained from the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention and was evaluated for face validity
and clarity during formative work for this trial.
Dietary behavior was measured using the Kristal Fat and Fiber
Behavior Questionnaire (FFB). The FFB is a 20-item scale measuring behaviors related to low-fat and high-fiber eating patterns.
Previous research has found this scale to be reliable and sensitive
to change and to correlate well with other “gold standard” measures such as food records and food frequency questionnaires
(Glasgow, Perry, Toobert, & Hollis, 1996; Kristal, Shattuck, &
Henry, 1990; Shannon, Kristal, Curry, & Beresford, 1997). A
Spanish-language version of the FFB was adapted for use in the
current study (Kristal, Shattuck, & Patterson, 1999). A total FFB
score was calculated, with scores ranging from 1.00 to 4.00, lower
scores indicating better fat and fiber-related dietary behavior.
Multilevel support for healthy lifestyles was measured using the
Chronic Illness Resource Survey (CIRS). The CIRS is a 22-item
scale that assesses support for healthy lifestyle behaviors and
chronic illness self-management from multiple sources including
family and friends, health care providers, neighborhood and community, media and health policies (Glasgow, Strycker, Toobert, &
Eakin, 2000; Glasgow, Toobert, Barrera, & Strycker, 2005). CIRS
subscale and total scores were calculated and ranged from 1.00 to
5.00, with higher scores indicating more support. The English
version of the CIRS had been previously validated (Glasgow et al.,
2000), and a Spanish version was validated during formative work
for this trial (Eakin et al., in press).
Adoption, implementation, and maintenance. Adoption was
measured by the number of clinics and providers approached who
agreed to participate in the trial. Implementation was measured by
tracking the delivery of the intervention protocol, including the
number of intervention sessions delivered, and the percentage of
patients setting goals on physical activity and dietary behavior
change. As this was a 6-month trial, longer-term maintenance of
outcomes was not assessed.
Statistical Analyses
General descriptive and bivariate statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS for Windows (Version 12.0.1, 2003, SPSS,
Chicago, IL) statistical software package. Continuous variables
were tested for normal distribution. Analyses were carried out on
an intention-to-treat basis. Significance was set at p  .05 (twotailed). Based on the sample size of 200, this study had 81% power
( p  .05) to detect an effect size of 0.20 on the two primary
behavioral targets (physical activity and dietary behavior) at 6
months.
We used independent sample t tests and Pearson’s chi-square
tests were used to assess differences between participants and
nonparticipants, the treatment group and usual care group, and
dropouts and completers. To examine changes between the treatment and usual care group over time, and to maximize the amount
of data that were used in the analysis, repeated measures analysis

of variance regression models, using a generalized estimating
equations approach, were carried out using the SUDAAN statistical package (Version 8.0.2, Cary, NC). Regression models were
adjusted for sex, age, language, and number of chronic conditions.
Subgroup analyses were also conducted to assess outcome measures for the intervention group, based on dose of intervention and
behavioral goals set, compared with the usual care group. The
alpha level was not adjusted for these secondary analyses.

Compared with nonparticipants, participants were more likely to
be female (data not shown). Complete data were available for 69%
of participants at 6 weeks and 81% at 6 months, and retention rates
did not differ significantly between intervention and usual care
groups. Women and Spanish speakers were more likely to complete study assessments compared with men and English speakers
(data not shown).
Baseline characteristics of participants randomized to the treatment group and those in usual care are shown in Table 1. Groups
differed significantly with respect to primary language and ethnicity, and although not statistically significant, there appeared to be
differences with respect to number of chronic conditions ( p
.08). The stratified, random assignment scheme did not result in
equal proportions of Spanish speakers in each study condition as
block randomization was not used and recruitment was stopped
earlier than anticipated because of limited resources.
Efficacy
Changes in dietary behavior, physical activity, and multilevel
support for healthy lifestyles between the groups over the three
time points are shown in Table 2. Scores were adjusted for sex,
age, language, and number of chronic conditions. A statistically
significant difference between the groups over time was evident
for dietary behavior, Wald F(2)  4.64, p  .011. The treatment
group showed a significantly greater improvement in dietary behavior compared to the usual care group at both 6 weeks (intervention effect  0.16  0.08, p  .031) and 6 months (intervention effect  0.18  0.06, p  .003). There were no
significant differences between groups over time for physical
activity when assessed as change in minutes walked per week,
Wald F(2)  2.04, p  .132, or as the percentage of those meeting
national physical activity guidelines, Wald F(2)  1.37, p  .505.
A statistically significant difference between the treatment and
usual care groups over time was observed for multilevel support
for healthy lifestyles (CIRS total score), Wald F(2)  8.23, p
.001. The treatment group reported significantly greater support at
both 6 weeks (intervention effect  0.32  0.08, p  .001) and 6
months (intervention effect  0.23  0.08, p  .003). Analysis of
changes for the individual CIRS subscales revealed significant
differences over time between the treatment and usual care groups
for the personal, Wald F(2)  9.67, p  .001, and family and

previously seen had disappeared, Wald F(2)  1.72, p  .182,
indicating that the CIRS mediated the observed change in dietary
behavior.
Adoption
All three of the community health center clinics of the Clinica
Campesina Family Health Services were approached for participation, and all agreed to participate, although because of limited
research resources, patients were recruited only from the largest of
the three clinics. In that clinic, all of the 12 providers agreed to
participate.
Implementation
Forty-eight (47.5%) of the 101 intervention condition participants received both intervention visits, 39 (38.6%) received only
one, and 14 (13.9%) were unable to be contacted for intervention
visits or phone calls. Forty-six (45.5%) received the intended three
follow-up phone calls, 29 (28.7%) received two calls, 9 (8.9%)
received one call, and a further 3 (3.0%) were never reached for
follow-up calls. During the intervention, 41 (40.6%) participants
set goals for physical activity only, 13 (12.9%) set diet goals only,
33 (32.7%) set both physical activity and diet goals, and 14
(13.9%) did not set any goals (because they were never reached for
intervention). Subgroup analyses to determine the effect of the
number of intervention contacts and the selection of behavioral
goals did not alter the results observed (data not shown).
Discussion
The Resources for Health trial, with its focus on improving
physical activity and dietary behavior in low-income and predominantly Spanish-speaking patients with multiple comorbid chronic
conditions, addresses a significant gap in the literature (Goldstein
et al., 2004). Taking the broader public health perspective of the
RE-AIM framework (Glasgow et al., 2004) allows the study results to be interpreted not only in terms of their immediate impact,
but also in terms of their potential for generalization.
Reach. Given the challenges of recruiting and retaining a
highly migratory, low-income, low literacy population, the ability
to (a) enroll 78% of those contacted and eligible and (b) retain 81%
at 6 months supports the feasibility of this approach. The overrepresentation of women and Spanish speakers suggests that recruitment efforts reached those most in need but also that it will take
more effort to engage Latino men in health behavior interventions.
Efficacy. Significant improvements occurred in one of two
primary outcome measures, namely dietary behavior, and in the
secondary outcome of multilevel support for healthy lifestyles. The
lack of change in physical activity was disappointing, but more
than likely reflects the difficulty in measuring physical activity via
a brief self-report instrument (Sallis & Saelens, 2000) and the
potentially limited sensitivity of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey Physical Activity population surveillance measure to detect change in the context of an intervention trial.
Adoption. The trial was clearly and strongly supported by the
community health care clinic in which it was conducted, as indicated by the 100% provider participation.
Implementation. This trial was challenging to implement, with
numerous missed and rescheduled appointments; however, overall
77% received at least three of the five intended intervention
contacts, again supporting the feasibility of the approach.
Maintenance. The medium-term (6-month) outcomes preclude evaluation of longer term maintenance of behavior change.
However, with regard to maintenance at the clinic/systems level,
the clinic intends to retain the study interventionist on staff as a
chronic disease health educator.
A strength of the study was the use of the socialecological
model to guide the intervention and broaden the focus to take into
account the multiple levels of influence on health behavior change
(Green, 2001; Stokols, 1996). This was not only implicit as an
underlying theory, but operationalized via the use of the CIRS to
provide feedback to participants and to assist with goal setting
around use of multilevel resources. The CIRS was also used as an
outcome measure, and one on which significant between-groups
change was observed. In addition, the CIRS also mediated the

interventionist; recruitment of Latino patients (primarily of Mexican descent) from a single clinic, which may limit the generalizability of findings; and the lack of longer term follow-up. The
sample size was also too small to allow for analyses of patients
nested within providers. However, providers were not involved in
the delivery of the intervention, and our previous work has shown
the intraclass correlations for the measures used in this study to be
extremely small (Glasgow et al., 1997).
Although there is a growing literature on health behavior interventions targeting Latinos, studies of interventions directly comparable to the chronic disease self-management approach of Resources for Health are few. Existing studies have often targeted
Latinas as the keepers of family health (Amaro & de la Torre,
2002) and have used a variety of intervention modalities, including
lay health advisors (or promotoras) to deliver intervention (Kim,
Koniak-Griffin, Flaskerud, & Guarnero, 2004; Navarro, Rock,
McNicholas, Senn, & Moreno, 2000; Swider, 2002) using print
and mass media (Nestle & Cowell, 1990; Wechsler & Wernick,
1992), as well as multiple modality approaches (Elder et al., 1998).
The most comparable study involved multiple health centers and
targeted multiethnic adults (a small percentage of whom were
Latino) around diet and physical activity (Emmons et al., 2005).
Like Resources for Health, it involved a session with a health
educator, follow-up phone calls, and tailored mailings; unlike
Resources for Health, it also involved clinicians providing a tailored health behavior change prescription. Similar to the present
findings, Emmons and colleagues (2005) found significant
changes in dietary behaviors, but not in physical activity, perhaps
suggesting that physical activity may be a more difficult behavior
to change in lower income, multiethnic subgroups.
A recent study based in the primary health care setting evaluated
a physical activity and dietary intervention that targeted primarily
Latinas 50 years of age and over recruited from community health
clinics and that delivered across three conditions: provider counseling; provider counseling and health education; and provider
counseling, health education, and community health worker support (Staten et al., 2004). At the 12-month follow-up, although
there were no significant between-groups differences, all three
groups showed an increase in physical activity, whereas women
receiving the comprehensive intervention were more likely to
make dietary changes. In an intervention to improve fat and fiber
targeting Latinas recruited via random digit dialing, Elder et al.
(2005) evaluated three conditions: lay health advisors plus tailored
materials, tailored materials only, or off-the-shelf print materials.
At 12-weeks postintervention, although there were no significant
differences between conditions, the lay health advisor condition
achieved significant improvements across a number of dietary
outcomes. In general these studies provide modest support for the
efficacy of health behavior interventions among Latinos but indicate that more needs to be done to elucidate the most effective
intervention modalities and to facilitate change across both diet
and physical activity behaviors.
The Resources for Health intervention was adapted for the
largely Latino sample from previous chronic disease selfmanagement interventions conducted by Glasgow and colleagues
that targeted primarily Caucasian samples (Riley, Glasgow, &
Eakin, 2001; Glasgow & Eakin, 2000). The Resources for Health
sample showed both poorer levels of health behaviors at baseline
and similar to or greater intervention effects for both fat- and
fiber-related dietary behavior (Glasgow et al., 1997; Glasgow &
Toobert, 2000; Kristal, Curry, Shattuck, Feng, & Li, 2000) and
multilevel support for healthy lifestyles (Glasgow et al., 2005).
This suggests that there is merit in adapting and evaluating existing
evidence-based primary-care-based health behavior interventions
with Latino and other high-risk subgroups (Goldstein et al., 2004;
O’Malley, Gonzalez, Sheppard, Huerta, & Mandelblatt, 2003).
Results of the Resources for Health trial suggest that a practical
and behaviorally focused, socialecological model driven intervention to enhance chronic disease self-management can be successfully delivered in a community health care context to lowincome, Spanish-speaking patients. Future research needs to
address generalization to other disadvantaged groups, longer term
maintenance of outcomes, and evaluate cost-effectiveness and
changes across multiple behavioral risk factors.
