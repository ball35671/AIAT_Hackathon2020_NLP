Abstract
Daily folic acid (FA) supplementation improves folate status, lowers circulating homocysteine (Hcy) concentrations, and
reduces the risk of neural tube defects. Little is known about the efficacy of weekly FA supplementation. The objective of
this study was to compare the efficacy of weekly and daily FA supplementations in improving folate and vitamin B-12
status and lowering Hcy concentrations in healthy reproductive-aged women. A randomized, double-blind supplementation trial was conducted in Guatemala. A total of 459 women were assigned randomly to 4 groups to receive weekly
(5000 or 2800 mg) or daily (400 or 200 mg) FA for 12 wk. Daily and weekly iron, zinc, and vitamin B-12 were also provided.
We determined serum and RBC folate by microbiological assays, but the latter was available only at baseline. Serum Hcy
and vitamin B-12 were also measured. We used generalized linear regression models to assess the effects of treatment
on biochemical indicators. Supplementation improved folate status similarly across all 4 groups. Overall, mean serum
folate concentrations increased by 15.4 nmol/L (95% CI: 13.8, 16.9) and the geometric mean serum Hcy concentration
decreased by 9.8% (95% CI: 212.3, 27.1). Daily supplementation improved serum vitamin B-12 by 20% (95% CI: 8, 33.2),
whereas weekly supplementation had no effect. In conclusion, weekly FA (either high or low dose) plus vitamin B-12 may
be as efficacious as daily supplementation in improving serum folate and lowering Hcy concentrations in healthy women of
reproductive age. J. Nutr. 138: 1491–1498, 2008.
Introduction
Neural tube defects (NTD),7 the most common and serious
forms of congenital malformations, are a public health problem
worldwide. It is estimated that ;0.1% of births or ;300,000
infants are affected globally each year (1). NTD contribute
considerably to the global burden of fetal and infant mortality,
morbidity, and disability.
Although there are no national data about folic acid (FA)
deficiency in Guatemala, different studies have reported a high
incidence of NTD (2,3), suggesting that FA deficiency is a
significant public health concern. The incidence of NTD is
particularly high in the western highlands of Quetzaltenango,
Guatemala, with an estimated rate of 106/10,000 live births (3).
Even though this rate is already high, it is substantially
underestimated because stillbirths, which are known to include
many malformations, were not considered. Vitamin B-12 deficiency is also common in Guatemala. A study of school children
in peri-urban areas of Guatemala reported that 11% had low
plasma vitamin B-12 and that an additional 22% had marginal
vitamin B-12 concentrations (4). Findings from a study in lactating women also showed that plasma vitamin B-12 was deficient or low in 46.7% of the mothers and was associated with
depletion of the vitamin in their infants (5). Additionally, ;60%
of childbearing age women in peri-urban areas of Guatemala
had low vitamin B-12 concentrations (6).
FA and vitamin B-12 play a critical role in the methylation pathways that convert homocysteine (Hcy) to S-adenosylmethionine,
a compound that has been shown to be involved in several
transmethylation reactions, including DNA methylation. Deficiency of FA can inhibit DNA biosynthesis or methylation
reactions, which in turn prevent the proper closure of the neural
tube during fetal development (7). In addition, deficiencies of FA

and/or vitamin B-12 can lead to high Hcy levels. Elevated Hcy is
a risk factor for various chronic diseases such as cardiovascular
and cognitive diseases (8,9). Furthermore, some studies report
associations between elevated Hcy and increased rates of
eclampsia and other poor pregnancy outcomes (10,11). Finally,
maternal Hcy concentrations may also play a role in the etiology
of fetal malformations such as NTD (12,13).
Several intervention studies have confirmed the efficacy of
daily supplementation of FA in improving folate status, lowering
Hcy concentrations, and reducing the risk of having a child with
NTD. A 4000-mg daily FA supplement has been shown to reduce
the risk of recurrence of NTD by 72% in a multicenter study
(14) and 400 mg FA taken daily has been proven to reduce the
risk of occurrence of NTD by 79% in the northern provinces and
by 41% in the southern provinces of China (15). However, daily
supplementation programs are likely to have low effectiveness
because of more complicated logistical factors and poorer
adherence. Little is known about whether weekly FA supplementation has the same impact on folate status as daily supplementation. One study of New Zealand women compared the
effect of weekly vs. daily FA supplementation (16,17) and
reported that a weekly FA supplement was as effective as a daily
supplement in lowering Hcy concentrations (16) but that weekly
was less effective than daily in improving folate status (17).
The objective of our study was to compare the efficacy of different regimens of FA supplementation, namely, very high-dose
weekly FA (5000 mg), high-dose weekly FA (2800 mg), high-dose
daily FA (400 mg), and low-dose daily FA (200 mg), in improving
folate and vitamin B-12 status and lowering Hcy concentrations
in healthy women of reproductive age in Guatemala.
Materials and Methods
Study site, study design, and sample size
Study site. The study was conducted in the village of Concepcio´ n,
Chiquirichapa, in the department of Quetzaltenango, Guatemala. This
village is located 2600 m above sea level and lies 40 km to the west of
Guatemala’s second largest city, Quetzaltenango. Village residents are
primarily of indigenous Mayan descent, particularly of the Mam culture,
and of low socioeconomic status (SES). The community is agrocentric
and key crops grown include potatoes and broccoli.
Design. The study design was approved by the Ethical Committee of
Hospital Roosevelt, Guatemala City, Guatemala and Emory University’s
Institutional Review Board, Atlanta, Georgia. There were 4 arms to the
double-blind, randomized trial (Table 1). The doses of FA were 400 and
200 mg for daily and 5000 and 2800 mg for weekly supplementation. The
400 mg daily was chosen because it is the current recommended dietary
allowance (RDA) for women of reproductive age for NTD risk reduction
(18) and the 200 mg daily was chosen because evidence from previous
studies shows improvement with this dose in folate status (19,20) and Hcy
levels (21,22). The 2800 mg weekly was a simple calculation of 7 times the
400-mg daily RDA, whereas the 5000 mg weekly was selected based on the
recommendation for women of reproductive age by the Guatemalan
Ministry of Public Health (23). Additionally, there was 1 daily and
1 weekly dose of iron sulfate, zinc sulfate, and vitamin B-12 (Table 1).
Supplementation lasted 12 wk, between March and June 2006.
Sample size. Women of childbearing age were selected for study. We
estimated that 100 women were required per group to detect a 0.4 SD
change in serum or RBC folate concentrations between baseline and
endpoint values for any 2 groups, at a power of 0.8 and significance level
of 0.05 (2-tailed test). Allowing for 15% attrition, this gave a target
sample size of 115 women per group (460 total).
Subject recruitment, randomization to treatment,
and compliance
A census of the community was conducted by trained personnel to
identify women between the ages of 15 and 49. Women were not
admitted into the study if any of the following conditions were present:
1) pregnancy; 2) lactation (having had a child within the last 3 mo); 3)
consumption of FA supplements; 4) chronic diseases that interfere with
FA metabolism; and 5) severe anemia (Hb , 70 g/L). Women with severe
anemia were provided 90 tablets containing 120 mg of iron for daily use
and referred to the local health clinic.
A total of 459 women were enrolled in the study. Computergenerated random numbers were used to assign women to 1 of 4
supplemental groups. Supplementation was double-blinded. All supplements were identical in appearance and taste and were coded with lot
numbers at the factory (Industrias Bioquı´micas), corresponding to 1 of 4
treatment arms. The code allocation was kept secure at Emory University
and was only revealed after completion of the trial. Trained field workers
from the community visited each woman 7 d/wk to deliver and observe
the ingestion of the supplements for the entire 12-wk duration of
supplementation. All women received 7 pills per week. The weekly dose
groups received 6 placebos and 1 active pill on the 3rd day of the week.
Daily records were kept to track the participants’ health. The trial was
registered in the U.S. NIH Clinical Trials registry (identification no.
NCT00394862).
Data collection
Blood collection. Venous blood samples were collected after overnight
fasting at baseline and at the end of 12 wk of supplementation. Venous
blood was centrifuged at 1500 3 g; 10 min at 4C. The serum was
separated and stored at 270C at the Institute of Nutrition of Central
America and Panama (INCAP) in Guatemala City until analysis at the
National Institute of Public Health, Cuernavaca, Mexico.
Dietary intake information. We collected dietary intake information at
baseline using a semiquantitative FFQ developed by INCAP. This FFQ
was shown to be valid for use in Guatemalan adults (24), and was
adapted for use in the Mam indigenous region.
Other data collection. Participants were interviewed at baseline for
information on their demographic background, level of education,
current marital status, reproductive history, and health status. SES was
assessed at baseline using a structured questionnaire that included
questions related to household size, occupation, and educational level of
the participants, water and sanitation, and household possessions. All
interviewers were bilingual in Mam and Spanish and interviews were
conducted in Mam or Spanish as required.
Laboratory analysis
Serum and RBC folate were determined by microbiological assays
(25,26). The CV for this assay was #16%. Unfortunately, the samples
intended for analyses of endpoint RBC folate concentrations were
improperly prepared such that reliable measures could not be obtained.
We measured serum vitamin B-12 using the nefelometric immunoassay
reactive kit (27). The CV for this method was between 5 and 10%.
Serum Hcy was measured by HPLC and flourometric detection (27,28).
The intra-assay CV of this assay was ,6%.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed based on 370 subjects who provided
both baseline and endpoint blood samples. Data were checked for

normal distribution using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test of normality.
Log transformation was used to normalize the distribution of serum
Hcy and vitamin B-12 values. Baseline characteristics across treatment
groups were compared using ANOVA and the Kruskal-Wallis tests
for continuous variables and chi-square analyses for categorical variables. Descriptive values were expressed as mean 6 SD for continuous
variables, and as median (inter-quartile range) for dietary intake. A
socioeconomic index was created using principal components analysis
according to the method used in Demographic Health Surveys and
INCAP studies (29,30). Compliance was calculated as the number of
tablets consumed divided by the total number of tablets provided. The
effect of treatment on serum folate, Hcy, and vitamin B-12 was assessed
using a generalized linear regression model (SAS Proc Mixed procedures)
assuming unstructured correlation to account for the correlation among
the repeated observations for a given subject (31), using treatment as a
fixed factor and time as a covariate. The between-subjects factor was 4
treatment types and the within-subjects factor was treatment effects
(from start to finish of supplementation). Between-group differences in
treatment effect would be indicated by a significant interaction between
treatment effect and treatment type. This is obtained by fitting the model
below:
Outcome ¼ b0 1 b1 3 time 1 b2 3 treatment 1 b3 3 time
3 treatment 1 Bi 3 other covariates:
Furthermore, we investigated whether the effects of supplementation
varied depending on initial folate, vitamin B-12, and Hcy status.
Differences between baseline and endpoint values were expressed as
percentages rather than absolute values for Hcy and vitamin B-12
because of the log transformation. All statistical tests were 2-tailed and
differences were considered significant at P , 0.05. We used SAS software, version 9.1, for statistical analysis (32).
Results
Trial profile. Of the 682 women initially identified by the recruitment census, 223 were excluded prior to randomization for
the following reasons: refusal to participate (n ¼ 67), cohabitation with another screened woman (n ¼ 119), failure to keep
the appointment for randomization and blood collection (n ¼
36), and pregnancy (n ¼ 1). A total of 459 women were
randomized into 4 treatment groups and 422 (92%) finished the
trial (Fig. 1). Thirty-seven subjects withdrew from the study
(8 from the group receiving 5000 mg FA weekly, 7 from the
group receiving 2800 mg FA weekly, 17 from the group receiving
400 mg FA daily, and 5 from the group receiving 200 mg FA
daily). The daily 400 mg FA group had a higher dropout rate
compared with the 3 other groups (P ¼ 0.017). Reasons for
attrition varied: 6 women became pregnant; 4 women moved
outside of the village; 3 women refused to participate stating
they were inconvenienced by the daily visits; 4 women were
forbidden to participate by their husbands and/or relatives; 11
women complained about gastric discomfort and withdrew; 3
women complained about other side effects such as headaches,
nausea, and dizziness and therefore withdrew; and 6 women
withdrew because of hospitalization for nonsupplementationrelated health problems. Those not continuing in the study had
similar socioeconomic and anthropometric characteristics compared with those who completed the study (P . 0.05; results not
shown). Baseline biochemical measures did not differ significantly by intervention group (n ¼ 422 women who completed
the intervention; P . 0.05; results not shown). Of these 422

participants, 370 or 88% provided both baseline and endpoint
blood samples; 52 people refused to give blood at the end of
intervention. Analyses were performed based on the 370
subjects with both baseline and endpoint values. Data available
included 354 subjects at baseline and 351 at endpoint for serum
folate; 344 subjects at baseline for RBC folate; 356 at baseline
and 359 at endpoint for serum Hcy; and 339 at baseline and 343
at endpoint for serum vitamin B-12. Reasons for missing
biochemical determinations were that some samples were
hemolyzed or that not enough was available for laboratory
analysis. Subjects included in the analyses had similar baseline
characteristics compared with subjects not included (P . 0.05;
results not shown).
Background characteristics. The age of the study subjects was
31.1 6 9.3 y (range, 15–49 y). Almost all of the women
identified themselves as Mam and spoke Mam as their first
language. The years of schooling were 5.8 6 3.8, with 79.2% of
subjects having ,10 y of schooling. More than one-quarter of
the study subjects were single, 28.8% were married, 35% were
in a common law marriage, and 9.2% were single, divorced, or
widowed.
The treatment groups did not differ in age, education, SES,
weight, height, BMI, and compliance (Table 2). Reported
median intakes of energy and nutrients (folate, vitamin B-12,
vitamin B-6, iron, and zinc) were similar among treatment
groups. The median intakes of these nutrients for the study
population were lower than the RDA, with 58.7% not meeting
the RDA for folate (400 mg/d), 63.3% not meeting the RDA for
vitamin B-12 (2.4 mg/d), and 66.0% not meeting the RDA for
vitamin B-6 (1.3 mg/d) (18).
The overall baseline serum folate concentration was 31.7 6
12.1 nmol/L; 11 subjects (3.1%) had very low serum folate
(,6.8 nmol/L) and another 25 subjects (7.1%) had marginally
low serum folate (6.8–13.4 nmol/L). The overall mean baseline
RBC folate was 436.8 6 169.9 nmol/L and 77 subjects (22.4%)
were folate deficient (RBC folate ,317 nmol/L). The overall
baseline geometric mean of serum vitamin B-12 was 332.1 pmol/L
(95% CI: 304.8–361.8). Using the cutoff suggested by Caterline
et al. (5), 55 subjects (16.2%) were vitamin B-12 deficient (,148
pmol/L) and 46 subjects (13.6%) had low concentrations of
vitamin B-12 (range, 148–221 pmol/L).The overall baseline
geometric mean Hcy concentration was 8.3 mmol/L (95% CI:
8.1–8.6). Using the cutoff by Selhub et al. (33), 14 subjects
(3.9%) were hyperhomocysteinemic (Hcy $ 14.4 mmol/L) and
another 43 subjects (12.08%) were on the borderline of elevated
Hcy concentrations (11.4–14.3 mmol/L). Baseline RBC folate
and serum folate, vitamin B-12, and Hcy concentrations did not
differ among the groups (Table 2).
Efficacy of the trial. Serum folate and Hcy concentrations
changed in all 4 groups (P , 0.0001), but the changes did not
differ among the groups (P for interaction ¼ 0.66 and 0.98,
respectively) (Table 3). Overall, serum folate concentrations
increased by 15.4 nmol/L (95% CI: 13.8, 16.9) and the
geometric mean Hcy concentrations decreased by 9.8% (95%
CI: –12.3, –7.1). The serum vitamin B-12 concentration
increased significantly across all 4 treatment groups, but the

increase did not differ among the groups (P ¼ 0.49). When
categorized as weekly and daily vitamin B-12 supplementation
groups, the daily groups had a significant increase of 20% (95%
CI: 8.0, 33.2; P , 0.01), whereas there was no change in the
weekly group (P ¼ 0.48) (8.1%; 95% CI: 22.7, 20.1). However,
the changes in the daily and weekly groups did not differ (P ¼
0.17). Overall, the geometric mean serum vitamin B-12 concentrations increased by 14.1% (95% CI: 5.9, 22.9).
Because experimental groups did not differ, we pooled the
data for further analyses. Women with a low initial serum folate
concentration responded to treatment with larger increases in
serum folate than those in subjects with high initial folate
concentrations (Table 4). Serum folate concentrations increased
by 39.8 nmol/L (95% CI: 32.1, 47.6) and 36.1 nmol/L (95% CI:
30.9, 41.2) for those with folate deficiency or marginal
deficiency at baseline, respectively, but only increased by 13.0
nmol/L (95% CI: 11.5, 14.4) for those with normal baseline
serum folate concentrations. Similarly, women with high concentrations of Hcy at baseline showed the greatest reduction in
Hcy after intervention with a mean decrease of 45.0% (95% CI:
251.8, 237.3) compared with a decrease of 22.1% (95% CI:
227.7, 216.0) for women with marginally high Hcy concentrations and no significant change for those with normal Hcy
concentrations (5.6%; 95% CI: 28.2, 2.9). The changes in
vitamin B-12 also depended on baseline vitamin B-12 status.
Women with baseline vitamin B-12 deficiency showed the
greatest improvement in vitamin B-12 after intervention with a
mean increase of 81.5% (95% CI: 52.9, 115.5). Women with

Discussion
The folate status of all 4 experimental groups improved significantly and to a similar extent. To our knowledge, the only other
randomized controlled trial comparing the effects of weekly vs.
daily FA supplementation on folate and Hcy status in reproductive age women was conducted in New Zealand (16,17). In that
study, researchers compared the efficacy of 2800 mg weekly to
that of 400 mg daily FA supplementation in women of reproductive age. Their results showed that 2800 mg FA weekly was as
effective as 400 mg FA daily in lowering Hcy concentrations, but
weekly supplementation was less efficacious than daily in improving folate status. Our findings are similar to those of the
New Zealand study regarding effects on Hcy levels; baseline Hcy
concentrations in our study were similar to those observed in the
New Zealand study, but the magnitude of Hcy change was
slightly lower in our study (;10% vs. 16 to 18.5%). However,
the supplements in our study differed in composition from those
of the New Zealand study in that ours also contained vitamin
B-12. Therefore, the decline in Hcy in our study may not be due
to FA alone but due in part to vitamin B-12. In terms of effects on
folate status, results from the 2 studies differ; we found no
difference in efficacy (serum folate) but the New Zealand study
found greater efficacy (serum folate and RBC folate) for daily
supplementation. We have no explanation for the differences in
efficacy between daily and weekly supplementation across the
studies.
Compared to the New Zealand sample, women in our study
had higher baseline serum folate and this may explain the lower
response to supplementation in our study. Serum folate increased 47–50% in our study, whereas it increased 65–150% in
the New Zealand study. Serum folate values after supplementation in our study were also similar to serum folate in the US
after fortification (34) after correcting for differences in methods
(35). Specifically, the Quantaphase II radio assay (Bio-Rad
Diagnostics) method used in the U.S. study resulted in values
that were 35% lower than those generated by the microbiological assay used in our study (35). The similar end-values
observed in our study, the New Zealand study, and the U.S.
study lead us to think that concentrations in these studies were
converging toward a saturation point. However, due to higher
baseline values in our study compared with the other studies, the
response to supplementation was lower in our study.
Although changes in vitamin B-12 did not differ between
daily and weekly groups, the changes in daily groups (20%)
were significant, whereas there was no change in the weekly
groups (P ¼ 0.48). This suggests greater efficacy for daily than
for weekly supplementation. The change in vitamin B-12 status
was most likely due to the vitamin B-12 in the supplements.
Further studies comparing the effects of weekly and daily
supplementation on vitamin B-12 status are needed to confirm
our findings.
The effect of the supplements was more pronounced in
women with lower folate concentrations at baseline. Women
with folate deficiency or marginal deficiency benefited the most,
with mean increases of 40 and 36 nmol/L, respectively, ;3 times
the increase observed in women with normal baseline folate (13
nmol/L). Women with elevated Hcy concentrations at baseline
showed the largest reduction after supplementation, a mean
decrease from baseline Hcy of 45%. Among women with
normal Hcy concentrations, there were no changes after FA
supplementation (P ¼ 0.8). Similar patterns were seen for
vitamin B-12 effects in which women starting with vitamin B-12
deficiency improved the most (mean increase of 81.5%) compared with a 38.4% increase in women with marginal vitamin
B-12 deficiency and no significant changes in women with normal
vitamin B-12. Clearly, effects of supplementation depended on
baseline values, with greater increases in those with lower values
for folate and B-12 and greater reductions in those with higher
Hcy concentrations. However, it was not possible to stratify the
deficiency groups by dosage type due to the limited number of
participants in each category.
Our study included multiple aims. Besides examining the
effect of supplementation on folate status, we were also interested in testing whether providing iron and zinc in combination
is less efficacious in improving iron status than is providing iron
alone (see Table 1 for design). The addition of zinc to some of the
supplements raises the concern that there may be an interaction
between folate and zinc. It has been proposed that FA supplements may impair zinc absorption (36,37), possibly by forming
an insoluble chelate in the lumen (36) or through a mutually
inhibitory effect of zinc and folate on intestinal transport
mechanisms (38). However, subsequent studies have failed to
prove the inhibitory effect of folate on zinc absorption (39) or on
zinc status (40–42). The evidence that zinc supplements affect
folate status is limited. In one study in middle-aged and older
European adults, supplementation with 15 or 30 mg zinc/d for 6
mo did not affect RBC folate status (43). Thus, we do not think
that our interpretation of the findings is influenced by the
presence of zinc in some of the supplement formulations. Rather,
the results of our study suggest that adding zinc does not affect
folate status, because all 4 groups responded similarly to various
specifications of FA supplementation. Similarly, we are not
concerned by the inclusion of vitamin B-12. The comparisons of
groups within daily and weekly arms were unbiased, because the
supplements contained similar amounts of vitamin B-12 within
these arms (i.e. 2.4 mg for both daily and 16.8 mg for both
weekly groups). Weekly doses of vitamin B-12 were 7 times
greater than those in daily groups but were identical when
expressed per day. The evidence that vitamin B-12 supplementation alone influences folate concentrations is limited and
contradictory (44,45). Thus, we do not expect the difference in
vitamin B-12 concentrations for daily and weekly supplements
to confound our findings.
This study has several strengths. The study design was robust
(a randomized controlled trial) and supplementation intake was
supervised daily. Implementation of the study was careful and
rigorous, from the training of the interview team to direct
supervision of supplementation ingestion to ensure high quality
data. Several regimens of supplementation were investigated:
depending on frequency of supplementation (weekly compared
with daily), and dose (weekly, 4000 mg compared with 2800 mg
FA; daily, 400 mg compared with 200 mg FA). The 4 experimental groups had similar time lags between the timing of the
last supplement consumption and blood draw (mean of 2.5 6
1.1 d), therefore avoiding bias when comparing the effects of
supplements on biochemical indicators.
Our study has a number of limitations. Our study was powered
to detect a difference of 0.4 SD units, a medium size effect. We
cannot claim with certainty, therefore, that smaller differences did
not exist. Further, data for the final analysis were not available for
;20% of the sample (89 participants), slightly higher than the
15% anticipated. However, our final sample size still allowed us to
1496 Nguyen et al.

on 08 March 2018
detect a difference of 0.4 SD, the specified target, with a power of
76%, only slightly less than the standard 80%.
Due to technical problems in preparing the samples, we did
not have postintervention RBC folate values and therefore were
able to assess the effects of supplementation on only serum
folate. Serum folate is not as good an indicator of folate status at
the individual level as is RBC folate, because serum folate
concentrations fluctuate with recent folate intake. However, we
compared group means, which would average out these fluctuations across individuals, making day-to-day variability less of a
concern. In addition, we measured changes in serum Hcy, which
is also an indicator of folate status, because an increase in serum
or plasma Hcy reflects intracellular folate deficiency (46). Thus,
although we lacked measures of RBC folate, changes in serum
folate and serum Hcy were consistent in indicating similar
efficacy across all 4 experimental groups. Finally, another
limitation is that our design did not include a placebo group;
hence, we cannot exclude the possibility that community-wide
dietary improvements coincided with the beginning of supplementation. This, however, is not likely to have occurred.
Guatemala has been a pioneer in the developing world
regarding food fortification initiatives. Wheat flour fortification
with iron and FA has been implemented since the late 1960s
(47). Since November 2002, as part of a national plan for the
prevention of NTD, the amount of FA added to wheat flour in
Guatemala has increased from 350–450 mg FA/kg wheat flour
to 1800 mg FA/kg of wheat flour (48). However, despite these
efforts, Guatemalans continue to suffer from micronutrient
deficiencies. The consumption of fortified wheat flour is confined
largely to Guatemala City and other urban centers. Many rural
and highland communities do not have access to FA-fortified
food products or find them too expensive to purchase on a
regular basis. Most poor rural areas, particularly indigenous
highland areas, consume mostly corn and corn flour rather than
wheat-based products. Findings from a study by Imhoff-Kunsch
et al. (47) suggested that the poor rural and indigenous populations benefit the least from wheat flour fortification. They
estimated that wheat flour fortification provided 26% of the
RDA for folate for women across all households but only 4% for
women in extremely poor households. Given that situation,
weekly FA supplementation represents an option for reaching
women of reproductive age in poor rural areas and in indigenous
regions of Guatemala. In addition, weekly supplementation with
iron and FA has been shown to have fewer side effects than daily
supplementation and this may enhance compliance (49). From a
programmatic perspective, weekly supplementation is less costly
and may be easier to manage. However, field studies are needed
to demonstrate the feasibility of weekly supplementation in
routine, large-scale programs.
The main concern with FA supplementation is that it may
mask symptoms of vitamin B-12 deficiency and that this may
lead to the progression of adverse neurological symptoms. The
current study provided both FA and vitamin B-12; we would
hope that public health programs would also provide vitamin
B-12 along with FA. Recently, concern has been expressed that FA
supplementation or fortification may have a promoting effect on
the progression of preexisting, undiagnosed premalignant and
malignant lesions (50–52). Evidence for this concern is not conclusive and needs further investigation. This potential, unconfirmed risk needs to be balanced against the proven benefit of
reducing NTD rates, which are very common in the region.
FA supplementation may reduce NTD considerably, but not
completely, because other causes may also be important in
Guatemala. Fumonisins may be a potential, additional risk
factor for NTD (53). Fumonisins is a family of mycotoxins, a
common fungal contaminant of maize. Fumonisins inhibit
ceramide synthase, causing depletion of complex sphingolipids,
which interfere with the function of some membrane proteins,
including the folate-binding protein, thus interfering with folate
transport (53). In the highland areas of Guatemala where the
staple is maize, consumption of fumonisins is likely to be high
(54), further exacerbating folate deficiency. Further studies are
needed to explore other factors, including genetic polymorphisms, which may contribute to the high incidence of NTD in
this population.
Our results suggest that weekly FA plus vitamin B-12 supplementation provided to Guatemalan women of reproductive
age may be as efficacious as daily supplementation in improving
serum folate and lowering Hcy concentrations. Further studies
are needed to confirm the efficacy of weekly FA supplementation
on folate status in women of child-bearing age in other populations.
