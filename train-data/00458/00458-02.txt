ABSTRACT Different supplementation schemes to build iron
stores in female Indonesian adolescents were investigated. Subjects were 273 high-school girls allocated randomly to four treat- ment groups. During a 3-mo period one group received 60 mg Fe, 750 p.g retinol, 250 p.g folic acid, and 60 mg vitamin C per day; a second group received 60 mg Fe, 6000 g retinol, 500 mg folic
acid, and 60 mg vitamin C once a week; a third group received 120
mg Fe and the same amount of the other three micronutrients as the
second group once a week; and a fourth group received only
placebos. All subjects were dewormed and supplement allocation was double blind. Blood samples were collected at baseline, after 2 and 3 mo of supplementation, and 6 mo after the last supplement.
After 2 mo of supplementation, groups supplemented weekly and
daily showed similar significant improvements (P < 0.001) in
hemoglobin and retinol concentrations, and supplementation for 3
instead of 2 mo did not significantly increase these two indicators.
After 3 mo, the increase in ferritin was “27 .tg/L in the daily and
14-15 .ag/L in the weekly groups (P < 0.001), the latter having a
final concentration of 42-45 .tg/L. At 6 mo postsupplementation
there were no significant differences among daily and weekly
groups, but the ferritin concentration was still l0-l2-j.ag/L
higher (P < 0.001) than in the placebo group. The group supplemented weekly with 60 mg Fe complained less about side effects
than the other supplemented groups (P < 0.05). Weekly supplementation with 60 mg Fe and 6000 .tg retinol for 3 mo was optimal for improving the iron status of the adolescents for ‘9 mo. Am J Clin Nutr 1997;66:177-83.

INTRODUCTION
Iron deficiency anemia is the most prevalent nutritional
disorder worldwide (1). Pregnant women are at special risk and
the prevalence of anemia for this population in the developing
countries of Southeast Asia is as high as 60-70% (2). Because
iron deficiency anemia is associated with poor pregnancy out- come (3, 4), many countries have started programs that attempt
to increase iron intake during pregnancy by distributing iron
tablets to pregnant women (5). Despite these programs, the
prevalence of iron deficiency has not decreased in the past
decade (1 , 5). The low effectiveness of the iron-supplementation programs is considered to be mainly due to inefficient
health service delivery and to low compliance of the pregnant women with tablet intake (5-7); efforts should be undertaken to
improve both of these factors. However, to decrease the preyalence of anemia during pregnancy it may not be sufficient to
only focus on an improvement in the effectiveness of the
existing iron-supplementation programs. Other factors, such as
the timing of supplementation and possible deficiencies of
other micronutrients, should also be considered.
Many women in developing countries are already anemic or have low iron stores before they get pregnant (6). These women will probably also be or become anemic soon after the
iron requirements increase toward the end of the first trimester
of pregnancy, and iron supplementation, which is normally
provided during the later pregnancy stages, is then too late.
Another factor is the vitamin A status of the women because
vitamin A influences iron metabolism (8). Even when iron
supplements are taken, any improvement in iron status may be
limited when vitamin A status is low (9). A decrease in the
prevalence of anemia during pregnancy could therefore be
reached through an improvement in iron and vitamin A status of women before they get pregnant.
Adolescent girls would be an important target group because
their iron requirements are relatively high, they will be future
mothers, and they can often be reached relatively easily
through schools (10). However, considering the experience
with the supplementation program for pregnant women in
terms of tablet delivery through the health care system and the
low compliance with intake, it would probably be expensive
and ineffective to supplement large groups of adolescent girls
with iron and vitamin A by using the same approach as for
pregnant women. A cheaper alternative (1 1) could be supplementation on a weekly basis because recent studies have shown
that the effects of weekly iron supplementation are similar to
those of daily supplementation among children (12, 13) and
nonpregnant (14) and pregnant ( 15) women. Currently, no

large-scale supplementation programs for adolescent girls exist, and whether weekly supplementation would benefit the
girls immediately and in a possible future pregnancy would
need to be investigated. It was the aim of this study to compare
different frequencies and doses of supplements with multiple
micronutrients among adolescent girls to investigate the effect
of different durations of supplementation and the moderately
long-term (9 mo) effect on iron stores.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
The study was carried out in 1995 in East Jakarta. Subjects were girls who were enrolled in a governmental senior high
school. A preliminary survey among 805 girls in the school
showed that 21. 1% of the girls were anemic with a hemoglobin
concentration < 120 g/L (by finger-prick blood test). This
prevalence was considered to be high enough to justify a blanket supplementation approach. Sample size calculation
showed that with 60 subjects per group, a between-group
difference in hemoglobin of 5.4 g/L and in retinol of 0.12
amol/L would be significant with an a of 0.05 and a power of
0.90. These differences were considered to be biologically
significant. Allowing for a high dropout rate, we decided to
include 360 girls and used presence of regular menstruation as a selection criterion. All 773 menopausal girls who were aged
14-18 y were eligible. Finally, 363 girls were randomly selected among the eligible girls, who, after selection, were
allocated randomly to one of four treatment groups. Both the
subjects and their parents gave written consent to participate in
the study.
Information on the content of the supplements is provided in
Table 1. The supplements were specially made for the study
(Kimia Farma, Jakarta, Indonesia). Besides iron and vitamin A,
the supplements also contained vitamin C to improve iron
absorption and folate to improve folate status. One group
received a supplement on every school day of the week (Monday-Friday); two other groups received a supplement only on Friday (Muslim prayer day) and placebos on the other school
days; and the last (fourth) group received placebos on every
school day. Supplements and placebos had the same red color
and shape, and were not distinguishable by sight. The supple- ments were taken during a break in the teaching schedule and no strict prescription was given regarding tablet ingestion with

or without meals or snacks. All subjects were dewormed at the
start of the study with a single 500-mg dose of mebendazole
because 34% of a subsample of 104 subjects were found to be
infested with Trichuris trichiura (16). The study was con- ducted in a randomized, doubly masked manner. It was our intention to provide the supplements under supervised conditions during the whole l2-wk period. However, the
last 4 wk of supplementation fell in the Muslim fasting month,
and the girls had off both weeks 9 and 12 of the supplementation period. Therefore, supplementation was supervised duning the first 8 wk, and during weeks 9-12 the supplements were provided on a take-home basis after the girls had received
careful instruction on tablet intake. Although instructions were given, tablet intake during weeks 9-12 of supplementation was checked by asking the subjects at the end of the supplementation period whether they had taken all tablets. In addition, the
plastic bags in which the tablets were provided were retrieved
from all subjects and the remaining tablets were counted.
Specific side effects were investigated by asking the girls, on
the Friday of week 1 1, whether they ever experienced an effect
related to the supplement during weeks 10 and 1 1 of the
supplementation period. The occurrence of side effects was
reported as the percentage of subjects who experienced a certain effect at least once. At baseline and after 8 and 12 wk of supplementation,
nonfasting venous blood samples were collected at the school
between 0900 and 1 130. Blood collection fell outside the
Muslim fasting month. To determine the longer-term effect of
the supplementation, blood samples were again collected 6 mo
after the end of the l2-wk supplementation period (9 mo after
baseline). Blood was collected in two tubes: one tube containing heparmn for the analysis of femtin and retinol (5 mL blood),
and one tube containing EDTA for the analysis of hemoglobin
and white blood cell counts (3 mL blood). Blood was transported to the laboratory in a cool box and analysis of hemoglobin was done within 4 h after blood collection. Plasma was obtained by centrifugation for 10 mm at 3000 X g and 25 #{176}C,
and was stored at -20 #{176}C until analyzed. Blood and plasma for
retinol analysis were kept in the dark as much as possible.
Hemoglobin was analyzed by using a Coulter counter
(Coulter MAXM; Coulter Electronics Limited, Luton, United
Kingdom). A duplicate analysis was done in 40 samples. Vanability based on these duplicate measurements was 0.99 g/L
(17). Femtin was analyzed by using the enzyme immunoassay
method (17). Duplicate analyses were done on 12% of the
samples. Variability based on these duplicate fernitin measure- ments was 0.246 .ag/L (17). Retinol was analyzed by using
HPLC (18) in a darkened room. No duplicate analysis was done for retinol.
The study protocol was approved by the ethical review
committee of the University of Indonesia and was in agreement
with the international ethical guidelines for epidemiologic studies (19).
Statistical analysis
A one-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to investigate whether the concentrations of hemoglobin, ferritin, and
retinol resembled a normal distribution. Ferritin was not nor- mally distributed but became so after a square-root transformation. Differences in concentrations between groups at baseline, 8 wk, 12 wk, and 6 mo after the end of supplementation

WEEKLY IRON SUPPLEMENTATION OF ADOLESCENTS I 79 were tested with analysis of variance. Differences in treatment effect between the four groups and between the three supplemented groups were investigated by using the multivariate
analysis (MANOVA) repeated-measures design of SPSSIPC+
(SPSS mc, Chicago) (20) with the supplement types as a between-subjects factor and treatment effect (baseline corn- pared with 8 wk, baseline compared with 12 wk, 8 wk corn- pared with 12 wk) as a within-subjects factor. Between-group
differences in treatment effect would be indicated by a significant interaction between treatment effect and treatment type.
Initial hemoglobin (in three groups: < 120, 120-130, and > 130 gIL) and retinol (in three groups: < 0.70, 0.70-1.05, and > 1 .05 .amolJL) concentrations were included in the analysis as between-subjects factors to correct for their possible confounding influence on the changes in hemoglobin and retino!.
Differences in prevalence were tested with a chi-square test. RESULTS Between baseline and 1 2 wk, a complete data set was obtamed for 273 subjects. Selected characteristics of the group of
subjects at baseline (n = 363) and of the subjects who com- pleted the study (n = 273) are shown in Table 2.
The number of dropouts from the daily, weekly with 60 mg
Fe, weekly with 120 mg Fe, and placebo group were 28, 20, 27,
and 15 respectively. The dropouts were not significantly different in age, weight, height, length of menstruation, or initial
hemoglobin concentration (varied from 126 to 129 g/L). These
values for the dropouts were also similar to the values of the
remaining subjects (Table 2). Common reasons for dropping
out were refusal to undergo blood taking, absence from class on the day of blood taking, and refusal to take tablets for the
duration of 1 2 wk. Prevalence of low iron and vitamin A status
is also presented in Table 2. At baseline, 30.4% had a ferritin
concentration < 15 g/L and 20. 1% had a fernitin concentration < 12 j.ag/L. Three subjects (1.1%) had a retinol concentration < 0.35 p.mol/L. Of those subjects who had initial hemoglobin concentrations < 120 gIL, 68.1% had a fernitin
concentration < 15 p.g/L, and 57.4% had a retinol concentration < 0.70 j.amollL. There were low but significant correlations at baseline between concentrations of hemoglobin and TABLE 2

fernitin (r = 0.37, P 0.001), and between hemoglobin and
retinol (r = 0.22, P = 0.001). Retinol concentrations were also
correlated with femtin (r = 0.20, P = 0.01).
There were no significant differences in initial hemoglobin,
retinol, or ferritin concentrations between the four groups (Table 3). After 8 wk of supplementation there were significant
within-group increases (P < 0.001) in hemoglobin, ferritin,
and retino! in the weekly and daily supplemented groups. In the
placebo group the hemoglobin and ferritin concentration decreased (P < 0.02) whereas the retinol concentration increased
compared with baseline (P < 0.001). The additional 4 wk of
supplementation did not give the same uniform result for the
groups supplemented weekly and daily. After 12 wk of supplementation, the hemoglobin concentration in the groups supplemented weekly and daily had decreased significantly com- pared with the values at 8 wk (P < 0.001) but was still higher
than the baseline values (P < 0.001). The hemoglobin concentration of the placebo group also decreased significantly (P <
0.00!). The ferritin concentration of the groups supplemented
weekly was significantly higher at 12 wk than at 8 wk (P <
0.001) whereas for the group supplemented group daily there was no further significant increase. Compared with the value at 8 wk, the retinol concentration of the group supplemented
weekly with 120 mg Fe had increased significantly (P <
0.001), and the retinol concentration in the placebo group had
decreased (P < 0.001).
Although at baseline the concentration of hemoglobin and
retinol was correlated, the changes in hemoglobin were not correlated with the changes in retinol for the three supplemented groups (P = 0.63). Between-group differences in treat- ment effect were tested separately for 8 and 12 wk of supplementation by investigating the changes compared with
baseline. The concentrations at baseline were associated with
the respective changes in hemoglobin (r = -0.58, P < 0.001)
and retinol (r = -0.62, P < 0.001) concentration in the three
micronutrient-supplemented groups. Therefore, the initial con- centrations were included as confounding factors in the analysis of between-group differences in treatment effect for hemoglobin and retinol. Changes compared with baseline for all
three hematologic indexes in the groups supplemented daily
and weekly differed significantly from those in the placebo
group at both 8 (P < 0.001) and 12 wk (P < 0.001) (Table 3).
There was no significant difference in treatment effect on
hemoglobin and retinol concentration between the groups supplemented weekly and daily at 8 or 12 wk. The increase in
ferritin concentration in the group supplemented daily was greater than that for the groups supplemented weekly at both 8
(P < 0.001) and 12 (P < 0.001) wk.
Prevalence of low concentrations of hemoglobin, ferritin,
and retinol for each group at baseline and 12 wk are presented
in Table 4. After 12 wk of supplementation the prevalence of
anemia (hemoglobin < 120 g/L) had decreased in the supplemented groups but the decrease was only significant (P = 0.01 1) in the group supplemented weekly with 60 mg Fe. The
final prevalences of anemia in the three supplemented groups were similar and ranged from 5.7% to 7.8%. In the placebo
group a small but nonsignificant increase in the prevalence
occurred. The percentage of subjects with a femtin concentration < 15 p.g/L was lowest in the group supplemented daily
group but this prevalence did not differ significantly from the
prevalence in the group supplemented weekly with 120 mg Fe Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article-abstract/66/1/177/4655662 by guest on 16 October 2018

35.0%, and 32.0% for the group supplemented daily, weekly
with 60 mg Fe, weekly with 120 mg Fe, and with placebo,
respectively. Six months after the end of the supplementation
the corresponding prevalences were 10.8%, 15.6%, 17.5%, and
44.0%, respectively.
Tablet intake was supervised during the first 8 wk of the
supplementation period to ensure that all tablets were taken.
During weeks 9-12, tablets were given on a take-home basis.
Checking tablet intake during weeks 9-12 indicated that subjects from each of the three supplemented groups took on
average about two of the four tablets prescribed for Fridays.
For the remaining days of the week there was no difference
between the supplemented groups. On average, subjects from
each group took 7-8 of the prescribed 16 tablets (tablets for
Monday-Thursday). Total intake for the supplemented groups
(including placebo for the groups supplemented weekly) was 9.4 tablets on average, whereas for the placebo group the intake was higher at 10.8 tablets (P < 0.05).
Subjects were questioned about side effects that occurred
during weeks 10 and 1 1 of the supplementation period, and the
percentage of subjects experiencing a certain side effect during
that period are shown in Table 6. Absence of side effects was most frequently reported in the placebo group, followed by the
group supplemented weekly with 60 mg Fe. Nausea, vomiting,
sleepiness, and increased appetite were significantly associated
with frequency and amount of iron intake. The percentage of
subjects who mentioned nausea was lower among individuals
receiving 60 mg Fe weekly than among those of the two other
supplemented groups (P < 0.05). The frequency of vomiting was higher among those receiving daily supplementation than
among members of the other three groups (P < 0.05).
2.00 DISCUSSION
Iron status of adolescent girls is likely to be an important
determinant of anemia during an eventual future pregnancy.
This is especially the case in the majority of developing countries where the average age of a first pregnancy is relatively
low. A 1994 population survey in Indonesia showed that the
median age at first birth was =20 y and that 33% of women
aged 20-24 y at the time of the survey had their first child
before they were 19 y age (21).
The group of adolescent girls in this investigation was relalively privileged because they still went to school. In Indonesia,
the majority of l7-y-old girls would probably already be working or be married. Considering their privileged position, their
prevalence of iron and vitamin A deficiency was quite high.
The high prevalence (30%) of subjects with low retinol values,
and the correlation between retinol and hemoglobin concentrations, retrospectively supported the approach of using com- bined iron-vitamin A supplementation, as had been suggested
earlier for combating anemia (8, 9).
Several aspects of supplementation were investigated in this
study-the composition of supplements: 60 mg compared with
120 mg Fe; the frequency of supplementation: weekly corn- pared with daily; the duration of supplementation: 8 compared
with 12 wk; and the effect of supplementation on iron status 6 mo after the last dose. Furthermore, side effects were recorded.
Iron and vitamin A status of the groups supplemented daily
and weekly improved significantly compared with that of the
placebo group, indicating the beneficial effect of the supplementation. In the placebo group, no improvements occurred in
iron status, but the prevalence of low retinol concentrations was reduced from 30.7% to 9.3%. This reduction is probably
due to a combined effect of deworming and a regression to the mean. The positive effect of deworming on vitamin A status was reported previously in a study among Brazilian and Indonesian children (22, 23).
Between the two groups supplemented weekly, no difference
in treatment effect resulted from 60 compared with 120 mg Fe
and a vitamin A-iron ratio of 100 compared with 50. The group
supplemented with 120 mg Fe, however, did complain more
frequently about side effects, hence, the weekly supplement
containing 60 mg Fe gave better overall results than the one
containing 120 mg Fe.
Comparing the groups supplemented daily and weekly, there was no difference in treatment effect on hemoglobin and retinol
concentrations. However, the increase in ferritin concentration
of the subjects supplemented daily was 12-1 3-.ag/L higher
(P < 0.001) than that of the subjects supplemented weekly.

5.6 Significantly tower than groups supplemented weekly and daily: P < 0.001, P < 0.01. The femtin concentration of the groups supplemented weekly was “40 ;.tg/L after 12 wk, and 7% of the subjects still had
a concentration < 15 p.g/L. Although lower than in the group
supplemented daily, the average ferritin concentration reached
by the subjects supplemented weekly after 12 wk can be
considered quite satisfactory, especially compared with fenitin
values reported for Western populations. Apparently healthy
l2-l4-y-old British school girls had an average ferritin con- centration of 30.4 .ag/L, with 19.8% having a ferritin value < 20 g/L (24). Among a United States population of 15-19-
y-old females, 14.2% had a femtin concentration < 12 tg/L
(25). It should also be noted that subjects supplemented daily
complained more about side effects, specifically vomiting and
nausea, than did subjects supplemented weekly with 60 mg Fe.
The real effect of supplementation from 8 to 1 2 wk was difficult to estimate because the assessed tablet intake for this
period was ‘‘50% of the targeted intake. Despite the reduced
intake, a further increase in iron stores occurred in the groups
supplemented weekly, as indicated by a rise in ferritin concentration of 5 p.g/L. In the group supplemented daily, no significant additional increase in ferritin occurred even though the
absolute amount of ingested iron was more than twice that
among the groups receiving the supplement weekly. The lack
of significant increase in ferritin concentration the group supplemented daily compares well with results from a study
among young healthy Swedish women, which suggested that
the net absorption of iron from diets with medium to high TABLE 6
bioavailability becomes zero when fernitin concentrations
range from 40 to 60 g/L (26).
Supplementation of adolescents with the objective to build
iron stores will only be efficient if the supplementation effect
remains during a prolonged period of time. Six months after the
end of the l2-wk supplementation the ferritin concentration of
the three supplemented groups was still 6 pg/L higher (P <
0.001) than initial values, and the prevalence of low ferritin
concentrations (< 15 p.g/L) was about half that before the
intervention. Six months after the end of supplementation the
previous difference in ferritin concentration between daily and
weekly supplementation was not significant anymore because
the decrease in ferritin concentration over the 6-mo period was greater in the group supplemented daily than in the group
supplemented weekly. This greater decrease in the group supplemented daily may be due to a low rate of absorption of iron
from food, which occurs when body stores are high (26).
Therefore, the effect on fenritin concentration of daily corn- pared with weekly supplementation was similar several months
after the end of supplementation.
The weekly supplement with 60 mg Fe and 6000 p.g retinol was most efficient in improving hemoglobin and retinol status and
gave good results in building iron stores when used over a period
of 12 wk. The vitamin A content of the weekly supplements was 6000 ,.ag, which is “‘1.7 times the weekly safe intake recom- mended by the Food and Agriculture Organization/World Health
Organization (27). In view of the lack of further improvement in

WEEKLY IRON SUPPLEMENTATION OF ADOLESCENTS 183
retino! concentration during weeks 9-12 of the supplementation
and the additional costs, a reduction of the vitamin A content of
the supplement to =4000 j.tg retinol should be considered. Therefore, under conditions similar to the situation at baseline in the
present study, a weekly supplement with 60 mg Fe and 4000 p.g
netinol will probably give good results in the improvement of iron
and vitamin A status and iron stores will be retained for 6 mo. Anthelminthic treatment may contribute significantly to the improvement of vitamin A status when a large part of the population
is infested with helminths.
The first 8 wk of the supplementation were supervised,
which ensured complete tablet intake. When tablets were given
on a take-home basis the intake dropped to 50% of the
prescribed intake. Therefore, it is important to investigate the
effectiveness of weekly supplementation of adolescents under
programmatic conditions before making any final decisions
about larger-scale applications. Topics to be investigated further include types of distribution systems, factors that influence
compliance with tablet intake such as knowledge and attitude
toward micronutrients, and communication strategies. A
