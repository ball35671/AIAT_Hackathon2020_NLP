Abstract
Background: Iron deficiency and iron-deficiency anaemia are associated with oxidative stress, but their role is largely
unclear. Information is scarce on the effects of iron supplementation on biomarkers of oxidative stress in humans.
Aims: This study evaluated the effectiveness of iron supplementation and nutrition education on improving the levels
of haemoglobin and ferritin, and decreasing oxidative stress among iron-deficient female adolescents in Gaza, Palestine.
Methods: A total 131 iron-deficient female adolescents were recruited and allocated randomly into 3 different groups. The
iron supplementation group (A) received 200 mg of ferrous fumarate weekly during the 3-month intervention, the iron
supplementation with nutrition education group (B) received iron supplements with nutrition education sessions, and
the control group (C) did not receive any intervention. The levels of haemoglobin, ferritin and malonyl dialdehyde were
measured at baseline, after 3 months (at which point the intervention was stopped), and then 3 months later. Trial registration number: ACTRN12618000960257.
Results: Haemoglobin levels increased significantly after supplementation in both groups A and B. At the follow-up stage
(3 months after stopping the intervention), iron and haemoglobin levels in group B continued to increase and malonyl
dialdehyde decreased. In Group A, haemoglobin, ferritin and malonyl dialdehyde levels decreased after 3 months of stopping the intervention. No changes were seen in Group C.
Conclusions: A nutrition programme should be adopted and integrated into comprehensive intervention programmes to
target iron-deficiency anaemia among female adolescents in Palestine.

Introduction
Iron deficiency is the most common form of nutritional
disorder worldwide, affecting more than 2 billion people globally (1). Iron deficiency is not the only cause of
anaemia but where anaemia is prevalent, iron deficiency
is the most common cause (2). Most adolescents suffer
from iron deficiency and its adverse health effects (2). In
Gaza, Palestine, the prevalence of anaemia was reported
as 33.3% (3), while the prevalence of iron deficiency was
23.6% among adolescents (4). Adolescents of today are the
adult population of tomorrow and therefore their health
and wellbeing are important (5).
Pregnancy increases the risk of iron deficiency and
the approach to iron-deficiency anaemia in pregnancy
has changed recently, from providing nutritional
supplements during pregnancy to taking steps earlier
to ensure that women, especially adolescents, have
adequate iron stores before conception (6).
Previous studies have found that knowledge is
one of the first steps to changing behaviour. Nutrition
knowledge is therefore an essential basis for good
dietary habits (7,8). Conversely, a lack of knowledge is
a risk factor for malnutrition (9). Nutrition education
programmes are needed to increase awareness in
female adolescents about anaemia (10). Moreover, health
education has proven to be very effective and has resulted
in a substantial improvement in iron levels and nutrition
knowledge (11,12).
Oxidative stress is defined as an imbalance between
the oxidation and anti-oxidation systems, resulting in
the excessive production of reactive oxygen species
(13,14). Reactive oxygen species of erythrocytes is one of
the principal causes of anaemia (15). Red blood cells are
subjected to continuous oxidative stress during their
lifetime. They are particularly susceptible to oxidative
damage from high content of unsaturated fatty acid
chains in the lipid bilayer combined with high oxygen

levels (16).
As far as we know, no studies have been carried out
to assess the effects of ferrous fumarate supplementation
on the biomarkers of oxidative stress in female
adolescents with iron deficiency and iron deficiency
anaemia. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate
the effects of iron supplementation and nutritional
education on haemoglobin (Hb) and ferritin levels and
oxidative stress in female adolescents (aged 15–19 years)
with iron deficiency and iron-deficiency anaemia in
Gaza, Palestine.
Methods
Study design and setting
This randomized control trial was conducted in Gaza,
Palestine on female adolescents aged 15–19 years with
iron deficiency and iron-deficiency anaemia (mild and
moderate). The study was conducted from 25 October
2015 to 25 April 2016.
Sample size and selection
The sample size was calculated based on the formula for
2 means:
n = [(Zα/2 + Zβ)
2
 × 2(σ2
)]/(µ1
 – µ2
)
2
Where:
µ1
 = mean change in Hb after 3 months from iron
supplements = 1.23 g/dL (17).
µ2
 = expected mean change in Hb after 3 months from
iron supplements = 2 g/dL
σ = standard deviation = 1.195
Zα/2: at 5% level of significance = 1.96
Zβ: for a power of 80% = 0.84.
The calculation gave 38 respondents in each group.
However, assuming a 15% drop-out from the trial, the
number of participants was increased to 45 per group.
Eligibility
Participants were eligible for inclusion in the trial if they
were unmarried and not pregnant. Participants were excluded if they: had severe anaemia (Hb < 8 g/dL); were
suffering from acute or chronic infections that could affect their Hb and ferritin levels at the time of the blood
sampling; had anaemia other than iron-deficiency anaemia; were underweight; were on medication; or were diagnosed with thalassemia trait.
Group allocation and intervention
This intervention programme was part of a 2-phase
study in which anaemia and iron deficiency status were
assessed among female adolescents attending secondary
schools in Gaza (first phase).
In the first phase, a sample of female adolescents aged
15–19 years was selected from secondary schools in Gaza.
As there are 5 governorates in Gaza, 1 school was selected
from each governorate out of a total of 145 schools.
Schools were listed by governorate and 1 was randomly
selected from each governorate. Similarly classes were
selected randomly from grades 10, 11 and 12 in the selected
schools, 1 or 2 class(es) from each grade according to the
population of the governorate. All the girls in the selected
classes (330 girls) were assessed for iron deficiency and
iron-deficiency anaemia. Preliminary screening for iron
deficiency and iron-deficiency anaemia (Hb < 12 g/dL and
ferritin < 15 µg/L) was done through vein blood samples.
The girls were also interviewed in school by a female
research assistant about their socioeconomic status and
to determine if they met the eligibility criteria.
A total of 177 girls (54%) had iron deficiency or irondeficiency anaemia. Of these, 43 did not meet the eligibility
criteria and were excluded. Therefore 135 students with
iron deficiency or iron-deficiency anaemia were invited
to participate in the second phase of the study. None was
taking taking any supplements. Those who agreed (n =
131) were randomized into 3 groups (Figure 1).
· Group A (iron supplementation) included 45 participants who received 200 mg of ferrous fumarate once
weekly for 3 months; this was given by the researchers during school hours.
· Group B (iron supplementation with nutrition education) included 44 participants who received iron
supplements (ferrous fumarate) once weekly and 9
nutritional education sessions (1.5 hours/session) for
3 months.
· Group C (controls) included 42 participants who did
not receive any intervention throughout the study
period.
The purpose of the nutrition education was to teach
the participants about the importance of good nutrition,
with an emphasis on iron deficiency and iron-deficiency
anaemia. The nutrition education intervention consisted
of lectures, posters, videos, booklets, and brochures.
Nutrition lectures were delivered by the researchers
using simple methods and vocabulary to present topics
on nutrition in Arabic such as food groups, the food
pyramid, a balanced diet, iron absorption enhancers and
inhibitors, good sources of iron, and ways to improve the
absorption of iron from foods.
After 3 months of the intervention, the
supplementation and education sessions were stopped
for Groups A and B, and the groups were followed up
after a further 3 months.
After the study was completed, the intervention was
offered to the girls in the control group; they were given
a packet of iron supplement tablets (20 tablets) and 2
sessions of nutrition education.
Measurements
Three blood assessments were done: at baseline (25 October 2015), after 3 months (first post-intervention, 25 January 2016), and after 6 months of baseline (second post-intervention (25 April 2016).
Complete blood count, serum ferritin and malonyl
dialdehyde (MDA) levels were measured. About 5 mL of

venous blood were drawn (0.5 mL in EDTA tubes and 3
mL in serum evacuated tubes) from each participant. All
the samples were placed in tube racks and packed in an
appropriate ice container (4 °C) and sent to a laboratory
accredited by the Palestinian Ministry of Health. The
samples were analysed on the same day. Blood samples
were coded so assessors were unaware of the group a
blood sample was from.
Anaemia was assessed by measuring Hb concentration
in the complete blood count analysis (Horiba ABX Micros
ES 60, France). Iron status was assessed by measuring the
serum ferritin levels (Chemistry Autoanalyzer, Model:
BS-120, Mindray Bio-Medical Electronic Co. Ltd, China)
in duplicate, and recording the average results. An MDA
adduct competitive ELISA kit (OxiSelectTM, Cell Biolabs,
Canada) was used to measure MDA levels.
Body weight of each participant was measured by
using a calibrated scale (Seca model 750 1017009, Germany.
Students were weighed barefooted to the nearest 0.5 kg.
Standing height also was measured without shoes to the
nearest 0.5 cm with a stadiometer (Seca body meter 206,
Germany), with the shoulders in a relaxed position and
the arms hanging freely. The body mass index (BMI) for
age was be calculated using the Anthro Plus program of

the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (version
7.1.5.2). Duplicate measurements of weight and height
of the students were taken and the mean of value was
determined.
Statistical analysis
All analyses were conducted using SPSS, version 22. Repeated measures analysis of variance (one-way repeated
measures ANOVA) was used to evaluate changes in all
the continuous variables (Hb, ferritin and MDA) over the
study period. Repeated measures ANOVA measured the
changes between the groups, within the group, and time
and group interactions. A P-value < 0.05 was considered
statistically significant.
Ethical considerations
Before data collection, written permission to carry out
the study was obtained from the Helsinki Committee
in Palestine and the Ministry of Education in Palestine
(reference number PHRC/HC/3^/14). After reviewing the
study protocol, the Human Ethics Committee of Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia gave its ethical approval (reference number UKM1.5.3.5/244/NN-025-2015).
In keeping with social and cultural norms, a female
interviewer was hired. Written consent was obtained
from all the respondents if they were aged ≥18 years or
from their parents if they were under 18 years. It was
explained that they were free to withdraw from the study
at any time.
Trial registration
This trial is registered under ACTRN number: ACTRN12618000960257.
Results
Descriptive results of the study sample
Table 1 describes the baseline sociodemographic characteristics of the participants (age, region, educational
grade), BMI, and blood analysis. Ferritin and MDA levels
in group B were slightly higher than in the other 2 groups
but no statistically significant differences were found.
Thus, no adjustments were made in the outcome analysis
on the basis of any of the variables.
Effect of nutrition education and
supplementation on Hb, ferritin and MDA
status
The main objective of the trial was to determine the effectiveness of iron supplementation and nutrition education on the levels of Hb, ferritin and MDA in female adolescents aged 15–19 years. The effect of the intervention
was assessed using the 2 dimensions of repeated measure ANOVA; firstly, the within group effect to determine
whether there was a difference in the blood parameters
(Hb, ferritin and MDA), and secondly, to assess the interaction of treatment and time together.
Table 2 shows that the difference in the mean Hb
concentration was statistically significant between
within the same group at different intervals (P < 0.001). A
post-hoc test using the Bonferroni correction showed that
there was a statistically significant difference between
all the timelines. The mean ferritin concentration also
differed significantly between the timelines (P < 0.001). A
post-hoc test using the Bonferroni correction showed that
there was a statistically significant difference between the
baseline and midline, and the baseline and end-line, but
there was no statistically significant difference between
the midline and end-line. There was a statistically
significant difference between the 3 timelines in MDA
concentrations also (P < 0.001). The Bonferroni test
showed that the differences were statistically significant
between the baseline and midline, and the midline and
end-line, but not between the baseline and end-line.
The results of the mean ferritin concentration were
statistically significant between the groups at midline
and end-line (post-intervention and post-intervention 2)
(P < 0.001).
Figures 2, 3 and 4 explain the differences in the
effect of nutrition education intervention between the 3
groups after 6 months. The trend in the plot showed the
adjusted mean levels (estimated marginal mean) of Hb,
ferritin and MDA for zero months (baseline), 3 months
(intervention period) and 6 months (follow-up without
intervention). The mean Hb, ferritin and MDA levels

were almost equal for the 3 groups at the baseline. After
3 months of the intervention, the mean Hb, ferritin,
and MDA levels increased in the 2 intervention groups
but there were no changes in the control group. After 6
months of the baseline, the Hb and ferritin levels still
increased in the nutrition education group, while the
MDA level decreased in the same group. On the other
hand, for the group that received iron supplementation
alone, there was a decrease in the Hb and ferritin levels at
the follow-up stage.
Discussion
This study evaluated the effects of an iron supplementation and nutrition education intervention on Hb, serum
ferritin and MDA levels as indicators of oxidative stress
among female adolescents with iron deficiency and
iron-deficiency anaemia in Gaza, Palestine.
After 3 months of the intervention, mean Hb
concentration had increased significantly in groups
A and B. This finding is consistent with the results of
studies in Malaysia and Ghana in 2012 (17,18).
The results of our study showed that weekly iron
supplementation (200 mg of ferrous fumarate) led to an
increase in Hb levels from a mean of 11.52 (SD 0.96) g/
dL to 12.46 (SD 0.64) g/dL after 3 months. This result is
consistent with that of previous studies. For example, a
study in India found an increase in mean Hb levels from
10.51 (SD 0.35) g/dL to 12.49 (SD 0.65) g/dL after 3 months
of weekly iron supplementation with folic acid among

female adolescents (19). Another study in India found the
mean Hb level among female adolescents with anaemia
increased from 10.80 g/dL to 12.65 g/dL after 3 months
of once weekly iron supplementation (20). Similarly, the
study in Ghana among students with anaemia aged 6–11
years reported an increase in mean Hb levels from 11.38
(SD 0.15) g/dL to 11.63 (0.13) g/dL after 10 weeks of a 5-day
weekly iron supplementation (65 mg of ferrous fumarate)
(17). A study in Peru also reported an increase in mean Hb
levels with twice-weekly iron supplementation (60 mg
of ferrous sulfate)—from 11.39 (SD 0.05) g/dL to 12.07
(SD 0.01) g/dL—among female adolescents with anaemia
aged 12–18 years after 4 months (21).
No significant differences in Hb levels were
seen between groups A, B and C (P = 0.57) before the
intervention. At 3 months, a significant increase in the
Hb levels was seen in groups A and B but not the control
group. At 6 months, Hb levels in group A decreased, but
in group B, Hb levels continued to increase, though at a
lower rate, until the end of the study. These results are
consistent with the results of a study conducted among
adolescents in Malaysia (17). The improvement in the Hb
levels in the participants in the iron supplementation
group was most likely due to the iron supplementation,
while the improved Hb levels in the participants in the
iron supplementation with nutrition education group
were most likely because of modifications to their dietary
habits, which depended on a positive attitude and good
practices.
The effect of the iron supplementation on iron levels
was assessed using the mean ferritin concentration.
There was a significant increase in the mean ferritin
level in Groups A and B. This finding is consistent with
the findings of the studies by Opoku and Menendez et al.
(18,22). In our study, mean ferritin levels after 3 months of
iron supplementation in group A changed from 9.9 (SD
3.16) µg/L to 19.92 (SD 5.43) µg/L. This change was higher
than the change in a study in Malaysia where ferritin
levels increased from 34.3 (SD 2.49) µg/L to 37.5 (SD
2.49) µg/L among female adolescents aged 12–17 years
with anaemia but not iron deficiency following weekly
iron supplementation for 3 months (23). This difference
in the amount of increase may be because the Malaysian
study targeted non-iron-deficient female adolescents. In
addition, according to the results of our study, the change
in the ferritin levels after the iron supplementation was
lower than the study by Opoku, in which an increase
in the ferritin levels was reported from a mean of 14.17
(SD 0.64) µg/L to 40.38 (SD 4.95) µg/L following 5-day a
week iron supplementation for 10 weeks among students
aged 6–11 years with iron-deficiency anaemia (18). This
difference may have been due to the age differences
between the studied samples.
Information is scarce on the effects of iron
supplementation on the biomarkers of oxidative stress
in humans (24). The lack of epidemiological data on
oxidative damage in healthy human populations is a
serious gap in the distribution, correlation and causative
factors of oxidative damage (25). Iron deficiency and irondeficiency anaemia are associated with oxidative stress,
but their role in initiating stress is largely unclear. Also,
oxidative stress induced by iron deficiency and irondeficiency anaemia may also be caused by an inadequate
supply of oxygen to tissues, resulting in increased
concentrations of inflammatory mediators that activate
leukocytes (26,27). There are inconsistencies in the results
of these studies. Previous studies reported that MDA
levels increased significantly in iron-deficiency anaemia
(28–30).
In iron-deficiency anaemia, oxidative stress increases
with the generation of free radicals, while therapeutic
doses of iron supplements increase oxidative stress and
antioxidant supplementation reduces oxidative stress.
This increase and reduction in oxidative stress was
studied among adults (31). Unlike in adults, oxidative
stress in iron-deficiency anaemia is not aggravated
by iron supplementation among children aged 10
months to 16 years (31). Tiwari et al. concluded that iron
supplementation is effective in improving Hb levels but
at the cost of increased oxidative stress among women
with anaemia (29). An increase in MDA levels has been
reported after 13 weeks of iron supplementation (32). An
increase was also found in women after only 4 weeks
of iron supplementation (33). The MDA level correlated
with the serum ferritin level, suggesting that the iron
status, having been modified by iron supplementation,
increased the biomarker of lipid peroxidation (MDA).
In contrast, the findings of our study differ from other
studies that reported iron supplementation for 6 weeks
or 12 weeks caused a decrease in MDA levels (24,30),
while another study reported no significant effects on
lipid peroxidation and iron-deficiency anaemia after iron
supplementation (33). These different findings might be
explained by the different study designs, sample sizes,
biomarkers, the consideration of certain covariates in
some studies, and the health status of the participants.

Effets de la supplémentation en fer et de l’éducation nutritionnelle sur l’hémoglobine,
la ferritine et le stress oxydatif chez des adolescentes carencées en fer (Palestine) :
essai contrôlé randomisé
Résumé
Contexte : Les carences en fer et l’anémie ferriprive sont associées au stress oxydatif, mais leur rôle reste grandement
méconnu. Les informations portant sur les effets de la supplémentation en fer sur les biomarqueurs du stress oxydatif
chez l’homme sont peu nombreuses.
Objectifs : La présente étude a évalué l’efficacité de la supplémentation en fer et de l’éducation nutritionnelle sur
l’amélioration des taux d’hémoglobine et de ferritine, ainsi que sur la réduction du stress oxydatif chez les adolescentes
carencées en fer à Gaza (Palestine).
Méthodes : Au total, 131 adolescentes carencées en fer ont été recrutées et réparties de façon aléatoire en trois groupes
distincts. Le groupe de supplémentation en fer (A) a reçu 200 mg de fumarate de fer sur une base hebdomadaire au
cours d’une intervention de trois mois. Le groupe de supplémentation en fer avec éducation nutritionnelle (B) a reçu des
suppléments en fer et a assisté à des sessions d’éducation nutritionnelle. Le groupe témoin (C) n’a bénéficié d’aucune
intervention. Les taux d’hémoglobine, de ferritine et de malonyl–dialdéhyde ont été mesurés au début, après trois
mois (stade auquel l’intervention a été interrompue) et ensuite trois mois plus tard. (Numéro d’enregistrement de l’essai :
ACTRN12618000960257).
Résultats : Les taux d’hémoglobine des groupes A et B augmentaient significativement après une supplémentation. À
l’étape de suivi (trois mois après l’arrêt de l’intervention), les taux de fer et d’hémoglobine du groupe B continuaient
d’augmenter et les taux de malonyl–dialdéhyde diminuaient. Dans le groupe A, les taux d’hémoglobine, de ferritine et
de malonyl–dialdéhyde diminuaient trois mois après l’arrêt de l’intervention. Aucun changement n’a été observé dans le
groupe C.
Conclusions : Un programme de nutrition devrait être adopté et intégré aux programmes d’intervention globaux de
façon à cibler l’anémie ferriprive chez les adolescentes en Palestine.
the duration of the supplementation are other possible
reasons (24).
In our study, at week 13 of iron supplementation, the
MDA biomarker was 44% higher than at the baseline.
This finding is consistent with that of previous studies,
which reported that an increase in the level of oxidative
stress was induced by iron supplementation with ferrous
fumarate or ferrous sulfate (26,32). In a 70-day study of
iron-deficient non-anaemic women who were given
ferrous sulfate (98.0 mg Fe/day) for 8 weeks, there was a
marked increase in the plasma MDA level. At week 6 of
the supplementation, the MDA indicator was more than
40% higher than at baseline (26,32).
A limitation of this study is that we did not include
an intervention a group that only received nutritional
education to compare with the other groups.
Conclusions
Interventions and strategies are needed to control anaemia and iron deficiency in Palestinian adolescent girls.
The implementation of nutrition education programmes,
including about iron-deficiency anaemia, in Palestinian secondary schools is recommended. The Palestinian
Ministry of Health, in conjunction with the Ministry of
Education, should carry out assessments of anaemia and
iron deficiency.
The school-based nutrition education programme
was associated with improvements in the Hb and iron
status, and knowledge, attitudes and practices among
female adolescents in Gaza. This findings highlights
the importance of nutrition education. Given that iron
supplementation helps adjust iron deficiency temporarily,
a combination of supplementation and education is
recommended to correct iron deficiency, and maintain
Hb within the normal range. Our findings are supported
by several studies showing nutritional education is
an effective tool in improving haematocrit, Hb, serum
ferritin levels and anaemia status among adolescents
(34,35). Future studies are needed to determine whether
nutrition education alone would be sufficient to increase
Hb and ferritin among iron-deficient female adolescents.
Oxidative stress increases with iron deficiency and
iron-deficiency anaemia. However, doses of ferrous
fumarate for 3 months can increase the oxidative
status by increasing MDA levels. The goal should be to
correct anaemia without increasing the oxidative stress.
Therefore, further studies are needed in this regard.
