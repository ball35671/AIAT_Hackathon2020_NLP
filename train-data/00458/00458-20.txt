Abstract
Objectives: This work aims at studying the effect of daily versus twice weekly long-term Fe supplementation on Fe absorption and status in
Fe-deficient women.
Design and methods: The study design is a randomized controlled open study carried out in the Internal Medicine Department, CHU de
Clermont-Ferrand, France. Twenty-four young women participated in this study and were randomized into two groups: Group 1 received 50 mg
Fe daily, and group 2 received 50 mg Fe twice weekly for 3 months. On day 10 (D10) and on day 90 (D90) of Fe supplementation, blood samples
were obtained, and women received orally about 5 mg of 57Fe, and blood was sampled at different times over 24 h. The 57Fe absorption was
evaluated by calculating the areas under the curves (AUC). Fe and oxidative stress status were also assessed.
Results: 57Fe absorption was similar in both groups on D10 but was greatly decreased in Group 1 and remained high in Group 2 on D90. Fe
status was more improved in Group 1 than in Group 2. Oxidative stress status remained statistically unchanged.
Conclusions: Our study shows that daily Fe supplementation is able to correct an Fe deficiency much more than twice weekly Fe
supplementation in young women.

Introduction
Iron (Fe) deficiency, with resulting anemia, is the world's
most common micronutrient deficiency. Although it is mostly
found in the developing world, it is nevertheless frequent in
industrialized countries: in France, 22.7% of women of childbearing age show an Fe deficiency as defined by a serum ferritin
concentration ≤15 μg/L and 4.4% present Fe deficiency anemia
[1]. In the US, the prevalence of Fe deficiency in women of
child-bearing age ranges according to socio-economic groups
from 10% to 22%, and the prevalence of Fe deficiency anemia is
about 4% [2]. In young women with low serum ferritin
concentrations, even with no anemia, controlled random trials
have shown that Fe supplementation alleviates fatigue and
improves attention, memory and physical condition [3–5].
However, there is no consensus on the best mode of Fe
supplementation, in particular, the frequency of Fe administration (daily, once or twice weekly).
If Fe is given daily, the duodenal cells can be rapidly
overloaded, and so no further dose may be effective for several
days. This phenomenon has been called mucosal block. Trials in
rats suggest that the intestinal absorption of Fe supplement is
better if the Fe is given at the time the intestinal cells are being
renewed [6,7]. The dose of Fe is then taken up by a new cell,
which possesses a high absorption capacity. Intermittent Fe
supplementation may be especially appropriate for developing

countries because of its lower cost and possibly better
compliance. Trials conducted mainly in children and pregnant
and non-pregnant women have, however, yielded conflicting
results [8–12]. Parameters other than the mucosal block effect
have evidently to be taken into account [13].
The aim of this work was to compare the efficacy of two
modes of Fe supplementation, daily and twice weekly, on Fe
status and intestinal absorption at the start and end of treatment
in young women with marginal Fe deficiency. Given the prooxidative effect of Fe, important Fe supplementation might
cause an increase in oxidative stress. The effect of Fe
supplementation frequency on oxidative stress parameters was
therefore also examined.
Subjects and methods
Selection of volunteers
We conducted a controlled randomized trial in young Fedeficient female students. Fe deficiency was defined by serum
ferritin levels below 15 μg/L after two measurements. The other
inclusion criteria were age 18 to 30 years, hemoglobin above
100 g/L, and no significant health disorders. The exclusion
criteria were gastro-intestinal symptoms, previous intolerance to
Fe treatment, ongoing treatment with minerals or other micronutrients, C-reactive protein above 10 mg/L, ALAT > 1.5 of the
normal value, presence of anti-hepatitis C or anti-HIV
antibodies, or presence of HBs antigen.
This trial was approved by the regional consultative
committee on the protection of persons in biomedical research,
Auvergne, France. Female students of the University of
Auvergne reporting to the university healthcare service were
invited to be screened for Fe deficiency by a serum ferritin
assay. In all, 553 female students were screened: 104 (18.8%)
had serum ferritin levels <15 μg/L, and these were sent a letter
asking them to consult the university healthcare service or their
own physician. Sixty-six students showed up and were seen by
one of the investigating physicians. Of these, 27 agreed to
participate in the trial for which they gave their written informed
consent. Two were excluded, one for a hemoglobin level
<100 g/L and the other for a second serum ferritin assay value
>15 μg/L. Twenty-five volunteers were then randomized to
participate in the trial. One patient withdrew from the trial
before D10 of treatment for personal reasons. Finally, 24
volunteers were included in the trial and 21 volunteers
completed the trial (see Fig. 1).

Treatment and randomization
The Fe treatment used was a commercially available oral
solution of Fe chloride (FeCl2, 4H2O) in 5 ml vials containing
178 mg of Fe chloride, i.e., 50 mg Fe in the form of ferrous Fe
and 100 mg of ascorbic acid (Fer UCB®, UCB Pharma SA,
Nanterre, France). The volunteers were asked to take the Fe
outside mealtimes. The volunteers included were randomized
into two groups with the aid of a randomization table: Group 1
received one 50 mg vial of ferrous Fe once a day for 90 days.
Group 2 received one 50 mg vial of ferrous Fe twice a week for
90 days. The vials were given to the volunteers in two 45-day
batches. The volunteers were asked to return any unused vials to
evaluate compliance.
Evaluation of Fe status
Blood Fe status was explored during an 8-day period before
the first intake of treatment (day 0) and on D90 of treatment.
The following blood parameters were used to explore Fe status:
(i) serum ferritin (immuno-turbidimetric method using latex
particles coated with monoclonal antibodies directed against
human ferritin; normal range: 20–200 μg/L for women), (ii)
serum soluble transferrin receptor/TfR (immunoturbidimetric
method using latex particles coated with monoclonal antibodies
directed against human serum transferrin receptor; reference
range 1.79–4.63 mg/L for women), (iii) serum Fe (colorimetric
method; normal range 10–40 mmol/L for women), and plasma
transferrin (immuno-turbidimetric method using latex particles
coated with monoclonal antibodies directed against human
transferrin; normal range 2–3.5 g/L) [Roche Diagnostics,
Meylan, France]. Transferrin saturation was determined using
the formula [Fe (mmol/L)/transferrin (g/L) × 23] × 100. Blood
counts were measured with an automated analyzer (Technicon
H*3, Technicon Instruments Corp, Tarrytown, NY).
Study of Fe absorption using a stable isotope
The stable isotope used to determine Fe absorption was 57Fe.
It was supplied as its oxide form by Trace Sciences International
Corp (Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada). Its isotopic composition was as follows: 0.01% of 54Fe, 1.17% of 56Fe, 96.66% of 57Fe and 2.16% 58Fe as Fe2O3. A solution of 250 mg/L of Fe
was prepared by the pharmacy at the Clermont-Ferrand hospital
using the following procedure: exactly 250 mg of Fe
(241.65 mg of 57Fe) as oxide was placed in a 250 mL beaker,
wetted with 10 mL of demineralized water, and 10 mL of 30%
Suprapure HCl was added gradually with continuous stirring
and heating on a hotplate (100°C), to yield a clear dark yellow
liquid. 150 mL of demineralized water was then added to dilute
this solution, which turned a very pale yellow. The solution was
transferred into a 1000 mL graduated flask, and 250 mL of
0.2 M NaOH was added stepwise in 5 mL portions. The pH of
the resulting solution was between 2 and 4. The solution was
topped up to 1000 mL with demineralized water. Lastly, the
solution was filtered through a 0.45-μm filter and split into
20 ml aliquots in flasks. These flasks were autoclaved for
20 min at 121°C. The Fe concentration was 0.25 mg/mL, and
the quantity of Fe dispensed to the volunteers by the oral route
was 5 mg per patient.
Iron absorption was studied on D10 and D90. In Group 1,
D10 was the time of the tenth dose of Fe. In Group 2, D10 was
the time of the third dose, the previous dose being on D6. After
a standard breakfast (French white bread, butter, coffee, milk
and sugar) taken at 08:15, the isotopic Fe solution and a vial of
50 mg of Fe were administered at 10:00 h with a glass of water.
Ten blood samples (3.5 mL) were taken to determine the
absorption of Fe at the following times: before intake, 0.5 h, 1 h,
1.5 h, 2 h, 3 h, 4 h, 6 h, 8 h, and 24 h after intake of the isotope.
The 57Fe absorption was evaluated by calculating the area under
the curves (AUC) expressed in μg of 57Fe per liter of serum and
per hour (μg 57Fe/L/h) from H0 to H24 after administration of
the isotope. The AUC values were calculated by the trapezium
method [14,15]. The justification of the applied approach is
largely developed in the discussion.
Serum Fe stable isotope ratio measurement (57Fe/56Fe) was
carried out by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry
(ICP-MS) using an Elan 6100 DRC, Perkin Elmer Sciex
apparatus. A sample of 100 μL of plasma was taken after blood
centrifugation: 200 μL of 100 g/L oxalic acid and 50 μL of 12.5 N
NaOH were added. After mixing and centrifugation, 200 μL of
supernatant was taken, and 50 μL of a 500 μg/L solution of
indium was added (as internal standard). The solution was then
topped up to 2.5 mL with 1% HNO3 and analyzed by ICP-MS.
Oxalic acid was added to precipitate the plasma calcium as
calcium oxalate because despite the collision chamber in the
apparatus, calcium–oxygen complexes with an atomic mass of
57 could still form secondarily. The achievable precision and
accuracy for routine 57Fe/56Fe isotope ratio measurement were
1.57% and 2.21%, respectively. The mass bias of the ICP/MS
was corrected thanks to a 50 μg Fe/l calibration point that was
run for each of the five samples.
Measurement of oxidative stress parameters
Three parameters reflecting oxidative stress were measured
in the volunteers' plasma: anti-oxidant capacity of the plasma,
thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and vitamin E.
These assays were performed on D0 and D90 for each patient
just before intake of Fe supplement. The plasma samples were
immediately placed at +4°C in the dark, centrifuged within the
following hour (10 min at 3000 rpm at +4°C), and frozen at
−80°C. Ferric reducing/anti-oxidant power of plasma (FRAP)
was determined using the method described by Benzie and
Strain [16]. Briefly, the EDTA plasma sample was mixed with
the FRAP reagent containing acetate buffer, 2,4,6 tri[2-pyridyl]-
s-triazine and FeCl3 solution. The solution absorbance was then
read against a blank at 593 nm. An external standard solution of
FeSO4 from 100 to 1000 μM was used. The regression equation
was then used to calculate the FRAP values of the samples
(units, μM Fe2+ per litter). TBARS determination was
performed according to Rayssiguier et al. [17]. Briefly, plasma
sample was mixed with TBA reagent and heated for 60 min at
100°C in acid medium. The formed TBARS were then extracted
702 M. Ruivard et al. / Clinical Biochemistry 39 (2006) 700–707
with n-butanol and assessed spectrofluorimetrically at the
following excitation and emission wavelengths, 532 and
553 nm, respectively. An external standard solution of
1,1,3,3-tetra-ethoxy-propane from 0.1 to 2 μM was used. The
regression equation was then used to calculate the TBARS
levels of the samples (units, μM TBARS/L). Vitamin E was
assayed using high performance liquid chromatography as
previously described [18].
Statistical analysis
The number of subjects required for the trial was calculated
from the expected difference in Fe absorption between Group 1
and Group 2. As the starting hypothesis was that the efficacy of
the two treatment schedules on Fe status, once a day or twice
weekly, would at least be similar, we expected an Fe absorption
(AUC) about 3.5 times greater in Group 2 than in Group 1. A
standard deviation of 50% of the higher value could be allowed,
as observed by Whittaker et al. [19]. For a Type 1 risk α of 0.05
and a power (1 − β) of 90%, the number of subjects required
was 12 per group. The data are given as mean ± SD.
For analysis in Fe absorption differences on D10 and D90
and the trend in Fe status between D1 and D90, the
Kolmogorov–Smirnov normality test was applied to each of
the parameters for the whole population. For the parameters
with a normal distribution, the Student's t test was used. For
parameters with non-normal distributions, the Mann and
Whitney test was used to compare the differences in trends
between the two groups (from D10 to D90 for AUC and from
D1 to D90 for the Fe status parameters), or the Wilcoxon signed
rank test to compare the trends in parameters within each group.
The χ2 test using the corrected Yates method was used to
compare the number of subjects on D90 with ferritin values
greater than or equal to 15 μg/L. A correlation between serum
ferritin and AUC on D90 was sought by calculating the nonparametric Spearmann correlation coefficient.
For the parameters of oxidative stress, the FRAP was used
for the power calculation. We expected a difference of 100 μM
Fe with a standard deviation of 100 μM Fe between the two
groups on D90. For a Type 1 risk α of 0.05 and for a number of
subjects of 12 per group, the power (1 − β) was 65% for the
parameters of oxidative stress.
Results
Twenty-four volunteers were randomized. Three volunteers
decided to drop out of the trial before D90; 2 from Group 1 (Fe
daily) and 1 from Group 2 (Fe twice weekly). The analysis
therefore concerned 21 volunteers (mean age 20.0 ± 1.6 years)
who participated fully in the trial: 11 in Group 1 (mean age
21.1 ± 2.1 years, mean body mass index 21.5 ± 4.2 kg/m2
) and
10 in Group 2 (mean age 19.4 ± 1.3 years, mean body mass
index 19.8 ± 1.8 kg/m2
). No statistical difference was observed
between the two groups at D0 in hemoglobin (P = 0.30), in
plasma TfR (P = 0.55), but a significant difference was
observed in serum ferritin (P = 0.03). Six patients were
suffering from Fe deficiency anemia (hemoglobin <120 g/L): 3

in Group 1 and 3 in Group 2. Three patients in Group 1 (one of
them dropped out) and two patients in Group 2 experienced
minor intestinal adverse effects. Fe supplementation compliance was 100% in the 21 patients who completed the full study.
The values of Fe status at the start (D1) and end (D90) of the
trial in the 21 volunteers are shown in Table 1. Within each of
the two groups, the increase in ferritin was significant; 7
volunteers in Group 1 and 1 patient in Group 2 showed ferritin
values >15 μg/L after the 90 days of treatment (P = 0.04); serum
ferritin increased by 239% in Group 1 and by 122% in Group 2.
Comparison of trends in averages between the two groups
showed that this increase was significant (P = 0.03). Moreover,
the fall in TfR level within the groups was significant
(P < 0.01). The TfR level fell by 31% in Group 1 and by
13% in Group 2, and this decrease was significant (P = 0.03).
The AUC patterns and the individual evolution of Fe
absorption in both groups are shown in Fig. 2. After 10 days of
treatment, i.e., at the tenth daily dose of Fe for Group 1 and the
third one for Group 2, the absorption of 57Fe was not different in
the two groups (AUC = 139 ± 123 μg 57Fe/L/h for Group 1 and
169 ± 106 μg 57Fe/L/h for Group 2, P = 0.55). If we include in
this analysis the 3 volunteers who dropped out of the trial after
D10, the Fe absorption values also remained statistically
equivalent on D10; AUC = 171 ± 138 μg 57Fe/L/h for Group
1 and 161 ± 111 μg 57Fe/L/h for Group 2 (P = 0.85). After
90 days of Fe treatment, there was a significant fall in Fe
absorption in Group 1 (−61% of the value at D10, P = 0.03),
while there was a non-significant increase in Fe absorption in
Group 2 (+12% of the value on D10, P = 0.55). This resulted
in a significant difference in Fe absorption on D90:
AUC = 54 ± 43 μg 57Fe/L/h in Group 1 and AUC =
189 ± 120 μg 57Fe/L/h in Group 2 (P = 0.03) due to opposite
trends in the two groups. Moreover, there was a significant
inverse correlation for the whole of the population on D90
between the values of serum ferritin and those of Fe absorption
(r = −0.63, P < 0.01), which was especially marked for ferritin
values lower than 20 μg/L (r = −0.69, P < 0.01) (Fig. 3).
However, when the correlations between AUC and serum
ferritin at D90 were performed separately for each group, there
were no significant correlations for either group (Fig. 3).
The oxidative stress parameters did not vary significantly
before and after the 90 days of treatment for either Fe
supplementation modes (Table 2).
Discussion
This trial shows that Fe absorption was not affected after
10 days of daily supplementation compared to twice weekly
supplementation. These results suggest that there is apparently
no mucosal block during Fe supplementation. After 3 months of
Fe supplementation, the Fe absorption fell appreciably in Group
1 receiving daily Fe supplementation but remained relatively
high in the group receiving twice weekly Fe supplementation.
Nevertheless, the Fe absorption observed on D90 in each group
separately was not significantly correlated with Fe status,
represented by serum ferritin level. Indeed, this correlation was
only non-significantly positive (r = 0.12, P = 0.72) in Group 1
and non-significantly negative (r = −0.33, P = 0.35) in Group 2.
This lack of significance may be due to the low number of
observations in each group and to the high SD values. These

(n = 11) received 50 mg supplemental iron per day, and Group 2 (n = 10) received 50 mg supplemental iron twice per week for 90 days. Fe absorption was measured on
two occasions: on D10 and on D90 of Fe supplementation. Panels A and B show AUC patterns with mean ± SD in the AUC body for each group. Panel C shows

non-significant positive (in Group 1) and negative (in Group 2)
correlations are in agreement with the better improvement in Fe
status in Group 1 than in Group 2. However, the Fe absorption
observed on D90 in both groups combined was significantly
correlated with Fe status (r = −0.63, P < 0.01). This correlation
was even greater when it was restricted to patients with serum
ferritin less than 20 μg/L at D90 (r = −0.69, P < 0.01). Given
that most of the volunteers supplemented twice weekly still have
a relatively low ferritin level on D90, unlike those supplemented
daily, the difference in Fe absorption observed between the two
groups is probably not attributable to the mode of supplementation, but to the difference in Fe status on D90. Indeed, the two
Fe supplementation modes corrected Fe status in our volunteers
as measured by a significant increase in serum ferritin levels and

correlation between serum ferritin level and AUC at D90 of Fe supplementation was sought by calculating the non-parametric Spearmann correlation coefficient.

by a significant decrease in plasma TfR levels after 3 months of
Fe supplementation. However, this correction was better in
Group 1 receiving daily Fe supplementation than in Group 2.
The main argument for intermittent Fe supplementation is
the synchronization of Fe input with renewal of the intestinal
mucosa to circumvent mucosal block, described for the first
time in animals in the 1940s by Hahn et al. [20] and later studied
in detail by Stewart et al. [21]. This argument is supported by
the results of more recent animal trials [6,7,22]. However,
results in animals are conflicting: the work of Benito et al. [23]
showed that intestinal Fe absorption in rats was identical when
Fe was administered continuously or intermittently for 3 days
which is in agreement with our results at D10. The recent work
of Frazer et al. [22] suggested an inhibition of Fe absorption
after a single oral dose in Fe-deficient rats, peaking after 12 h,
and then gradually reverting to normal in 72 h, but this effect is
ascribed to a decrease in the expression of divalent metal
transporter 1 (DMT1) and brush border ferrireductase (Dcytb)
rather than to cell renewal rate. This may thus explain why the
duration of mucosal block can be shorter. It is now known that
the expression of these Fe transporters (DMT1 and Dcytb)
depends on the expression of hepatic hepcidin [24]. Hepcidin is
most probably the main regulator of intestinal Fe absorption: its
gene is repressed in conditions of deficiency, while its
overexpression causes severe Fe-deficiency anemia [25,26]. A
recent animal trial has shown that an exogenous supply of
hepcidin causes an inhibition of Fe absorption within 24 h [27].
Hence, it is possible that hepatic Fe provision rapidly favors
hepcidin gene overexpression, inhibiting intestinal Fe absorption during subsequent Fe administration, provided the Fe
deficiency is not too marked before treatment. This effect might
explain why mucosal block occurs during repeated Fe
administration in populations in which Fe deficiency is very
moderate and might account for the discrepancies observed in
human clinical trials. Thus, Viteri et al. [28] studied a
population similar to ours: young women with an average age
of 22 years in an industrialized country (USA), but among
whom only 16% were Fe deficient, with the Fe supplementation
being dispensed to the entire population. In this controlled
randomized trial, a 7-month weekly supplementation with
60 mg of Fe was found to be more efficacious than a 3-month
daily supplementation at the same dose when evaluated at
7 months. Lastly, Cook and Reddy [29] examined, in a
comparable population, the effect of Fe supplementation mode
on intestinal Fe absorption (measured using radioisotopes).
After 6 days of daily Fe supplementation (50 mg of elemental
Fe), no difference was found from young women who had taken
no Fe for 6 days. Again, our findings at D10 are consistent with
these results. In addition, we demonstrate that the long-term
difference in Fe absorption observed appears to depend on the
Fe status in terms of ferritin: this supports results showing a
close link between Fe status measured by ferritin levels and
intestinal Fe absorption [30].
Different techniques may be used to determine mineral
intestinal absorption in humans. Stable isotopes are very useful
tools to investigate different aspects of absorption and
metabolism of minerals. For the Fe absorption test, the
erythrocyte isotope incorporation technique is the golden
approach [31]. However, we applied in this study the AUC
technique for many reasons: (a) this technique has been
validated and used by Barrett et al. [32,33] and very recently
by others using radioactive or stable Fe isotopes [34,35]; (b) the
amount of Fe isotope used in the erythrocyte isotope
incorporation technique is at least ten to fifteen times higher
than in the AUC technique, which makes the study very
expensive [36]; (c) finally, we wanted to establish the relative
absorption of Fe in the same volunteers receiving different
doses of Fe where the AUC technique may be satisfactory.
Given the pro-oxidant effects of Fe, aggressive Fe
supplementation might result in an increase in oxidative stress
[37]. Some workers have reported an oxidative stress of this
type in rats [38,39] and humans [40,41], while others failed to
observe any such effect [42]. Our results show no modification
of oxidative stress parameters, irrespective of the supplementation frequency; it is unlikely that this absence of significant
change is merely due to the small sample, as no trend was
observed, although the power of this study was poor for the
parameters of oxidative stress (1 − β = 65% for 12 subjects per
group, but only 60% for 11 subjects per group; see section
“Subjects and methods”). Nevertheless, two possible explanations can account for these results: (a) after its arrival in the
bloodstream, the Fe is immediately bound to transferrin; Fe
linked to transferrin is not pro-oxidant; (b) addition of Fe to
human plasma does not result in lipid peroxidation or free
radical production, but simply oxidation of vitamin C [43] or
other anti-oxidants. It may be assumed that the female students
enrolled in the trial were not appreciably deficient in vitamin C
and that the slight Fe enrichment of their plasma was not
sufficient to oxidize all the vitamin C present. Lastly, the Fe
deficiency is accompanied by a fall in the activity of antioxidant enzyme systems such as superoxide dismutase,
catalase, and glutathione peroxidase, in humans [44]. It is
possible that the Fe supplement, in correcting the deficiency,
also restores anti-oxidant capacity, thereby offsetting the
oxidative effect of the Fe itself.
In conclusion, Fe absorption did not seem to depend on Fe
supplementation modes, as shown at D10, but absorption
depended largely on Fe status, as shown at D90. Moreover, our
trial showed that daily Fe supplementation can provide a better
correction of Fe deficiency than a twice weekly supplementation for 3 months in young women with low ferritin levels. The
Fe supplementation did not appear to induce oxidative stress in
our volunteers as measured in terms of three recognized plasma
markers.
