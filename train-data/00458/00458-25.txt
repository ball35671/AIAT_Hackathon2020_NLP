Abstract
Objective: High prevalences of vitamin A deficiency and anaemia among adolescents warrant interventions. This study evaluated the effectiveness of school-based supplementation to reduce anaemia and improve vitamin A status.

Design: School-based, grade-randomized, intervention.

Subjects and setting: In all, 1757 girls and 1859 boys, aged 12–15 y, in 24 Junior High Schools.

Interventions: Weekly supplementation for 14 weeks with 60 mg iron and 250 μg folate (Fe group; n=978), 10 000 IU vitamin A (VA group; n=970) or both (VAFe group; n=1042) to subjects in 15 schools, compared to subjects in nine other schools not receiving supplements (control; n=626).

Results: The baseline anaemia prevalence (Hb <120 g/l) in girls was 20% (prepubertal) and 26% (pubertal), and in boys 24% (pre-pubertal) and 11% (pubertal). Serum retinol concentrations were low (<1.05 μmol/l) in 41% of boys and 45% of girls. The interventions did not increase haemoglobin concentrations. Serum retinol concentration of boys, but not girls, in the VA group increased (0.33 vs 0.07 μmol/l in controls; P<0.01). The risk factors for low serum retinol concentration were lower baseline serum retinol concentration (OR 0.02–0.03) with, for girls, nightblindness at baseline (OR 5.88), and for boys, not receiving vitamin A (OR control: 1.00; VA: 0.37; Fe: 0.77; VAFe: 0.34) and maternal illiteracy (OR mother never attended school 1.00, mother received any formal education 0.17–0.33).

Conclusions: Supplementation with vitamin A increased serum retinol concentration of boys. Iron supplementation did not change Hb. This appeared to be due to poor compliance, and partly related to side effects.

Sponsorship: This study was funded by USAID through the OMNI Project.

Introduction
Anaemia and vitamin A deficiency are very prevalent throughout the world. Globally, 55% of underfives and 56% of pregnant women are anaemic (ACC/SCN, 1997). In Indonesia, prevalences are similar (UNICEF, 1996). Among Asian adolescents, anaemia prevalences have been found to be range from 11 to 26% (Sunethra Atukorala & De Silva, 1990; Ahmed et al, 1996; Angeles-Agdeppa et al, 1997; Soekarjo et al, 2001). Vitamin A deficiency is also prevalent in Indonesian preschool children (51% serum retinol <0.70 μmol/l; Muhilal & Permaesih, 1994), and pregnant (33.5%, Suharno et al, 1992), lactating (36%; de Pee et al, 1995) and adolescent women (30% <0.70 μmol/l; Angeles-Agdeppa et al, 1997).

The main cause of anaemia and vitamin A deficiency is inadequate intake of bioavailable iron and vitamin A, in addition to other factors like excessive blood loss, frequent infections and other micronutrient deficiencies. Both conditions have negative consequences for health, development, well-being and productivity (Delisle et al, accessed 2002). In addition, vitamin A deficiency plays a role in the development of anaemia (Mejia et al, 1977; Bloem, 1995), and vitamin A supplementation can enhance the effect of iron supplementation (Mejia & Chew, 1988; Suharno et al, 1993).

Adolescence (the period between the ages of 10 and 19 y, according to the WHO definition) is the period of the third-fastest growth a human being experiences, after the foetal and infancy periods (Tanner, 1978). This rapid growth highly increases the physiological needs for micronutrients such as iron and vitamin A (Brabin & Brabin, 1992; Antilla & Siimes, 1996), and thus the susceptibility to deficiency in these phases of the lifecycle. As important changes (physiological, psychological and social) occur, and many adult patterns are established, adolescence provides a window of opportunity to prevent adult health problems. However, adolescents’ needs are not met by the health services, especially in developing countries.

Iron supplementation programmes focus mainly on pregnant women, while vitamin A capsule distribution programmes for underfives and postpartum women exist in Indonesia as in many other countries. Supplementation during adolescence might be more effective as it could take place over a relatively long period of time, and weekly dosing would be sufficient (Fogelholm et al, 1994; Viteri, 1996; Angeles-Agdeppa et al, 1997). Schools and worksites may be appropriate distribution channels, while teachers and peer group support to promote behavioural change might lead to higher compliance than found among pregnant women.

The present study was aimed to test the feasibility and effectiveness of weekly vitamin A and iron supplementation when delivered in a programmatic context to adolescent girls and boys attending Junior High Schools in rural and urban East Java, Indonesia. It was implemented by Helen Keller International in cooperation with the Ministry of Health of the Government of Indonesia as part of the GIRLS (Gizi: Intervensi Remaja Lewat Sekolah/Nutrition Intervention for Adolescents through Schools) Project.

Methods
Subjects
24 schools were selected to represent the two main school types in Indonesia as well as both rural and urban locations. Eight rural general Junior High Schools (R-SMP=rural Sekolah Menengah Pertama) were randomly selected from two districts (Bangkalan and Sampang) on the island of Madura. The urban area was represented by 16 randomly selected schools in Surabaya, the capital of East Java: nine urban general Junior High Schools (U-SMP=urban Sekolah Menengah Pertama) and seven Islamic Junior High Schools (U-MTs=urban Madrasah Tsanawiyah). Pupils in all selected schools were of middle and low socioeconomic class, of Javanese or Madurese ethnicity, and Muslim, except for one U-SMP, where the majority was Christian Chinese.

Except in the control schools, all pupils received supplements. However, data were collected only on pupils who were between 12 and 15 y old at the start of the study, and whose parents gave written informed consent for taking supplements and being enrolled in the data collection (91.4% of eligible pupils; n=5166).

This study was conducted between October 1996 and May 1997, in collaboration with the Indonesian Ministries of Health and Education after approval from the Medical Ethical Committee of the Ministry of Health, Indonesia.

Sample size
Based on the sparse data available at the time on anaemia prevalence among Indonesian adolescent girls (Schultink, 1995, personal communication), an anaemia prevalence of 30% was presumed. In order to be able to detect a 50% reduction from this prevalence at α=0.05 and β=0.80, and accounting for an expected dropout rate of 25%, 168 subjects per intervention group were needed (total 672).

Design
Adolescents from 15 schools (four U-MTs, seven U-SMP and four R-SMP) (n=2990) were randomly selected to receive weekly supplements, while adolescents in the other nine schools (three U-MTs, two U-SMP and four R-SMP) served as controls (n=1750). In each of the schools receiving supplements, each of the three grades was randomly allocated to receive one of the three supplementation regimes: weekly 10 000 IU vitamin A (VA group; n=970), weekly 60 mg elemental iron (as ferrous sulphate) plus 250 μg folate (Fe group; n=978) or weekly 10 000 IU vitamin A and 60 mg elemental iron plus 250 μg folate (VA+Fe groups; n=1042) (Figure 1). Owing to the theoretical possibility of pregnancy occurring in the study population, the supplements used in the intervention complied with the official recommendations of the Indonesian government for safe use of supplements in pregnancy. Therefore, the dosage of vitamin A did not exceed 10 000 IU and iron-folate tablets were used, such as are routinely distributed to pregnant women in Indonesia. The red iron/folic acid tablets and yellow sugar-coated vitamin A tablets were all produced locally (Kimia Farma, Jakarta, Indonesia). All pupils were aware of which supplement(s) they were taking and they were told that the supplements would improve their health and prevent/cure anaemia. This information was also disseminated to the parents by means of a leaflet, which was part of the informed consent procedure.

Field workers supplied drinking water and the pupils took the supplements in their classrooms. One or two field workers supervised a classroom of approximately 50 pupils. Intensive supervision was avoided as the purpose of the study was to implement the distribution in a way resembling as closely as possible the context of a school-based programme. The supplements were given once weekly for 3 months (a total of 14 times). Nine tablets were taken under group supervision by trained fieldworkers, while the five tablets that had to be taken during the Muslim fasting month and school holidays were distributed at the schools and taken home with instruction to take them once a week on a fixed day.

Data collection
At baseline, trained field workers (the majority of whom were graduates of the Nutrition Academy in Malang, East Java) collected data on the socioeconomic background and health status of the pupils, using a standard questionnaire. After the intervention, all data were collected again, except those on socioeconomic background. Self-reported compliance for the supplementation was recorded for a random subsample (n=413; 13.8%) after the intervention.

The dietary intake of vitamin A was assessed semiquantitatively with the 24-h vitamin A semiquantitative (24 VASQ) method (De Pee et al, 1999), and pubertal status was assessed with the status quo method (Cameron, 1993), using menarche and first nocturnal emission as indicators for the onset of puberty in girls and boys, respectively.

Anthropometric measurements consisted of height (using microtoise (Cameron, 1986), recorded to the nearest 0.1 cm), weight with light clothing and without shoes (using Soehnle digital weighing scales, recorded to the nearest 0.1 kg), and mid upper-arm circumference (MUAC) (using a special measuring tape developed by the Indonesian Department of Health, recorded to the nearest 0.1 cm).

Haemoglobin concentration was assessed in all adolescents with the HemoCue device (HemoCue™, Angelholm, Sweden) using peripheral blood from the fingertip. However, venous blood for HPLC analysis of serum retinol concentration was collected only from a random subsample drawn from all grades in all schools (11.4%, n=625) (see Figure 1). Trained nurses and laboratory staff drew approximately 3 cc blood from the antecubital vein between 0800 and 1400. Between blood collection and serum collection, the samples were stored in the dark on ice. Sera were obtained the same day by centrifuging the blood at 750 × g for 15 min and stored at −20°C. Retinol analysis was carried out by HPLC (column: Bondapak C18, Waters, Milford, MA, USA; detector Waters LCM1+; standards: Sigma; solvent: Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) with methanol/water (90/10 v/v) as mobile phase (Thurnham et al, 1988).

The pupils in the control schools were not seen during the supplementation intervention, but the data collections at the start and end of the study were similar to that in the other schools.

Data analysis and statistics
Results are presented on all subjects in the intervention groups and on a stratified random sample of the control group (n=626) (see Figure 1). This was done to arrive at the same proportional representation of the three school types (urban and rural SMP and urban MTs) as in the supplementation groups. As type of school is an important indicator of socioeconomic status and closely related to haemoglobin concentration (Soekarjo et al, 2001), it may be a significant confounder in the assessment of effects of supplementation.

Values are expressed as means±s.d., quartiles (median (25–75%)) or percentages. To assess comparability between groups at baseline, χ2 tests, Kruskal–Willis and Mann–Whitney U-tests and analysis of variance (ANOVA) were applied. To assess the change in haemoglobin and serum retinol concentrations in the different intervention groups before and after the intervention, ANOVA and a paired t-test were referred to. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the relative risk of having low serum retinol concentration after the intervention for different factors (Snedecor & Cochran, 1980). The computer program SPSS (SPSS 7.5 for Windows, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used for statistical analyses. A P-value of <0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.

Results
At baseline, data were collected from 5166 subjects. After 3 months of intervention, data were collected again from 4904 of these subjects. Complete sets were available on 4810 subjects (2990 in intervention schools and 1820 in control schools). Dropout during the study (5.1%) was mainly caused by absenteeism on several consecutive days during the end-line data collection. There was no difference in dropout rate between the four groups. In the intervention groups, dropout of boys was similar to that of girls, but in the control group 6.6% of boys dropped out compared to only 3.9% among girls. Subjects who dropped out were slightly older than those who remained in the study, and more subjects in the urban religious schools dropped out compared to the other school types. Otherwise, there were no differences between those who finished the study and those who did not. All boys and girls in the supplementation groups with complete sets of data were included in the analyses (n=2990), while a selection was made from the control group (n=626) as described in the data analysis section (Figure 1).

The baseline characteristics of the 1757 girls and 1859 boys on whom data were used for this paper are shown in Table 1a and b. A proportion of the subjects did not know their parent's educational level. They were not excluded and the numbers of subjects for whom this information is available are mentioned in the footnotes to the table. There were no differences in sex distribution between the four groups. Among girls, all groups were similar with respect to the percentage of pubertal subjects, vitamin A intake from animal sources and the level of maternal education. Boys in the four groups did not differ with regard to the percentage of pubertal subjects, vitamin A intake from animal and plant sources and anthropometric indicators. There was no difference in vitamin A intake from either animal or plant sources between girls and boys.

Paternal educational level and anthropometric indicators were slightly worse for girls in the control and VA+Fe groups compared to the other two groups; however, this was not related to differences in any of the micronutrient-related indicators (haemoglobin and serum retinol concentrations, and nightblindness). Boys in the control group had parents with lower education than in the other groups, indicative of lower socioeconomic status.

There were no differences in any of the indicators of micronutrient status among the girls, while among boys there were no differences among the groups in the prevalence of anaemia or nightblindness. However, the mean haemoglobin concentrations were slightly higher among boys in the iron group compared to the VA group, and the mean serum retinol concentration was higher in boys in the VA+Fe groups than in the VA group.

Differentiation between pubertal and prepubertal subjects is not shown in Table 1a and b, as this would make the table very complicated, but the proportions of pubertal subjects in each group are indicated and were similar in the four groups for both boys and girls. Anaemia prevalence was 20% among prepubertal and 26% among pubertal girls, 24% among prepubertal and 11% among pubertal boys. There was a positive relationship between pubertal status and haemoglobin concentration in boys (129±13 g/l in prepubertal boys vs 136±14 g/l in pubertal boys, P<0.001), but not in girls (128±11 vs 126±12 g/l).

Serum retinol concentrations were <1.05 μmol/l in 41.4% of boys and 45.1% of girls. The proportions of subjects with serum retinol concentrations <0.70 μmol/l were 11.4% boys (range 6.5–10.8%) and 7.7% girls (range 4.4–9.3%), and did not differ between the four groups in either sex. There was a positive relationship in girls between puberty and serum retinol concentration: 1.06±0.32 vs 1.19±0.43 μmol/l in prepubertal and pubertal girls (P<0.05). The same trend was seen in boys, although it was not significant: 1.11±0.43 vs 1.21±0.45 μmol/l in prepubertal and pubertal boys, respectively (NS).

After the supplementation was over, self-reported compliance for iron supplements was collected from 136 boys and 134 girls and for vitamin A supplements from 134 boys and 137 girls. Almost all respondents (90–97%) claimed to have taken at least half the tablets distributed under supervision (data not shown). Without supervision, however, this proportion dropped to 50–70% (Figure 2). Self-reported compliance without supervision was higher among girls than among boys, and higher in the VA+Fe groups than in the groups that received only one type of supplement. More girls than boys reported to have taken at least 50% of the iron tablets without supervision (70.1 vs 50.7%; P<0.05), but there was no such difference for vitamin A (70.1 vs 61.2%; NS).

There was a nonsignificant relationship between reported side effects (in particular, nausea, vomiting and bad taste/smell often associated with nausea, which together are referred to here as gastrointestinal (GI) side effects) and reported compliance among girls. Girls who reported GI side effects of iron tablets (41.4% of 134 interviewed girls) reported a lower compliance to iron tablets when there was no supervision than girls without GI side effects: 60.0 vs 76.9% reported having taken at least 50% of the tablets. No such relationship was present for complaints about GI side effects of vitamin A tablets (reported by 16.2% of girls). Among boys, no relationship between side effects of iron tablets (reported by 24.3% of 136 boys) and reported compliance was found. However, boys who complained about GI side effects of vitamin A tablets (13.4%) were less compliant than those who did not complain (38.9 vs 64.6% reported having taken at least 50% of the vitamin A tablets; P<0.05). No relationship, however, was found between reported side effects and impact of the intervention on haemoglobin or serum retinol concentrations.

Initially, analyses of the effect of the supplementation were performed on the total population. As no effect of the supplementation was found, analyses were repeated in subgroups based on pubertal and anaemia status or serum retinol concentration.

The change in haemoglobin concentration in these subgroups is shown in Table 2. Anaemic pubertal girls in the Fe group showed a higher increase in the mean haemoglobin concentration than those in the VA group. However, there was no difference between either of these groups and the control group, and no effect was found in the VA+Fe group. Among anaemic prepubertal girls, there was a nonsignificant trend of an increasing effect in the VA, Fe and VA+Fe groups, but the control group did nearly as well as the VA+Fe group. Among nonanaemic girls, and among boys, no effect of the interventions was found. However, anaemic pubertal boys seemed to respond better to vitamin A, with or without iron, than to iron alone, while the change in haemoglobin concentration in the Fe group was comparable to that in the control group. No significance was reached due to the small numbers of anaemic pubertal boys.

The interventions did not increase the serum retinol concentrations of girls (Table 3). When all boys were considered, regardless of their initial serum retinol concentrations or pubertal status, subjects in the VA group showed a significantly (P<0.01) higher increase than those in the control group. After differentiation for pubertal status, this effect occurred in the pubertal boys (P<0.05), while among prepubertal boys it did not reach statistical significance. Among boys with normal serum retinol concentrations (≥1.05 μmol/l), no impact of the interventions was found. Boys who received vitamin A alone but not in combination with iron experienced a significantly higher increase in serum retinol concentration. This effect was also found in the subgroup of pubertal boys, but not among prepubertal boys. No effect of the interventions on serum retinol concentration was found among boys with normal baseline serum retinol concentrations. However, among those with low serum retinol concentrations, boys receiving vitamin A alone experienced a higher increase than those receiving iron only or nothing. In the group receiving both vitamin A and iron, the increase in serum retinol concentrations was only higher than that in the iron-only group, while no difference was found with the control group. Within the subgroup of boys with low serum retinol concentrations, prepubertal boys experienced a significantly higher increase in serum retinol concentrations in the vitamin A only group compared to the control group, but not in the group receiving both vitamin A and iron. In contrast, pubertal boys receiving vitamin A either alone or with iron had a higher increase than those receiving iron alone, but not than those receiving nothing. The fact that the increase was higher in the VA than in the VA+Fe group might be explained by the higher baseline serum retinol concentrations in this latter group.

Full size table
When the percentage of low serum retinol concentration (<1.05 μmol/l) is considered, rather than the mean serum retinol concentration, there is a clear impact of both VA and VA+Fe in the boys, while no effect is seen in the girls. Of the boys with low serum retinol concentrations at baseline, only 29.2% (n=14) and 24.0% (n=6) still had concentrations below the cutoff after the intervention, when they had received vitamin A alone or with iron, respectively, compared to 61.5% (n=16) and 60.6% (n=20) in the control and iron groups (P<0.005). In the girls, the corresponding figures were 50.0 (n=16) in the control group, 52.8 (n=19) in the VA group, 56.1 (n=23) in the Fe group and 44.8 (n=13) in the VA+Fe group. It was not possible to distinguish between prepubertal and pubertal subjects, as the numbers of subjects with low baseline serum retinol concentrations were too small for this analysis.

As no impact of the intervention was found on haemoglobin concentration, logistic regression analysis was only performed to assess the risk of having low serum retinol concentrations after the intervention (Table 4). In girls (n=280), the only factors increasing this risk were having a low serum retinol concentration at baseline and being nightblind at baseline. Boys (n=284) had a higher risk of having a low serum retinol concentration when they had a mother with no formal education, and received either no supplementation or iron only, in addition to having a lower baseline serum retinol concentration.

Discussion
This school-based intervention among 12–15 y-old adolescents found no effect on haemoglobin concentration of 14 weeks of supplementation with 60 mg iron+250 μg folate and 10 000 IU vitamin A, either alone or in combination. While there was no effect of the supplementation on the serum retinol concentration of girls, boys showed an increase in serum retinol concentration after supplementation with vitamin A alone but not with iron.

At the time this study was designed, not much literature was available on iron and vitamin A supplementation among adolescents. However, based on supplementation studies in other groups like children (Angeles et al, 1993) and pregnant women (Suharno et al, 1993), it was deemed reasonable to expect an impact in adolescents as well. Lately, other studies have shown the efficacy of weekly supplementation with iron and/or vitamin A to increase haemoglobin (and serum retinol) concentrations among adolescent girls (Angeles-Agdeppa et al, 1997, Tee et al, 1999, Ahmed et al, 2001). No studies among boys were found. The differences in findings with the present study may be explained by the following critical review of the various factors, which can cause differences in impact of the supplementation on haemoglobin and serum retinol concentration of adolescents.

The main difference is that those studies were efficacy trials and therefore only reported on compliers, while the study presented here assessed the effectiveness of supplementation in a programmatic setting. Only two studies included vitamin A in the intervention (Angeles-Agdeppa et al, 1997; Ahmed et al, 2001), and in particular the latter found results resembling those documented by Suharno et al (1993) in pregnant women. However, the subjects of both studies were older, were all postmenarcheal, had lower serum retinol concentrations and, in Ahmed et al's study, were all anaemic, which can explain part of the difference in impact. Tee et al found an increase in haemoglobin concentration of anaemic girls after iron/folate supplementation, but there was no placebo group to compare this with. Among nonanaemic girls, weekly supplementation with 120 mg but not 60 mg iron increased haemoglobin concentration. Their subjects were older, and no details on pubertal or socioeconomic status were provided. Recent studies among pregnant women also did not find an additional benefit of vitamin A supplementation on haemoglobin concentrations in pregnancy nor postpartum, nor of postpartum serum retinol concentrations (Muslimatun et al, 2001a, Muslimatun et al, 2001b, Semba et al, 2001).

The interventions were randomized per grade and the proportion of pupils attending the different types of schools was similar in all four treatment groups. The control group consisted of pupils from similar schools in the same area who did not receive any intervention and were measured at the same periods as the intervention groups. Differences between schools could thus not influence the results of the intervention. No difference was found between the control group and the intervention groups, and there is no reason to assume this would have been different had a placebo been used. Mix up of supplements between the different groups was highly unlikely because the supplements had different colours and no placebo was used.

The study coincided with Ramadan, the Muslim fasting month. This could not be avoided, because otherwise the time between school examinations (during which no supplementation and/or data collection activities were allowed in the schools) would have been insufficient for the supplementation to be effective. During Ramadan people generally consume more meat and other sources of haem iron, which might have led to higher haemoglobin concentrations. However, due to the double randomization scheme, there is no reason to assume that this effect, if at all present, differed between intervention groups.

During the fasting month and holidays supplements had to be taken at home without supervision (n=5 tablets). Self-reported compliance without supervision was low, but similar to what Angeles-Agdeppa et al (1997) found for supplements taken at home. Thus, it should be assumed that the actual duration of supplementation in this study was only 9 weeks, which was probably too short for the supplements to have an effect.

The fact that vitamin A supplements were not effective in increasing serum retinol concentration in girls and haemoglobin concentration in both girls and boys might be due to the fact that the dose was relatively low. A measure of 10 000 IU on a weekly basis amounts to only 428 retinol equivalents (RE)/day, while the RDA for vitamin A in this age group is 700 RE for girls aged 14–18 y and 900 RE for boys of the same age (US Institute of Medicine, 2000).

However, short duration and low vitamin A dose alone cannot completely explain these results. In boys with low serum retinol concentrations, the increase in serum retinol concentration in the two groups receiving vitamin A was almost twice as large as in the other two groups (and also compared to the girls). In addition, there was a nonsignificant increase in haemoglobin concentration among pubertal anaemic boys in these treatment groups, showing that the dose was probably adequate for boys.

The larger increase in serum retinol concentrations of boys with low initial serum retinol concentrations in the VA group compared to those in the VA+Fe groups was expected because of their lower baseline serum retinol concentrations. Owing to the similar baseline concentrations of girls and boys, and the lower recommended daily allowance (RDA), a similar increase would have been expected in girls. It is possible that the RDA for girls is either not correct or not applicable in this population, that subclinical infections were more prevalent among girls or that there were other factors selectively decreasing absorption in girls, despite the similar conditions of supplement consumption. However, another factor that potentially could explain the lack of impact particularly among the girls is poor compliance.

In view of the lack of impact found, it is highly probable that respondents over-reported compliance rates, and that this occurred more among girls than among boys. This is confirmed by reports from field workers that supplements were found on the floors of the schools, indicating that even under supervision, actual compliance was lower than reported, especially for iron. Thus, self-reporting is not a reliable tool to measure compliance. Almost all subjects claimed to have taken a considerable number of the supplements and as a result, there was no relationship between self-reported compliance and impact. This phenomenon of over-reporting compliance has also been found among Indonesian pregnant women (Schultink et al, 1993; Ridwan et al, 1996).

Most studies to date have focused on anaemic subjects. However, from a public health point of view, it may be worthwhile to target the whole population to have an impact among a subgroup, rather than identify subjects and then specifically target those. Therefore, this study included all pupils in the schools, but analyses were performed with the aim to determine differential effects in subgroups.

Based on these results, the authors conclude that: (1) anaemia and subclinical vitamin A deficiency are prevalent in the study population, (2) vitamin A supplementation is effective to increase serum retinol concentration in adolescent boys, in particular those with low serum retinol concentrations, but that 10 000 IU on a weekly basis is probably a relatively low dose, (3) there is a sex difference in response to iron and vitamin A supplementation, probably due to differences in compliance, which should be investigated further and (4) GI side effects appear to play an important role in decreasing compliance.

Policy and programme implications
Given the high prevalence of anaemia and subclinical vitamin A deficiency among adolescents, this group forms a window of opportunity to break the generational cycle of these deficiencies. It is becoming increasingly clear that micronutrient supplementation may be a long-term necessity and the efficacy of iron and vitamin A supplements in adolescent girls has been proven in strictly controlled trials. Where school enrolment is adequate, schools form a better entry point than the health system, especially in developing countries. Not only are future adults’ attitudes and behaviour formed in schools, but supplementation and health education can be integrated in the school curriculum.

However, this study shows that caution is called for when applying the results of controlled trials directly to programmes. More operations research should be dedicated to school-based supplementation with micronutrients in adolescents, focusing on improving effectiveness, in particular implementation, monitoring and compliance issues. Special efforts have to be undertaken to increase the involvement of teachers and students. The low compliance found in this study, in particular in the iron group, and its relationship with GI side effects, indicates the need to use better-quality iron tablets. The dose of vitamin A was relatively low and the impact of higher doses of weekly vitamin A supplementation, such as 20 000 IU, should be explored.
