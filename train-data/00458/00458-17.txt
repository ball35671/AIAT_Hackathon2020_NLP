Background/Objectives: Iron deficiency anemia is a major public health problem in developing countries and may affect school
performance and physical work capacity in nonpregnant adolescents, and may increase the risk of anemia during subsequent
teenage pregnancies. We assessed the effect of weekly iron (120 mg elemental iron) and vitamin A (25 000 IU) supplementation
on hemoglobin, iron status and malaria and nonmalaria morbidity in adolescent schoolgirls.
Subjects/Methods: A total of 279 schoolgirls aged 12–18 years from public primary schools in Kisumu, western Kenya. Doubleblind randomized placebo-controlled trial using a factorial design.
Results: Five months of iron supplementation was associated with a 0.52 g dl1 (0.21, 0.82) greater increase in hemoglobin
relative to iron placebo. The effect was only observed in girls with iron deficiency on enrollment (1.34 g dl1 (0.79, 1.88)), but
not in iron-replete girls (0.20 g dl1 (0.59, 0.18)). Similar differences in treatment effect were seen between menstruating
and nonmenstruating girls. The effect of iron was independent of vitamin A. The baseline prevalence of vitamin A deficiency was
low (6.7%) and no sustained increase in hemoglobin was seen with weekly vitamin A (0.07 g dl1 (0.38, 0.25)). Incidence of
malaria parasitemia was higher in the iron than iron-placebo groups (Rate ratio 1.33 (0.94, 1.88)).
Conclusions: Weekly iron supplementation results in substantial increases in hemoglobin concentration in adolescent
schoolgirls in western Kenya, which may outweigh possible risks caused by malaria, but only in iron-deficient or menstruating
girls and not in iron-replete and nonmenstruating girls.

Introduction
Anemia, including iron deficiency anemia, remains one of
the most widespread public health problems in developing
countries, with preschool children and pregnant women
most severely affected (WHO, 2001). During adolescence,
requirements of iron and other micronutrients, including
vitamin A, increase due to the rapid expansion of total blood
volume and increase in lean body mass during the growth
spurt, and following the onset of menstruation (Brabin and
Brabin, 1992). In settings where additional risk factors of
anemia (for example, malaria and hookworm) prevail and
nutritional intake is inadequate, adolescents are at significant risk of developing anemia, with or without iron
deficiency. The prevalence of anemia in adolescent girls in
sub-Saharan Africa is estimated to be around 40% (DeMaeyer
and Adiels-Tegman, 1985; ACC/SCN, 1997).
Adverse consequences of anemia and iron deficiency range
from severe morbidity to more subtle effects on physical
work capacity and deficits in cognitive development and
potentially school performance (Stoltzfus, 2001). Prepregnancy hemoglobin level and iron status are also important
determinants of the risk of anemia-related morbidity and
mortality during pregnancy (Brabin et al., 1998; Bothwell,

2000). Furthermore, iron deficiency may be associated with
retarded growth, which in turn may be associated
with obstructed labor due to cephalopelvic disproportion
(Harrison, 1985).
Vitamin A requirements also rise significantly during
puberty reflecting the role of this nutrient in sexual
maturation (Michaelsson et al., 1976). Vitamin A deficiency
(VAD), even when subclinical, may cause anemia through
the modulation of iron metabolism as reviewed by Semba
and Bloem (2002). Randomized trials in anemic subjects
have shown that vitamin A added to iron supplementation
gave better hematological response than iron alone (Hodges
et al., 1978; Mejia and Chew, 1988; Suharno et al., 1993).
VAD is also recognized to play a role in growth, development
and the functioning of the immune system (ACC/SCN,
1997).
There is a long-standing controversy about the safety of
iron supplementation in malaria-endemic areas. Although
iron deficiency causes a number of biochemical abnormalities and impaired cell-mediated immunity with increased
susceptibility to infections (Fleming, 1987), concerns have
also been raised that hyperferremia resulting from iron
therapy may exacerbate infections, in particular malaria
(Oppenheimer, 2001). The controversy has received renewed
attention following the recent findings from a study in
Zanzibar that reported in an increased rate of severe diseases
and death in malaria-endemic Zanzibar (Sazawal et al., 2006).
Because vitamin A supplementation raises serum iron this
might also increase susceptibility to infection. On the other
hand vitamin A supplementation in deficient individuals
may boost the immune response and has been shown to
provide protection against a number of infections (Villamor
and Fawzi, 2000). High-dose vitamin A supplementation has
been shown to reduce the number and severity of clinical
malaria attacks in one trial (Shankar et al., 1999) but not in
another (Binka et al., 1995).
School-based interventions in adolescent girls offer an
opportunity to combat iron deficiency, anemia and stunting
before pregnancy (Brabin and Brabin, 1992). We conducted a
randomized placebo-controlled trial to determine the effect
of weekly supplementation with iron alone, vitamin A alone
or a combination of the two, on hemoglobin concentration
and iron status in adolescent schoolgirls in western Kenya.
We also determined whether the addition of vitamin A has
the potential to decrease or neutralize any adverse effects of
iron supplementation on morbidity both from malaria and
other infections.
Methods
Study area and population
This study was conducted between April 1998 and November
1998 in the city of Kisumu (population B320 000), located
on the shores of Lake Victoria, in Nyanza Province, western
Kenya.
Malaria transmission in this urban area is largely uncharacterized, but is perennial with highest transmission during
peak rainfall from April – July and October – December.
Exposure to infective mosquitoes is likely to vary from the
city center to the peri-urban areas (Robert et al., 2003). A
study of pregnant women attending the hospital antenatal
clinic reported an overall parasitemia prevalence in teenage
pregnancies of 25% (van Eijk et al., 2001). Approximately
26% of 15- to 19-year-old girls are estimated to be infected
with human immunodeficiency virus-1 (Glynn et al., 2001).
A study of vitamin A status conducted in a rural area 60 km
north west of Kisumu found the prevalence of VAD (serum
retinol p0.70 mmol l1
) to be 55.2 and 17.5% in preschool
and primary school girls, respectively, and none with signs
of xerophthalmia (Friis et al., 1997). A study in pregnant
women receiving folate supplementation suggested that
folate deficiency is not a major cause of anemia among
pregnant women in this area (Ouma et al., 2006).
Study design and recruitment
This was a double-blinded, randomized placebo-controlled trial
with a 2 2 factorial design. After consent was obtained from
the parents–teachers associations of 14 public primary schools
within the Kisumu municipality, all girls 12–18 years were
screened for the presence of anemia using a portable Hemocue
system (HaemoCue AB, Angelholm, Sweden). For logistical
reasons, only schools with 410 girls fulfiling the entry criteria
were considered. Girls with mild-to-moderate anemia were
enrolled 6–8 weeks after screening, when a questionnaire and
physical examination were completed and a repeat finger-prick
blood sample taken. Pregnancy tests were conducted for girls
with a history of delayed menstruation. Any girls with severe
anemia (hemoglobin (Hb) o 7.0gdl1
), evidence of severe VAD
(that is, signs of xerophthalmia), pregnancy or concomitant
disease requiring hospitalization were excluded.
Randomization and blinding
Balanced block randomization scheme (N ¼ 12) was used.
Active and placebo supplements were manufactured by
Laboratory and Allied Limited (Nairobi, Kenya). The key
was revealed only after completion of the study.
Interventions
Study participants were given one of the following supplementations: (1) iron and vitamin A, (2) iron and vitamin A
placebo, (3) vitamin A and iron placebo or (4) iron placebo
and vitamin A placebo (double placebo). Iron supplementation consisted of 120 mg elemental iron in the form of two
200 mg ferrous-sulfate tablets given once weekly. Vitamin A
was given as 25 000 IU (8.3 mg) retinol in the form of a
gelatin capsule once weekly, a dose considered safe in first
trimester pregnancy (WHO, 1998). Tablets and capsule were
given at the same time with a glass of water.
Weekly iron and vitamin A in adolescent schoolgirls

European Journal of Clinical Nutrition
All schools were visited weekly by a study nurse for
supervised administration of study supplements. If girls were
absent, supplements were left with the teachers. Supervised
treatment was not possible during a 3-week leave period
between two school terms and a 2-week teachers’ strike.
Instructions were given to the girls to take the study
supplements at home.
Follow-up
The study was initially designed to include a 6-month
intervention period, but shortened to 5 months following an
early request from the teachers because the sixth month
would have fallen in the school examination month. Girls
were seen monthly after enrollment for a finger-prick blood
sample (for hemoglobin concentration and malaria smear),
questionnaire (including medical history, menstrual history,
history of potential side effects and use of medication in the
prior month) and basic physical examination (including
clinical impression, skin rash and axillary temperature).
At weekly treatment visits, girls were seen by the study
nurse. Girls with symptomatic illness were referred to a
dedicated study pediatrician. Each girl was given a health
passport and girls suspecting illness could report directly
to this clinic at no cost. The study pediatrician filled in a
dedicated study form that was used for passive surveillance.
Laboratory methods
A Coulter Counter (Model M530, Coulter Electronics
Limited, Luton, UK) was used to determine hemoglobin
concentration. Daily control samples were run to determine
the daily coefficient of variation, which never exceeded 7%.
Blood cells and plasma were separated and stored at 20 1C,
and subsequently at 80 1C until further processing.
Ferritin and C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured on
stored samples in a multiplexed bead-based assay as
previously described (Coutinho et al., 2005). Retinol-binding
protein (RBP) was measured on stored samples in a
competitive binding assay using RBP (RDI, Concord, MA,
USA) coupled to microspheres as target and biotinylated
anti-RBP (courtesy of Dr Hix, PATH, Seattle, WA, USA) as the
competitive detection Ab, essentially as described (Coutinho
et al., 2005). RBP is known to occur as a 1:1 molar complex
with retinol and can be used as a surrogate marker of serum
retinol and equimolar cutoffs for RBP with similar sensitivity
and specificity to predict VAD as serum retinol (Gamble et al.,
2001). All laboratory markers for iron and vitamin A status
could be assessed only for the baseline and 3 months time
points, because more than 80% of stored samples taken at
the 5-month time point were lost in transport.
Thick blood smears were stained with Giemsa and
examined for the presence of malaria parasites with a  100
oil-emersion objective as previously described (Leenstra
et al., 2003a).
Anthropometric data
Measurements of height and weight were performed at
baseline according to standard World Health Organization
procedures as described (Leenstra et al., 2005). Sexual
maturation was assessed using a modified Tanner score
based on the assessment of breast development only (Tanner,
1962).
Sample size
We estimated that a sample size of 220 participants (55 per
arm) would be sufficient to detect a 0.5 g dl1
. difference in
the mean change in hemoglobin between the treatment
groups by the end of the intervention period, with 90%
power and 95% confidence, anticipating 20% dropout and
assuming a standard deviation of the mean Hb level of
0.8 g dl1
.
Statistical methods
All analyses were conducted in SAS (version 8.02, Statistical
Application Software Institute, Cary, NC, USA). Analyses
were done on an intention to treat basis. Ferritin, RBP,
malaria and parasitemia were log normally distributed, and
the data were Loge transformed (Ln(value þ 1)).
Changes in mean Hb, ferritin and RBP were assessed using
a repeated measures linear regression model to adjust for
within-subject correlation of the endpoint over time
(Fitzmaurice et al., 2004). Means were modeled as a
polynomial function of time. Models were adjusted for the
baseline value of the outcome. School was included as a
covariate in all models. Because ferritin and RBP levels are
influenced by inflammation, models including ferritin or
RBP as an outcome were adjusted for concurrent CRP level,
entered into models as a time-varying covariate.
The difference in the prevalence of anemia between
treatment groups was assessed using marginal log binomial
regression (repeated measures logistic regression), and
expressed as the prevalence ratio at the final follow-up visit,
adjusted for the presence of anemia at baseline.
Differences in geometric mean parasite density between
treatment groups over the course of the study period were
assessed with a linear mixed effects model for parasitemic
subjects only. The incidence rates of malaria parasitemia
(any species) and history of illness due to malaria or other
causes in the month prior to survey were calculated based on
time up to the episode, the end of the main intervention
period or loss to follow-up. Observation time and events
occurring within 28 days of a treated malaria episode were
excluded from analysis of the incidence of parasitemia. Rate
ratios for incidence of malaria and clinical outcomes were
obtained from a Poisson regression model, controlling for
confounding factors.
Factors at baseline were introduced into initial models
individually to assess possible confounding and/or effect
modification. The interaction between the effects of iron and

vitamin A was tested using the log likelihood ratio test.
When the interaction term was not significant the main
effect of iron while adjusting for the effect of vitamin A, and
vice versa, was estimated by fitting above models without
the interaction term. We assessed whether iron deficiency at
baseline modified the effects of iron and vitamin A using the
log likelihood ratio test. Menstruation is one of the most
important risk factors for iron deficiency anemia (IDA) in
older teenage girls in this study area (Leenstra et al., 2004),
and because iron deficiency is difficult to determine in
practice, we also examined whether the effect of treatment
on Hb concentration depended on the presence of menarche
at baseline.
Results
Study number and descriptive
A total of 1615 girls aged 12–18 years were screened in 14
schools during a 6-week period in April and May 1998.
Overall, 350 (21.7%) girls were found to have mild/moderate
anemia (7.0 g dl1 pHb o12.0 g dl1 (WHO, 2001)). Only 6
(0.4%) girls had severe anemia (Hb o7.0 g dl1 (WHO,
2001)). Of the 350 anemic girls at screening, 279 were
enrolled (Figure 1). Loss to follow-up at the end of the study
was 10.8% (30 of 279) and not different between the
treatment groups (Figure 1). Baseline characteristics did not
predict loss to follow-up (data not shown).
Treatment groups were comparable at baseline (Table 1).
The mean age was 13.8 (s.d. 1.3) years. The median maturity
rating (Tanner breast development stage) was 3 (IQ range
2–4) and 46.8% of the girls had passed menarche. Of the
girls that were anemic at screening (using Hemocue Hb
assessment), 30.5% were anemic at start of treatment 6–8
weeks later (using coulter counter Hb assessment). Baseline
mean Hb was 12.8 g dl1 (s.d. 1.7). Baseline geometric mean
ferritin was 13.0 g dl1 (s.d. 7.7) and prevalence of iron
deficiency (ID; ferritin o12.0 mg l1 (WHO, 2001)) was
42.3%. Prevalence of VAD was 6.7%. VAD was defined as
RBP o14.7 mg l1
, which corresponds with the widely used
retinol cut-off o0.70 mmol l1 (de Pee and Dary, 2002). A
quarter of the girls had malaria parasitemia at baseline, a
third of these had high parasite densities defined as 4500
parasites per mm3
. Only one girl presented with symptomatic malaria (presence of malaria parasites with concurrent
axillary temperature X37.5 1C). Prevalence of stunting
(height-for-age z-score two s.d.’s below the reference median)
and underweight (weight-for-age z-score two s.d.’s below the
reference median) were 4.4 and 4.3%, respectively.
Hematological response
The adjusted differences in mean Hb concentration between
the treatment groups and double placebo after 5 months of
supplementation were 0.46 g dl1 (0.00, 0.92) for iron and
vitamin A combined, 0.44 g dl1 (0.01, 0.87) for iron alone
and 0.14 g dl1 (0.59, 0.31) for vitamin A alone (Figure 2).
There was no evidence for interaction between the effects
of iron and vitamin A on Hb concentrations (P-value
for the iron–vitamin A interaction ¼ 0.89). Subsequent
models were therefore developed to estimate the main
effects of iron and vitamin A, while controlling for the effect
of the other intervention (Table 2). Iron supplementation
was associated with a 0.52 g dl1 higher mean Hb by 5
months and a 65% lower prevalence of anemia compared to
placebo (Table 2). Vitamin A supplementation was not
associated with a significant difference in mean Hb or
prevalence of anemia, compared to vitamin A placebo by
5 months (Table 2).
Subgroup analysis indicated that the iron status at baseline
significantly modified the effect of iron supplementation on
Hb levels (P-value interaction terms o0.0001). Iron supplementation was only effective in individuals who were iron
deficient at baseline (Table 3). Baseline iron status did not
modify the effect of vitamin A on Hb (P-value interaction
term ¼ 0.87).
At baseline, menstruating girls had a 0.64g dl1 (0.21, 1.07)
lower Hb compared to girls not yet menstruating (P ¼ 0.004).
Iron had a clear effect in menstruating girls but not in
nonmenstruating girls (Table 3; P-value interaction
term ¼ 0.002). Menstruating girls receiving iron placebo
(N ¼ 66) had a 1.03 g dl1 (1.53, 0.54) lower Hb level at
5 months than nonmenstruating girls receiving iron placebo
(N ¼ 75) (Po0.0001). The above effects were independent
of differences in iron status at baseline (data not shown).
Menstruation did not modify the effect of vitamin A on Hb
(P-value interaction term ¼ 0.83).
Because of the low prevalence of VAD at baseline there was
insufficient power to assess whether the effects of iron or
vitamin A supplementation were modified by baseline
vitamin A status.
Impact on ferritin concentrations
There was no interaction between the effect of iron and
vitamin A on ferritin concentrations (P-value interaction
term ¼ 0.35). Three months of iron supplementation
was associated with a 13.3 mg l1 higher ferritin concentration compared to iron placebo (Table 2). Vitamin A
supplementation had no effect on ferritin concentrations
(Table 2).
Impact on RBP concentrations
There was no interaction between the effect of iron and
vitamin A on RBP concentrations (P-value interaction
term ¼ 0.44). A total of 3 months of vitamin A supplementation had no significant effect on mean RBP concentration
(Table 2). Similarly, iron supplementation had no effect on
RBP concentrations at 3 months (Table 2).

Impact on the incidence of malaria, all-cause morbidity, side
effects and menstrual abnormalities
There was no evidence for interaction between the effects of
iron and vitamin A on any of the malaria outcomes (data not
shown); main effects incidence risk ratios are given in
Table 4.
The monthly follow-up visits indicated that girls in the
iron-supplemented groups were slightly more likely to be
parasitemic at active follow-up visits (P ¼ 0.10, Table 4)
compared to girls who were randomized to receive placebo
iron. However, geometric mean parasite densities were not
higher in this group (P ¼ 0.99). Vitamin A supplementation
did not affect the risk of malaria (Table 4). No differences
between groups were seen in any other measures of
morbidity at the monthly follow-up or clinic visits (Table 4).
Passive surveillance indicated that 32 girls visited the study
clinic during the follow-up period. The most common
diagnosis was malaria (diagnosed eight times) followed by
allergic conjunctivitis (seven times), tonsillitis (six times)
and gastritis (five times). There was no difference between
the groups. Anemia was diagnosed only twice; once in a girl
with malaria and once in a girl with menorrhagia. None of
the girls presented with severe disease.
Girls receiving iron were more likely to report constipation
or dark stools than girls receiving iron placebo (Rate ratio
2.2 (1.1, 4.4) and 6.4 (1.0, 41.5), respectively). There was no
difference between groups regarding the occurrence of
potential side effects as nausea, vomiting or diarrhea (data
not shown).
Discussion
This randomized controlled trial evaluated the effect of
weekly iron and vitamin A supplementation on hemoglobin
levels, iron status and morbidity in adolescent schoolgirls in
urban Kisumu, western Kenya. Five months of weekly iron
supplementation was associated with a 1.34 g dl1 increase in
mean hemoglobin concentrations compared to iron placebo,
but only in girls who were iron deficient at baseline. No
effect was seen in iron-replete girls. These results are
consistent with several recent weekly iron supplementation

trials in adolescent girls (Ka¨telhut et al., 1996; Tee et al., 1999;
Kianfar et al., 2000; Zavaleta et al., 2000; Ahmed et al., 2001).
Weekly vitamin A supplementation was not associated
with a sustained increase in Hb. It has long been recognized
that vitamin A is essential for normal hematopoiesis and
plays a role in the etiology of anemia (Semba and Bloem,
2002). In a study of iron supplementation for anemic
vitamin A-depleted individuals, hematological response to
iron was only observed after vitamin A status was improved
(Hodges et al., 1978). Recent randomized controlled trials
that determined the effect of vitamin A in addition to iron
supplementation for the treatment of anemia showed that
the combined therapy resulted in significantly better
hematological recovery than iron supplementation alone
(Mejia and Chew, 1988; Suharno et al., 1993; Mwanri et al.,
2000; Ahmed et al., 2001). However, others have failed to
confirm these findings (Ka¨telhut et al., 1996; Kolsteren et al.,
1999; Muslimatun et al., 2001; Soekarjo et al., 2004). In our
study, there was also no evidence that the effect of iron was
dependent on the concomitant administration of vitamin A.
The difference between the above named studies is not
explained by differences in dosage, as most gave daily doses
between 5000 and 8000IU retinol (that is, 35 000–56 000 IU
per week). Moreover, one of the studies showed a significantly

enhanced effect in adolescent girls even with a relatively low
weekly dose of 8000 IU retinol for 12 weeks, which was lower
than our weekly dose of 25 000 IU (Ahmed et al., 2001).
Conversely, the differences between the above named
studies might be explained by differences in baseline vitamin
A status between study populations, in studies where
combined supplementation was more efficacious than iron
alone, there was a high (430%) prevalence of baseline VAD
(retinol o0.70 mmol l1
) (Suharno et al., 1993; Ahmed et al.,
2001), whereas in studies where combined supplementation
was not effective there was a low (o15%) prevalence of VAD
(Ka¨telhut et al., 1996; Kolsteren et al., 1999; Soekarjo et al.,
2004). Thus the lack of a sustained effect of vitamin A on
hemoglobin levels and the lack of interaction between iron
and vitamin A in our study likely reflects the low prevalence
of VAD in this age group; only 6.7% of the girls were defined
as VAD at enrollment.
The lack of a hematological response following iron
supplementation in nonmenstruating girls suggests that
iron deficiency is not a main cause of anemia during
premenarche in this setting. This is consistent with our
previous observations in this same age group in neighboring
Bondo district, which implicated malaria and schistosomiasis as potential causes of anemia in young adolescents (12–13
years), but not in older menstruating girls (14–18 years)
(Leenstra et al., 2004). In the older girls heavy menstruation
was the only risk factor identified, presumably because
resistance to parasitic infection improves with age and
pubertal development (Kurtis et al., 2001; Leenstra et al.,
2003b). Furthermore, insecticide-treated bed nets were
found to reduce the prevalence of malaria-associated anemia
in young schoolgirls aged 12–13 years, but not in the older
girls (Leenstra et al., 2003a). These combined results suggest
that the relative contribution of iron deficiency as a cause of
anemia is likely to be greatest in menstruating girls and that
they are the demographic group most likely to benefit from
iron supplementation programs in schools. An additional
explanation could be that iron absorption is upregulated in
menstruating girls in anticipation of loss through menstruation and to facilitate growth.
Despite the well-recognized public health burden of
anemia and the beneficial effects of iron supplementation,
the use of iron therapy remains controversial in many
malaria-endemic countries because of the concerns that iron
therapy exacerbates infections (INACG Consensus Statement, 1999; Oppenheimer, 2001). A meta-analysis by the
International Nutritional Anemia Consultative Group concluded that the overall increased risk of malaria parasitemia
is small and does not outweigh the hematological benefits of
iron supplementation (INACG Consensus Statement, 1999).
However, recent findings that iron supplementation is
associated with increased mortality and hospital admission
in young preschool children in an area with intense malaria
transmission has refueled the debate about the role of
universal iron supplementation in malarious areas (Sazawal
et al., 2006). In the current study, iron supplementation was
associated with increased incidence of malaria parasitemia
(Rate ratio 1.33 (0.94–1.88)), independent of age or baseline
iron status. Although this was not statistically significant, it
is in line with the findings from the previous meta-analysis
(INACG Consensus Statement, 1999). A larger increase in
clinical malaria (fever and parasitemia) was observed in the
iron-supplemented group (Rate ratio 1.87 (0.39–8.90)), but
the CIs were wide and a more substantial increase cannot be
excluded. There was no evidence that weekly iron supplementation increased the risk of all-cause morbidity.
Although, our study is too small to provide conclusive
evidence on the risk of malaria associated with iron
supplementation, the high degree of acquired immunity to
malaria in older (menstruating) teenage girls (Kurtis et al.,
2001; Leenstra et al., 2003b) would suggest that the public
health effects of any increased risk of malaria are likely to be
much smaller than in young preschool children. For
example the absolute risk of clinical malaria in the teenage
girls in this study was very low and all clinical episodes were
mild, whereas in this same population, malaria is one of the
main causes of death in infants (Phillips-Howard et al.,
2003).
We conclude that school-based weekly iron supplementation in girls aged 12–18 is well tolerated and results in
substantial increases in hemoglobin concentrations that
outweigh the possible inherent risks caused by malaria but
only in iron-deficient and menstruating girls, and not in
iron-replete or nonmenstruating girls. This would argue in
favor of targeted rather than universal iron supplementation
in adolescent schoolgirls in malarious areas. However,
screening for iron deficiency, or targeting iron supplementation to schoolgirls that admit to being post-menarche is
unlikely to be feasible, cost effective or culturally acceptable.
Alternatively, targeting the highest risk age group and the
use of integrated approaches that combine universal iron
supplementation with malaria prevention measures, for
example, through use of insecticide-treated nets, could be
considered. VAD was rare and weekly vitamin A supplementation, alone, or combined with iron, did not result in a
sustained increase in hemoglobin. Further research is
required to determine the long-term effects of iron alone,
or combined with malaria prevention in schoolgirls of
reproductive age for the prevention of anemia-related
adverse outcomes in adolescent pregnancies.
