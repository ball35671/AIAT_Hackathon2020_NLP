Background
Anaemia is a condition in which the number of red blood cells is insufficient to meet physiologic needs; it is caused by many conditions,
particularly iron deficiency. Traditionally, daily iron supplementation has been a standard practice for preventing and treating anaemia.
However, its long-term use has been limited, as it has been associated with adverse side effects such as nausea, constipation, and teeth
staining. Intermittent iron supplementation has been suggested as an effective and safer alternative to daily iron supplementation for
preventing and reducing anaemia at the population level, especially in areas where this condition is highly prevalent.
Objectives
To assess the effects ofintermittent oral iron supplementation, alone orin combinationwith other nutrients, on anaemia and its associated
impairments among menstruating women, compared with no intervention, a placebo, or daily supplementation.
Search methods
In February 2018, we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, nine other databases, and two trials registers. In March 2018, we also searched
LILACS, IBECS and IMBIOMED. In addition, we examined reference lists, and contacted authors and known experts to identify additional
studies.
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs with either individual or cluster randomisation. Participants were menstruating
women;thatis, women beyond menarche and priorto menopause who were not pregnant orlactating and did not have a known condition
that impeded the presence of menstrual periods. The intervention was the use of iron supplements intermittently (one,two orthree times
a week on non-consecutive days) compared with placebo, no intervention, or the same supplements provided on a daily basis.
Data collection and analysis
Both review authors independently assessed the eligibility of studies against the inclusion criteria, extracted data from included studies,
checked data entry for accuracy, assessed the risk of bias of the included studies, and rated the quality of the evidence using GRADE.
Main results
We included 25 studies involving 10,996 women. Study methods were not well described in many of the included studies and thus assessing risk of bias was difficult. The main limitations of the studies were lack of blinding and high attrition. Studies were mainly funded by

international organisations, universities, and ministries of health within the countries. Approximately one third of the included studies
did not provide a funding source.
Although quality across studies was variable, the results consistently showed that intermittent iron supplementation (alone or with any
other vitamins and minerals) compared with no intervention or a placebo, reduced the risk of having anaemia (risk ratio (RR) 0.65, 95%
confidence interval (CI) 0.49 to 0.87; 11 studies, 3135 participants; low-quality evidence), and improved the concentration of haemoglobin
(mean difference (MD) 5.19 g/L, 95% CI 3.07 to 7.32; 15 studies, 2886 participants; moderate-quality evidence), and ferritin (MD 7.46 μg/
L, 95% CI 5.02 to 9.90; 7 studies, 1067 participants; low-quality evidence). Intermittent regimens may also reduce the risk of having iron
deficiency (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.04; 3 studies, 624 participants; low-quality evidence), but evidence was inconclusive regarding iron
deficiency anaemia (RR 0.07, 95% CI 0.00 to 1.16; 1 study, 97 participants; very low-quality evidence) and all-cause morbidity (RR 1.12, 95%
CI 0.82 to 1.52; 1 study, 119 participants; very low-quality evidence). Women in the control group were less likely to have any adverse side
effects than those receiving intermittent iron supplements (RR 1.98, 95% CI 0.31 to 12.72; 3 studies, 630 participants; moderate-quality
evidence).
In comparison with daily supplementation, results showed that intermittent supplementation (alone or with any other vitamins and minerals) produced similar effects to daily supplementation (alone or with any other vitamins and minerals) on anaemia (RR 1.09, 95% CI
0.93 to 1.29; 8 studies, 1749 participants; moderate-quality evidence). Intermittent supplementation may produce similar haemoglobin
concentrations (MD 0.43 g/L, 95% CI −1.44 to 2.31; 10 studies, 2127 participants; low-quality evidence) but lower ferritin concentrations
on average (MD −6.07 μg/L, 95% CI −10.66 to −1.48; 4 studies, 988 participants; low-quality evidence) compared to daily supplementation.
Compared to daily regimens, intermittentregimens may also reduce the risk of having iron deficiency (RR4.30, 95% CI 0.56 to 33.20; 1 study,
198 participants; very low-quality evidence). Women receiving iron supplements intermittently were less likely to have any adverse side
effects than those receiving iron supplements daily (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.82; 6 studies, 1166 participants; moderate-quality evidence).
No studies reported on the effect of intermittent regimens versus daily regimens on iron deficiency anaemia and all-cause morbidity.
Information on disease outcomes, adherence, economic productivity, and work performance was scarce, and evidence about the effects
of intermittent supplementation on these outcomes unclear.
Overall, whether the supplements were given once or twice weekly, for less or more than three months, contained less or more than 60
mg of elemental iron per week, or given to populations with different degrees of anaemia at baseline did not seem to affect the findings.
Furthermore, the response did not differ in areas where malaria was frequent, although very few trials were conducted in these settings.
Authors' conclusions
Intermittent iron supplementation may reduce anaemia and may improve iron stores among menstruating women in populations with
different anaemia and malaria backgrounds. In comparison with daily supplementation, the provision of iron supplements intermittently
is probably as effective in preventing or controlling anaemia. More information is needed on morbidity (including malaria outcomes),
side effects, work performance, economic productivity, depression, and adherence to the intervention. The quality of this evidence base
ranged from very low to moderate quality, suggesting that we are uncertain about these effects.

Iron supplements taken one, two or three times a week for preventing anaemia, and its consequences in menstruating women
What is the issue?
Across the globe, approximately one out of three non-pregnant women of reproductive age are anaemic; i.e. have fewer red blood cells
or less haemoglobin (a red substance that combines with oxygen and carries it around the body) in each red blood cell than normal.
Although there are several causes of anaemia, it very often results from sustained iron deficiency. The standard practice to prevent or
treat anaemia in women has been daily iron supplementation (sometimes combined with folic acid and other vitamins and minerals) for
three months. However, it is frequently associated with side effects such as nausea or constipation. Intermittent supplementation (that
is, the consumption of supplements one, two or three times a week on non-consecutive days) has been proposed as an effective and safer
alternative to daily supplementation.
Why is this important?
Women with anaemia may have less energy for physical work and become more prone to infections. Most women throughout the world
enter pregnancy with anaemia, putting them at greater risk of having low birth-weight babies and other complications during delivery.
Some scientists believe that taking iron a few times a week – instead of every day – can help women with anaemia to feel better and
improve their haemoglobin without giving them as many side effects. If women have fewer side effects, they may be more likely to take
iron supplements more regularly and for longer periods.

We reviewed the evidence in February 2018. We included 25 randomised controlled trials (a type of experiment in which participants
are randomly assigned to one or more treatment groups) involving 10,996 women. We included studies examining the administration of
intermittentiron supplements versus no intervention, a placebo (dummy pill) orthe same supplements given on a daily basis. Most studies
were implemented in school settings and were mainly funded by international organisations, universities, and ministries of health within
the countries. Approximately one-third of the included studies did not provide a funding source.
The findings show that women receiving intermittent supplementation with iron alone, orin combination with folic acid or other nutrients,
were less likely to be anaemic than those women who received no iron supplements or a placebo. They also had higher concentrations of
haemoglobin and ferritin (a protein that carries iron). Intermittent supplementation also reduced the risk of having iron deficiency. The
findings indicate that intermittent supplementation was as effective as daily supplementation in reducing the prevalence of anaemia and
increasing haemoglobin concentrations, with fewer side effects. It had no effect on raising ferritin concentrations.
We found scarce evidence on the effect of intermittent supplementation compared to placebo or daily supplementation on iron deficiency
anaemia, all-cause morbidity, disease outcomes, adherence, economic productivity, and work performance.
What does this mean?
Intermittent iron supplementation in menstruating women may be an effective intervention for reducing anaemia and improving haemoglobin concentrations compared to no treatment, placebo or daily supplementation. Intermittent supplementation may be associated
with fewer side effects compared to daily supplementation. The findings were not affected by whether the supplements were given once
ortwice weekly, forless or more than three months, contained less or more than 60 mg of elemental iron per week, or given to populations
with different degrees of anaemia at baseline (starting point for comparisons). The evidence base was of overall low quality.

Description of the condition
Anaemia is a condition in which the oxygen-carrying capacity of the
blood is insufficient to meet the physiologic needs of body tissues.
The global prevalence of this condition in non-pregnant women
of reproductive age is estimated to be 29.0% (WHO 2015), and it
is more frequent in low- and middle-income countries or among
women who belong to a low socioeconomic stratum (Soekarjo
2001; Bodnar 2002; Bentley 2003). Anaemia has multiple direct
causes that very often coexist: it can resultfrom parasitic infections
(Kumar 2007; Anah 2008); inflammatory disorders (Yip 1988); inherited disorders of haemoglobin structure; oxidative stress (i.e. imbalance between free radicals and antioxidants) and vitamin and
mineral deficiencies such as that of vitamins A and B12, and folate
(Herbert 1987; Hercberg 1992; Jimenez 2010), and especially iron,
which is responsible for at least half of the cases of anaemia (WHO
2001).
Iron deficiency results from long-term imbalance caused by inadequate dietary iron intake, poor iron absorption or utilisation, increased iron requirements, or chronic blood loss (Alleyne 2008). Individual iron requirements vary considerably throughout the human life cycle (Lynch 2007), and both physiological (for example,
pregnancy or early postpartum) or pathological (for example, HIV
infection) conditions affect iron requirements (WHO 2001). Postmenarchal women are at higher risk of developing iron deficiency
because of menstrual losses, and if they do not have an adequate
iron intake, this condition can progress to anaemia (known as iron
deficiency anaemia or IDA).
Iron deficiency is one of the most prevalent forms of malnutrition
globally. It is estimated that 50% of anaemia is attributable to iron
deficiency worldwide (WHO 2001). Iron deficiency, even in the absence of anaemia, may either cause disability directly or be a risk
factor for it (Stoltzfus 2003). For example, it causes impaired muscle function and impaired resistance to infections in all age groups
(Beard 2005), and it is associated with reduced physical capacity
and work performance in adolescents and adults (Beard 2001; WHO
2001; Clark 2008). Most women throughout the world enter pregnancy with less than desirable iron reserves, which reduce their reproductive performance (Viteri 2005). In addition to iron deficiency, women are frequently deficient in other vitamins and minerals that play importantroles in the body (Ramakrishnan 2002; Kontic-Vucinic 2006; Ahmed 2008). An adequate folate intake during the
periconceptional period, for example, is crucial to reducing the risk
of having a baby with neural tube defects (NTDs) (De-Regil 2015);
vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies are major causes of anaemia
(Green 2017), while vitamin A regulates many critical functions, including vision, integrity of epithelial tissue (i.e. membranous tissue
covering internal organs and other internal surfaces of the body),
the expression of several hundred genes, and its deficiency also
contributes to nutritional anaemia (WHO 2011a). Although these
deficiencies may not translate into a comparable prevalence of
anaemia, supplementation of these nutrients in women may improve their health throughout life, as there is some indication that
these deficiencies are of public health concern in certain countries
(McLean 2008).
Anaemia in women of reproductive age is diagnosed when the
haemoglobin concentration in the blood is below 120 g/L, a cutoH that varies with residential elevation above sea level (altitude)
and smoking (WHO 2011b). Iron deficiency anaemia is diagnosed by
the combined presence of anaemia and iron deficiency, measured
by ferritin (< 15 μg/L) or any other indicator of iron status such as
serum transferrin receptors or zinc protoporphyrin (WHO 2011c).
Description of the intervention
Daily iron plus folic acid supplementation remains the standard approach for the prevention and treatment of anaemia among menstruating women, since dietary changes alone usually cannot correct this condition, as the iron content in the diet is relatively constant and difficult to increase (DeMaeyer 1989). The recommended
daily, supplemental dosage for non-pregnant women of reproductive age living in countries where anaemia is highly prevalent (i.e.
above 40%) is 60 mg of elemental iron and 400 µg of folic acid for
three months (WHO 2001). The use of folic acid prior to pregnancy aims to improve folate status, and this dose has been shown to
be effective for preventing NTDs in women who become pregnant
(WHO 2001). Despite its proven efficacy, the main problem with the
daily regimen is lack of compliance, due to side effects such as diarrhoea, constipation, dark stools, metallic taste, teeth staining, and
nausea (Yip 1994).
Intermittent oral iron supplementation (i.e. one, two orthree times
a week on non-consecutive days) has been suggested as an effective alternative to daily iron supplementation to prevent anaemia
at the population level. The efficacy of intermittent iron supplementation for the prevention of anaemia and iron deficiency has
been studied over the last 15 years in children, adolescents and
pregnant and non-pregnant women of reproductive age. A review
of 22 trialsperformedinallofthese groups concludedthatbothdaily and once-weekly iron supplementation were efficacious under
favourable conditions in reducing anaemia (Beaton 1999). Subsequent trials in menstruating women have confirmed these findings
(Crape 2005; Khan 2005; Paulino 2005), although some study authors have suggested that the weekly intake of supplemental iron
may be insufficient to meet women's needs and have proposed the
use of iron supplements twice a week (Kianfar 2000; Olsen 2000).
Recent trials have used a variety of intermittent iron supplementation schemes such as: a double dose, once- and twice-a-week
scheme, which reduced iron deficiency efficiently (Ahmed 2012);
and a once-a-week scheme,with andwithout other micronutrients,
which improved iron status (Bansal 2016) and haemoglobin concentration significantly (Kätelhut 1996).
The international recommendation for weekly supplementation
for non-pregnant women of reproductive age is that supplements
should contain 60 mg of elemental iron in the form of ferrous sulphate and 2800 µg (2.8 mg) of folic acid (WHO 2011d). Although evidence for the effective dose of folic acid for intermittent supplementation is very limited,the currentrecommendation is based on
the rationale of providing seven times the recommended daily dose
to prevent NTDs, and experimental evidence that high weekly doses can improve red blood cell folate concentrations to levels that
have been associated with a reduced risk of NTDs (Martinez-de Villareal 2001; Martinez-de Villareal 2002; Norsworthy 2004; Nguyen
2008). However, some countries have chosen to give a higher dose
in their programmes. India, for example, provides 100 mg of elemental iron (Vir 2008) under supervised and unsupervised conditions, decreasing the prevalence of anaemia from 73.3% to 25.4%.
The provision of vitamins and minerals other than iron and folic
acidonanintermittentbasismay also helpto supplementwomen's

diets and therefore improve health and development throughout
the life cycle (Allen 2009a; Allen 2009b; Dalmiya 2009).
How the intervention might work
Intestinal cells turn over every five to six days in humans. Hence,
providing iron on an intermittent basis would expose this nutrient
to new mucosal cells (made up of epithelial tissue) only, improving absorption efficiency (Viteri 1995), andreducing oxidative stress
and side effects (Viteri 2005). It may also reduce absorption blockage due to high iron levels in the gut lumen (i.e. inside space of
the gut) and in the enterocyte (i.e. intestinal cell) (Anderson 2005;
Oates 2007). Intermittent regimens may be perceived as more tolerable, ergo increasing adherence to supplementation (Casanueva 2006). In order to improve the success of this intervention, the
World Health Organization (WHO) encourages the integration of
intermittent iron supplementation programmes with other public
health measures, including deworming to prevent hookworm infections, improved bioavailable dietary iron intake, and interventions to control other prevalent causes of anaemia, particularly
malaria, other infections, and vitamin A deficiency (WHO 2011d).
The endemicity of malaria in a given region is an important consideration when providing iron supplements at the population level. Malaria, which is responsible for more than a million deaths per
year (Gajida 2010), causes anaemia through several mechanisms.
Provision of iron in malaria-endemic areas, particularly to children,
has been a long-standing controversy due to concerns that iron
therapy may exacerbate infections, particularly malaria (Oppenheimer 2001; Okabe 2011). Although the mechanisms by which additional iron can benefit the parasite are far from clear (Prentice
2007), intermittent supplementation might be an effective option
to prevent anaemia and improve malaria treatment in malaria-endemic areas since less iron is available for the parasite.
Why it is important to do this review
Improving iron and folate nutrition of adolescent and adult menstruating women may contribute to adequate mental and physical performance and reproductive health, which may, in turn, significantly enhance maternal and infant health outcomes. Intermittent supplementation is proposed as a viable approach forimproving iron and folate status in populations, especially in areas where
anaemia is highly prevalent, and where mass fortification of staple
foods with iron and folic acid is not available and not likely to be
available in the near future.
After the publication of the first version of this review (Fernández-Gaxiola 2011a), WHO published guidelines on intermittentiron
supplementation (WHO 2011d), and WHO Member States committed to theWorldHealth Assembly to halve anaemia in pregnant and
non-pregnant women of reproductive age by 2025 (WHO 2014). To
date, weekly iron supplementation has been implemented in more
than 10 countries in Asia and Africa, but there is still a need for
the literature to be systematically reviewed so there is updated evidence on the efficacy, effectiveness, and safety of this intervention,
to inform a possible scale-up as part of public health programmes.
This is an update of the previous review (Fernández-Gaxiola 2011a),
which was to inform the WHO guideline on intermittent supplementation in menstruating women (WHO 2011d). The evidence will
complement the findings of other Cochrane Reviews exploring the
effects of intermittent regimens among pregnant women (PeñaRosas 2015), the effects of intermittent iron supplementation in
children under 12 years of age (De-Regil 2011), and the effect of oral
iron supplementation on preventing and treating anaemia among
children in malaria-endemic areas (Okabe 2011).

Criteria for considering studies for this review
Types of studies
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs with randomisation at either the individual or cluster level. Quasi-RCTs are trials
that use systematic methods to allocate participants to treatment
groups such as alternation or assignment based on date of birth or
case record number (Reeves 2011).
Types of participants
Menstruating women; that is, women beyond menarche and prior
to menopause who are not pregnant or lactating or have any condition that impedes the presence of menstrual periods, regardless
oftheir baseline iron status or anaemia status, ethnicity, country of
residence, or level of endurance.
We did notinclude studies targeting women with conditions affecting iron metabolism such as intestinal malabsorption conditions,
ongoing excessive blood loss (including ongoing blood donations),
inflammatory bowel disease, cancer, chronic congestive cardiac
failure, chronic renal failure, chronic liver failure, or chronic infectious disease.
Types of interventions
Interventions involving an intermittent dosage of oral iron, either
alone or with other vitamins and minerals, versus no intervention
or placebo or the same supplements provided on a daily basis.
Oral iron supplementation refers to the delivery of iron compounds
directly to the oral cavity, either as a tablet, capsule, dispersible
tablet orliquid. Forthe purpose of this review, intermittent supplementation is defined as the provision of iron supplements one, two
or three times a week on non-consecutive days.
We performed the following comparisons:
1. intermittent iron supplementation (alone or with any other micronutrients) versus no supplementation or placebo; and
2. intermittentiron supplementation versus daily iron supplementation.
We included studies that combined iron supplementation with other cointerventions, such as education or deworming, but only if the
other cointerventions were the same in both the intervention and
comparison groups.
We excluded studies examining tube feeding, parenteral nutrition
or supplementary food-based interventions such as mass fortification of staple or complementary foods, home fortification with miIntermittent iron supplementation for reducing anaemia and its associated impairments in adolescent and adult menstruating women

Search methods for identification of studies
We analysed the indexing terms in the MEDLINE records for the included studies in the first version of this review using Yale MeSH
Analyser (Grossetta Nardini 2017), and concluded that a number of
indexing terms used in the previous strategy were redundant. We
revisedthe searchstrategy forthisupdateby removing these terms,
which increased the precision of the search (Appendix 1). Search
strategies for the previous version of this review are in Appendix 2.
We limited our searches to studies published from 1980 onwards
since the first trials on this intervention were published after this
year. We did not apply any language restrictions. For those articles
written in a language other than English, we commissioned their
translation into English, to assess them for eligibility according to
the prespecified selection criteria (Criteria for considering studies
for this review).

Data collection and analysis
We summarised the methods thatwe had planned to use, as per our
published protocol (Fernández-Gaxiola 2011b), but did notin Table
1. We may use these methods in future updates of this review.
Selection of studies
Using Covidence systematic review software (Covidence 2017),
both reviewers (AF-G; LD-R) independently screened titles and abstracts of all records yielded by the searches against the selection
criteria (Criteria for considering studies for this review), discarding those that were clearly irrelevant. Next, they both obtained the
full-text reports of all relevant or potentially relevant studies that
seemed to meet the inclusion criteria, and assessed them for eligibility. There were a few disagreements, due to oversights of either
one of the review authors, which they resolved through discussion.
We recorded the decisions of our selection process in a PRISMA diagram (Moher 2009).
Data extraction and management
Both review authors (AF-G; LD-R) independently extracted data
from eligible studies using Covidence (Covidence 2017) and a form
designed to collect other detailed data forthis review. AF-Gentered
the data into Review Manager 5 (RevMan 5) (Review Manager 2014),
and LD-R carried out checks for accuracy. We resolved any discrepancies through discussion. If the information regarding any of the
studies was unclear, we attempted to contact the authors of the
original reports, to ask them to provide further details.
We completed the data collection form electronically and recorded information (as set out below) on: study design; setting and participants (inclusion and exclusion criteria); study methods and assessment of risk of bias (see Assessment of risk of bias in included studies); intervention (for example, compound, dose, regimen,
duration of intervention); outcomes (with details of how and when
measured); and results.

Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
Each reviewer independently assessed the risk of bias in each included study using a simple contingency form thatfollowed the domain-based evaluation (sequence generation; allocation concealment; blinding; incomplete outcome data; selective reporting bias;
other sources of bias), described in Chapter 16 of the Cochrane
Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011b)
and set out in Appendix 3. If there was insufficient information to
assess the risk of bias, we rated the domain at 'unclear risk of bias',
until further information was published or made available to us. If
there was sufficient information, we categorised the domain as being either at 'low risk of bias' or 'high risk of bias' accordingly. We
resolved any disagreements by discussion.
Overall risk of bias
We summarised the risk of bias at two levels: within studies (across
domains) and across studies.
For the first, we made explicit judgements about whether studies were at high risk of bias, according to the criteria given in the
Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011a). With reference to the domains listed above, we assessed the likely magnitude and direction of the bias and whether
we considered it was likely to impact on the findings. We considered a study to be at low risk of bias overall if it was assessed at low
risk of bias for both sequence generation and allocation concealment and either blinding or incomplete outcome data.
For the second, we assessed the quality of the evidence for each
individual outcome using the GRADE approach (Balshem 2010;
Schünemann 2011); see 'Summary of findings' tables (beneath Data synthesis) below.
We reported the results of our assessment in the 'Risk of bias in
included studies' section, in the 'Risk of bias' tables (beneath the
Characteristics of included studies tables), in Summary of findings
for the main comparison and Summary of findings 2, and graphically.
Measures of treatment e;ect
Dichotomous data
We presented dichotomous outcome data as average risk ratios
(RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
Continuous data
We presented continuous outcome data as mean differences (MD)
with 95% CIs, measured at the end of the intervention. If studies did
not provide this information but reported the mean change, we included these data as suggested in Chapter 9 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Deeks 2011).

Unit of analysis issues
Cluster-randomised studies
We included cluster-randomised studies in the analyses with individually-randomised studies; cluster-randomised studies are labelled with a (C). We estimated effective sample sizes for each one
of them in order to perform correct analyses according to Chapter 16 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011b).
We obtained the intra-cluster correlation coefficients (ICC) from
Hall 2002 (C) (ICC = 0.0698; average cluster size (ACS) = 18.55; design
effect (DE) = 2.22) and Roschnik 2003 (C) (ICC = 0.1123; ACS = 29.0,
DE = 4.35), which we imputed to all cluster studies except Roschnik
2003 (C). We then calculated the ACS from the reports and estimated each study's effective sample size. Based on other reports (Okabe 2011), we assumed an average cluster size of 32 for classes,
when the average cluster size or number of clusters and individuals
were not clear (Agarwal 2003 (C); Soekarjo 2004 (C)). In summary,
we used the following information to account for the effect clustering in the data: Jayatissa 1999 (C) (ACS = 25.6; DE = 2.71); Muro 1999
(C) (ACS = 43.1; DE = 3.94); Agarwal 2003 (C) (ACS = 32; DE = 3.16);
Soekarjo 2004 (C) (ACS = 32; DE = 3.16); Mozaffari 2010 (C) (ACS = 25;
DE = 2.68).
Additionally, we conducted sensitivity analyses to examine the potential effect of clustering on the CI of the summary estimates, by
removing cluster-RCTs from the analyses andcomparing the effects
(Sensitivity analysis).
Studies with more than two treatment groups
For studies with more than two intervention groups (multi-arm
studies), we included the directly relevant arms only. When we
identified studies with various relevant arms, we combined the
groups into a single pair-wise comparison (Higgins 2011a), and included the disaggregated data in the corresponding subgroup category. When the control group was shared by two or more study
arms, we divided the control group (events and total population)
over the number of relevant subgroup categories to avoid double
counting the participants. The details are described in the Characteristics of included studies tables.
Cross-over trials
As specified in our protocol (Fernández-Gaxiola 2011b), we did not
include cross-over trials.
Dealing with missing data
Forincluded studies, we noted the levels of attrition and reported it
in the 'Risk of bias' tables (beneath the Characteristics of included
studies tables).
We carried out analyses, as far as possible, on an intention-to-treat
(ITT) basis; that is, by attempting to include all participants randomised to each group in the analyses. If this was not possible, we
performed an available case analysis, in which we analysed the data for each and every participant for whom the outcome was obtained.
Assessment of heterogeneity
We assessed methodological heterogeneity by examining the risk
of bias of the studies, and clinical heterogeneity by examining the
similarity between the types of participants, interventions and outcomes. For statistical heterogeneity, we examined the forest plots
from meta-analyses to look for heterogeneity among studies, and
used the I2 statistic, Tau2 and Chi2 tests as heterogeneity statistics
to quantify the level of heterogeneity among the studies included
in each analysis. When we identified moderate or substantial heterogeneity (I2 greater than approximately 30%), we explored it by
conducting prespecified subgroup analyses (see Subgroup analysis
and investigation of heterogeneity).
Assessment of reporting biases
When we suspected reporting bias (see 'Selective reporting bias'
under Assessment of risk of bias in included studies), we attempted to contact the study authors to ask them to provide missing outcome data. We investigated reporting biases (such as possible publication bias) using funnel plots, assessing asymmetry visually.
Data synthesis
We carried out statistical analyses using RevMan 5 (Review Manager 2014). We used random-effects meta-analyses due to possible
heterogeneity in the interventions, populations and methods used
in different trials. We used Mantel-Haenszel weighting for dichotomous outcomes and inverse variance for continuous outcomes, to
adjust the effect measure according to the extent of its variation
both between and within studies.
'Summary of findings' table
We presented the main findings of the review in 'Summary of findings' tables, which we prepared using GRADE profiler software
(GRADEpro 2015). We created two 'Summary of findings' tables
for both main comparisons: 1. Intermittent iron supplementation
(alone or with any other micronutrients) versus no supplementation or placebo (Summary of findings for the main comparison);
and 2. intermittent iron supplementation versus daily iron supplementation (Summary of findings 2). We included the following primary outcomes at the end of the intervention or at the time point
closest to the end in these tables: anaemia (haemoglobin concentration below a cut-oH defined by trialists); haemoglobin (g/L); iron
deficiency (as defined by trialists by using indicators of iron status such as ferritin or transferrin); ferritin (µg/L); iron deficiency
anaemia (defined by the presence of anaemia plus iron deficiency diagnosed with an indicator of iron status selected by trialists);
all-cause morbidity (the most frequent event associated with the
intervention independent of the cause, as defined by the trialists)
(see Primary outcomes). We also listed estimates of relative effects
along with the number of participants and studies contributing data for each outcome.
Both review authors independently assessed the quality of the evidence for each individual outcome using the GRADE approach (Balshem 2010; Schünemann 2011), which involves consideration of
within-study risk of bias (methodological quality), directness of evidence, heterogeneity, precision of effect estimates, and risk of publication bias. The results were expressed as one of four levels of
quality (high, moderate, low, or very low).
Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity
When data were available and it was appropriate, we carried
out the following subgroup analyses on three primary outcomes
(anaemia, haemoglobin, and ferritin concentrations), to look for

possible differences between studies (note, we pragmatically decided not to conduct subgroup analyses on those outcomes with
three trials or fewer).
1. Composition: iron alone; iron + folic acid; iron + multiple micronutrients
2. Anaemia status at baseline (haemoglobin < 120 g/L, adjusted by
altitude and smoking, as appropriate): anaemic; non-anaemic;
mixed/unknown
3. Iron status at baseline (as defined by the trialists): iron deficient;
not iron deficient; mixed/unknown
4. Dose of elemental iron perweek in the intermittent group: 60 mg
of iron or less; more than 60 mg of iron
5. Duration of supplementation: three months or less; more than
three months
6. Malaria status of the area at the time of the trial (as reported by
trialists): yes; no/unknown
We examined differences between subgroups by visual inspection
of the subgroups’ CI, with non-overlapping CI suggesting a statistically significant difference in treatment effect between subgroups.
We also used the Borenstein 2008 approach to formally investigate
differences between two or more subgroup categories.
Sensitivity analysis
We conducted sensitivity analyses ad hoc to examine the potential
effect of clustering on the CI of the summary estimates, by removing cluster-RCTs from the analyses and comparing the effects (see
Appendix 4). We conducted an additional sensitivity analysis ad hoc
with two studies (Hall 2002 (C); Roschnik 2003 (C)), in which approximately half of the participants were young females (< 12 years of
age)to see their effect on the analyses (see Effects of interventions).

Results of the search
The search strategy forthe first publication of this review identified
9484 records for possible inclusion, 2706 of which were duplicates.
We assessed 52 full-text reports and: included 21 studies (from 25
reports); excluded 20 studies (from 24 reports); identified two studies (from three reports) as awaiting classification; and identified
two ongoing studies (see Fernández-Gaxiola 2011a).
The updated search identified 7532 records through database
searches and 296 additional records through searching other
sources. Having removed duplicates, we screened 5098 records on
the basis of title and abstract, and removed 5074 clearly ineligible records. We retrieved 24 full-text reports, which we assessed
against the inclusion criteria (Criteria for considering studies for
this review).We excluded 18 reports (related to: eight newly excluded studies (12 reports), two previously excluded studies (two reports), and one previously ongoing study (four reports)) from the
review, and included four new studies (from four reports). We also
identifiedtwostudies (fromthree reports) as awaiting classification
(ofwhich, one study (two reports)was previously ongoing), and one
new ongoing study (from one report).
Altogetherthis reviewexcluded28 studies (from38 reports), included 25 studies (from 29 reports), has four studies (from six reports)
awaiting classification, and one ongoing study (from one report).

Included studies
We included 25 studies, involving 10,996 participants, all of which
met the pre-established inclusion criteria (Criteria for considering
studies for this review). All studies were published between 1997
and 2018. Most studies focused on the prevention of anaemia and
iron deficiency by improving iron status indicators (Primary outcomes); few studies reported data on the prespecified secondary
outcomes (Secondary outcomes). See the Characteristics of included studies tables for more detail.
Settings
Studies were conducted in 15 different countries, most of them
low- and middle-income countries: Bangladesh, Brazil, France,
Guatemala, India, Indonesia, Iran, Kenya, Malawi, Mali, Mexico,
Nepal, Pakistan, Peru, Sri Lanka and Tanzania. One study was conducted in Europe (Riuvard 2006), four in Latin America (Dos Santos
1999; Zavaleta 2000; Gonzalez-Rosendo 2002; Nguyen 2008), five in
Africa (Muro 1999 (C); Beasley 2000; Hall 2002 (C); Roschnik 2003
(C); Leenstra 2009), and 15 in Asia (Angeles-Agdeppa 1997; Jayatissa 1999 (C); Kianfar 2000; Ahmed 2001; Gilgen 2001; Februhartanty
2002; Shah 2002; Agarwal 2003 (C); Shobha 2003; Soekarjo 2004 (C);
Mozaffari 2010 (C); Joshi 2013; Gupta 2014; Rezaeian 2014; Jalambo 2018).
Most studies were conducted in school settings; however, five studies implemented the intervention in rural and urban communities, health centres, and villages (Dos Santos 1999; Beasley 2000;
Gilgen 2001; Nguyen 2008; Joshi 2013), and one study was conducted among garment factory workers (Ahmed 2001). Five studies exIntermittent iron supplementation for reducing anaemia and its associated impairments in adolescent and adult menstruating women

plicitly mentioned thatthey were conducted in areas with some degree of malaria endemicity (Muro 1999 (C); Beasley 2000; Februhartanty 2002; Hall 2002 (C); Leenstra 2009).
Participants
Participants' ages rangedfrom six (Hall 2002 (C)to 49 (Nguyen 2008)
years of age. While we did notinclude studies specifically recruiting
premenarchal girls - as these are the subject of a separate review
(De-Regil 2011) - two studies recruited young females and separate
data were not available for postmenarchal girls only (Hall 2002 (C);
Roschnik 2003 (C)). Based on the age range reported in these studies, we assumed that at least half of the participants fulfilled ourinclusion criteria and thus we decided to retain them in the review.
If the disaggregated data are made available to us, we will include
them in future updates of the review.
Most studies involved a mix of anaemic and non-anaemic women,
with the exception of six studies thatincluded women with mild-tomoderate anaemia (Dos Santos 1999; Ahmed 2001; Shobha 2003;
Leenstra 2009; Joshi 2013; Gupta 2014), one of which, Shobha 2003,
included only severely anaemic women (i.e. women with haemoglobin concentrations ≤ 8 g/dL). The remaining studies excluded
these severely anaemic women and gave them treatment or referred them to health care (or both). Only two studies specifically
included iron-deficient women (i.e. women with serum ferritin concentrations ≤ 15 mcg/L) (Riuvard 2006; Jalambo 2018).
Samples size varied among included studies, ranging from 24 in Riuvard 2006 to 2461 in Soekarjo 2004 (C); however, for cluster-randomised studies, the analyses only include the estimated effective
sample size, after adjusting the data to account for the clustering
effect.
Interventions (intermittent regimens, supplement composition
and iron dose)
Intermittent regimens
Most studies provided intermittent iron supplementation once a
week and compared it to control (i.e. no intervention), placebo,
daily iron supplementation or other nutrients or dosages also given intermittently once a week. Five studies provided supplements
twice a week compared with: once weekly supplementation (Kianfar 2000; Gupta 2014); daily supplementation (Shobha 2003; Riuvard 2006); or control (Rezaeian 2014). One study provided iron
supplements three days a week and compared this with daily supplementation and placebo (Zavaleta 2000).
Duration of the intervention
Duration of the intervention varied greatly among studies. In 13
studies,womenwere supplemented forthree months orless (Angeles-Agdeppa 1997; Dos Santos 1999; Jayatissa 1999 (C); Muro 1999
(C); Kianfar 2000; Ahmed 2001; Hall 2002 (C); Shobha 2003; Soekarjo 2004 (C); Riuvard 2006; Nguyen 2008; Joshi 2013; Jalambo 2018).
The duration of the intervention was: three and a half months in
three studies (Shah 2002; Agarwal 2003 (C); Roschnik 2003 (C)); four
months in six studies (Beasley 2000; Zavaleta 2000; Februhartanty
2002; Gonzalez-Rosendo 2002; Mozaffari 2010 (C); Rezaeian 2014);
five months in one study (Leenstra 2009); and six months in one
study (Gilgen 2001). The maximum duration of supplementation
was one year (Gupta 2014).
Supplements composition
In 11 studies, women were supplemented with iron only (Dos
Santos 1999; Beasley 2000; Kianfar 2000; Zavaleta 2000; Gonzalez-Rosendo 2002; Shobha 2003; Riuvard 2006; Leenstra 2009;
Mozaffari 2010 (C); Rezaeian 2014; Jalambo 2018). In the remaining studies, women received iron plus folic acid supplements in 10
studies (Jayatissa 1999 (C); Muro 1999 (C); Gilgen 2001; Februhartanty 2002; Hall 2002 (C); Shah 2002; Agarwal 2003 (C); Roschnik
2003 (C); Gupta 2014; Joshi 2013), iron plus multiple micronutrients supplements in two studies (Angeles-Agdeppa 1997; Nguyen
2008), andironplus folic acidandironplusmultiple nutrients in one
(Ahmed 2001) and iron plus folic acid or vitamin A or iron plus folic
acid plus vitamin A in another (Soekarjo 2004 (C)).
Most studies supplemented iron with ferrous sulphate, with the exception of three studies that used ferrous fumarate (Gilgen 2001;
Joshi 2013; Jalambo 2018) and one study that used ferrous chloride (Riuvard 2006). Six studies did not specify the form of iron used
for supplementing women (Angeles-Agdeppa 1997; Muro 1999 (C);
Agarwal 2003 (C); Shobha 2003; Nguyen 2008; Mozaffari 2010 (C)).
All studies used supplements as tablets or caplets.
Iron dose
The 25 studies tested several supplemental doses of iron in the intermittent group but none of the studies exceeded 120 mg of elemental iron per week. See below.
1. 10 mg of elemental iron (one study: Rezaeian 2014)
2. 30 mg of elemental iron (one study: Mozaffari 2010 (C))
3. 50 mg of elemental iron (two studies: Kianfar 2000; Riuvard
2006)
4. 60 mg of elemental iron (seven studies: Dos Santos 1999; Jayatissa 1999 (C); Zavaleta 2000; Februhartanty 2002; Gonzalez-Rosendo 2002; Shobha 2003; Soekarjo 2004 (C))
5. 65 mg of elemental iron (five studies: Muro 1999 (C); Hall 2002
(C); Roschnik 2003 (C); Jalambo 2018)
6. 66 mg of elemental iron (one study: Gilgen 2001)
7. 70 mg of elemental iron (one study: Shah 2002)
8. 100 mg of elemental iron (three studies: Agarwal 2003 (C); Joshi
2013; Gupta 2014)
9. 120 mg of elemental iron (three studies: Beasley 2000; Ahmed
2001; Leenstra 2009)
Angeles-Agdeppa 1997 and Nguyen 2008 examined the effects of
two different doses of elemental iron: 60 mg and 120 mg of elemental iron per week.
Funding sources
Five studies were partially funded (Soekarjo 2004 (C)) or fully funded by international organisations (Jayatissa 1999 (C); Gilgen 2001;
Hall 2002 (C); Agarwal 2003 (C)). Four studies were partially funded by government organisations; two by the Department for International Development in the UK (Beasley 2000; Ahmed 2001)
and two by the Ministry of Health within the country (Kianfar 2000;
Soekarjo 2004 (C)). Four studies were funded by universities and
institutes (Kianfar 2000; Shah 2002; Mozaffari 2010 (C); Rezaeian
2014), and four were partially funded by a pharmaceutical company, as theyprovidedthe supplements used(Angeles-Agdeppa 1997;
Ahmed 2001; Riuvard 2006; Leenstra 2009). Two studies were partially funded by a technical collaboration (an agreement whereby

and two were partially funded by a foundation (Beasley 2000; Leenstra 2009).Only two studies declared no funding source was used to
implementtheir study (Shobha 2003; Jalambo 2018). Seven studies
did not provide a funding source (Dos Santos 1999; Muro 1999 (C);
Zavaleta 2000; Gonzalez-Rosendo 2002; Roschnik 2003 (C); Nguyen
2008; Joshi 2013).
Excluded studies
We excluded 28 studies: 13 studies were not RCTs (Cook 1995; Jackson 2003; Siddiqui 2003; Berger 2005; Crape 2005; Horjus 2005;
López de Romaña 2006; Deshmukh 2008; Vir 2008; Casey 2009; Pasricha 2009; Joseph 2013; Shah 2016); two were reviews (Beaton
1999; Dwividi 2006); one was a commentary on another study (Perrin 2002); nine compared interventions outside the scope of this
review (Bruner 1996; Kätelhut 1996; Tee 1999; Viteri 1999; Ahmed
2005; Ahmed 2010; Ahmed 2012; Moretti 2015; Bansal 2016); two
used a different population (Ramakrishnan 2012; Sen 2012); and
one excluded postmenarchal girls because the anthelmintic drug
given along with the iron supplementation was not safe in cases of
pregnancy (Taylor 2001).
See the Characteristics of excluded studies tables for a detailed description of the studies and the reasons for their exclusion.
Studies awaiting classification
Four studies are awaiting classification (Olsen 2000; Sharma 2000;
Brabin 2014; Malhotra 2013); two of these four RCTs are from Africa
(Olsen 2000; Brabin 2014) and the othertwo are from India (Sharma
2000; Malhotra 2013). Olsen 2000 compared the efficacy of twiceweekly iron supplementation versus placebo. Brabin 2014 compared the efficacy of once-weekly iron-folate supplementation versus folate (control). Sharma 2000 compared the efficacy of onceweekly versus daily iron and folic acid supplementation plus the
effect of added ascorbic acid on the efficacy of iron-folate supplementation. Malhotra 2013 compared the efficacy of twice-weekly iron-folate supplementation versus control versus twice-weekly
iron-folate supplementation plus the effect of nutrition education
versus nutrition education only on haematological status.
The dosages of elemental iron used in the studies were: 60 mg in
Olsen 2000 and Malhotra 2013, 100 mg in Sharma 2000, and unclear
for Brabin 2014.
We were unable to extract data for our outcomes from Olsen 2000
as the data were not disaggregated by sex, or from Sharma 2000
as the data were categorised by percentages. Malhotra 2013 was
only available as an abstract and did not provide data for our comparisons. The Brabin 2014 report included only the qualitative part
of the RCT and was missing the quantitative part for our metaanalysis. In addition, the participants in Brabin 2014 were young
women enrolled prior to their first pregnancy, and more information is needed to clarify the study's eligibility for inclusion in the review.
Ongoing studies
We found one ongoing study from India (CTRI/2017/11/010453).
This study is comparing the efficacy of once-a-week versus daily
iron supplementation at controlling anaemia in adolescent school
girls aged 12 to 16 years with anaemia. The trial will provide 60 mg
of elemental iron forthree months. Recruitment has been completed and some results have been already published. See Characteristics of ongoing studies table.
Risk of bias in included studies
Overall, many included studies did not describe study methods
completely, which made it difficult to assess risk of bias. We contacted some study authors for support and are still awaiting a reply at the time of publication of this review. With the exception of
two studies (Hall 2002 (C); Nguyen 2008), we considered all of the
studies included in this update to be at high risk of bias (or of low
quality).
See the 'Risk of bias' tables (under the Characteristics of included
studies tables)for an assessment ofthe risk of bias of each included
trial, and Figure 2 and Figure 3 for an overall graphical summary of
the risk of bias of all included trials. In the 'Summary of findings' tables, we presented the overall quality of the evidence for each primary outcome, by comparison (Summary of findings for the main
comparison; Summary of findings 2).

Allocation
Sequence generation
Nine studies adequately randomised the participants to the intervention group (Dos Santos 1999; Gilgen 2001; Gonzalez-Rosendo
2002; Hall 2002 (C); Riuvard 2006; Nguyen 2008; Joshi 2013; Gupta 2014; Rezaeian 2014). Of these nine studies, four used a random
number generator (Gilgen 2001; Gonzalez-Rosendo 2002; Hall 2002
(C); Nguyen 2008), one used drawing of lots (Dos Santos 1999), one
used a randomisation table (Riuvard 2006), one used a generated
block (Joshi 2013), one used a lottery method (Gupta 2014), and another used a simple draw (Rezaeian 2014).
Sixteen studies did not state the method used to generate the
random sequence clearly, so we rated these at unclear risk of
bias (Angeles-Agdeppa 1997; Jayatissa 1999 (C); Muro 1999 (C);
Beasley 2000; Kianfar 2000; Zavaleta 2000; Ahmed 2001; Februhartanty 2002; Shah 2002; Agarwal 2003 (C); Roschnik 2003 (C); Shobha
2003; Soekarjo 2004 (C); Leenstra 2009; Mozaffari 2010 (C); Jalambo
2018).
Allocation concealment
Ten studies reported adequate allocation concealment (Jayatissa
1999 (C); Zavaleta 2000; Ahmed 2001; Hall 2002 (C); Agarwal 2003
(C); Roschnik 2003 (C); Soekarjo 2004 (C); Nguyen 2008; Leenstra
2009; Mozaffari 2010 (C)). Of these 10 studies, three kept the code
secure until all data were entered into the computer (Ahmed 2001)
or until after study completion (Nguyen 2008; Leenstra 2009), and
seven were randomised at cluster level and we considered that the
risk of selection bias at the individual level was unlikely (Jayatissa
1999 (C); Zavaleta 2000; Hall 2002 (C); Agarwal 2003 (C); Roschnik
2003 (C); Soekarjo 2004 (C); Mozaffari 2010 (C)).
In 15 studies, the method used to conceal the allocation was unclear or not mentioned (Angeles-Agdeppa 1997; Dos Santos 1999;
Muro 1999 (C); Beasley 2000; Kianfar 2000; Gilgen 2001; Februhartanty 2002; Gonzalez-Rosendo 2002; Shah 2002; Shobha 2003; Riuvard 2006; Joshi 2013; Gupta 2014; Rezaeian 2014; Jalambo 2018).
Blinding
We rated 13 studies at low risk of performance and detection
bias (Angeles-Agdeppa 1997; Dos Santos 1999; Jayatissa 1999
(C); Beasley 2000; Kianfar 2000; Zavaleta 2000; Ahmed 2001;
Gilgen 2001; Februhartanty 2002; Roschnik 2003 (C); Leenstra 2009;
Nguyen 2008; Rezaeian 2014). Of these 13 studies, nine were described as being single or double blinded (Angeles-Agdeppa 1997;
Dos Santos 1999; Jayatissa 1999 (C); Beasley 2000; Zavaleta 2000;
Ahmed 2001; Gilgen 2001; Februhartanty 2002; Nguyen 2008), and
of these nine, five specified that the placebos were of identical
appearance (Angeles-Agdeppa 1997; Jayatissa 1999 (C); Zavaleta
2000; Nguyen 2008; Gilgen 2001). Four studies did not mention or
describe blinding in the study, so we rated them at unclear risk
of performance and detection bias (Hall 2002 (C); Agarwal 2003
(C); Joshi 2013; Jalambo 2018). We rated eight studies at high risk
of performance and detection bias because participants, personnel and outcome assessors seemed to be aware of the treatments
(Muro 1999 (C); Gonzalez-Rosendo 2002; Shah 2002; Shobha 2003;
Soekarjo 2004 (C); Riuvard 2006; Mozaffari 2010 (C); Gupta 2014).
Incomplete outcome data
Loss to follow-up varied greatly among studies, from 1% in Agarwal 2003 (C) to 41% in Roschnik 2003 (C). We rated six studies,
which lost more than 20% of randomised participants or had imbalanced losses between study groups (or both), at high risk of attrition bias (Angeles-Agdeppa 1997; Dos Santos 1999; Beasley 2000;
Ahmed 2001; Roschnik 2003 (C); Nguyen 2008). We judged a further seven studies, which did not mention attrition making it difficult to judge whether the lack of data were due to no losses to follow-up or to incomplete reporting, at unclear risk of attrition bias
(Gilgen 2001; Gonzalez-Rosendo 2002; Shobha 2003; Joshi 2013;
Gupta 2014; Rezaeian 2014; Jalambo 2018). We considered the remaining 12 studies to be at low risk of attrition bias (Jayatissa 1999
(C); Muro1999 (C); Kianfar 2000; Zavaleta 2000; Februhartanty 2002;
Hall 2002 (C); Shah 2002; Agarwal 2003 (C); Soekarjo 2004 (C); Riuvard 2006; Leenstra 2009; Mozaffari 2010 (C)).
Selective reporting
Although it was difficult to assess reporting bias, because we did
not have access to study protocols, we did not find a clear indication of reporting or publication bias by assessing funnel plot asymmetry visually.
Of the 25 included studies, we rated 22 at unclear risk of reporting
bias. We rated one study at low risk of reporting bias because there
was apparently no selective reporting (Jalambo 2018). We considered two studies to be at high risk of reporting bias (Agarwal 2003
(C); Joshi 2013). In Agarwal 2003 (C), data for plasma ferritin concentrations were estimated only in some girls and it was unclear
how the selection was made. In Joshi 2013, there was missing information on compliance at the individual level that was recorded
through home visits and postintervention interviews.
Other potential sources of bias
We rated 14 studies, which appeared to be free of other sources of
bias, at low risk of other bias (Dos Santos 1999; Jayatissa 1999 (C);
Muro 1999 (C); Kianfar 2000; Zavaleta 2000; Gilgen 2001; Agarwal
2003 (C); Soekarjo 2004 (C); Riuvard 2006; Nguyen 2008; Mozaffari
2010 (C); Joshi 2013; Rezaeian 2014; Jalambo 2018).
We rated eight studies at unclearrisk of other sources of bias (Angeles-Agdeppa 1997; Beasley 2000; Ahmed 2001; Gonzalez-Rosendo
2002; Hall 2002 (C); Roschnik 2003 (C); Shobha 2003; Leenstra 2009).
In Angeles-Agdeppa 1997, the intervention was unsupervised during the four-week period, as the supplements were provided on a
take-home basis. In Beasley 2000, the control group was given vitamin B12, which could have potentially impacted anaemia status.
Ahmed 2001 had some variability in the administration of the supplements depending on the factory (i.e. supplements were given
before versus after lunch, with an empty stomach versus having
eaten little). In Roschnik 2003 (C), the results were affected by a
famine in Malawi at the time of the trial. In Angeles-Agdeppa 1997,
Gonzalez-Rosendo 2002, Hall 2002 (C) and Shobha 2003, the distribution of anaemia was not shown. In Leenstra 2009, most of the results forthe fourrandomised groups were presented in graphs that
were difficult to interpret (and consequently have not been included in our Data and analyses tables), and data on several outcomes
were described as non-significant but were not shown (side effects,
including vomiting and diarrhoea).

We rated three studies at high risk of other sources of bias
(Februhartanty 2002; Shah 2002; Gupta 2014). In Februhartanty
2002, there was a higher prevalence of anaemia in the group that
received supplements weekly. In Shah 2002, the daily group were
not explicitly supervised while those in the weekly group were supervised. Finally, Gupta 2014 had missing information on side effects that were recorded by the intervention group.

Intermittent supplementation of iron (alone or plus any other
micronutrients) versus no supplementation or placebo
Eighteen studies involving 8988 women examined intermittentiron
supplementation versus no supplementation or placebo (Angeles-Agdeppa 1997; Muro 1999 (C); Jayatissa 1999 (C); Beasley 2000;
Kianfar 2000; Zavaleta 2000; Ahmed 2001; Gilgen 2001; Februhartanty 2002; Hall 2002 (C); Shah 2002; Agarwal 2003 (C); Roschnik
2003 (C); Soekarjo 2004 (C); Leenstra 2009; Mozaffari 2010 (C); Rezaeian 2014; Jalambo 2018). Nine of these studies met the prespecified criteria mentioned above (see Assessment of risk of bias in included studies) for being at lower risk of bias.
Primary outcomes
Anaemia
Eleven studies reported data on this outcome (Angeles-Agdeppa
1997; Jayatissa 1999 (C); Muro 1999 (C); Zavaleta 2000; Ahmed
2001; Hall 2002 (C); Shah 2002; Agarwal 2003 (C); Roschnik 2003 (C);
Soekarjo 2004 (C); Mozaffari 2010 (C)). We pooled these studies in a
meta-analysis and found evidence that women receiving intermittent supplementation were less likely to have anaemia atthe end of
the intervention than those women who received no intervention
or placebo (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.87; 3135 participants; Analysis
1.1). However, treatment effect sizes varied between studies (T2=
0.16; Chi2= 58.75 (P < 0.001); I2= 83%).
We conducted a subgroup analysis and found no evidence to suggest that the composition of the supplement (iron only, iron plus
folic acid, or iron plus any other micronutrients) affected anaemia
(Analysis 1.2). However, we did find evidence that mixed/unknown
anaemic women in the intervention group were less likely to have
anaemia than anaemic women in the intervention group (RR 0.71,
95% CI 0.55 to 0.93; 2913 participants; Analysis 1.3; Test for subgroup differences: Chi2 = 9.38 (P = 0.002); l2= 89.3%). All studies reported iron status as mixed/unknown at baseline so we were not
able to conduct subgroup analysis (Analysis 1.4). In further subgroup analyses, we found no evidence to suggest that dose of elemental iron per week in the intervention group (Analysis 1.5), duration of supplementation (Analysis 1.6), or malaria endemicity at
the time when the study was conducted (Analysis 1.7) affected
anaemia. There was a high level of heterogeneity between the studies in these analyses (between 79% and 84%). We rated the quality
of this evidence as low.
Haemoglobin
Fifteen studies examined haemoglobin concentrations (Angeles-Agdeppa 1997; Jayatissa 1999 (C); Beasley 2000; Kianfar 2000;
Ahmed 2001; Gilgen 2001; Februhartanty 2002; Hall 2002 (C);
Roschnik 2003 (C); Agarwal 2003 (C); Soekarjo 2004 (C); Leenstra
2009; Mozaffari 2010 (C); Rezaeian 2014; Jalambo 2018). We pooled
these studies in a meta-analysis and found evidence that women
receiving iron supplements intermittently had 5.19 more grams of
haemoglobin perlitre (95% CI 3.07 to 7.32; 2886 participants; Analysis 1.8), than those who received no intervention or a placebo.
Again, treatment effect sizes varied between studies (T2 = 14.01;
Chi2 = 87.02 (P < 0.001); I2 = 84%).
We conducted subgroup analyses and found no evidence to suggest that the composition of the supplement (iron only, iron plus
folic acid, or iron plus any other micronutrients) (Analysis 1.9),
or anaemia status at baseline (anaemic status before the supplementation) (Analysis 1.10) affected haemoglobin.Not enough studies contributed data for the analysis on women's iron status at
baseline (iron deficiency before the supplementation) so that most
women had a mixed/unknown iron status (Analysis 1.11). In further
subgroup analyses, we found no evidence to suggest that dose of
elemental iron per week in the intervention group (Analysis 1.12),
duration of supplementation (Analysis 1.13), or malaria endemicity
at the time when the study was conducted (Analysis 1.14) affected
haemoglobin. There was a high level of heterogeneity between the
studies in these analyses (around 85%). We rated the quality of this
evidence as moderate.
Iron deficiency
Three studies reported data on iron deficiency (Angeles-Agdeppa
1997; Ahmed 2001; Mozaffari 2010 (C)). We pooled these studies in
a meta-analysis and found no evidence thatiron deficiency differed
between the groups (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.04; 624 participants;
Analysis 1.15). The heterogeneity was high but the directions of the
results were consistent(T2 = 0.36, Chi2 = 17.52 (P < 0.001); I2 = 89%) .
We rated the quality of this evidence as low.
Ferritin
Seven studies examined ferritin concentrations (Angeles-Agdeppa 1997; Beasley 2000; Ahmed 2001; Gilgen 2001; Februhartanty
2002; Mozaffari 2010 (C); Jalambo 2018). We pooled these studies
in a meta-analysis and found evidence in favour of the intervention
group (MD 7.46 μg/L, 95% CI 5.02 to 9.90; 1067 participants, Analysis 1.16). The heterogeneity was moderate (T2 = 4.10; Chi2 = 10.94
(P = 0.09); I2 = 45%). We rated the quality of this evidence as low.
We conducted subgroup analyses and found no evidence to suggest that the composition of the supplement (iron only, iron plus
folic acid, or iron plus any other micronutrients) (Analysis 1.17)
or anaemic status at baseline (Analysis 1.18) affected ferritin. Not
enough studies contributed data for the analysis on women's iron
status at baseline (iron deficiency before the supplementation) so
that most women had a mixed/unknown iron status (Analysis 1.19).
In further subgroup analyses, we found no evidence to suggestthat

1.20), duration of supplementation (Analysis 1.21), or malaria enIntermittent iron supplementation for reducing anaemia and its associated impairments in adolescent and adult menstruating women

demicity at the time when the study was conducted (Analysis 1.22)
affected ferritin.
Iron deficiency anaemia
A single study reported data on this outcome (Mozaffari 2010 (C)).
It found no difference in iron deficiency anaemia between those
women who received iron supplements intermittently and those
women who did not receive iron (RR 0.07, 95% CI 0.00 to 1.16; 97
participants; see the illustrative forest plotin Analysis 1.23). We rated the quality of this evidence as low.
All-cause morbidity
A single study reported data on this outcome (Beasley 2000). It
found no difference in all-cause morbidity between those women
who received iron supplements intermittently and those who
women did not receive iron (RR 1.12, 95% 0.82 to 1.52; 119 participants; see the illustrative forest plot in Analysis 1.24). We rated the
quality of this evidence as low.
Secondary outcomes
Diarrhoea
A single study reported data on diarrhoea (Angeles-Agdeppa 1997).
It found no evidence that diarrhoea differed between the groups
(RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.05 to 1.49; 209 participants; see the illustrative
forest plot in Analysis 1.25).
Any adverse side e;ects
Three studies examined any adverse side effects (Angeles-Agdeppa 1997; Gilgen 2001; Leenstra 2009). We pooled these studies in a
meta-analysis and found no evidence that adverse side effects differed between the groups (RR 1.98, 95% CI 0.31 to 12.72; 630 participants; Analysis 1.26).
Adherence
Two studies examined adherence (Zavaleta 2000; Ahmed 2001). We
pooled these studies in a meta-analysis and found no evidence that
women receiving iron supplements intermittently adhered to the
intervention better than those women who did not receive iron (RR
0.99, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.02; 417 participants; Analysis 1.27).
Malaria outcomes
Two studies reported data on malaria outcomes (Beasley 2000;
Leenstra 2009). We pooled these studies in a meta-analysis and
found no evidence that the prevalence (Analysis 1.28) and incidence Analysis 1.29) of parasitaemia, prevalence of high-density
parasitaemia (Analysis 1.30), and clinical malaria (Analysis 1.31) differed between those women who received iron supplements intermittently and those women who did not receive iron.
No studies reported on our other prespecified secondary outcomes: respiratory infections; school performance and cognitive
function; or depression.
Sensitivity analyses
We conducted sensitivity analyses by reanalysing the data for
anaemia, haemoglobin, iron deficiency and ferritin with cluster-RCTs excluded (Jayatissa 1999 (C); Muro 1999 (C); Hall 2002 (C);
Agarwal 2003 (C); Roschnik 2003 (C); Soekarjo 2004 (C); Mozaffari
2010 (C), and found no significant differences in the results. See Appendix 4.
In two studies (Hall 2002 (C); Roschnik 2003 (C)), approximately
half of the participants (276 participants and 376 participants, respectively) were young females (< 12 years of age). We conducted a
sensitivity analysis ad hoc and found that excluding these studies
changedthe estimate for anaemia fromRR0.65 (95%CI 0.49 to 0.87)
to RR 0.58 (95% CI 0.40 to 0.86; results not shown), and haemoglobin from MD 5.19 g/L (95% CI 3.07 to 7.32) to MD 5.67 g/L (95% CI
3.37 to 7.97; results not shown). As the interpretation of our results
did not change, we decided to retain these trials in our analyses and
thus minimise the risk of publication bias.
Intermittent iron supplementation versus daily iron
supplementation
We included 13 studies involving 6213 women in this comparison
(Angeles-Agdeppa 1997; Dos Santos 1999; Jayatissa 1999 (C); Kianfar 2000; Zavaleta 2000; Gonzalez-Rosendo 2002; Shah 2002; Agarwal 2003 (C); Shobha 2003; Riuvard 2006; Nguyen 2008; Joshi 2013;
Gupta 2014). We considered only two of these studies to be at higher risk of bias overall (Shah 2002 and Gupta 2014) and six of these
to be at lower risk of bias overall (Jayatissa 1999 (C); Kianfar 2000;
Zavaleta 2000; Gonzalez-Rosendo 2002; Soekarjo 2004 (C); Nguyen
2008.
Primary outcomes
Anaemia
Eight studies reported data on this outcome (Angeles-Agdeppa
1997; Dos Santos 1999; Jayatissa 1999 (C); Zavaleta 2000; Gonzalez-Rosendo 2002; Shah 2002; Agarwal 2003 (C); Joshi 2013). We
pooled these studies in a meta-analysis and found evidence that
women receiving iron supplements daily were as likely to have reduced anaemia at the end of the intervention as those women receiving iron supplements intermittently (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.93 to
1.29; 1749 participants; Analysis 2.1). The heterogeneitywas low(T2
= 0.01; Chi2 = 7.93 (P = 0.34); I2= 12%). We rated the quality of this
evidence as moderate.
We conducted subgroup analyses and found no evidence to suggest that the composition of the supplement affected anaemia
(Analysis 2.2). We found inconclusive results that anaemia status
at baseline (anaemia status before the supplementation) affected
anaemia (Analysis 2.3), and no studies reported data for the analysis exploring the effects of iron status at baseline (Analysis 2.4). Almost an even number of studies provided 60 mg of elemental iron
or less per week (four studies) or more than 60 mg of elemental
iron per week (five studies), and we found no evidence to suggest
that the dose in the intervention group affected anaemia (Analysis
2.5). In further subgroup analyses, we found no evidence to suggest
that the duration of the intervention (Analysis 2.6) or the malaria
endemicity atthe timewhen the studywas conducted (Analysis 2.7)
affected anaemia.
Haemoglobin
Ten studies reported data on this outcome (Angeles-Agdeppa
1997; Dos Santos 1999; Jayatissa 1999 (C); Kianfar 2000; Gonzalez-Rosendo 2002; Agarwal 2003 (C); Shobha 2003; Riuvard 2006;
Joshi 2013; Gupta 2014).Wepooledthese studies inameta-analysis
and found no evidence that mean haemoglobin concentrations differedbetweenwomenreceiving intermittentironsupplementation
and women receiving daily iron supplementation (MD 0.43, 95% CI
−1.44 to 2.31; 2127 participants; Analysis 2.8). The level of heteroIntermittent iron supplementation for reducing anaemia and its associated impairments in adolescent and adult menstruating women

geneity was high (T2 = 6.45; Chi2 = 40.60 (P < 0.001); I2 = 78%). We
rated the quality of the evidence as low.
We conducted subgroup analyses and found no evidence that the
composition of the supplement (iron only, iron plus folic acid,
or iron plus other micronutrients) affected haemoglobin (Analysis
2.9). However, we did find evidence that anaemic women had a
stronger response to intermittent supplementation than women
with mixed/unknown anaemia status (MD0.43, 95% CI-1.44 to 2.31;
804 participants; Analysis 2.10), but only four studies contributed
to this analysis so the results should be interpreted with caution.
Not enough studies contributed data for the analysis on women's
iron status at baseline (iron deficiency before the supplementation)
so that most women had a mixed/unknown iron status (Analysis
2.11). Almost an even number of studies provided 60 mg of elemental iron or less per week (six studies) and more than 60 mg of iron
per week (five studies); there was no statistical difference between
the groups. In Angeles-Agdeppa 1997, women who received 60 mg
or less intermittently showed higher haemoglobin concentrations
than women who received higher doses (Analysis 2.12). We found
no evidence of any subgroup differences by duration of the intervention (Analysis 2.13) or malaria endemicity at the time when the
study was conducted (Analysis 2.14). There was substantial heterogeneity between the studies in these analyses (between 76% and
80%).
Iron deficiency
Only a single study reported data on this outcome (Angeles-Agdeppa 1997). Itfound no evidence thatiron deficiency differed between
the groups (RR 4.30, 95% CI 0.56 to 33.20; 198 participants; see the
illustrative forest plot in Analysis 2.15). We rated the quality of this
evidence as very low.
Ferritin
Four studies reported data on this outcome (Angeles-Agdeppa
1997; Agarwal 2003 (C); Riuvard 2006; Gupta 2014). We pooled these
studies in a meta-analysis and found evidence that women receiving iron supplements daily had higher concentrations of ferritin at
the end of the intervention than those women receiving iron supplements intermittently (MD−6.07 μg/L, 95% CI −10.66 to −1.48; 988
participants; Analysis 2.16). The heterogeneity was high (T2 = 15.55;
Chi2 = 33.80 (P < 0.001); I2= 91%). We rated the quality of this evidence as very low.
We found statistical differences in all subgroup analyses: daily supplementation was more effective than intermittent supplementation at increasing ferritin concentrations in women regardless of
the composition of the supplement (Analysis 2.21), anaemia (Analysis 2.18) or iron status at baseline (Analysis 2.19), dose of elemental iron (Analysis 2.20), duration of supplementation (Analysis 2.17),
or malaria endemicity at the time when the study was conducted
(Analysis 2.22). However, it should be noted that most subgroups
had only one study or included all four studies in the same subgroup, or had no studies, and that there was substantial heterogeneity between studies in these analyses (between 74.4% and
91%). Therefore,results were inconclusive and should be interpreted with caution.
None of the included studies reported data on the other prespecified primary outcomes: iron-deficiency anaemia and all-cause morbidity.
Secondary outcomes
Diarrhoea
Only a single study reported data on this outcome (Angeles-Agdeppa 1997). It found no evidence that diarrhoea differed between the
groups (RR 2.41, 95% CI 0.12 to 49.43; 198 participants; see the illustrative forest plot in Analysis 2.23).
Any adverse side e;ects
Six studies reported data on this outcome (Angeles-Agdeppa 1997;
Jayatissa 1999 (C); Shobha 2003; Nguyen 2008; Joshi 2013; Gupta
2014). We pooled these studies in a meta-analysis and found evidence that women receiving iron supplements intermittently were
less likely to have any adverse side effects than those women receiving iron supplements daily (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.82; 1166
participants; Analysis 2.24).
Depression
Only a single study reported data on this outcome (Nguyen 2008).
It found no evidence that depression differed between the groups
(RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.07; 369 participants; see the illustrative
forest plot in Analysis 2.25).
Adherence
Four studies reported data on this outcome (Dos Santos 1999; Gonzalez-Rosendo 2002; Shah 2002; Riuvard 2006). We pooled these
studies in a meta-analysis and found no evidence that adherence to
intermittent supplementation differed from that for daily supplementation (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.09; 507 participants; Analysis
2.26).
None of the included studies reported data on the other prespecified secondary outcomes: respiratory infections; work performance and economic productivity; school performance and cognitive function; and malaria incidence and severity.
Sensitivity analyses
We conducted sensitivity analyses to examine the potential effect
of clustering on the CI ofthe summary estimates, by removing cluster-RCTs from the analysis and comparing the effect for anaemia,
haemoglobin, and ferritin. We found no significant differences in
the results. See Appendix 4.

Summary of main results
Available data indicate that, among menstruating women, intermittent oral supplementation with iron (alone or plus any other nutrients) increases haemoglobin and ferritin concentrations and reduces the prevalence of anaemia compared to no supplementation
or placebo.Overall,this positive response does not differ when providing iron supplementation weekly ortwice weekly; nor does it differ with the duration of the intervention, dose used, or malaria endemicity. As the quality of the evidence was, on average, low, the
confidence in the effect estimate is limited and the true effect may
be substantially different from the estimate of the effect.
Compared with daily supplementation, findings suggest that intermittent supplementation has a similar effect in reducing the prevalence of anaemia and increasing haemoglobin concentrations at
the end of the intervention. However, information from a fewer

number of trials shows that women receiving intermittent supplementation are more likely to have lowerferritin concentrations and
fewer side effects at the end of the intervention. As the quality of
the evidence was also, on average, low, the confidence in the effect
estimate is limited and the true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect.
Information on morbidity (including malaria outcomes), work performance and economic productivity, depression, and adherence
to the intervention was scarce, but, thus far, there is no evidence
that intermittent supplementation has any effect on these outcomes, either when compared with a placebo, no intervention, or
with daily iron supplementation. There were no data for the subgroup analysis of the effect of iron status at baseline on anaemia
for intermittent iron supplementation compared to placebo or no
intervention; and, for the other outcomes, there was only one trial.
Overall completeness and applicability of evidence
This review included a total of 25 RCTs involving 10,996 women;
most ofthem were conducted in low- and middle-income countries
in Latin America, Africa, and Asia where anaemia is a public health
problem. The overall quality of the evidence was, on average, low,
and the main limitation of the studies was the lack of blinding and
high attrition.
Intermittent iron supplementation regimens have been proposed
as an efficacious and efficient approach to the prevention and control of anaemia and atleast 100 studies on intermittentiron supplementation regimens in different age groups have been published
during the last 15 years. Although the real effect of an intervention
is context-specific, the results of this review showed that weekly or
twice weekly iron supplementation regimens are effective in reducing the prevalence of anaemia and improving haemoglobin and ferritin concentrations in menstruating women in comparison with no
supplementation or placebo. There was insufficient information to
assess with certainty the effect of this intervention on other health
and nutrition outcomes.
The results suggest that the provision of supplements once a week
with 60 mg to 120 mg of iron is enough to produce a positive
haematological response in populations with different degrees of
anaemia. The efficacy ofthis intervention to treat anaemiawas similar to the efficacy of daily supplementation. Furthermore, in all of
the studies in which anaemia was an inclusion criterion, there was
a higher increase in haemoglobin concentrations among women
who received supplements intermittently. This finding was true
even in different settings and with different levels of supervision.
Folic acid merits a special mention, as its consumption did not
have a differential effect on anaemia and haemoglobin concentrations; however, its use during the periconceptional period has been
proven to reduce the risk of having babies with NTDs, an outcome
that was outside the scope of this review (De-Regil 2015).
According to our review, daily supplementation was more effective
at increasing ferritin concentrations, compared with the provision
of supplements once or twice a week. This may have implications
for the use of intermittent iron supplementation regimens in populations with a high prevalence of iron deficiency where increasing
ferritin concentrations are needed.
Although improved adherence and fewer side effects have been
proposed as an advantage of intermittent supplementation over
daily supplementation, there is no evidence that in relatively wellcontrolled environments and for short periods of supplementation,
women adhere better to intermittent regimens. However, there
was no difference when women were compared with those receiving a placebo either. Clearly, there are gaps on how the duration,
frequency and intensity of side effects affect short- and long-term
adherence to supplementation.
One study (459 participants) reported on the incidence of hospitalisation (Nguyen 2008) and one study (24 participants) reported on
oxidative stress post-supplementation (expressed as the Ferric Reducing Ability of the Plasma or FRAP) (Riuvard 2006). These studies
found no evidence thatthe effects of intermittent supplementation
on these indicators were differentfrom that produced by daily supplementation. None of the other included studies reported data on
these outcomes.
Quality of the evidence
We found the overall quality of the available evidence ranged
between moderate to low in comparison 1 and comparison 2,
both primarily due to substantial heterogeneity, risk of bias, and
methodological inconsistency. Most outcomes with very low quality evidence have only one included study.
Study limitations/risk of bias in included studies
With the exception of two studies (Hall 2002 (C); Nguyen 2008), we
considered all of the studies included in this update to be at high
risk of bias (see Risk of bias in included studies; Figure 2; Figure 3).
Most studies did not describe the methods used to randomly assign participants and conceal allocation. Generally, blinding of participants, care providers and outcome assessors was not attempted, although some studies reported thattechnical staH carrying out
laboratory investigations were unaware of group allocation. This
lack of blinding could represent a potentially serious source of bias.
Inconsistency was also a problem in many of these studies.
Inconsistency
We considered that clinical inconsistency was unlikely for our
outcomes. Variability in participants characteristics, interventions,
and outcomes across the included studies was likely to be low
(Ryan 2016). However, methodological inconsistency was a potentially important factor in the overall assessment of evidence for
our outcomes. We found differences between studies in terms of
methodological factors, specifically blinding and allocation concealment, that may have led to differences in the observed intervention effects (Higgins 2011a). We found substantial heterogeneity in some outcomes, especially anaemia and haemoglobin, that
could be partly explained by subgroup analyses. Although this does
not necessarily mean thatthe true intervention effect varies,results
should be interpreted with some caution.
Imprecision
Imprecision due to small sample sizes orfew events in the included
studies was unlikely. However, we considered imprecision in continuous outcomes (i.e. haemoglobin and ferritin measurements) an
important factor in the overall assessment of the evidence. There
was a lot of variation in the effects ofthe intervention among participants for continuous outcomes, as results showed wide CIs around
the effect estimate (Ryan 2016).

Indirectness
We consideredthatindirectnesswasunlikely.We foundnoindirectness regarding population, interventions, or outcomes assessed
across studies. The study populations paralleled those of clinical
andpublic health interest underreal conditions. The evidence summarised in the review comes from studies addressing the main review questions, especially for our primary outcomes; and our secondary outcomes were almost not addressed.
Publication bias
We considered that publication bias was unlikely. Data used in the
analyses came from representative samples from the studies that
have been conducted. Overall, included studies had large sample
sizes and numbers of events (i.e. more than 300) (Ryan 2016). However, some subgroup analyses had small sample sizes.
Potential biases in the review process
We attempted to minimise bias in several ways. We tried to be as inclusive as possible to avoid potential bias in the search strategy and
found publications in different languages in journals from all continents, although the literature identified was predominantly written in English. We were also able to obtain some unpublished information. Both review authors independently assessed the eligibility of studies for inclusion, participated in data extraction, and conducted the 'Risk of bias' assessments. One review author entered
the data into a form design for the review and the other checked
the data for accuracy. However, carrying out reviews is not an exact science and may require a number of subjective judgements; it
is possible that a different review team may have reached different
decisions regarding assessments of eligibility and risk of bias. We
would encourage readers to examine the Characteristics of included studies tables to assist in the interpretation of results.
Several studies had selection bias, with both unclear random sequence generation and unclear concealment of the allocation sequence, which could have introduced bias at the group level in
terms of differences between the baseline characteristics of the
groups that were compared. When the intervention was allocated
at class level or studieswere cluster(C)RCTs, such as Jayatissa 1999
(C) and Agarwal 2003 (C), we assumed that bias at the individual
level was unlikely. We also assumed a low risk of bias when tablets
had the same colour and shape, or were manufactured by the same
laboratory, although some studies did not describe the method to
conceal the allocation, such as Zavaleta 2000 and Leenstra 2009.
Agreements and disagreements with other studies or
reviews
To our knowledge, only one meta-analysis of RCTs has been conducted previously on the efficacy of intermittent iron supplementation in the control of iron deficiency anaemia (Beaton 1999). That
review included the results of 22 studies completed before 1999 in
different age groups. Of the included studies, nine were carried out
among adolescents and compared once ortwice a week versus daily supplementation; most of them also assessed a control group
that did not receive iron. All studies reported results for haemoglobin and three also measured ferritin. The Beaton 1999 review
did notinclude adult non-pregnant women, and the review authors
pooled the results from school-aged children and adolescents.
Like us, the authors of Beaton 1999 concluded that intermittent
supplementation increased haemoglobin and ferritin levels and reduced anaemia when compared with no intervention or a placebo.
However, findings from Beaton 1999 and Fernández-Gaxiola 2011a
suggested that intermittent supplementation was less efficacious
than daily supplementation in reducing anaemia (RR 1.44, 95% CI
1.33 to1.56; andRR1.26: 95%CI 1.04 to1.52,respectively),butthere
were no statistical differences in haemoglobin concentrations between regimens. The authors of Beaton 1999 concluded that weekly supplementation should be considered for school-aged children
and adolescents only in situations where there is strong assurance
of supervision and high adherence.
A more recent unpublished review included 12 studies evaluating
the effects of weekly iron and folic acid supplementation among
non-pregnant women of reproductive age (Margetts 2007). The results suggested that the consumption of supplements containing
60 mg of elemental iron with folic acid for at least 12 weeks, with or
without deworming treatment, increased iron status, as judged by
increased haemoglobin and, in some studies, serum ferritin levels.
The effect of weekly supplementation on haemoglobin concentration was similar to that reported for daily supplementation, except
in subsets of women who were severely anaemic at baseline where
daily supplementation was more effective.
Overall, the findings of these reviews agree with the findings of this
Cochrane Review. The 25 studies included in ourreview, conducted
in different age groups, contexts and with different levels of supervision, showthatintermittent supplementationmaybe an effective
public health intervention. In contexts where daily supplementation has failed, has not been implemented or there is a strong need
to increase coverage in at-risk populations and economic resources
are limited, the feasibility of delivering intermittent supplementation could make this intervention a viable alternative to consider.
The results of the present review are only applicable to menstruating women. However, another systematic review assessing
the benefits and safety of this intervention in preschool-aged and
school-aged children concurs with our findings (De-Regil 2011).
From the programme implementation perspective, a recent narrative review reports that weekly iron and folic acid supplementation has been successfully implemented in Cambodia, Egypt, India, Laos,the Philippines, and Vietnam,reaching over half a million
menstruating women (WHO-WPRO 2011).

Implications for practice
Intermittent supplementation with iron alone or in combination
with other micronutrients may reduce anaemia and may improve
iron stores among menstruating women in populations with different anaemia and malaria backgrounds. Women receiving supplements intermittently can probably reduce their anaemia and may
achieve similar haemoglobin concentrations at the end of the intervention than women receiving supplements daily. With the current evidence,there is no indication thatthis intervention has detrimental effects on women's health and other indicators of nutritional status. Good supervision and adherence is fundamental for
the intervention to succeed. Intermittent iron supplementation is
a feasible intervention for reaching other populations in a variety
of settings, outside antenatal-care (ANC) visits, immunisation proIntermittent iron supplementation for reducing anaemia and its associated impairments in adolescent and adult menstruating women

grammes, and health programmes for adolescents and women of
reproductive age.
Most studies provided 60 mg of elemental iron or more on a weekly basis, and the effect on the haematological status may not be
affected by the duration of the intervention. The provision of micronutrients other than iron may not alter the haematological response. Iron and folic acid supplementation, therefore, have the
possibility of impacting not only menstruating women, but also of
benefiting those women who become pregnant and their babies,
and improving their nutritional status and impacting other indicators of micronutrients status and health.
The evidence on the efficacy and effectiveness of this intervention
is uncertain due to the low quality of the evidence base. The true
effect may be substantially differentfrom the estimate ofthe effect.
Implications for research
This review has highlighted the need for further research in this
area, particularly on:
1. side effects and adherence to the intervention;
2. patient-important outcomes and adverse effects;
3. the effects of the provision of multiple micronutrients on an intermittent basis and their effect on iron status and other indicators of micronutrients status and health;
4. the periodicity ofintermittentiron supplementation to maintain
an adequate iron status throughout the reproductive years;
5. the effective andsafedose offolic acidthat shouldbe usedalong
with iron to supplement women intermittently;
6. the effects of intermittent iron supplementation regimens on
work performance and productivity outcomes;
7. economic analyses; and
8. the effects of intermittent iron supplementation regimens on
malaria outcomes.
Lack of methodological rigor in some RCTs included in this review
has resulted in low-quality evidence in the review. Improving the
quality of primary studies is needed.

Methods Design: 3-arm, cluster-randomised trial
Unit of randomisation: class; "As school teachers did not agree to randomization at the individual girl
level, the randomization was done at the class section level for the 60 class sections (all class sections
taken)" (quote)
Participants Setting/location: 4 government senior secondary schools (all of these schools cater to the middle socioeconomic group population) in North-East Delhi, India
Sample size: 2088 girls
Age range: 10-17 years
Baseline prevalence of anaemia: ˜ 48%
Inclusion criteria: secondary school girls aged 10-17 years old
Exclusion criteria: girls with haemoglobin < 7.0 g/dL
Interventions Intervention:
60 class sections were allocated to 1 of 3 groups.
1. Group 1 (n = 691): participants did not receive any tablets for the first 100 days and haemoglobin was
estimated at 115 (± 5) days. They were thereafter given tablets containing 100 mg of elemental iron
and 500 μg (0.5 mg) of folic acid with advice to take 1 tablet daily for 100 days; blister packs were
distributed once a week (as in group 2).
2. Group 2 (n = 702): participants received same tablet, containing 100 mg of elemental iron and 500 μg
(0.5 mg) of folic acid, one every day for 100 days; blister packs were provided once a week.
3. Group 3 (n = 695): participants received same tablet weekly until group 1 completed the study (230
days).
Length of the intervention: 100 days (we did not consider the second period in which group 1 and 3
received supplementation)
Outcomes 1. Anaemia (haemoglobin < 120 g/L)
2. Haemoglobin
3. Ferritin
Notes Comments:
1. The intervention was supervised. Compliance was monitored verbally on weekly visits when 7 tablets
in a blister pack were distributed. The used blisters were collected each week;results were notreported.
2. Sexual maturity rating was done using Tanner’s criteria.
3. The time of menarche and regularity of menstrual periods were noted.
4. We adjusted the results of this study to account for the effect of clustering in the data; we used the
estimated effective sample size in the analyses.
5. Malaria endemicity was not reported.

Bias Authors' judgement Support for judgement
Random sequence generation (selection bias)
Unclear risk Comment: randomisation was done at the class section level for 60 class sections. Method of sequence generation not described
Allocation concealment
(selection bias)
Low risk Comment: not mentioned; however, since randomisation was performed at
class section level, selection bias at individual level was unlikely
Blinding (performance
bias and detection bias)
All outcomes
Unclear risk Comment: not described for participants, personnel nor outcome assessors;
however, seems unlikely to have been blinded, and no placebo was used
Incomplete outcome data
(attrition bias)
All outcomes
Low risk Comment: 7 girls in the daily administered group during the second week of
intervention complained of gastric side effects and requested not to continue
in the study and were excluded
Selective reporting (reporting bias)
High risk Comment: girls with haemoglobin < 70 g/L (0.3%) were eliminated from the
analysis. Plasma ferritin and C-reactive proteins (CRP) were estimated in every
tenth girl of the study groups; it is unclear how each girl was selected for these
analyses. Data not available for the second measurement
Other bias Low risk Comment: appears to be free of other bias

Methods Design: 2 × 2, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial
Unit of randomisation: individual level
Participants Setting/location: garment factories in Dhaka City, Bangladesh
Sample size: 480 postmenarchal, non-pregnant teenagers
Age range: 14–19 years
Baseline prevalence of anaemia: ˜ 90%
Inclusion criterion: haemoglobin concentration between 80 and 120 g/L (anaemic)
Exclusion criteria:
1. haemoglobin below 80 g/L

For the purposes of this review, we combined groups 3 and 4, only presenting them separately for the
subgroup analysis by nutrient. We compared the combined group with group 1.
Outcomes 1. Anaemia
2. Haemoglobin
3. Iron deficiency
4. Ferritin
5. Serum iron
6. Total iron-binding capacity
7. Transferrin saturation (%)
8. Vitamin A
9. Adherence (75% of the doses)
Notes Comments:
1. The study population was highly transitional with a high rate of migration.
2. Malaria endemicity was not reported.
Study start date: March 1998
Study end date: September 1998
Funding source: supported by a grant from the Department for International Development, UK. Beximco Pharmaceutical Company, Dhaka, Bangladesh, provided the iron and folate preparation and the Opsonin Pharmaceutical Company, Barisal, Bangladesh, provided the vitamin A preparation.

(attrition bias)
All outcomes
High risk Comment: 289 out of 480 (60%) participants completed the study and the
losses were unbalanced among groups: 41%, 44%, 38% and 35% for groups 1,
2, 3, & 4, respectively. Participants were lost to follow-up for the following reasons: 75% leQ their job or moved to another factory; 3% became pregnant; 5%
refused to give a second blood sample; 12% were absent on the day of blood
collection; and 5% did not take the supplements for the full 12-week supplementation period
Selective reporting (reporting bias)
Unclear risk Comment: insufficient information to permit judgement
Other bias Unclear risk Comment: some variability in the administration of the supplements, depending on the factory management. In some factories, supplements were given
before lunch and in some they were given after lunch. Many participants came
to work after having eaten little or no breakfast and ate only a small lunch. Distribution of mild, moderate and severe anaemia not shown

Participants Setting/location: governmental senior high schools in East Jakarta, Indonesia
Sample size: 363 girls
Age range: 14-18 years
Baseline prevalence of anaemia: 21%
Inclusion criterion: presence of regular menstruation
Exclusion criteria: apparently none
Interventions Participants were allocated to 1 of 4 groups.
1. Group 1 (n = 92): participants received 60 mg of elemental iron, 250 μg (0.25 mg) of folic acid, 750 µg
of retinol, and 60 mg of vitamin C on every school day of the week (Monday-Friday).
2. Group 2 (n = 92): participants received 60 mg of elemental iron + 500 µg (0.5 mg) of folic acid + 6000
µg of vitamin A (as retinol) + 60 mg of vitamin C only on Friday (Muslim prayer day) and placebos
throughout the rest of the week.
3. Group 3 (n = 92): participants received 120 mg of elemental iron + 500 µg (0.5 mg) of folic acid + 6000
µg of vitamin A (as retinol) + 60 mg of vitamin C only on Friday (Muslim prayer day) and placebos
throughout the rest of the week.
4. Group 4 (n = 92): participants received a placebo every school day.
Length of the intervention: 12 weeks
For the purposes of the review, we combined groups 2 and 3, splitting them only for the subgroup
analysis by dose.
Outcomes 1. Anaemia
2. Iron deficiency
3. Prevalence of low retinol
4. Haemoglobin
5. Ferritin
6. Retinol
7. Diarrhoea
8. Adverse side effects (nausea, vomiting, sleepiness)
9. Positive side effects (increased appetite)
Notes Comments:
1. All participants were dewormed at the start of the study with a single 500-mg dose of mebendazole
because 34% of a subsample of 104 participants were found to be infested with Trichuris trichiura.
2. Intervention was supervised during the first 8 weeks. During weeks 9-12 the supplements were provided on a take-home basis after the girls had received careful instruction on tablet intake (because
the last 4 weeks of supplementation fell in the Muslim fasting month).
3. Compliance was monitored by retrieving plastic bags in which the tablets were provided and counting
the number of tablets that remained.
4. Malaria endemicity was not reported.

Methods Design: 3-arm, single-blind, community trial
Unit of randomisation: individual level
Participants Setting/location: junior high schools in Kupang, East Nusa Tenggara, in the eastern part of Indonesia
Sample size: 150 postmenarchal adolescent girls, students from 2 different public high schools. 100
were selected from 1 school and allocated randomly to placebo or weekly groups and a further 50 adolescent student girls recruited at random from a different public high school and allocated to the menstruation group
Age range: ˜ 14-15 years
Baseline prevalence of anaemia: 58%
Inclusion criteria: postmenarchal adolescent girls from two different high schools located in relatively
similar urban areas
Exclusion criteria: none stated
Interventions Participants were allocated to 1 of 3 groups.
1. Group 1 (n = 50): girls received a tablet containing 60 mg of elemental iron (as ferrous sulphate) and
250 μg (0.25 mg) of folic acid every Wednesday.
2. Group 2 (n = 50): girls received a placebo tablet every Wednesday.
3. Group 3 (n = 50): girls were given an iron tablet each day for 4 consecutive days (during menstruation).
Length of the intervention: 16 weeks
For the purposes of this review, we compared groups 1 and 2 only.
Outcomes 1. Haemoglobin
2. Ferritin
Notes Comments:
1. For participants attending morning classes, tablets were taken in the morning. For participants attending afternoon classes, tablets were taken in the afternoon. To control parasitic infestation, all
participants were given a single dose of 500 mg of mebendazole 3 days before supplementation.
2. Due to unfavourable environmental conditions in the study area during lateNovember 1998,the 16thweek tablets for the placebo and weekly groups were taken in the 17th week. The second blood collection was delayed by around 5 days.
3. Malaria area

Length of the intervention: 24 weeks
For the purposes of this review, we only compared groups 1 and 4.
Outcomes 1. Haemoglobin
2. Ferritin
3. Labour productivity
4. Helminth infections
5. Adverse side effects (giddiness, dizziness, nausea, bouts of vomiting, diarrhoea, and stomach pains)
6. Positive side effects (well-being, feeling stronger and more energetic, feeling relief from stomach
pains, anorexia, diarrhoea)
Notes Comments:
1. We could not extract data on work productivity as they did not include standard deviations. There
were no significant differences in the number of days plucked on pruned, unpruned and young tea
bushes between the study groups.
2. Of 139 women in the iron-supplemented group, 87 (62.2%)reported an improvementin well-being after 24 weeks of iron supplementation. Nearly half (46.6%) felt stronger and more energetic and 15.2%
felt relief from stomach pains, anorexia, and diarrhoea. In the placebo group, 51.1% felt better after
the study with 38.9% feeling stronger and more energetic, and 6.4% feeling relief from stomach pains,
anorexia, and diarrhoea.
3. No screening for malaria parasites was performed as malaria is not known to be endemic in the study
region.

to 4.4) than girls receiving iron placebo (rate ratio = 6.4 (95% CI 1.0 to 41.5). There was no difference
between groups regarding the occurrence of potential side effects as nausea, vomiting, or diarrhoea
(data not shown).
4. Malaria transmission in this urban area is largely uncharacterised, but is perennial with highest transmission during peak rainfall from April–July and October–December.

Notes Comments:
1. Full compliance, measured during the third week by positive iron stool tests, was 60-100% and declined to 40-87% at the 5th week. Self-reported compliance tended to be higher.
2. Supplements were distributed by the school teacher and a supplementation record book was provided to each class leaderforthe weekly collection of information about ingestion of the tablet, eventual
side effects, illness, and absenteeism throughout the whole supplementation period. The reported
side effects were: increased appetite, stomach irritation, increase in activity, and less sleepiness.

of its consumption. A study investigator supervised intake of weekly supplements.
2. Quote: "Drop-outs because of poor compliance were almost double in the daily supplementation
group as compared with the weekly group, and persistent adverse effects were also limited to the daily supplementation group. However, because there were fewer participants, the impact of a daily vs
weekly schedule on the adverse effects of iron therapy could not be confidently demonstrated" (data

Outcomes 1. Haemoglobin (stratified by anaemia status*)
2. Attendance
3. Morbidity
4. Adherence
5. Side effects
For the purposes of this review, we pooled all girls in group 1, independently of the degree of anaemia,
and did the same for group 2.
*Based on initial haemoglobin levels, participants were classified as normal (higher than 120 g/L), mildly anaemic (100-119.9 g/L), moderately anaemic (80-99.9 g/L), or severely anaemic (80 g/L), as per the
WHO standard.
Notes Comments:
1. The participants were dewormed with a single dose of 400 mg of albendazole 1 week prior to supplementation.
2. Supplementation was carried out under the strict supervision of the investigator and the supplement
was administered around 4.00 pm, 3 hours after lunch and 3 hours before dinner.

Unit of randomisation: class level
Participants Setting/location: 4 rural or urban schools selected from 2 districts (Bangkalan and Sampang) on the
island of Madura, representing both main school types in Indonesia
Sample size: 1460 postmenarchal adolescents
Age range: 12-15 years
Baseline prevalence of anaemia: 22.9%-26.1%
Inclusion criteria: school students
Exclusion criteria: not available
Interventions 15 intervention schools. All children (n = 2990) received supplements and were divided into 3 groups
according to their grade.
1. Group 1 (n = 489): students received 10,000 IU of vitamin A.
2. Group 2 (n = 516): students took 60 mg of elemental iron (as ferrous sulphate) and 250 μg (0.25 mg)
of folic acid once a week.
3. Group 3 (n = 533): students received weekly doses of 10,000 IU of vitamin A, 60 mg of elemental iron,
250 μg (0.25 mg) of folic acid.
A fourth group (9 schools; n = 923) did not receive the intervention.
Length of the intervention: 3 months

Given that it was unclear how the 9 schools were allocated to receive no intervention, and that the 3 intervention groups were allocated at random to each intervention, we only compared groups 1 and 3.
Outcomes 1. Haemoglobin concentration (stratified subsequently by sex, pubertal status, and anaemia status)
2. Compliance
3. Side effects. We only included data for pubescent girls
Notes Comments:
1. This study also included data for boys, which we did not use in this review.
2. Children took 9 tablets under the supervision of trained field workers (1-2 field workers per ˜ 50 students). 5 tablets were distributed at school with instructions to be taken once a week on a fixed day
at home during Ramadan and school holidays.
3. All pupils were aware of the supplements they were taking and were told iron would improve health
and prevent/cure anaemia.
4. Self-reported compliance and side effects were recorded atthe end ofthe intervention from a random
subsample of girls taking supplements (n = 413; 13.8%). Almost all respondents (90%–97%) claimed
to have taken at least half of the tablets distributed under supervision. Without supervision, however,
this proportion dropped to 50%–70%. 41% of the girls taking supplements reported gastrointestinal
side effects.
5. Malaria endemicity was not reported.
6. We adjusted the results of this study to account for the effect of clustering in the data; we used the
estimated effective sample size in the analyses.

Methods Design: 3-arm, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial
Unit of randomisation: individual level
Participants Setting/location: public secondary school in Villa El Salvador, a peri-urban shanty town in Lima, Peru
Sample size: 312 adolescent girls
Age range: 12-18 years
Baseline prevalence of anaemia: ˜ 19%
Inclusion criteria:
1. living in community for at least 6 months
2. healthy, nulliparous, menstruating regularly in the last three months
3. haemoglobin lower than 80 g/L
Exclusion criterion: multi-vitamin/mineral supplement intake in the last 6 months
Interventions Participants were allocated to 1 of 3 groups.
1. Group 1 (n = 98): girls were given a tablet containing 60 mg of elemental iron as ferrous sulphate 2 days
of the week and a placebo on the other 3 days of the week, Monday-Friday.
2. Group 2 (n = 101): girls were given a tablet containing 60 mg of elemental iron as ferrous sulphate 5
days of the week, Monday-Friday.
3. Group 3 (n = 97): girls were given a placebo 5 days of the week, Monday-Friday.
All tablets had the same brick colour and shape.
Length of the intervention: 17 weeks
Outcomes 1. Anaemia
2. Haemoglobin
3. Serum ferritin
4. Free erythrocyte protoporphyrin
We were not able to use continuous data for haemoglobin because standard deviations and number of
cases and controls were not reported at follow-up. Changes in haemoglobin levels by initial anaemia
status in adolescents were presented in graphs (final haemoglobin concentrations for daily, intermittent, and control groups were 123.7 g/L, 120 g/L and 110.4 g/L, respectively).
Notes Comments:
1. Supplements were administered daily, at school, between meals, together with a sweetened
flavoured drink without ascorbic acid, and under close supervision of a field worker.
2. Girls took 94% of the expected dose of 85 pills, and the median consumption was 80 tablets in the 3
groups. Few girls in the 3 groups reported side effects (e.g. gastrointestinal problems or headache)
during the intervention, and there was no significant difference in the frequency of side effects reported by any group.

Study Reason for exclusion
Ahmed 2005 Randomised, double-blind clinical trial conducted in Bangladesh. Anaemic (haemoglobin less than
120 g/L) girls (n = 197) aged 14-18 years old from rural schools in Dhaka District were entered into a randomised double-blind trial and received twice-weekly supplements of iron and folic acid
or multiple micronutrients (15 micronutrients, including iron and folic acid for 12 weeks). Found
that twice-weekly multiple micronutrients supplementation for 12 weeks significantly improved
the status of the micronutrients assessed, but was not more efficacious than supplementation with
iron and folic acid alone in improving the haematologic status of anaemic adolescent girls. We excluded the study because the authors did not compare intermittent iron supplementation versus
daily supplementation or placebo and hence it was outside the scope of this review.

Study Reason for exclusion
Ahmed 2010 Randomised, double-blind trial conducted in Bangladesh. Anaemic adolescent girls (n = 324) aged
11-17 years, attending rural schools, were given once- or twice-weekly multiple micronutrient supplements or twice-weekly iron-folic acid supplements, containing 60 mg of elemental iron/dose
in both supplements, for 52 weeks. Both once- and twice-weekly multiple micronutrient supplements significantly improved riboflavin, vitamin A, and vitamin C status compared with iron-folic
acid supplements. Overall, once-weekly multiple micronutrient supplements was less efficacious
than twice-weekly multiple micronutrient supplements in improving iron, riboflavin, red blood cell
folate, and vitamin A levels. Micronutrient supplementation beyond 26 weeks was likely important
in sustaining improved micronutrient status. We excluded the study because the authors did not
compare intermittent iron supplementation versus daily supplementation or placebo and hence it
was outside the scope of this review.
Ahmed 2012 Randomised, double blind controlled trial with 324 adolescent girls to investigate the effect of
long-term once-weekly and twice-weekly UNIMMAP dose using a double dose of all nutrients except for folic acid. 3 supplementation groups: 1) double UNIMMAP dose and a placebo once weekly; 2) double UNIMMAP dose twice weekly; 3) routine standard dose of iron-folic acid twice weekly. An equal number of 324 rural school girls aged 11-17 years old were randomly assigned to each
intervention group. Blood samples were collected at baseline, 26 and 52 weeks. MMN-1 was found
to be less effective than MMN-2 in improving iron, vitamins A and B2 and folic acid status. Receiving MMN beyond 26 weeks showed little additional benefit in improving micronutrients status. In
conclusion, given twice weekly for 26 weeks, MMN supplements improved micronutrient status effectively with no significant increase in haemoglobin concentration compared with iron-folic acid
alone in non-anaemic adolescent Bangladeshi girls. We excluded the study because the comparison was outside the scope of this review.
Bansal 2016 Community-based, randomised, double-blind controlled trial conducted among anaemic adolescent girls (n = 446) 11-18 years of age. Sought to assess and compare the impact of weekly ironfolic acid supplementation with or without vitamin B12 on reduction in prevalence of anaemia
and blood concentrations of haemoglobin, ferritin, folic acid, and vitamin B12. Weekly supervised
supplementation was given for 26 weeks. Group A (n = 222): iron (100 mg), folic acid (500 mcg) and
placebo; Group B (n = 224): iron (100 mg), folic acid (500 mcg) and cyanocobalamin (500 mcg for
6 weeks and 15 mcg for 20 weeks). Haemoglobin, serum ferritin, folic acid and vitamin B12 levels
were assessed at baseline and after intervention. A total of 373 participants completed 26 weeks of
supplementation successfully. The study showed that iron-folic acid supplementation with or without vitamin B12 was an effective method of curing anaemia. We excluded the study because the
comparison was outside the scope of this review.
Beaton 1999 A report based on the analysis of 22 completed trials of iron supplementation. The major objective
of the analysis was to determine, to the extent possible, the situations in which the apparent efficacy of intermittent supplementation was maximised. We excluded the report because it was a review.
Berger 2005 Community-based trial in all 19 communes of the Thanh Mien district in the Hai Duong province
in Hanoi, Vietnam. Women were informed by the social marketing campaign about the benefits of
taking preventive iron folic-acid supplementation before and during pregnancy, combined with improved diets. Women recruited were married, nulliparous and planning to have a child. They were
allocated to 2 treatments according to their pregnancy status at baseline: daily supplements containing 60 mg of elemental iron + 250 μg (0.25 mg) of folic acid to pregnant women or weekly intervention to non-pregnant women. We excluded the study because it was not randomised and did
not have a control group.
Bruner 1996 Double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial that assessed the effects of iron supplementation on
cognitive function in adolescent girls (n = 716) with non-anaemic iron deficiency. Girls who enrolled
at 4 high schools in Baltimore, USA, were screened for non-anaemic iron deficiency (serum ferritin
= 12 μg/L or less with normal haemoglobin). 98 (13.7%) girls had non-anaemic iron deficiency, 81
of whom were enrolled in the trial. Participants were randomly assigned oral ferrous sulphate (650
mg twice daily) or placebo for 8 weeks. The effect of iron treatment was assessed by questionnaires
and haematological and cognitive tests, which were done before treatment started and repeated

after the intervention. Authors used 4 tests of attention and memory to measure cognitive functioning. Intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses were done. Of the 81 enrolled girls with nonanaemic iron deficiency, 78 (96%) completed the study (39 in each group). 5 girls (3 = control, 2 =
treatment) developed anaemia during the intervention and were excluded from the analyses. Thus,
73 girls were included in the per-protocol analysis. Ethnic distribution, mean age, serum ferritin
concentrations, haemoglobin concentrations, and cognitive test scores of the groups did not differ
significantly at baseline. Postintervention haematological measures of iron status were significantly improved in the treatment group (serum ferritin = 27.3 vs 12.1 μg/L, P < 0.001). Regression analysis showed that girls who received iron performed better on a test of verbal learning and memory
than girls in the control group (P < 0.02). In this urban population of non-anaemic, iron-deficient
adolescent girls, iron supplementation improved verbal learning and memory. We excluded the
study because the authors did not compare intermittent iron supplementation versus daily supplementation or placebo and hence the study was outside the scope of this review.
Casey 2009 Distribution of weekly iron and folic acid supplementation and deworming were integrated with
routine health services and made available to 52,000 women. Demographic data and blood and
stool samples were collected at baseline and 3- and 12-month post-implementation surveys using
a population-based, stratified, multi-stage cluster sampling design. Authors concluded that a free,
universal, weekly iron and folic acid supplementation programme with regular deworming was associated with reduced prevalence and severity of anaemia, iron deficiency, and hookworm infection when made available to Vietnamese women over a 12-month period. We excluded the study
because it was not randomised and did not have a control group.
Cook 1995 Study designed to examine inhibition in absorption from iron taken on the previous day by measuring iron absorption from 50 mg of radiolabeled ferrous sulphate in 23 female volunteer participants
divided into 2 groups. In the first group, a labelled ferrous sulphate supplement was given with water, and in the second group it was given with a rice-based meal. In both groups, absorption was
measured in a randomised fashion twice in each participant, once with daily and once with weekly supplementation. Those tested for daily supplementation were given an iron supplement daily
for 6 days before testing whereas those tested for weekly supplementation were given no iron for
6 days before testing. When the labelled iron supplement was given with water only, absorption
averaged 8.5% with daily and 9.8% with weekly administration compared with 2.3% and 2.6%, respectively, when given with food. The 13% lower absorption observed with daily administration
in both groups was not statistically significant (P > 0.20). These results indicated that there was no
significant absorptive advantage in giving iron less often than once daily. We excluded the study
because it was not a controlled trial.
Crape 2005 A social marketing programme promoting weekly iron-folic acid supplementation improved
haemoglobin levels in women of reproductive age in Cambodia. Supplementation was increasingly
effective among women of higher socioeconomic status. We excluded the study because it was not
randomised and did not have a control group.
Deshmukh 2008 Effectiveness trial of a weekly, iron supplementation regimen through the government health system among urban slum, rural, and tribal girls of Nashik district, India. Participants were adolescent
girls (14-18 years old) who were given supplements containing 100 mg of iron and 500 μg (0.5 mg)
of folic acid and were trained for three hours every day for three days. The overall prevalence of
anaemia came down significantly to 54.3% from 65.3%. We excluded the study because it was not
randomised and did not have a control group, and hence was outside the scope of this review.
Dwividi 2006 Review of programmes in India of weekly iron supplementation to control anaemia in adolescent
girls. Programmes, implemented in 13 states with varying coverage, targeted 2 different groups:
girls in school and girls out of school. The objective of the review was to summarise and analyse
the status/characteristics of the various adolescent anaemia programmes in India, summarise and
analyse the results of the impact assessments that have already been conducted, and to estimate
and analyse the costs of the programmes. From results, it was evident that weekly iron/folic acid
supplementation in adolescents girls led to a marked decrease in the prevalence of anaemia. In
some cases, a large long-term impact (70%, 2 years) was reported. Reasons for the small but significant decrease in the prevalence of anaemia included low compliance and a possible multicausality of anaemia as deficiency in other vitamins and minerals or genetic causes. It could also be that

a larger reduction in anaemia prevalence may be achieved only after prolonged supplementation.
Supplementation programmes should continue until other sources of iron intake become available, be it from natural dietary sources or from fortified foods, or both. Programmes targeting outof-school girls can be successful as the interventions targeting these girls also resulted in significant decreases in anaemia prevalence. Success factors included: ensuring compliance; counselling
not only the beneficiaries but the community; ensuring continuous tablet supply and regular monitoring; among others. It is clear that if well conceived, the supplementation component of an overall package of services for the adolescent girl costs very little. We excluded this record because it
was a review.
Horjus 2005 Pre-post study to assess the programme effectiveness of 2 school-based weekly iron-folic acid supplementation regimens: 5 months versus 8 months. In both groups, participant girls received 60 mg
of elemental iron and 400 µg (0.4 mg) of folic acid. All girls received a single dose of mebendazole at
the beginning of the study and at 6 months. The study found that school-based weekly supplementation is a feasible and effective intervention to prevent seasonal drops in haemoglobin concentration and increases in anaemia prevalence. We excluded the study because it was not randomised
and the comparisons did not fit the scope of this review.
Jackson 2003 Randomised trial to ascertain whether short-term supplementation with iron was effective in reducing anaemia. Assigned 608 girls with mild-to-moderate anaemia from high schools to 3 treatment groups. Supplementation included 60 mg of iron per week, 3500 μg (3.5 mg) of folic acid per
week, iron + folic acid (same dose), and a control group. In conclusion, 8 weeks of supplements given on a weekly basis were well tolerated and caused few symptoms, and the regimen was effective in reducing anaemia by 30-40%. We excluded the study because the control group was not randomised and included it non-anaemic classmates (with normal haemoglobin values).
Joseph 2013 To assess if weekly iron-folic acid dose (150 mg of ferrous sulphate + 0.5 mg of folic acid along with
vitamin C (100 mg)) in the workplace could reduce the prevalence of anaemia. The study setting
was 7 apparel manufacturing factories and it lasted 16 weeks. A sample of 515 workers were included and given a single dose of albendazole before the supplementation period. Haemoglobin levels of a randomly-selected sample of workers were tested before and after the intervention. Found
that the workplace might be an ideal location for weekly iron supplementation to tackle anaemia
effectively and possibly improve working efficiency. We excluded the study because it was not a
randomised controlled trial.
Kätelhut 1996 Randomised effectiveness study to investigate whether a supplement containing iron and folic
acid, vitamin A, and vitamin C would be more effective than a supplement containing only iron and
a smaller amount of folic acid in improving the iron status of young women. A total of 84 menstruating anaemic and non-anaemic girls were included and randomly assigned to 2 groups. Group
1 received weekly supplements containing 60 mg of elemental iron + 500 mcg folic acid + 20,000
IU vitamin A and 60 mg ascorbic acid for 5 weeks. Group 2 received weekly supplements containing only 60 mg of elemental iron and 250 mcg of folic acid. Haemoglobin, mean cell volume, and
serum ferritin increased in both groups, confirming that weekly supplementation was effective in
improving iron status in a short time. We excluded the study because the comparison was outside
the scope of this review.
López de Romaña 2006 Cluster trial conducted in Peru among women and adolescent girls of childbearing age and children under 5 years of age, to assess the impact of a campaign on the growth of children and on
anaemia among children and among women and adolescent girls of childbearing age. Weekly multi-micronutrient supplementation was provided for 8 weeks in communities with a high prevalence
of stunting; control households were selected from communities with a lower prevalence of stunting. There were no significant effects of weekly multi-micronutrient supplementation on anaemia
or growth. We excluded the study because it was not randomised.
Moretti 2015 Authors conducted 3 separate studies with the aim of measuring acute iron-induced increase in
hepcidin. They used a cross-over design study to assess iron status markers. In study 1, participants
were randomly assigned to take 2 iron challenges either as a single dose or as 2 doses given on consecutive days; hepcidin response was assessed after 48 hours. In study 2, 2 single doses of 60 mg
of elemental iron were administered on 2 consecutive days and, similarly hepcidin response was

assessed after 48 hours. In study 3, the effect of administering 60 mg of iron twice daily during 24
hours on hepcidin levels and iron absorption was assessed. The duration of hepcidin response supported alternate days of supplementation. We excluded the study because the setting, population
and intervention were outside the scope of this review.
Pasricha 2009 Multi-stage, cluster-sampling study. A programme of weekly iron and folic acid supplementation and deworming every 4 months for all women of reproductive age living in Yen Bai province,
Vietnam, was implemented by active distribution through the existing primary health structure.
Women received ferrous sulphate and folic acid tablets. After 3 months, anaemia prevalence fell to
58/221 (26.2%), and the mean haemoglobin change was + 3.5 g/L (95% CI 0.9 to 6.6). We excluded
the study because it was not randomised and did not have a control group, and hence was outside
the scope of this review.
Perrin 2002 We excluded this record because it was a commentary paper on Shah 2002.
Ramakrishnan 2012 Double-blind, randomised controlled trial with 5011 women, to evaluate whether providing additional, pre-pregnancy, weekly iron-folic acid or multiple micronutrient supplements improves iron
status and anaemia during pregnancy and early postpartum, compared to folic acid only. Women
were provided with weekly supplements containing either only 2800 mcg of folic acid (control
group), 60 mg iron + 2800 mcg of folic acid, or 15 micronutrients with similar amounts of iron and
folic acid. All women who became pregnant (n = 1813) in each of the 3 groups received daily supplements (60 mg of iron + 400 mcg of folic acid) through delivery. Haematological indicators were
assessed at baseline (pre-pregnancy), during pregnancy, postpartum, and in cord blood. We excluded the study because, although supplements were given during pre-pregnancy, no outcomes
on pre-pregnancy (i.e. menstruating women) were reported, only pregnancy and postpartum.
Sen 2012 Randomised, efficacy controlled trial to assess the impact of iron-folic acid supplementation on hemanitic status and growth of school girls. The trial was conducted in primary urban schools with
girls (aged 9-13 years) only. 4 schools were randomly assigned to either treatment or control: 100
mg of elemental iron + 0.5 mg of folic acid once weekly, twice weekly, daily, and no treatment in
the control group. Haemoglobin levels increased significantly in all intervention schools, with higher increases among anaemic girls. Twice-weekly supplementation was comparable to daily supplementation with regard to impact on haemoglobin and growth, at less cost and greater feasibility. We excluded the study because it did not include menstruating girls: girls who attained their
menarche (n = 18), prior to or during the study, were excluded from the analysis though they received the supplements.
Shah 2016 Community-based, cross-sectional study in 5 tribal villages in India to describe the burden of
anaemia. The study included adolescent boys (n = 127) and girls (n =117) aged 10-19 years. They
were provided weekly with iron-folic acid supplements containing 100 mg of elemental iron and
500 mcg of folic acid, along with the distribution of abendazole tablets for bi-annual deworming.
Awareness sessions were conducted for mothers and adolescents. Results showed a significant
reduction in anaemia of all severity among adolescents boys and girls. We excluded the study because it was not a randomised controlled trial.
Siddiqui 2003 Study to compare improvement in haemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular haemoglobin and ferritin levels in children (aged 5-10 years ) and women of reproductive age
(15-45 years of age), who were supplemented orally with single and double doses of ferrous sulphate daily and once weekly. 20 children received 200 mg of ferrous sulphate daily and 20 received
the same dose once weekly for 2 months. 10 women received 300 mg of ferrous sulphate daily, 10
received the same dose once weekly, and 10 received 600 mg of ferrous sulphate once weekly for 1
month. All parameters improved significantly in children who received 200 mg of ferrous sulphate
daily and weekly. Similarly, the parameters improved significantly in women who received 300 mg
of ferrous sulphate daily and 600 mg of ferrous sulphate weekly. In conclusion, weekly supplementation of iron was far better at controlling iron deficiency anaemia, due to cost-effectiveness and
better compliance. We excluded the study because it was not randomised and did not have a control group, and hence was outside the scope of this review.

Taylor 2001 Randomised controlled trial with 428 primary school students stratified into 6 groups by age, sex,
and intervention, with the objective of measuring the effect of different anthelmintic treatments
and iron supplementation regimens provided twice at 6-monthly intervals for 1 year. Half of the
students received iron supplementation (200 mg of ferrous fumarate weekly for 10 weeks). Students received 2 anthelmintic regimens, either 400 mg of albendazole plus 40 mg/kg of praziquantel or 400 mg of albendazole on 3 consecutive days plus 40 mg/kg of praziquantel, or placebo. 12
months after treatment there was a significant increase in haemoglobin levels (P = 0.02) among
pupils receiving triple-dose albendazole, praziquantel and ferrous fumarate; students receiving no
anthelmintic treatment showed a significant decrease, as did pupils who received triple-dose albendazole and praziquantel but no iron. We excluded the study because postmenarchal girls were
excluded from the study due to risk of pregnancy and treatments were not secure during pregnancy (at the moment, the safety of albendazole during pregnancy has not been established).
Tee 1999 Study that investigated whether long-term, weekly iron and folic acid supplements administered at
school would improve haemoglobin and ferritin concentrations in adolescent girls, including those
with mild-to-moderate anaemia and haemoglobin concentrations indicating borderline anaemia.
266 girls with haemoglobin concentrations of 80–119.9 g/L (group A) and 358 girls with haemoglobin concentrations of 120–130 g/L (group B) who were otherwise healthy took part; group C did not
receive supplements but was not followed-up. All 266 girls in group A and 268 (out of 358) girls in
group B were randomly assigned to receive either 60 mg or 120 mg of elemental iron plus 3500 μg
(3.5 mg) of folic acid weekly for 22 weeks. 90 of the girls in group B were randomly assigned to receive only 5000 μg (5 mg) of folic acid weekly. Authors concluded that long-term, weekly iron-folic
acid supplementation was a practical, safe, effective, and inexpensive method for improving iron
nutrition in adolescent school girls. We excluded the study because girls in both arms were given
iron on a weekly basis.
Vir 2008 Study performed in school and non-school girls aged 11-18 years that aimed to assess the effectiveness of weekly iron-folic acid supplementation in reducing the prevalence of anaemia in adolescent girls. The project provided weekly iron-folic acid tablets, family life education, and deworming
tablets every 6 months to 150,700 adolescent school and non-school girls of a total district population of 3,647,834. Groups were not evaluated simultaneously. In 4 years, the overall prevalence of
anaemia was reduced from 73.3% to 25.4%. Haemoglobin levels and anaemia prevalence were influenced significantly at 6 months. No difference in the impact on haemoglobin or anaemia prevalence was observed between supervised and unsupervised girls. We excluded the study because it
was not randomised and did not have a control group.
Viteri 1999 Randomised, double-blind trial involving 239 healthy, menstruating women, older than 18 years of
age (some anaemic and some iron deficient) from the University of California, Berkely community,
USA. Exclusion criteria: blood donation during the previous 6 months, pregnancy, pregnancy terminated during the previous year, lactating, meno-metrorrhagia, having a chronic condition interfering with normal iron metabolism, currently taking or having taken therapeutic iron during the last
6 months, and predicted impossibility to comply with the experimental protocol. Group 1 received
60 mg of elemental iron + 250 µg (0.25 mg) of folic acid daily for 3 months and 250 µg (0.25 mg) of
folic acid weekly for 4 months. Group 2 received 60 mg of elemental iron + 250 µg (0.25 mg) of folic
acid daily for 3 months and 60 mg of elemental iron + 250 µg (0.25 mg) of folic acid weekly (same
dose) for 4 months. Group 3 received 250 µg (0.25 mg) of folic acid daily for 3 months and 250 µg
(0.25 mg) of folic acid (same dose) weekly for 4 months. We excluded the study because the intervention groups did not match the comparisons of interest in this review.

Method Approach Reason for non-use
Measures of
treatment effects
Continuous data
We had planned to use the SMD to combine trials
that measured the same outcome but used different
methods.
There was no need to use the SMD to combine trials as
outcomes were measured with the same methods.
We had planned to conduct a sensitivity analysis to
examine the effects of removing studies at high risk
of bias (studies with unclear or high risk of bias for
sequence generation and allocation concealment,
and either high levels of attrition or no blinding)
from the analyses and comparing the effect.
It was not possible to conduct this analysis because only two studies were considered at low risk of bias according to our predefined criteria (Hall 2002 (C) and
Nguyen 2008).
Sensitivity analysis
We had planned to conduct a sensitivity analysis to
explore the effect of missing data.
We were not able to conduct this analysis given that 13
out of 25 studies had attrition, and 22 out of 25 studies
had unclear risk of reporting bias.

Appendix 3. Criteria for assessing risk of bias
Sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias)
We described for each included study the method used to generate the allocation sequence. We assessed the method as follows.
1. Low risk of bias: any truly random process (for example, random number table; computer random number generator)
2. High risk of bias: any non-random process (for example, odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number)
3. Unclear risk of bias: insufficient information to facilitate a judgement of low or high risk of bias
Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias)
For each included study we described the method used to conceal the allocation sequence (when applicable) and assessed whetherintervention allocation could have been foreseen in advance of, or during recruitment, or changed after assignment. We assessed the method
as follows.
1. Low risk of bias: concealed allocation using, for example, telephone or central randomisation, consecutively numbered sealed opaque
envelopes (or equivalent)
2. High risk of bias: allocation based on, for example, open random allocation, unsealed or non-opaque envelopes
3. Unclear risk of bias: insufficient information to facilitate a judgement of low or high risk of bias
Blinding (checking for possible performance and detection bias)
For each included study we described the methods used to blind performance and outcome assessment. Forthe first one, we described the
methods used, if any, for blinding: 1. study participants and 2. personnel, from knowledge of the allocated intervention during the study.
For the second one, we described the methods used, if any, for blinding: 3. outcome assessors, from knowledge of which intervention a

participant reviewed. Whilst we reported these judgements separately, we combined the results into one judgement of overall risk of bias
associated with blinding as follows (Higgins 2011a).
1. Low risk of bias: blinding of participants, key study personnel and outcome assessment ensured, and unlikely that blinding could have
been broken; or none or incomplete blinding but the review authors judged that the outcome or outcome measurement was unlikely
to be influenced by lack of blinding
2. High risk of bias: blinding of key study participants and personnel or outcome assessment attempted, but likely that blinding could
have been broken and the outcome or outcome measurementinfluenced by the lack of blinding; or no blinding orincomplete blinding,
and the outcome or outcome measurement was likely to be influenced by lack of blinding
3. Unclear risk of bias: insufficient information to facilitate a judgement of low or high risk of bias
Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias through withdrawals, dropouts, protocol deviations)
For each included study we described the completeness of data, including attrition and exclusions from the analysis, and noted if attrition
levels were higher for one prespecified outcome or group of outcomes. We also noted whether missing data were imbalanced across
groups, the reasons for attrition or exclusions where reported, or whether data were imputed (and, if so, the methods used). We assessed
the methods as follows.
1. Low risk of bias: fewer than 20% of cases lost to follow-up and balanced in numbers across intervention groups
2. High risk of bias: 20% or cases lost to follow-up or outcome data imbalanced in numbers across intervention groups
3. Unclear risk of bias: insufficient information to facilitate a judgement of low or high risk of bias
Selective reporting bias
For each included study we described how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found. We
assessed the methods as follows.
1. Low risk of bias: it was clear that all of the study’s prespecified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review were
reported
2. High risk of bias: not all the study’s prespecified outcomes were reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not prespecified; outcomes of interest were reported incompletely and so could not be used;the study failed to include the results of a key outcome
that was expected to be reported
3. Unclear risk of bias: insufficient information to facilitate a judgement of low or high risk of bias
Other sources of bias
For each included study we described any important concerns we had about other possible sources of bias and assessed them as follows.
1. Low risk of bias: study appeared to be free of other sources of bias
2. High risk of bias:there was atleast one importantrisk of bias; for example,the study had a potential source of bias related to the specific
study design as not being blinded or selective outcome reporting
3. Unclear risk of bias: insufficient information to facilitate a judgement of low or high risk of bias

There are a number of differences between this review and our protocol (Fernández-Gaxiola 2011b).
1. General
a. We cited the relevant chapters of the Cochrane Handbook of Systematic Reviews of Interventions, instead of the book, when presenting the methods used in the review, in order to direct the reader to the most relevant sections.
2. Types of outcome measures.
a. Given that the population of menstruating women includes premenarcheal girls and adult women, and each group uses a different
cutofffor anaemia,we changed our previous definition of anaemia from "'haemoglobin concentration < 120 g/L, adjusted by altitude
where appropriate" to "haemoglobin concentration below a cut-oH defined by trialists, adjusted by altitude where appropriate".
b. We also changed the name of the outcome "any other side effects" to "any adverse side effects", to avoid mixing negative effects,
such as nausea or vomiting, with positive effects such as improved awareness or activity.
3. Electronic searches
a. We revised the search strategy to improve its precision.
b. We did not search the following three databases, which are listed in the protocol for this review (Fernández-Gaxiola 2011b):
i. BIOSIS, as it was no longer available to us;
ii. metaRegister of Controlled Trials, as it was under review at the time of this update; and
iii. Networked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations, as it was not available at the time of this update.
c. We searched two additional Ovid MEDLINE segments, which are updated daily: MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations;
and MEDLINE Epub Ahead of Print.
d. We also searched CinicalTrials.gov and IMBIOMED to look for any relevant registered clinical trials.
4. Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity
a. As very few studies reported data for most of the outcomes, we limited the subgroup analyses to the following three primary outcomes: anaemia, haemoglobin, and ferritin concentrations.
b. In addition to visually examining the forest plots, we also used the Borenstein 2008 approach, to formally investigate differences
between two or more subgroups.
5. Sensitivity analysis
a. We conducted sensitivity analyses ad hoc to examine the potential effect of clustering on the CI of the summary estimates, by removing cluster-RCTs from the analyses and comparing the effects. We reported the results of this analysis in Appendix 4.
b. We conducted an additional sensitivity analysis ad hoc with two studies (Hall 2002 (C); Roschnik 2003 (C)), in which approximately
half of the participants were young females (< 12 years of age), to assess their effect on our analyses.
