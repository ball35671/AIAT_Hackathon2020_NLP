Editorial introduction
This paper was accepted after revision to help ensure that
all adequately designed studies of weekly and daily iron
supplementation of vulnerable groups are available for
further peer review after publication. Although this study
was too short to be an adequate test of preventive supplementation, there was no significant difference in haemoglobin response to weekly and daily iron. A greater
response of ferritin to daily than to weekly iron in the
short period of eight weeks is to be expected. However,
for a long-term preventive programme, the slower ferritin response is not disadvantageous, since iron stores will
slowly rise to desirable levels with several months of weekly
supplementation [1]. With daily supplementation, there
is a tendency to initially undesirable high serum ferritin
levels that only gradually become normal.

Abstract
In Sri Lanka 36% of all adolescents have inadequate iron
intakes. Daily and weekly iron supplementation of 659
adolescent schoolgirls, divided into three groups, was
studied in an eight-week double-blind trial. One group
received 60 mg of iron, 250 µg of folic acid, and 100 mg

of vitamin C daily. The second group was given the same
doses on a weekly basis. The third group was given a
placebo. All of the participants were dewormed at the
beginning of the study. Anaemia was more common among
older adolescents. Haemoglobin levels increased significantly
at the end of the study. The prevalence of anaemia was
reduced from 25% to 9.5% by weekly supplementation
and from 18.5% to 8.6% by daily supplementation. The
difference in haemoglobin levels between the two groups
receiving supplementation was not significant. The daily
administration of iron produced a greater increase in serum
ferritin than weekly administration. The unit cost of weekly
supplementation was 3.24 SLR (Sri Lankan rupees), equal
to $US0.05. On the basis of these results, long-term weekly
doses of iron are suitable for the prevention of irondeficiency anaemia in adolescents. Use of the school as
the administration channel ensures compliance.
Introduction
Iron deficiency is estimated to cause anaemia in two
billion people worldwide, and another billion are iron
deficient. Inadequate iron is the most prevalent nutritional deficiency. An iron-supplementation programme
has the potential to prevent iron deficiency in substantial
segments of the population, as demonstrated in other
countries [1].
Adolescence has been defined by the World Health
Organization (WHO) as the period between the ages
of 10 and 19 years [2]. It is also a period of increased
nutritional requirements. In addition to the increased
iron needs of the expanding red cell mass and myoglobin
in newly gained muscle tissue, adolescent girls require
up to 15% more iron to compensate for menstrual blood
losses [3]. The haemoglobin cut-offs used to define
anaemia in adolescents over 12 years and under 12 years
of age living at sea level are 12 and 11.5 g/dl, respectively [4]. The prevalence of anaemia was 36% among
adolescents in Sri Lanka [5].
Preventing and correcting iron-deficiency anaemia
among adolescents is urgent because of its negative con-
430
sequences, which include decreased immunity, increased
morbidity, and impaired cognitive performance [6].
Adolescent girls are an important target group because
they are future mothers, and they can often be reached
relatively easily through schools. Although in principle prevention and treatment of nutritional iron deficiency is simple, i.e., increasing available iron through
diet and preventing abnormal iron losses, achieving these
goals is not easy. Regular provision of supplementary
iron and folate tablets to adolescent girls from the onset of menses has proved to be effective [7]. However,
the health infrastructure required for delivery of these
supplements is often inadequate for the implementation of this approach.
The daily administration of 60 mg of iron results in
a rapid decline in percent of iron absorbed. It also loads
the intestinal epithelium with iron and often causes
adverse gastrointestinal symptoms. Since the renewal
time of the intestinal mucosa is five to six days, a similar weekly dose of iron should be efficacious, given
adequate time and compliance, and side effects would
be minimized. Large-scale programmes to combat iron
deficiency among adolescents have seldom been
attempted because of the costs of daily supplementation and the extra managerial burden for the health
sector [8]. To improve the iron status of adolescents,
alternative approaches that are less costly and less burdensome to the health sector are needed.
Supplementation using intermittent dosing schedules may offer such an alternative for large-scale programmes targeted to children. Studies in pre-school
children [9], adolescents [10], and pregnant women
[11] showed that intermittent iron supplementation
was as effective in improving iron status as daily supplementation. Supplementation on a weekly instead of
a daily basis decreases programme cost and might increase compliance. For these reasons, we tested the hypothesis that weekly iron supplementation would be
as effective as daily iron supplementation under reallife community conditions in Sri Lanka when schools
were used as the distribution channel.
Materials and methods
The study was designed as a double-blinded, placebocontrolled clinical trial. It was conducted in a girls’
schools with classes up to year 10 in the district of
Colombo, Sri Lanka. The girls were from 10 to 17 years
of age and were distributed among five classes (years
6–10). Some schools with classes up to year 13 were
closed during the study period. The sample size was
calculated on the basis of the formula given by Pocock
[12]. To achieve significant results at the 5% level with
a 5% drop-out rate at a power of 90%, 231 girls were
assigned to each group. Nine schools were selected
randomly.
In each school, one grade from years 6 to 10 was
randomly selected for the study. Three parallel classes
from each school were studied. When three parallel
classes of the same grade were not available in the same
school, three consecutive classes were selected (e.g., years
6, 7, and 8). All selected classes in nine schools were
invited to participate in the study. Subjects were excluded
if they had chronic infectious diseases or cardiopathies,
if they had taken supplements or medications containing
iron during the previous month, or if they had a haemoglobin level less than 10 g/dl with a blood picture
showing any other kind of anaemia. One class in each
school in each treatment group (nine classes for each
treatment), with a total population of 690 girls 10 to
17 years of age, was enrolled for the study.
The Institute’s ethical review committee approved
the study. The girls excluded because of blood findings indicative of an anaemia not due to iron deficiency
were referred for further investigation. After permission had been obtained from the education authorities, the schools were visited and the principals and
teachers of the selected classes were briefed about the
study. The girls selected to participate received letters
explaining the purpose of the study to obtain the consent of their parents. After written consent had been
obtained, the fieldwork was carried out from September to December 1997.
Iron and folate tablets distributed by UNICEF were
used in the study. Each tablet contained 60 mg of elemental iron and 250 µg of folic acid. Supplements and
placebos had the same colour and shape and were not
distinguishable by sight. Therefore, the girls, teachers,
and interviewers were not aware of differences among
the treatment regimes.
All the girls who participated in the study were given
the specified supplementation regime for each school
as follows. Those in class 1 (243 girls) were given a daily
dose of ferrous sulphate (60 mg elemental iron) and
250 µg of folic acid in a combined tablet (iron/folate)
and 100 mg of vitamin C five days per week, Monday
through Friday. Those in class 2 (230 girls) were given
the same dose of iron/folate and vitamin C, but only
once a week on Monday, and they were given a placebo replacement for the iron/folate and vitamin C
during the other four days. Those in class 3 (217 girls)
were given the placebo replacement for iron/folate and
vitamin C five days per week, Monday through Friday.
Fingerprick samples of blood were collected to measure the haemoglobin level by the HemoCue method.
The instrument was standardized before each session.
The readings were recorded immediately on the questionnaire. The samples were taken with disposable needles in the morning before the interval snack, when
the participants were in a seated position. About 5%
of the samples were duplicated, and the variability
was 0.89 g/L.
In one school chosen at random, 5 ml of antecuR. Jayatissa and C. Piyasena
431
bital venous blood was collected from each participant
with minimum stasis to measure serum ferritin and
haemoglobin levels. Disposable syringes and needles
were used for venipuncture. The blood was collected
in the specified bottle and transported to the laboratory within two to three hours. The serum was separated on the same day and refrigerated at 4° to 8°C.
After the final blood collection, serum ferritin was determined in the samples by enzyme immunoassay using a commercial kit. Duplicate analyses were performed
for 5% of the samples, and the variability was 0.54 µg/L.
Control sera with a mean ferritin value of 31.2 ± 6.2
µg/L were provided by the manufacturer.
On the same day that the blood samples were drawn,
height and weight were measured using standard anthropometric techniques. The electronic weighing scales
(with precision up to 100 g and with a digital display)
and anthropometric rods (with precision up to 10 mm)
were used for all measurements. All the equipment was
standardized each morning before the measuring session. The girls were measured in the morning without
shoes. To detect inter- and intra-observer variability,
duplicate measurements were obtained by the same
measurer and recorder in 5% of the sample and by a
different measurer and recorder in 10% of the sample;
the variability was 0.3 to 0.5 cm for height and 0.1 kg
for weight.
To eliminate a major source of variation among subjects, anthelmintic therapy, consisting of a single 500-
mg dose of mebendazole, was given to all the girls on
the first day, without prior screening.
The girls who participated in the study were given
letters to be submitted to their family doctor or to any
other doctor if they happened to seek treatment during the study. They were requested to avoid any additional iron or vitamin preparations.
A two-week supply of supplement and placebo tablets was issued to each class teacher. The tablets for each
day were packed in a sealed polythene bag labelled with
the date and the class. Weekends and public holidays
were excluded. If a girl was absent, the teacher was asked
to keep the packet and turn it over to the officer who
visited the school next. The teachers administered the
tablets at the time of the marking of attendance registers around 9 a.m. under direct supervision, to make
sure the girl swallowed the tablets.
The teachers maintained the daily record sheets of
the students and recorded whether the students were
present or absent, the tablets administered, and any
complaints. Written guidelines were given to each
teacher. The schools were visited once every two weeks.
At this time the tablets for the next two weeks were
left and the balance from the previous two weeks was
collected.
On the day after the last dose was administered, i.e.,
after eight weeks, another blood sample was collected.
The participants who had had signs of vitamin deficiencies
on the previous examination were treated, and other
medical conditions such as dental caries were referred
for treatment. All the girls were given oral health education information on iron-deficiency anaemia, its prevention, and its dietary management. In addition, written
information was distributed in the form of pamphlets.
Results
A total of 690 girls were enrolled in the study. The dropout rate was 4.5%. The reasons for dropping out were
side effects (16 girls, 52%), leaving school (10 girls, 32%),
or doctor’s advice not to take the tablet with other treatment (5 girls, 16%). Side effects were reported by 16
girls: 11 in the daily supplementation group and 5 in
the weekly group. The side effects reported included
constipation, sleepiness, abdominal pain, rash, and
nausea. Usually the side effects became milder after a
couple of days and eventually disappeared. In some cases,
however, they caused the girls to discontinue treatment.
The girls who dropped out did not differ significantly
from those who remained in the study in weight, height,
age, initial haemoglobin concentration, and other factors. The compliance was 100% on the days when the
girls were in school, unless the girls were drop-outs.
Of the 659 girls who completed the study, 139 (21%)
were anaemic. The numbers of girls in the weekly, daily,
and placebo treatment groups were 220 (33%), 222
(34%), and 217 (33%), respectively.
Though the groups were randomly allocated by
classes, not by individuals, the similarity of the subjects’ characteristics among the groups was assessed by
comparing the variables age, level of mother’s education (completed in school), number of siblings, birth
order, nutritional status (determined by body mass
index), and age of menarche (table 1). The girls in the
group that received daily supplementation were significantly younger than those in the other two groups.
The factors affecting the initial haemoglobin values
were compared at the beginning of the study to detect
any confounding effect of these factors on the supplementation (table 2). The girls were classified as anaemic or non-anaemic according to the age-specific cutoffs for initial haemoglobin values. The anaemic and
non-anaemic groups did not differ in age, mother’s years
of education, number of siblings, birth order, nutritional status, and age of menarche.
Initial haemoglobin (F = 0.46, p = .6), final haemoglobin (F = 1.6, p = .2), and the change in haemoglobin
(F = 1.5, p = .2) did not differ among the three treatment groups (table 3). Daily and weekly supplementation had a greater effect on haemoglobin levels than
placebo.
The overall prevalence of anaemia at the start of the
study was 21.1%, and there were no significant differences among the treatment groups in the initial haeAdolescent schoolgirls
432
moglobin levels (table 4). The prevalence of anaemia
was reduced from 25% to 9.5% by weekly supplementation and from 18.5% to 8.6% by daily supplementation. In the placebo group the prevalence decreased from
19.8% to 13.4%.
The three treatment groups did not differ in initial
ferritin levels (F = 0.51, p = .6), but there were significant differences among the groups in final ferritin levels (F = 3.67, p = .03) and the change of ferritin levels
(F = 4.11, p = .02) after supplementation (table 5). Ferritin increased most in the daily treatment group, much
less in the weekly treatment group, and not at all in
the placebo group.
Discussion
All over the world, more than 1.6 billion people are
affected with anaemia. More than half of these cases
are preventable and treatable iron-deficiency anaemia
[1]. Iron-deficiency anaemia in adolescent girls is associated with poor pregnancy outcomes and contributes
to intrauterine growth retardation, low birthweight,
increased maternal and perinatal mortality, and low
iron stores of the infant at birth [13].
The average age at first marriage in Sri Lanka is 24.4
years [2]. One-third of the adolescents in Sri Lanka
suffer from anaemia [5]. When there is a high prevalence of anaemia in the population, supplementation
will be reduced to treat the most severely affected individuals. Therefore, the control of anaemia in adolescence is the need of the day [14].
Because the teachers gave the tablets to the girls, compliance was high. Side effects do not appear to have
played a major role in lack of compliance in taking iron
tablets. It should also be noted that drop-outs due to
side effects were higher among the daily group than
the weekly group. This finding is comparable to that
from a study in Indonesia [10].
At the start of the study, the overall prevalence of
anaemia was 21.1%. Supplementation with iron, folic
acid, and vitamin C for eight weeks caused a rise in
haemoglobin concentration and a fall in the prevalence
of anaemia in both the weekly and the daily supplementation groups. When the groups receiving daily and
weekly supplementation were compared, no difference
in treatment effect on haemoglobin concentrations was

found. In a subsample, daily administration of iron
produced a significantly greater increase in serum ferritin than weekly supplementation. These findings compare well with those of similar studies in other countries [9, 15, 16].
Besides the highly significant increase in haemoglobin
in the iron-supplemented groups, there was a small but
significant increase in haemoglobin in the placebo group.
However, there was no increase in ferritin level in the
placebo group; the mean ferritin concentration actually
decreased by an average of 2.8 µg/L. The rise in haemoglobin in the placebo group may have been the result of the deworming. A positive effect of deworming
on haemoglobin status was reported previously in a study
of pregnant women on a Sri Lankan plantation [17].
A significantly higher proportion of older adolescents were anaemic. Although the prevalence of anaemia was markedly reduced by supplementation for eight
weeks, 10.5% of all the girls remained anaemic. Whether
a more prolonged supplementation would further reduce the prevalence of anaemia needs to be investigated. It is possible that adding other nutrients, such
as vitamin A [10], would improve the results.
The unit cost of weekly supplementation, including
anthelmintic treatment, was 3.24 SLR (Sri Lankan rupees), equal to $US.05. This was one-quarter the cost
of daily iron supplementation.
The following conclusions can be drawn. In this population of mildly anaemic girls (all of whom were treated
for possible hookworm infection), there was only a small
response to iron supplementation. The effects of weekly
and daily supplementation were not distinguishable.
Weekly supplementation is an economically advantageous and simple intervention to improve the haemoglobin status of adolescent girls. Weekly supplementation generated fewer complaints of side effects, and
compliance was high. The greater rise in serum ferritin with daily administration of iron is of no practical
significance as long as the preventive supplementation
programme is continued. Experience from other studies
indicates that even iron stores, as indicated by serum
ferritin, reached similar levels with daily and weekly
iron supplementation [18]. Moreover, the initially
high ferritin levels with daily iron administration
may be disadvantageous [19]. Administration of iron
supplementation by teachers without close medical
supervision is a viable possibility. A weekly ironsupplementation programme aimed at controlling anaemia among adolescents should be encouraged. It is recommended that preventive iron supplementation be
provided through schools on a long-term basis.
