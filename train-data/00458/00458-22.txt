Supplementation in Adolescent Nepalese Girls

Objective: To compare the effectiveness of weekly vs daily iron and folic acid supplementation for control of anemia in adolescent Nepalese girls.
Design: Randomized controlled trial.
Setting: A Government Girl School in Dharan, Nepal, an urban foothill town that is 305 m above sea level.
Subjects: Consecutive healthy adolescent girls (n=209, median age 15 years) randomized to 3 groups matched for age, anthropometry, and personal and sociodemographic characteristics. Of 209 subjects, 181 completed the trial. Two girls had adverse reactions to treatment and were excluded.
Intervention: Group A (n=70) received a 350-mg fer-rous sulfate and 1.5-mg folic acid combination once daily for 90 to 100 days. Group B (n =67) received the tablet under supervision once a week for 14 weeks. Group C (n=72) did not receive any drugs.
Outcome Variable: Presupplementation and post-
supplementation differences in prevalence of anemia and change in hematocrit.
Results: Prevalence of anemia (defined as hematocrit <36%) declined from 68.6% and 70.1% in groups A and B to 20% and 13.4%, respectively, postsupplementation (P<.001), whereas the prevalence in group C changed little (68.1% to 65.3%, P=.81). There was a significant rise in the mean hematocrit of both supplemented groups (group A, 32.9%±3.5% to 41.0%±5.6%, P<.001; group B, 33.2%±3.6% to 40.4%±4.9%, P<.001) but no appre¬ciable change in controls (34.2% ± 2.9% to 34.1% ± 3.3%, P= .91). Net change in mean hematocrit in both the supple¬mentation groups was comparable (P= .57).
Conclusions: The prevalence of anemia in adolescent Nepalese girls is high. Supervised iron and folic acid therapy once a week is an effective alternative to daily administration and helps lower the prevalence of ane-mia in adolescent girls.

NEMIA IS the most preva¬lent nutritional problem worldwide, due mainly to iron deficiency. Its preva¬lence is highest among
young children and women of childbear-ing age, particularly pregnant women.' The exact figure for global prevalence of ane¬mia among adolescent girls is not known but is estimated to be quite high. The physiological growth spurt, with its atten¬dant rise in mean hemoglobin level, and menarche cause an increase in daily iron requirement, which, if not met, can rap¬idly result in anemia. Diagnosis and treat¬ment of anemia is of particular impor¬tance in adolescent girls because they enter the reproductive cycle soon after menar¬che. Even a marginal iron deficiency at this stage can precipitate severe anemia later on due to the stress imposed by preg¬nancy and parturition. Adolescent girls can be easily approached through school-based intervention programs.2
Based on study in rats, it has been sug¬gested that iron supplementation should not be given daily, but rather weekly or twice weekly.' With a daily dose, the in¬testinal mucosal cells get saturated quickly,

and iron absorption stops. Because the turnover rate of these cells is 5 to 6 days, a single weekly dose may be as effica-cious and more cost-effective. Compli-ance might also improve because fewer doses of iron would be needed. This hy-pothesis has been supported by studies comparing the effectiveness of hemoglo-bin or hematocrit response, which was found to be similar regardless of whether supplementation was daily, weekly, or twice weekly34-7 To the contrary, Cook and Reddy' concluded that there is no sig¬nificant absorptive advantage in giving iron less often than once daily. Hallberg9 reit¬erated that there is no evidence that weekly
