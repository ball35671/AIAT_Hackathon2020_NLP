ABSTRACT To assess the efficacy and acceptability of a daily and intermittent iron supplementation, a doubleblind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in a public school located in periurban Lima, Peru. Adolescent girls
(n 5 312), 12–18 y old, were randomly assigned to one of the following three groups: 1) 60 mg iron as ferrous sulfate
daily from Monday to Friday; 2) 60 mg iron as ferrous sulfate 2 d/wk and 3 d placebo (intermittent); 3) placebo, from
Monday to Friday. Field workers gave the girls supplements during school hours for 17 wk; 296 girls completed the
trial. Girls took 94% of the expected dose of 85 pills. Few side effects were reported. Postintervention, hemoglobin
(Hb), serum ferritin (SF) and free erythrocyte protoporphyrin (FEP) were improved significantly in the iron-supplemented groups compared with placebo (P , 0.05). Daily supplements led to higher Hb increases than intermittent
supplements (P , 0.05), but SF and FEP were similar between the two groups. Thus, both iron supplementation
schedules were efficacious in preventing iron deficiency in adolescent girls through the school system, and the
daily schedule was better than the intermittent schedule at increasing Hb values and reducing anemia. J. Nutr.

KEY WORDS: ● iron deficiency anemia ● iron supplementation ● adolescents
Iron deficiency anemia (IDA)5 is considered the most prevalent nutritional deficiency in the world (ACC/SCN 1992),
and small children and women of reproductive age are most
affected (WHO 1992). Global estimates suggest that 47% of
nonpregnant women and 60% of pregnant women are anemic
(Royston 1982). A recent survey in Peru found that 57% of
children ,5 y of age and 36% of women were anemic (INEI
1997). IDA reduces physical activity and affects behavior,
psychomotor development and school performance (Lozoff et
al. 1991, Soemantri et al. 1985, Soewondo et al. 1989). In
pregnancy, IDA is associated with increased risk of preterm
delivery, low birth weight and higher maternal mortality
(Murphy et al. 1986, Scholl et al. 1992, Viteri 1994).
Iron supplementation is one of the recommended strategies
to improve iron status in the vulnerable groups. In many
countries such as Peru, iron supplements are given to pregnant
women who receive checkups at the health centers. However,
iron deficiency anemia remains high, affecting 54% of Peruvian pregnant women (Zavaleta et al. 1993). Additional strategies to prevent and treat anemia must be considered to reduce
the high prevalence of IDA in women before they become
pregnant. One important option, as yet untested, is to give
iron supplementation to adolescent girls who are attending
school.
The effectiveness of daily iron supplementation programs
has been questioned because of the low efficiency of health
services and the lack of compliance of the target groups
(Schultink et al. 1995). The use of intermittent supplementation schedules has been suggested as a way in which to
improve compliance by reducing side effects. Several studies
conducted in anemic preschool and school-aged children have
shown that the efficacy of an intermittent iron supplementation schedule is similar to that of daily dosing (Schultink et al.
1995). This study aimed to assess the feasibility, efficacy and
acceptability of reducing anemia in adolescent girls attending
public school in Lima, Peru using daily or intermittent iron
supplementation.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
The study was conducted from August to December 1996 in a
public secondary school in Villa El Salvador, a periurban shantytown
in Lima, Peru. Subjects were adolescent girls, 12–18 y old, who met
the following criteria: living in the community for at least 6 mo before

the study, healthy, nuliparous, menstruating regularly in the last 3
mo, had not taken any multivitamin-mineral supplement in the last
6 mo and a hemoglobin (Hb) . 80 g/L. Adolescent girls and their
parents or guardians signed the informed consent form. The Ethical
Committee of the IIN approved the protocol.
This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled study with 312 subjects assigned at random to one of the following groups: 1) 60 mg iron
as ferrous sulfate, daily from Monday to Friday; 2) 60 mg iron as
ferrous sulfate/d, two times per week (intermittent) and 3 d placebo;
and 3) placebo, daily from Monday to Friday. The supplements were
given for 17 wk. All tablets had the same brick color and shape and
were produced for this study by a local pharmaceutical company
(Instituto Quimioterapico S.A Lima, Peru) and distributed in coded
blister packages. Supplements were administered daily at school,
between meals, together with a sweetened flavored drink without
ascorbic acid and under the close supervision of a field worker who
also recorded acceptability and side effects. To ensure participation,
girls received counseling on the benefits of taking iron tablets and
about the possibility of side effects.
At entry, general socioeconomic information, weight, height and
midupper-arm circumference were recorded. At the beginning and
end of the trial, a blood sample was obtained by venipuncture for
analysis of Hb, serum ferritin (SF) and free erythrocyte protoporphyrin (FEP). Hb was analyzed by the cyanometahemoglobin method, SF
by ELISA using human antiferritin and antiferritin peroxidase antibodies from DAKO, and FEP by a hematofluoremeter. The cut-offs
were defined as follows: for anemia, Hb , 120 g/L; for iron deficiency,
SF , 12 mg/L; and for FEP, . 80 mg/L. At the beginning and end of
the study, a digital scale (SECA, UK) measured weight to the nearest
0.1 kg and a portable wooden stadiometer measured height to the
nearest 0.1 cm.
A total of 312 girls started the trial and 16 dropped out the study.
Of these 16, eight girls moved to another school, two girls disliked the
tablets, four girls claimed that side effects (constipation, gastric discomfort, headache) were the reason for withdrawal and two girls were
absent at the time of final evaluation, although they took the tablets.
Girls who withdrew and girls who concluded the study had the same
age, weight and Hb.
Data analysis was done using the SPSS/PC Statistical Program
V.7.5 (SPSS, Chicago, IL). Data analysis included descriptive statistics, paired t test, chi-square test, nonparametric tests and analysis of
covariance with initial Hb as a covariate. Hb values were normally
distributed; SF and FEP were not normally distributed and were
normalized by using a natural logarithm transformation.
RESULTS
Adolescent girls participating in the three supplement
groups were similar in weight, height, body mass index (BMI)
and iron indicators. They were also similar in indicators of
socioeconomic status, such as parents’ education, housing materials and home services. Girls took 94% of the expected dose
of 85 pills, and the median consumption was 80 tablets in the
three groups. Few girls in the three groups reported side effects
(e.g., gastrointestinal problems or headache) during the intervention, and there was no significant difference in the frequency of side effects reported by any group.
Changes of iron status in the subjects are presented in
Table 1. Final Hb values in both iron-supplemented groups
(daily and intermittent) were significantly higher than those
in the placebo group (P , 0.05), and the daily supplementation group had significantly higher Hb than the intermittent
group (P , 0.05). There were no differences in SF and FEP
between daily and intermittent groups at the end of the study.
SF did not change in the two iron-supplemented groups, but
decreased significantly in the placebo group (P , 0.05). FEP
decreased in the daily and intermittent groups (P , 0.05) but
remained the same in the placebo group. The proportion of
anemic subjects was similar in the three groups at entry into
the trial, i.e., 19.8% in the daily, 18.4% in the intermittent
and 15.5% in the placebo group. At the end of the trial the
proportion of anemic subjects in the daily group (10.9%) was
lower compared with the intermittent (17.3%) and the placebo (22.7%) groups (P , 0.05.).
Results were more pronounced among the anemic subjects
than in the entire group. At postintervention, the final Hb
concentrations were higher in the iron-supplemented groups
than in the placebo group (P , 0.05) (Fig. 1). The response
in Hb concentration was correlated with initial Hb values and
did not change in the placebo group (P , 0.05). For the
anemic subjects in all groups, the gains in Hb were 11.1 g/L
(daily), 6.8 g/L (intermittent) and 1.6 g/L (placebo). Hb
concentrations among the nonanemic subjects did not change
during the time of supplementation in the daily group. However, Hb concentrations declined in the placebo and the
intermittent groups (P , 0.05) in nonanemic girls.
DISCUSSION
Iron supplementation given at school improved iron indicators in adolescent girls. The response in subjects receiving
daily iron was most efficacious at increasing Hb concentration
and reducing the proportion of anemic subjects.
These results are different from the findings in other studies
comparing intermittent and daily doses of iron in Indonesian
preschool children (Schultink et al. 1995). In animal experiments, a similar effect on Hb for daily and intermittent doses
has been observed, and it has been argued that the intermittent dose allows time for the turnover of the intestinal cells
that have better absorptive capacity than cells that have
recently absorbed iron (Viteri 1996). However, similar levels
of absorption between the daily and weekly doses have been
reported in humans (Cook and Reddy 1995). The better Hb
response and a significant reduction in anemia prevalence
observed in girls taking iron supplements daily in this study are
explained by the greater amount of iron delivered. The intermittent dose was effective in improving the iron status of this
population, although not as effective as the daily dose.
Acceptability of the iron supplements in this study was
excellent because girls received information before and during
the trial about benefits of taking iron, the possibility of side
effects and that side effects or taking iron did not cause adverse

health effects. Side effects were not a serious problem in any of
the groups whether supplemented or not with iron, and the
dose of iron (from no iron to 60 mg/d) had no significant
effect. As a result, compliance was high.
In conclusion, iron supplementation given through the
school system could be an intervention to improve iron status
and prevent anemia in adolescent girls. It might also reduce
the risk of iron deficiency and anemia before pregnancy, particularly among girls who marry and begin childbearing shortly
after they finish school. Daily supplementation is more effective than intermittent supplementation in increasing Hb concentrations; however, the intermittent supplementation dose
was also effective and could be used if given over a longer
period than in this study. Targeting anemic girls might also be
considered because the increase in Hb was highest in anemic
girls, although this must be weighed against the cost and
acceptability of screening girls.
