Summary We evaluated the effect of weekly doses of 400 mg of ferrous sulphate for 4 months on the iron status of
adolescent girls in a controlled trial in Tanga, Tanzania. Supplementation led to a significantly greater
increase in serum ferritin compared with the control group ( 15.6 g/l vs. 8.6 g/l) (P  0.002) but there
was no significant difference in change in haemoglobin. Children given iron showed a significantly greater
weight gain than controls ( 2.4 kg vs.  1.4 kg) (P  0.03). Weekly iron supplementation may be an effective means of increasing iron stores and growth in children vulnerable to iron deficiency.

Introduction
In recent years, a number of studies have suggested that
weekly iron supplementation is as effective as daily supplementation in raising haemoglobin levels (Gross et al. 1994;
Liu et al. 1995; Schultink et al. 1995; Ridwan et al. 1996;
Angeles-Agdeppa et al. 1997; Berger et al. 1997; Palupi et al.
1997; Viteri et al. 1999). Although they have been subject to
criticism (Hallberg 1998), the studies found that groups
receiving intermittent iron supplementation achieved significant benefits equal to that of groups supplemented daily irrespective of age or culture (Beard 1998). In the past, many
daily supplementation programmes in developing countries
have been unsuccessful due to lack of supplies and compliance (Galloway & McGuire 1996) and as well as requiring
fewer iron tablets, several studies found that weekly supplementation led to a reduction in these problems.
The majority of studies published so far have been conducted in Asia, with one (Berger et al. 1997) in South
America. Due to the results of the studies, there is a growing
momentum in several developing countries for a change in
policy from daily to weekly or intermittent dosing (Galloway
& McGuire 1996). However, there is little information on the
impact of weekly iron supplementation in Africa where determinants of anaemia often differ markedly from those in Asia.
This paper reports a study of weekly iron supplementation
amongst adolescent girls living in the Tanga region of
Tanzania.
Adolescent girls are an important target group for supplementation since their iron requirements are high (Brabin
& Brabin 1992). Many are on the verge of becoming mothers
for the first time and can readily be supplemented through
school-based delivery programmes (Partnership for Child
Development 1998), a measure which, if successful, could
make the new technology even more cost-effective.
Materials and methods
Study area and population
This study was undertaken by Ushirikiano wa Kumwendeleza
Mtoto Tanzania (UKUMTA) (Tanzania Partnership for Child
Development), a partnership of government agencies, scientific institutions and donor agencies which aims to improve
the health of school-aged children in Tanzania and which is
part of an international research consortium (PCD 1998).

N. M. R. Beasley et al. Iron supplementation in Tanzanian girls
UKUMTA’s work began in Tanga Region and the study was
conducted in a rural area of Muheza District in the villages of
Misongeni, Ubembe and Kilometa Saba. Any child aged
between 12 and 18 years and living in the villages was eligible
to participate in the study, irrespective of school attendance.
The study commenced in April 1996 and follow-up occurred
in August 1996.
Inclusion criteria, study design and randomization
The criteria for inclusion into the study were completion of
all baseline measurements and a haemoglobin concentration
 70 g/l. Children with severe anaemia were referred for
treatment. Children included were randomly assigned to two
groups matched for intensity of infection with hookworm
and S. haematobium. Both were treated for infection with
geohelminths and S. haematobium as part of a school-based
mass treatment programme run within the region by
UKUMTA. Treatment took the form of a single dose of
albendazole (400 mg) and praziquantel (40 mg/kg body
weight). During the 16 weeks following anthelminthic treatment, one group was given 12 doses of ferrous sulphate
(2  200 mg per dose) (Weiders Ltd, Norway) whilst the second group was given 12 doses of a control treatment
(2  50 g cyanocobalamin (vitamin B12)) (Gold Shield
Healthcare Ltd, Croydon, UK). The use of a strict placebo
was not allowed by local and national ethical bodies. Whilst
vitamin B12 deficiency can be considered as a contributory
factor to anaemia, macrocytosis was observed in only 8% of
blood films taken at baseline. Given this low prevalence, it
was considered appropriate to use cyanacobalamin as a
locally acceptable control. Girls were given treatments at
intervals of at least 1 week. It was not possible to give children a weekly dose for the whole 16-week period since many
were absent during the month-long school break in June. The
design was single blind only, in which measurement staff did
not know the treatment group.
Community and institutional approval
The study was approved by the Tanzania Commission for
Science and Technology, the Tanzania Food and Nutrition
Centre, Dar es Salaam and local officials of the Ministries of
Health and Education in Tanga. After obtaining their agreement, meetings were held in all villages before the start of the
trial to explain both its aims and procedures, and to gain
community consent. The entry of children into the study was
achieved after full explanation to parents and children. It was
clearly explained to the children that they could decline to
enter the study or remove themselves from the study without
prejudice to their treatment.
Baseline measurements
Stool, urine and blood samples were collected from each
child. Stool samples were examined microscopically once for
the eggs of species of intestinal worms using the rapid KatoKatz technique and the concentration of eggs was expressed
as eggs/g of faeces. A 10-ml aliquot of urine was filtered
through 12 mm diameter polycarbonate membranes with a
12-m pore size (Costar, UK) held in pop-top membrane
holders (Millipore Ltd). The presence of eggs of
S. haematobium was noted and the concentration expressed
as eggs/10 ml of urine. Venous blood was collected using a
closed collection system (Vacutainer Ltd) and the haemoglobin concentration estimated using a photometer
(Hemocue Ltd); 1-ml aliquots of blood were centrifuged and
serum collected (Becton Dickinson Microtainer, MSE
Microcentaur from Fisons). Ferritin, C-reactive protein and
1-glycoprotein concentrations were determined by ELISA
at the Tanzania Food and Nutrition Centre. Ferritin and
CRP were measured by sandwich ELISAs using capture and
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies to ferritin
and CRP (Dako, Cambridge, UK). Ferritin standards were
manufactured by Dako and CRP standards by Behring
Diagnostics (Milton Keynes, UK). The method used to
measure 1-glycoprotein has been described previously
(Filteau et al. 1994). Thick and thin blood films were prepared and stained using Giemsa stain and then examined
for the presence of Plasmodium spp. The concentration of
infected red blood corpuscles was expressed as parasites
per 200 white blood cells. Height and weight were measured
to the nearest 0.1 cm and 0.1 kg, respectively, using a stadiometer (‘Leicester’ Model, Children’s Growth Foundation)
and electronic scales (Soehnle). Z-scores of height for age
and weight for age were calculated using NCHS reference
standards and EpiInfo version 6.0 software. A socioeconomic
score was developed by scoring children for reported family
possession (1) or lack (0) of the following items: house construction composing concrete walls, concrete floors and tin
roofs, latrine, bicycle, and radio. In addition children were
also scored for presence or absence of shoes at interview. A
socio-economic score was formed by summing the scores
(maximum 7, minimum 0).
Follow-up
Fourteen to 15 weeks after the start of treatments, children
were asked to provide stool and urine samples again for parasitological examination and 16 weeks after treatment were
weighed, measured for height and asked to give a venous
blood sample to estimate concentration of haemoglobin and
to estimate the intensity of infection with Plasmodium spp.
Children then received antihelminthic treatment as necessary

and all children with a haemoglobin level  120 g/l were
given 28 tablets of 200 mg ferrous sulphate.
Data entry and statistical methods
Double data entry was done using FoxPro (Microsoft, USA)
and analysed using SPSS software. Because most variables
were not normally distributed, 	2 tests were used to compare
prevalence and Kruskal–Wallis tests to compare differences
between continuous variables. Correlations were calculated
using Spearman rank correlation. Tables show arithmetic
means of variables with standard deviations.
Results
In total, 261 girls volunteered to participate in the baseline
survey and of these 235 completed all baseline measurements.
A total of 234 girls met the inclusion criteria and were
recruited to the study. Of the girls included in the study, 119
(51% of those recruited) received 12 doses of iron or control
treatment and completed all follow-up measures. The remaining 115 (49% of those recruited) either dropped out of the
study or due to absences failed to receive all 12 doses of treatment. Girls who completed the study did not differ from
those who dropped out with respect to any of the variables
measured at baseline. Data for serum ferritin and acute phase
protein concentrations were available for 107 of the girls who
completed the study. Girls for whom these data was available
did not differ from others with respect to any of the variables
measured.
The mean age of both treatment groups was 13.8 years
(SD  1.5 years) and did not differ significantly (P  0.93).
Helminth infections were common (hookworm 81%, T.
trichiura 57%, A. lumbricoides 22%, S. haematobium 56%).
No significant differences existed at baseline between groups
in terms of estimated prevalence or intensity of infection.
Nor did the groups differ significantly on decline of these
variables following de-worming. The two groups did not differ with respect to socio-economic status, having similar
mean scores (treatment score  3.05, control score  3.19
P  0.89).
A highly significant difference was observed with respect to
change in serum ferritin concentration, that of the treatment
group increasing more than that of the control treatment
(Table 1). Although it is clear that ferritin concentrations correlated positively with acute phase protein concentrations
(Spearman Rank correlations: C-reactive protein r  0.39
n  107 P  0.00001; 1-glycoprotein r  0.26 n  107
P  0.007), the effect of supplementation on ferritin concentrations was observed whether children with inflammation
(indicated by C-reactive protein   5 mg/l and/or 1-glycoprotein 
 0.7 g/l) were excluded from analysis or not. Mean
haemoglobin concentrations did not differ between the treatment groups at either baseline or follow-up and there was no
difference in change in haemoglobin during the study
(Table 2).
Girls given iron were found to put on more weight during
the study than girls given control treatments (Table 3). There
was no difference between groups at either baseline or followup with respect to anthropometric indices or height.
Treatment groups did not differ with respect to prevalence
of infection with P. falciparum during the study (Table 4). At
baseline, treatment groups showed a trend towards difference
with respect to parasitaemia (P  0.06). Change in parasitaemia differed significantly between groups during the
study (P  0.01). Acute phase protein concentrations did not
differ between groups during the study (Table 5).
Discussion
Serum ferritin levels of girls given weekly iron increased significantly more ( 50%) than those of girls given control
treatments ( 18%). This suggests that weekly iron supplementation may be a highly effective means of raising iron
stores in a community vulnerable to the development of iron
deficiency. Similar results have recently been described among

Malaysian schoolgirls (Tee et al. 1999). Raising iron stores
may be of benefit for a number of reasons. Most girls included in our study were of the age when first pregnancies
occur in Tanzania and raising stores could both protect them
from iron deficiency during pregnancy and have a beneficial
effect on fetal development. Iron deficiency has also been
associated with low cognitive function and educational
achievement, reduced physical fitness and immunity to infection (reviewed by Nokes et al. 1998). Raising iron stores could
reduce the incidence of such problems.
While an increase was observed in the mean haemoglobin
concentrations of both treatment groups, no difference was
observed between treatment and control. This is in marked
contrast to several other studies of weekly supplementation
(Angeles-Agdeppa et al. 1997; Berger et al. 1997; Palupi et al.
1997). Our results highlight the need to include a control
group in order to draw valid conclusions. Lack of control has
made difficult the interpretation of several studies which have
observed an increase in haemoglobin on weekly iron supplementation (Hallberg 1998).
Since at baseline 73% of our girls were not anaemic
(Hb  110 g/l), the lack of an effect of supplementation on
haemoglobin is unsurprising. Similarly, haemoglobin levels of
non-anaemic Malaysian schoolgirls were also unaffected by
weekly iron-folate supplementation (Tee et al. 1999). Our
results suggest that the provision of weekly supplementary
iron did not increase haemoglobin levels in our population.
This could be attributed to coexisting micronutrient deficiencies or problems with metabolism of iron due to chronic
infections such as malaria which is holo-endemic in the study
area (Lyimo et al. 1991). In a placebo-controlled trial in the
Gambia, another area of holo-endemic malaria, Bates et al.
(1987) found no haematological effect of giving a twice
weekly multinutrient drink containing iron (100–200 mg),
thiamine, riboflavin and vitamin C to 5–14-year-old children
during a period of 3 months. In our study, the failure of supplementation to affect haemoglobin levels might also be
attributed to the fact that the end of the intervention period
occurred at a time of high dietary iron availability, coinciding
both with the main harvest, when food is plentiful, and also
with the orange harvest.
In our study, supplementation led to a significant increase
in weight gain. Previous studies have shown that daily supplementation with iron is associated with increased growth
(Chwang et al. 1988; Latham et al. 1990) and improved
appetite (Lawless et al. 1994). In our study, it is likely that
follow-up occurred too early to detect any potential gains in
height.
A potential concern of giving iron is the possibility that
supplementation may increase the risk of infection with
malaria (Oppenheimer et al. 1986; Smith et al. 1989). Other
studies (Bates et al. 1987; Harvey et al. 1989) have not demonstrated such an effect. In our study, a significant difference
was observed with respect to change in parasitaemia
(Table 4). However, since the groups were quite dissimilar at
baseline (P  0.06), it is not possible to determine whether
weekly supplementation had any significant effect on parasitaemia. Levels of acute phase proteins did not differ
between groups during the study suggesting that supplementation did not lead to any increase in inflammation. Data
were not available to determine if supplementation had any
clinical impact.
The results of this study imply that weekly iron supplementation could provide a highly effective means of raising the iron stores of adolescent girls. By protecting them
from the cognitive effects of iron deficiency, weekly iron supplementation could help girls to get the most out of school.
As well as being members of a population vulnerable to iron
deficiency, the schoolgirls included in the study were of an age
when pregnancies would be expected to begin to arise

(Partnership for Child Development 1998). Supplementation
could also help both girls and their babies achieve improved
health. The study has shown for the first time that weekly
iron supplementation can have an effect on growth. These
benefits, attributable to iron supplementation, occurred at
the same time as girls were treated for helminth infections
through the activities of the Tanzanian Partnership for Child
Development. It suggests that weekly iron supplementation
could produce effects over and above those already attributed
to school based mass de-worming programmes (Beasley et al.
1999).
