Abstract Iron supplementation has been suggested as a strategy for prevention and
treatment of iron deficiency (ID) and iron deficiency anemia (IDA) in many countries, but
non-compliance of daily regimens and common dosage remain as major challenges. The
aim of this study was to investigate the effects of low dose once weekly iron
supplementation in adolescent girls. The study was designed as a community-based,
randomized, supplementation trial. The initial sample consisted of 200 female high school
students, aged 14–16 years old, of whom 193 students concluded the study. They were
randomly selected and assigned into either iron-supplemented group (ISG) or ironunsupplemented group (IUG). The ISG received 150 mg ferrous sulfate once weekly for
16 weeks, whereas the IUG received nothing. Weight, height, and hematological parameters
were measured and compared between the two groups before and after the intervention.
There was no significant difference between the initial measures of the two groups before
the intervention. After 16 weeks of intervention, mean of hemoglobin and serum ferritin
improved significantly in ISG compared to IUG. At the beginning of the study, percent of
anemia, IDA, and ID in ISG were 12.5%, 8.3%, and 30.2%, whereas these figures for IUG
in this period of study were 14.4, 10.3, and 38.2, respectively, which were not significantly
different between the two groups. However, percentages of the above items at the end of
study in ISG were 2.1%, 0%, and 21.9%, respectively. In contrast to IUG, all cases of IDA

ferrous sulfate for 16 weeks significantly improved iron status in female adolescents and
effectively treated IDA. There is no need for higher dosage of iron for supplementation that
may cause adverse effects and bear higher costs.

Introduction
Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is actually the most common nutritional anemia worldwide and
still a public health problem in developing countries. It is generally assumed that more than
50% of the cases of anemia are due to iron deficiency (ID) [1–3]. There are many possible
causes of IDA. This condition can mainly arise from inadequate iron intake or absorption.
Other causes include increased iron requirement for growth of blood volume (e.g., during
infancy, adolescence, pregnancy, or lactation), increased excretion (e.g., in excessive
menstrual blood or hemorrhage from injury), or chronic blood loss (e.g., due to bleeding
ulcer, bleeding hemorrhoids, parasites, or malignant disease) [4]. Also, defective release of
iron from its stores in the body and defective iron use due to a chronic inflammation or
other chronic disorders are known as contributing factors to IDA. So, infants, preschool
children, adolescents, women of childbearing age, and particularly pregnant women are at a
greatest risk of developing this kind of anemia [2, 5].
Many consequences have been reported for ID and especially IDA. They include
impaired motor development and coordination, impaired language development and
scholastic achievement, psychological and behavioral effects (inattention, fatigue, insecurity, etc.), and decreased physical activity in infants and children. IDA consequences in
pregnant women are increased maternal morbidity and mortality, increased fetal morbidity
and mortality, and increased risk of low birth weight [4, 6, 7]. Globally, ID ranks number 9
among 26 risk factors which are indicated in the global burden of disease 2000. Also, in
2002, IDA was considered to be among the most important contributing factors to the
global burden of disease [8, 9]. IDA is a major public health problem in Iran, especially
among pregnant women and adolescent girls. Some studies in various areas of Iran reported
the prevalence of ID in 14- to 20-year-old girls as 27–39% and showed that 10–15% of
Iranian girls are suffering from IDA [10–12].
Several strategies have been suggested for preventing IDA, including dietary
modification, fortification of staple food with iron, infection control, and iron supplementation [13]. However, each recommended strategy must be adapted with the patient
variables like culture, socio-economic situation, attitude, behavior, and dietary pattern. In
some situations, iron supplementation is the best approach as it can specifically target highrisk group, be safe and flexible, and get implemented quite rapidly [5, 14, 15]. Variations in
deployment of iron supplementation in terms of duration, dose, type and form of prescribed
product, and frequency of administration have resulted to different findings. Route and
frequency of administration with along the dosage of iron play an important role in gaining
the patient’s compliance and achieving the desired level of clinical effectiveness [16].
Despite numerous studies conducted so far, there is no consensus on the best duration
and dosage of iron supplementation. Regarding the important role of these two factors on
the overall effectiveness and compliance of this approach, conducting some complementary
studies are needed. In some studies, administration of ferrous sulfate as low as 200 mg once
Once Weekly Low-dose Iron Supplementation 23
weekly for 2 months has been reported to be more effective than daily plan [17, 18]. With
the aim of finding the effectiveness of even lower dosage, this study was designed to
investigate the effects of supplementing 30 mg elemental iron as 150 mg ferrous sulfate
once weekly for a 16-week period on iron status of 14–16-year-old female high school
students in Yazd, Iran. This study can be distinguished from the similar ones by using lowdose iron once weekly for supplementation.
Materials and Methods
Study Design and Location The study was designed as a community-based randomized,
supplementation trial. The study protocol was approved by the Research Council and Ethics
Committee at Shahid Sadoughi University of Medical Sciences in Yazd. The study was
carried out in some girls’ high schools of Yazd city in central Iran between October 2007
and November 2008.
Subjects and Procedures Eight girls’ high schools were randomly selected and assigned to
either iron-supplemented group (ISG) or iron-unsupplemented group (IUG). The first
graders in each high school were called and invited to participate from the alphabetically
sorted registration list to accumulate 25 students in each high school. The total number of
students was 100 in each group at the beginning of the study when participants were 14 to
16 years old (ISG mean age ± SD: 15.17±0.76, IUG: 15.21±0.64). The subjects were
followed up for 16 weeks. ISG students received weekly one 150-mg coated-tablet of
ferrous sulfate on the first working day of each week for 16 weeks, whereas IUG received
no supplementation throughout the study. The tablets were products of Shahre Daru
pharmaceutical company (Shahre Daru Laboratories Co. Ltd. Tehran, Iran) and were
distributed by the school health officer among the participants each week under supervision
of the schoolmaster. The students in ISG were told to consume the prescribed tablet with a
cup of water at the break between their two classes in the morning.
Measurements Weight and height of the girls were taken at the beginning of the trial
(baseline) by a health worker using a Detecto mechanical medical scale (Detecto scales
INC, Brooklyn, NY, USA) which was regularly calibrated and controlled against standard
weights. Girls were allowed to have their high school uniform on. The standing height of
girls was measured by the height-measuring rod of the scale. Weight was measured to the
nearest 0.25 kg and height to the nearest 1.0 cm. The body mass index (BMI) was
calculated as weight in kilograms (kg) divided by the square of height in meters (m2
) and
was rounded to the nearest tenth.
Students who had hepatic or neural diseases or received or donated blood within the
previous 2 weeks were excluded because of potential effects on their iron status indicators.
About 5 ml of fasting venous blood was taken from each subject, 2 ml for cell blood count
(CBC), and the remainder for serum tests. The sample tubes were sealed with parafilm, kept
at 4–5°C, and sent to the Yazd Central Laboratory to be analyzed for CBC, hemoglobin
(Hb), hematocrit (Hct), mean corpuscular value (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin
(MCH), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), and serum ferritin. CBC
test was run on the same day with a Sysmex KX21N (Sysmex Corporation, Kobe, Japan)
blood analyzer, and serum ferritin was assayed by enhanced chemiluminescence
immunoassay method. In this study, ID is defined as serum ferritin below 12 μg/L, anemia
as Hb value below 12 g/dl, and IDA as coincidence of ID and anemia [11]. The cutoff point
24 Mozaffari-Khosravi et al.
of Hct, MCV, MCH, and MCHC were considered 35%, 80 fl, 27 pg, and 32 g/L,
respectively.
At the end of the trial, to assess the compliance and side effects of the intervention, the
supplemented students were asked about consuming and any possible adverse reactions.
Statistical Analysis Results are given as mean ± SD and frequency distribution tables. The
Kolmogorov–Smirnov test was used for checking the normal distribution of quantitative
variables. For comparing the mean of the normally distributed indices between the two
groups, we used Student’s t test; and for other indices, Mann–Whitney U test was used.
Fisher’s exact and McNemar tests were used for comparing categorical variables. The P
value ≤0.05 was considered as significant. All P values were two-tailed. Statistical Package
for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 11 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used for data
analysis.
Ethical Considerations An informed consent was obtained from each participant at the
beginning of the trial. They could quit the study freely, whenever desired. The research
Ethics Committee of Shahid Sadoughi University of Medical Sciences approved the study
protocol.
Results
A total of 200 high school girls were recruited in the two study groups of this trial, of whom
193 concluded the study. Four girls from ISG and three girls from IUG stepped out on
grounds of travel, illness, or some personal reasons (Fig. 1).

The mean of quantitative variables of the study including age, weight, height, BMI, and
hematological parameters before starting the intervention are shown in Table 1. No
significant difference was noticed between the baseline measures of the groups.
The hematological parameters at the end of intervention are shown in Table 2. According
to these data, except for white blood cells (WBC), MCV, MCH, and MCHC, the mean of
other variables were significantly different between the two groups, as mean of Hb in ISG
and IUG were 14.56±1.20 and 13.32±1.25 g/dl, respectively, that showed a significant
difference (P value <0.001). Similarly, mean of serum ferritin got significantly different
(P value=0.008) in ISG and IUG (35.59±32.87 and 23.73±16.60 μ/L, respectively).
Table 3 shows the percentage of anemia, IDA, ID, and other hematologic indices
according to standard cutoff points at the beginning and end of the study among the two
groups. At the beginning of study, percent of anemia, IDA, and ID in ISG were 12.5%,
8.3%, and 30.2%, whereas these figures for IUG were 14.4, 10.3, and 38.2, respectively,
which were not significantly different between the two groups. However, percentages of
these measures in ISG at the end of the study were 2.1%, 0%, and 21.9%, respectively.
Table 4 shows the frequency distribution of hematological indices before and after the
intervention in the two groups. According to these data, the frequency of all measures
except for serum ferritin significantly changed after the intervention in ISG, whereas in
IUG, only MCV and MCH showed significant changes after 16 weeks of intervention. The
subjects in ISG reported no remarkable adverse effects.
Discussion
Our findings showed significant improvement in iron status after 16 weeks of intervention
in ISG. Percentage of anemia in this group reduced from 12.5% at baseline to 2.1% at the
end of intervention. Also, IDA reduced from 8.3% to nil (0%) during this period, and ID
rate decreased from 30.2% to 21.9%.
It has been well demonstrated that preventing ID and its consecutive anemia is not
possible without iron supplementation, especially in people at higher risk like pregnant

women. For getting the best compliance by the subjects and maintaining its efficacy,
various approaches have been proposed and evaluated. Route and frequency (daily, once
weekly, and twice weekly) of administration, product form and dosage, content of
elemental iron, and also logistics and distribution network are the most important
determinants in overall effectiveness of such supplementation [19].

Once Weekly Low-dose Iron Supplementation 27
Many studies have suggested daily administration of iron supplement as an effective
method [20–25], but due to lower coverage, insufficient logistics, and low compliance of
consumers which are reported by some other studies [5, 26–29], weekly regimens have
been reported to be more effective with higher compliance since the mid 1990s [16, 18, 20].
In a similar study to ours, Engstrom et al. recruited three groups of 6–12-year-old
children for 24 weeks. The first group received 12.5 mg elemental iron as ferrous sulfate on
a daily basis, the second group 25 mg weekly, and the third group got no supplementation
to serve as control group. Daily supplementation was reported to be more effective than
weekly plan. No significant difference was seen in hemoglobin concentration between the
weekly group and the control group. In the current study, despite shorter period of
intervention, mean of hemoglobin, ferritin, and rate of anemia were significantly different
between the supplemented and unsupplemented groups [30].
In two other studies, administration of 200 mg ferrous sulfate once weekly for 2 months
in children of 5–10 years old has been reported to be more effective than daily plan [17,
18]. In contrast, we supplemented iron with lower dosage but longer duration.
In a study by Sungthong et al., effects of daily and weekly supplementation on anemia
status and intelligence quotient were compared [31]. They administered 60 mg elemental
iron (twofold more than our dosage) weekly, for 16 weeks (similar to our study). They
showed that mean of hemoglobin concentration in both daily and weekly groups increased
significantly. Ferritin and hemoglobin concentrations in the weekly group were significantly
higher than those of the control group. Their findings support our results, although the
dosage of supplemented iron in current study is around half of theirs.
Siddiqui et al. compared daily against weekly supplementation of 200 mg ferrous sulfate
for 2 months in 5- to 10-year-old children suffering from ID. Both methods improved
hematological parameters including hemoglobin, ferritin, and serum iron, though the
weekly method was reported as more cost effective [17]. In another trial by Jovan et al.,
pregnant women were supplemented with 120 mg ferrous sulfate for 14 weeks, either once
or twice weekly. They reported no significant difference between the two groups [32].

Another study on administering 60 mg elemental iron once weekly for 12 weeks did not
reveal meaningful effects on blood parameters [33].
It is obvious that for comparing results of various studies on iron supplementation, some
variables like duration, dosage, study population, route of administration, and product form
should be taken into account. By comparing the results of current study with similar ones,
response of ID anemic patients to supplementation was outstanding, so that at the end of the
study, all the subjects with this problem recovered. This extraordinary result can be justified
by close supervision of health workers and schoolmasters on supplementation program in
the target schools. The role of supervision on the supplementation efficacy has been
highlighted by some studies [28]. In addition, no remarkable side effect due to iron
consumption was reported by the subjects. The good organization and supervision of the
trial with lack of side effects yielded a compliance rate of 96% that can justify the desirable
achieved results.
One of the limitations of this study was lack of diet record and assessment of diet changes
during the trial, which may have had effects on the results to some extent. Meanwhile, lack of
placebo utilization in unsupplemented group can be regarded as another limitation.
In this study, supplementation of 30 mg elemental iron once per week is shown to be
effective. Further studies for determining minimum effective dose are needed. As a
conclusion, weekly supplementation of 150 mg ferrous sulfate for 16 weeks in female
adolescents effectively prevented ID and IDA, so there is no need for higher dosage that
may cause adverse effects and additional costs.
