Summary Background Recent data
suggest that daily iron supplementation of iron-replete children could
impair their growth. If verified for
weekly iron supplementation these
results would markedly complicate
targeting and implementing schoolbased weekly iron supplementation
programs. Aim of the study To ascertain the effect of weekly iron supplementation on the growth and hemoglobin status of non-anemic schoolage children. Subjects and methods
73 Bolivian non-anemic school-age
children randomly assigned to the
treatment group (n=37; receiving
supplements containing FeSO4 during 18 weeks) or the control group
(n=36; receiving a placebo during the
same period). Hemoglobin concentration and anthropometric measures
were determined for each child at the
beginning (T0) and the end (T18) of
the study. Results The treatment
group did not show any significant
variation in hemoglobin concentration between T0 and T18 (–1.6±10.4
g/L; P=0.40) whereas the control
group showed a significant decrease
in hemoglobin concentration
(–4.6±10.9 g/L; P=0.03). Anthropometric changes were not significantly
different between the treatment and
the control groups for weight,
(1.63±1.11 kg vs 1.88±0.79 kg;
P=0.30), height (2.35±0.94 cm vs
2.11±1.03 cm; P=0.34) or mid-upper
arm circumference (0.29±0.57 cm vs
0.22±0.54 cm; P=0.64). Conclusion
In our study, weekly iron supplementation of non-anemic school-age children had no negative effect on their
growth while having a positive effect
in preventing significant decreases in
hemoglobin concentration. These results suggest that in regions where
iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is
prevalent, a simple and cost-effective
way to control IDA in school-age
children is to give weekly iron supplements to all children at school.

of non-anemic Bolivian school-age children
A randomized placebo-controlled trial
Introduction
Iron deficiency anemia is the most prevalent nutritional deficiency worldwide. It is a major public health problem
with adverse consequences especially for women and children. Over 90 % of affected individuals live in developing
countries [28]. Iron deficiency anemia in children is associated with decreased growth rates [4], impaired cognitive
development [21, 31], reduced resistance to infections
[26], increased fatigue [16], and poor school performance
[20, 24].
In most countries, anemic children only receive iron
supplements on the basis of diagnosed anemia. However,
the continuing high prevalence of iron deficiency anemia
among children in these countries shows that such an approach is not working. Poor health coverage of children at
risk, especially in rural and suburban areas, and inadequate
compliance, usually due to the side effects resulting from
therapeutic doses of oral iron, are the main causes of the
failure of iron supplementation programs [23]. Any finding
that improves the distribution of iron supplements to children and their compliance with the treatment would therefore have important implications for the prevention and
control of iron deficiency anemia in children.
In the last few years, several studies have demonstrated
the biological efficacy of supervised intermittent iron supplementation in controlling mild to moderate anemia in

children. In these studies intermittent dosing of iron appears to improve children’s hemoglobin levels equal to the
standard daily regimen. A study in Indonesia [22] demonstrated that twice weekly iron supplementation (30 mg elemental iron/dose delivered as a syrup) had an effect similar to that of daily iron supplementation in children (2–5
yrs old) with low iron status. A study in China [14] found
that a twice-weekly dose (6 mg elemental iron/kg body
weight delivered as tablets) had no advantages over a
weekly dose in iron-deficient children (3–6 yrs old) but did
produce more side effects. An iron supplementation trial in
Bolivia [1, 3] using lower doses of iron than the study in
China (3–4 mg elemental iron/kg body weight delivered as
tablets) showed that weekly administration of iron supplements corrected anemia as effectively as daily dosing in
anemic school-age children (4–7 yrs old).
In Bolivia, the prevalence of iron deficiency anemia in
school-age children ranges from 35 % to 60 % [2, 9]. In
such a context, schools are an ideal setting for the implementation of weekly iron supplementation programs for
the control of iron deficiency anemia in school-age children. The only feasible way to implement such programs
would be to treat all children attending school because previous screening of hemoglobin levels to identify anemic
children would increase the cost, time, technical skills, and
logistical constraints needed to carry out the programs.
Iron supplementation of anemic children has been
shown to improve their weight gain [5, 12, 13]. Moreover,
recent research shows that daily and weekly iron supplementation have similar positive impact on weight gain in
anemic school-age children. However, data from Indonesia suggest that daily iron supplementation of iron-replete
children could result in a decreased weight gain in comparison to children given a placebo [11].
If verified for weekly doses of iron in school-age children, these results would bring into question the delivery
of iron supplements to non-anemic children and markedly
complicate targeting and implementing school-based
weekly iron supplementation programs. To evaluate this
concern, our study sought to ascertain the effect of weekly
oral iron supplementation on the growth and hemoglobin
status of non-anemic Bolivian school-age children living
in a resource-poor community.
Subjects and methods
Subjects were Bolivian school-age children living in the
outskirts of La Paz (4,000 m above sea level). The initial
selection criterion was age within the range 6–11.9 years
old and hemoglobin concentration > 144 g/L. Hemoglobin
was determined in finger-prick blood samples with a Hemoglobin Photometer HemoCue (HemoCue AB; Angelholm, Sweden).
131 children attending school met the inclusion criteria
for age. All 131 children were screened for anemia. 58 children (44.3 %) were anemic (hemoglobin concentration
<=144 g/L) and 73 children (55.7 %) were non-anemic (hemoglobin concentration > 144 g/L). All anemic children received weekly iron supplements for 18 weeks. The 73 nonanemic children were randomly assigned to the treatment
(n=37) or the control (n=36) group using a table with randomly assorted digits. During 18 weeks, children in the
treatment group received tablets containing iron (FeSO4)
whereas children in the control group received a placebo
similar in color and appearance to the iron supplement.
A teacher trained by the principal investigator was responsible for the delivery of the iron tablets in the classrooms. The teacher was provided with a list of the names
of the children and the number and kind of pills (colorcoded) each child should take every Wednesday. Children
who were not present at school on Wednesday received the
tablets on Thursday.
The iron dose was calculated to provide children with
an average of 3 mg of elemental iron per kg of body weight.
The supplement consisted of two types of tablets containing either 20 mg or 36 mg of elemental iron in form of
FeSO4. These tablets were used in combination to adjust
the dose to the child’s weight. For example, a child of 33
kg of body weight was given 1 pill containing 36 mg of elemental iron and three pills containing 20 mg of elemental
iron (36+60=96) to come the closest possible to the 99 mg
that would correspond to the child’s weight (33x3=99).
Tablet administration began one hour after arrival at
school in the morning. The teacher supervised the administration of tablets to the children with clean boiled water
and made sure the children swallowed the supplements.
The teacher recorded in a notebook compliance and side
effects reported by children an/or their parents. Neither the
teacher nor his assistant were aware of the composition of
the tablets delivered to the children.
The design of the study enabled a randomized doubleblind placebo-controlled trial with children in the treatment
group receiving a weekly supplement of 3 mg of elemental
iron/kg body initial weight (as recommended in the master
protocol for WHO/UNU/UNICEF multi-country study of
weekly iron supplementation) and children in the control
group receiving a placebo.
At the beginning and the end (one week after supplementation ended) of the 18-week supplementation trial,
hemoglobin concentration and anthropometric measures
were determined for each child. Anthropometric assessment in both the treatment and the control group included
measures of weight, height, and mid-upper arm circumference. Body weight was measured to the nearest 0.1 kg
with an electronic weighing scale (SECA, Hamburg, Germany) while children were minimally clothed. Body
height was expressed as the mean of three consecutive
measurements to the nearest 0.1 cm with a WHO model
height-measuring stadiometer while children were standing barefoot. Mid-upper arm circumference was measured
to the nearest 0.1 cm with a linen tape. All measurements

Weekly iron supplementation of non-anemic children
were made by the same observer in accordance with
Lohman et al. [15].
Tablet administration started two days after anemia
screening and anthropometric assessment. The research
proposal respected the International Guidelines for Ethical
Review of Epidemiological Studies [6]. Informed consent
was obtained from the parents of the children participating
in the study. The protocol of the study was explained to and
approved by the school board.
Statistical analysis
Z-scores of the indicators weight-for-age and height-forage were calculated for all children with EPI-INFO 6.01
(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1990) by using the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS, 1977)
data as a reference.
A one-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was applied to
establish that the hemoglobin concentration and anthropometric indicators were normally distributed. Student’s ‘t’
tests were used to test for differences in mean values between the treatment and the control group groups. Paired
sample Student’s tests were employed when examining
changes within groups between the beginning and the end
of the study. Chi-square analyses were conducted to test
differences between groups in age and sex composition.
Multiple linear regression analyses using the all variables
method were performed to determine the most significant
predictors of changes in hemoglobin concentration and anthropometric variables. A P value < 0.05 was considered
significant in all statistical tests. All statistical analyses
were computed using SPSS for Windows (SPSS Inc.,
Chicago, 1993)
Results
A complete set of data was obtained for 33 children in the
treatment group (89.2 %) and for 31 children (86.1 %) in
the control group. At baseline, anthropometric and hematological values of dropouts (4 in the treatment group and
5 in the control group) were similar to those of the children
who completed the supplementation trial. In all nine cases,
the reason for attrition was that the children’s families
moved to other settings.
In the final sample, mean age of children (Table 1) in the
treatment group was not significantly different from that of
the control group (110.9±23.8 months vs. 110.8±24.9
months respectively; P=0.99). Between group differences
in age distribution (Table 2) were not significant either. The
treatment group included 12 children 6–7.9 years old, 11
children 8–9.9 years old and 10 children 10–11.9 years old;
the control group included 12, 8 and 11 children respectively in each age category (Chi-square test, P=0.80). Similarly, no significant differences were observed in sex distribution (Table 1) between the two groups. The treatment
group included 16 boys and 17 girls whereas the control
group included 18 boys and 13 girls (Chi-square test;
P=0.44).
At baseline (T0), mean values of hemoglobin concentration, weight, height, mid-upper arm circumference,
weight-for-age Z-score, and height-for-age Z-score in the
two groups were not significantly different (Table 1).
Similarly at the end of the study (T18), no significant
differences in hemoglobin concentration, weight, height,
mid-upper arm circumference, weight-for-age Z-score, or
height-for-age Z-score were observed between the treatment and the control groups (Table 1).
In the end of the study (T18), the number of children
who had hemoglobin concentrations lower than or equal to
144 g/L was similar in both groups (5 children in the treatTable 1 Age, sex, hemoglobin concentration, and athropometric parameters of children at the beginning and at the end of the studya

Weekly iron supplementation of non-anemic children
ables method showed that the only two significant predictors of weight gain over the supplementation period were
the age and the initial weight. Similarly, the only two significant predictors of height gain over the supplementation
period were the age and the initial height. Initial mean
weight and height in the two groups were not significantly
different. Nevertheless, despite randomization the proportion of underweight children (weight-for-age < –2 SD) in
the control group was significantly higher than in the treatment group (0.30 vs 0.19; Chi-square test, p=0.04), possibly indicating a greater potential for weight gain in the control group. After correcting for the initial age and weight by
including them in the analysis of variance, the between
group differences in treatment effect for weight gain
(tested by the interaction between treatment effect and supplement type) were not statistically significant.
Only one girl in the treatment group reported undesirable side effects (nausea) by the end of the study, but she
completed the 18-week treatment. All children who completed the study in either group received at least 17 doses.
Discussion
For the purpose of screening, anemia was defined in our
study by a hemoglobin concentration lower than or equal
to 144 g/L. This cut-off value has been previously recommended for the definition of anemia in school-age children
living at 4000 m above the sea level [1, 3]. The prevalence
of anemia in the base population of our study was 44.3 %.
This figure is consistent with previous estimates pointing
out high prevalences of anemia among Bolivian school-age
children living at high altitude [2, 9].
An increase in hemoglobin concentration greater than
10 g/L in response to iron supplementation is usually considered as evidence of initial iron deficiency anemia in
children [8]. In our study, the number of children in the
treatment group who responded to the weekly iron supplementation by an increase in hemoglobin concentration
greater than 10 g/L was low (n=5). This number was not
significantly different than the number of children in the
control group who showed the same response at the end of
the study (n=6). Therefore, children classified as non-anemic were truly non-anemic.
The duration of our study (18 weeks) and the dose of elemental iron given to children (3 mg/kg initial weight)
were the same as in the study by Idjradinata et al. [11].
However, the supplementation scheme (one weekly dose)
and the age group (64 school-age children) in our study
were different from the supplementation scheme (daily
dose) and the age group (47 preschool children) in the
study by Idjradinata et al. in Indonesia.
Idjradinata et al. found that after four months of daily
supplementation, the group receiving a placebo showed
greater weight gain than the iron-supplemented group.
However, at baseline the control group was slightly lighter
for age than the iron-supplemented group, possibly indicating a greater potential for weight gain. Moreover, borderline between-group differences in morbidity could also
explain differences in growth potential. The betweengroup difference in weight gain was not statistically significant. However, with repeated-measures analysis, there
was a significant interaction between treatment group and
weight gain. These controversial findings could therefore
be the result of a peculiar data subset from a larger study
designed to test the developmental consequences of iron
deficiency anemia in childhood [10].
In our study, the treatment group did not show any significant variation in hemoglobin concentration after 18
weeks of weekly iron supplementation. The control group
instead showed a significant decrease in hemoglobin concentration between the beginning and the end of the study.
No significant between-group difference was found
with respect to weight, height, mid-upper arm circumference, weight-for-age Z-score, or height-for-age Z-score either in the beginning or the end of the study. Both the
treatment and the control group showed significant increases in anthropometric measures with respect to the initial ones. These augmentations were not significantly different between groups. The main predictors of weight and
height gain were the age and the initial weight or height of
children, respectively. After correction for age and initial
weight or height, the between-group differences in weight,
height, weight gain and height gain remained not statistically significant.
The International Nutritional Anemia Consultative
Group (INACG), WHO, and UNICEF recommend that a
daily dose of 2 mg iron/kg weight be given to children 6–24
months of age for the prevention of anemia [25]. The dose
given to children in the Indonesian study was significantly
higher (3 mg/kg body weight/day). This could have translated into lower absorption rates of nutrients in the supplemented children due to the intestinal blocking by the preceding dose (-s) of iron and result in the observed adverse
effect on weigh gain in iron-replete children. Aweekly supplementation schedule would allow for a longer period for
the absorption of iron, and avoid intestinal overload, and
prevent any adverse effect on weight gain.
In our study, weekly iron supplementation of non-anemic Bolivian school-age children had no negative effect on
their growth while having a positive effect in preventing
significant decreases in hemoglobin concentration.
Program implications
In Bolivia, little progress has been accomplished over the
last decade in controlling iron deficiency anemia in schoolage children [9] despite the well-documented negative consequences of iron deficiency anemia on school performance, mental acuity, and concentration [27].
The control of iron deficiency anemia in school-age
268 European Journal of Nutrition, Vol. 39, Number 6 (2000)

children has mostly relied on programs that attempt to distribute therapeutic daily iron supplements to children
through the primary health care system on the basis of diagnosed anemia. The effectiveness of such programs has
been very weak likely because of the low coverage of the
health care system in rural and periurban areas, the operational constraints of such programs, and the poor compliance associated with the daily regimen [30].
Recent school-based studies in Bolivia have shown that
the administration of a weekly dose of iron to anemic
school-age children is as efficacious as a daily schedule in
controlling iron deficiency anemia [1, 3]. Therefore, supplementation programs for the control of iron deficiency
anemia in school-age children could significantly improve
their effectiveness through a school-based weekly supplementation approach. Such an approach could significantly
increase coverage and reduce costs. It would also improve
the compliance of the target group given that side effects of
iron supplements are dose-related [29].
However, previous screening of hemoglobin levels to
identify and target anemic children would significantly increase the cost, time, technical skills, and logistical constraints needed to carry out such school-based weekly supplementation programs.
In our study, weekly iron supplementation of non-anemic children showed no negative effect on their growth
while preventing significant stresses in hemoglobin status.
These results suggest that in regions like the Bolivian highlands (Altiplano) where iron deficiency anemia is prevalent, the simplest and most cost-effective way to prevent
and control iron deficiency anemia in school-age children
would be to give weekly iron supplements to all children at
school.
Such a strategy would have positive effects for all beneficiaries. In the case of children who suffer from iron-deficiency anemia when they enroll in school, a weekly iron
supplementation program would lead to the correction of
iron deficiency anemia in a relatively short period of time
[1, 3]. In the case of children who do not suffer from irondeficiency anemia when they enroll in school, weekly iron
supplementation would protect them, as seen in our study,
from significant stresses in hemoglobin status related to
seasonal variations in iron intake and/or iron utilization,
growth, and infections.
In both cases, a long-term weekly iron-supplementation
program would allow for the progressive accumulation of
adequate iron reserves, which would protect children from
iron deficiency and anemia, improve their school performance, strengthen their immunity, and prevent anemia during adolescence [27]. This is particularly important in
countries like Bolivia where many girls marry and begin
childbearing shortly after they finish school [7].
