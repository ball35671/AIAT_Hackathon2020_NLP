Abstract
Background: The study was conducted to compare the effects of tubal sterilization through electrocoagulation and the application of
mechanical clips on the ovarian reserve.
Study Design: Eighty-eight patients in the reproductive period with the desire of tubal sterilization were included in the prospective,
randomized study. The patients were divided into two groups by simple randomization as tubal sterilization through electrocoagulation group
and the application of mechanical clips group. Day-3 serum follicle stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, estradiol, inhibin-B and
antimüllerian hormone and Day-3 total ovarian volume measurements and anthral follicle counts of all patients in the preoperative and 10th
postoperative months were compared both within and between the two groups.
Results: A significant difference between the postoperative 10th-month Day-3 total ovarian volumes and anthral follicle counts was detected
between the electrocoagulation and mechanical clips application groups.
Conclusion: Tubal sterilization by electrocoagulation is very likely to have an adverse effect on the ovarian reserve in the postoperative period.

1. Introduction
Worldwide, the most commonly used method of fertility
regulation is tubal sterilization [1].
The importance of contraceptive methods can be better
understood when the fact that 700,000 women died due to
unwanted pregnancies between the years of 1995 and 2000
is brought to attention. Tubal sterilization is a frequently
utilized contraceptive method during the postpartum period
in Turkey, as in many other developing countries [2].
Currently, about 700,000 of these procedures are performed
each year in the United States. Half is performed right after a
woman gives birth. The rest are elective procedures
performed as a 1-day operation. Eleven million US women
aged 15–44 years rely on sterilization as a means of birth
control to prevent pregnancy. More than 190 million couples
worldwide use surgical sterilization as a safe and reliable
method of permanent birth control [3]. According to data
obtained in 2003, the frequency in which tubal sterilization is
the choice of contraception in Turkey is 5.7% [4].
This study was based on the hypothesis that tubal
sterilization procedures may adversely affect ovarian reserve
by impeding blood flow to the ovaries. Disrupted blood flow
to the ovaries due to the occlusion of the anastomosis
between uterine and ovarian arteries during tubal sterilization
can be encountered both with electrocoagulation and
mechanical clips application techniques.
We aimed to compare the effects of the two techniques of
tubal sterilization on the ovarian reserve.
2. Materials and methods
This prospective, randomized study was conducted in our
gynecology department from January 2007 to June 2008.
The study was approved by the ethics committee, and written
consents of all the study participants were obtained.

Patients with perimenopausal symptoms, abnormal body
mass index, endocrinological pathologies, a family history of
premature ovarian failure, ovarian cysts greater than 25 mm
detected during transvaginal ultrasonography and those who
had undergone pelvic surgery within the previous year or
during the study period were excluded from the study.
Patients selected for the study had ovarian reserves in the
normal range, regular menstrual periods, and no risks for
premature ovarian failure in the personal and family
histories. After reviewing the current literature on the
subject, we defined the normal range for ovarian reserve as
having a total anthral follicle count of at least 8, with a
minimum of 4 follicles in each ovary; calculating the total
basal volume over 6 cm3 and measuring the basal follicle
stimulating hormone (FSH) level b10 mIU/mL. Besides
these major criteria, we have also considered basal E2 levels
b70 pg/mL, basal antimüllerian hormone levels N1.26 ng/mL
and basal inhibin B levels N45 ng/mL to be normal. Eightyeight patients in the reproductive period between the ages of
35–40 years who had voluntarily requested tubal sterilization were included in the study. The patients were separated
into two groups by the simple random sampling method
using a table of random numbers: 44 of them having
undergone tubal sterilization through electrocoagulation and
44 of them having undergone tubal sterilization through the
application of mechanical clips.
The preoperative serum FSH, luteinizing hormone (LH),
estradiol (E2), inhibin B and antimüllerian hormone levels on
the third day of menstruation of all patients were measured;
samples were taken from antecubital venous blood. Total
ovarian volume measurements and anthral follicle counts
were obtained by transvaginal ultrasonography on the same
day. All ultrasonographic measurements were obtained by
the same operator using the Logiq 200 Pro (General Electric,
Milwaukee, WI) ultrasound machine and the 5.0-MHz
probe. Ovarian volume was calculated by measuring the
longitudinal (D1), anteroposterior (D2) and transverse (D3)
diameters of both ovaries and using the prolate ellipsoid
formula (Vol=D1×D2×D3×π/6). The total ovarian volume
was obtained by adding the volumes of both ovaries. Anthral
follicle count was recorded as the number of 2–10-mm sized
follicles seen in both ovaries.
Patients were scheduled for surgery in the follicular phase
of their menstrual cycle to avoid the possibility of pregnancy.
All laparoscopic tubal sterilization operations were performed under general anesthesia. The Veress needle was
inserted with the patient in the neutral position. Following
the confirmation of peritoneal access, the abdomen was
inflated with carbon dioxide up to 14 mm Hg of pressure.
After insertion of the trocars, the patient was brought to the
Trendelenburg position. During exploration, the general
appearance and mobility of the tubes were observed. In the
group in which electrocoagulation was utilized for tubal
sterilization, bipolar cautery with a 40-W ValleyLab Force
EZ-8C (Boulder, CO) was applied at the point of the tube 3
cm from the tubouterine junction. Following cauterization,
the tubes were cut apart to make sure that the end points were
separated. If considered necessary, the cut tubal ends were
cauterized by bipolar cautery. In the group in which
mechanical clips were applied for tubal sterilization, two
clips were placed side by side on the free portion of the tube
3 cm from the uterus, making sure that the entire tubal
segment was included. Following successful occlusion of the
tubes, abdominal exploration was performed, and the
decision to end the operation was made. No antibiotics
were administered to patients without any signs of infection
during the postoperative follow-up, and the patients were
discharged from hospital on the first postoperative day.
All patients were scheduled for follow-up on the 10th
postoperative month. Day-3 serum FSH, LH, E2, inhibin B
and antimüllerian hormone levels of all the patients were
repeated, and the anthral follicle count and Day-3 total
ovarian volume measurements were obtained by transvaginal ultrasonography. All findings were recorded.
2.1. Statistics
SPSS program for Windows 13.0 was utilized for the
statistical analysis of data obtained in the study. Descriptive
statistical methods (mean, standard deviation) were used in
the evaluation of the study data, and the variables were
compared with the paired or unpaired t test, as appropriate.
Statistical significance was considered to be achieved at the
pb.05 level, with a 95% confidence level.
3. Results
The mean age of patients undergoing tubal sterilization
through electrocoagulation and the application of mechanical clips was 37.14±1.62 and 37.24±1.68 years, respectively. No statistical difference between the mean ages of the
two study groups was detected (pb.05).
The preoperative Day-3 ovarian reserve indicators of
patients undergoing tubal sterilization through electrocoagulation and the application of mechanical clips are summarized
in Table 1. No statistically significant difference in the mean
preoperative Day-3 total ovarian volumes and anthral follicle
counts between the two groups was found (pb.05) (Table 1).

The preoperative and postoperative 10th-month mean
values of ovarian reserve indicators in the tubal sterilization
through electrocoagulation group are summarized in Table 2.
In the electrocoagulation group, there is a statistically significant difference between the Day-3 total ovarian volume on
transvaginal ultrasonography of 11.62±2.49 in the preoperative period and the 10.80±2.10 in the 10th postoperative
month (pb.01). A statistically significant difference is
detected also between the mean anthral follicle counts of
12.15±2.89 in the preoperative period and 10.52±2.34 in
the 10th postoperative month (pb.01) (Table 2).
Preoperative and postoperative 10th-month mean values
of ovarian reserve indicators in the tubal sterilization
through the application of mechanical clips group are
summarized in Table 3. The mean preoperative Day-3 total
ovarian volume on transvaginal ultrasonography in the tubal
sterilization through mechanical clips application group was
12.01±2.90 cm3
, and the mean total ovarian volume on
transvaginal ultrasonography on the 10th postoperative
month was detected to be 11.82±2.21 cm3
. No statistically
significant difference was present between these two results
(pN.05). No statistically significant difference between the
preoperative mean anthral follicle count of 12.19±2.94 and
postoperative 10th-month mean anthral follicle count of
11.96±2.13 was detected either (pN.05) (Table 3).
Postoperative 10th-month mean values of ovarian reserve
indicators in the tubal sterilization through electrocoagulation and the application of mechanical clips groups are
shown in Table 4. The mean Day-3 total ovarian volume
detected on transvaginal ultrasonography on the 10th
postoperative month in patients who had undergone tubal
sterilization through the application of mechanical clips was
statistically higher than that of the patients who had
undergone tubal sterilization through electrocoagulation
(pb.05). Similarly, the mean anthral follicle count in the
tubal sterilization through the application of mechanical clips
group was found to be statistically significantly higher than
that of the tubal sterilization through electrocoagulation
group (pb.01) (Table 4).
4. Discussion
It is a well known fact that fecundity in women decreases
with advancing age. In a study conducted in China, a linear
decrease in the anthral follicle count of 3.8% per year was
detected [5]. Taking into account the ongoing atresia of
ovarian follicles starting from the 20th intrauterine week and
the fact that the oocyte count will never increase, evaluation
of ovarian reserve by examination of the ovarian primordial
follicle pool is certain to have an important place in the
prediction of menopause, a time when ovarian reserves are
totally used up and fecundity has come to an end. At least
1000 follicles are necessary for the continuation of the
menstrual cycle [6]. At lower follicle counts, the cessation of
menstrual cycles and therefore menopause will ensue.
The ideal parameter in determining ovarian reserve must
be easy to measure, minimally invasive, inexpensive and
must have a good predictive value. Ultrasonography is
suitable for the evaluation of ovarian reserve because it is a
fast, accurate and cost-effective method. Day-3 total ovarian
volume decreases in parallel to advancing age. The decrease
in anthral follicle count during the early follicular phase of
the menstrual cycle may be apparent before the rise in serum

FSH levels. Follicles reach a size of at least 2 mm after they
have left the inactive resting stage. Follicles of this size can
be visualized by ultrasonography. These anthral follicles
secrete inhibin B and E2 in response to increasing FSH levels
during the cycle [7]. With the aim to compare many currently
utilized ovarian reserve parameters, Bancsi et al. [8]
evaluated Day-3 serum basal FSH, E2 and inhibin B levels
and ultrasonographic findings of anthral follicle count and
total basal ovarian volume in 120 patients undergoing in
vitro fertilization for the first time. The results of the study
revealed anthral follicle count to be the best indicator of poor
ovarian reserve and that the accuracy of anthral follicle count
in predicting poor prognosis is enhanced with basal serum
FSH and inhibin B measurements.
In light of the studies on ovarian reserve in the literature,
we chose Day-3 serum FSH, LH, E2, inhibin-B and hormone
levels and ultrasonographic findings of Day-3 total ovarian
volume and anthral follicle counts to be indicators of ovarian
reserve. The clomiphene citrate challenge test, gonadotropinreleasing hormone agonist stimulation test and exogenous
FSH ovarian reserve test were not considered because they
are dynamic, invasive and costly tests, and it is not beneficial
to administer induction agents prior to operative procedures.
Ovarian stromal blood flow detected through Doppler
ultrasonography was not utilized because of the difficulty
in its application and standardization problems.
The prospective study conducted by Alvarez et al. [9] in
1989 is one of the first studies in the literature about the
effects of tubal sterilization on the ovarian reserve. In this
study, the Pomeroy method was applied to eight patients,
and the Uchida method was applied to nine patients, with
Day-3 serum FSH, LH and E2 levels obtained on the
second and sixth postoperative months. No statistically
significant effect of the two techniques on the ovarian
reserve parameters was detected. The small study population and the inadequate evaluation of ovarian reserve
parameters were the drawbacks of this study. In another
study in which tubal sterilization through the Pomeroy
technique with minilaparotomy was applied to 20 patients,
Geber et al. [10] did not find a significant difference in the
ovarian artery pulsatility index values between the
preoperative and postoperative periods. In a study published by Carmona et al. [11] in 2003, 26 patients
underwent tubal sterilization by the application of bipolar
cauterization. A control group of the same number of
patients was formed, and the preoperative Day-3 serum
FSH, LH, E2 and inhibin B levels were determined. Upon
evaluations on the sixth, 12th, 18th, 24th and 60th
postoperative months, no statistically significant difference
was observed in the ovarian reserve indicators. A similar
study was conducted in Turkey by Dede et al. [12]. The
serum basal FSH, LH and E2 levels of 60 patients
undergoing tubal sterilization by bipolar electrocoagulation
were recorded. No statistical difference was found in the
ovarian reserve indicators on the third postoperative month.
In both of these studies, only hormonal markers were used
as ovarian reserve indicators in patients who underwent
tubal sterilization by bipolar cauterization, and no statistically significant difference was detected in either of the
two. In the Kelekci et al. study [13] utilizing electrocoagulation for tubal sterilization in 74 patients with a
control group of 74 women, the preoperative early
follicular phase serum FSH, LH and E2 levels and total
ovarian volume, anthral follicle count and ovarian stromal
blood flow Doppler indices were recorded. When the
ovarian reserve parameters of the first and 12th postoperative months were obtained, the serum Day-3 FSH
levels and ovarian stromal artery pulsatility indexes were
observed to be higher than the same measurements in the
control group and the preoperative period. However, this
difference was observed to disappear totally on the 12th
postoperative month, and no statistically significant difference in the ovarian reserve indicators remained between the
patient and the control groups.
In the present study, no statistical difference in the
hormonal ovarian reserve parameters of patients undergoing tubal sterilization by bipolar electrocoagulation
between the preoperative and 10th postoperative month
was detected. Nevertheless, the postoperative mean Day-3
total ovarian volume and anthral follicle counts detected by
transvaginal ultrasonography were found to be significantly
low. It is proposed in studies in the literature on ovarian
reserve indicators that ultrasonographic Day-3 total ovarian
volume measurement and anthral follicle count are the best
indicators of early deteriorating primordial follicle pool
[14,15]. In light of recent literature, our comments on the
results of our study are such that ultrasonographic
parameters are early indicators of deteriorating ovarian
reserve due to the fact that only the ultrasonographic
ovarian reserve indicators are affected, while the hormonal
ovarian reserve indicators remain unchanged in patients
who have undergone tubal sterilization by electrocoagulation. At the 10th postoperative month after which no
follow-up was carried out, the ultrasonographic measurements — early indicators of poor ovarian reserve — were
found to be decreased, while the hormonal measurements
remained unchanged. It is likely that hormonal indicators
will be adversely affected in the following months to come.
However, further long-term studies need to be carried out
to confirm this hypothesis.
There is no statistically significant difference between the
mean ages of the patients undergoing tubal sterilization
through electrocoagulation and those with application of
mechanical clips. The mean age of both of the groups is
around 37 years. No statistically significant difference was
observed between the preoperative and postoperative 10thmonth ovarian reserve indicators of patients undergoing tubal
sterilization by the application of mechanical clips. Therefore, no adverse effect of this method on the ovarian reserve
was detected. Even though there was no statistically
significant difference between the preoperative and postoperative 10th-month FSH and LH levels of the groups that
G. Goynumer et al. / Contraception 80 (2009) 90–94 93
went through electrocoagulation and mechanical clip application, the FSH and LH increase in the electrocoagulation
group was slightly more. In the study conducted by Timonen
et al. [16], no statistical difference was detected in the serum
levels of FSH, LH and E2, between the preoperative and
postoperative 12th month in 33 patients who have undergone
tubal sterilization by the application of mechanical clips.
Similarly, in another study carried out by Thranov et al. [17]
in which fallopian rings and Filshie clips were utilized for
tubal sterilization, no significant effect of the two methods on
the ovarian reserve parameters was detected. Sumiala et al.
[18] compared the preoperative ovarian arterial resistance
measurements of 16 patients with the same measurements
obtained in the early postoperative period and third postoperative month. A significant increase in the ovarian
vascular resistance both in the early postoperative period
and the third postoperative month was detected. The most
important drawback of this study utilizing mechanical clips
was the short follow-up period of three months. It is shown in
many studies that tubal sterilization procedures lead to a
temporary increase in the ovarian artery Doppler indices in
the early postoperative period [13,19]. In light of all the data
in the literature, our comments on the findings of our study
are such that the application of clips in tubal sterilization has
no adverse effects on the ovarian reserve in the postoperative
period. Only a transient increase in the ovarian artery
resistance can be encountered in the early postoperative
period due to occlusion of the anastomosis between uterine
and ovarian arteries which is resolved in the following
months, having no effect on the ovarian reserve indicators in
the long run. Although no gross change in uterine or ovarian
arterial flow is reported by Doppler flowmetry following
sterilization [10], we believe that microvascular perfusion
changes may occur in ovarian blood flow, as Donnez et al.
[20] have reported retardation of the endometrium 6 months
after sterilization by electrocautery.
5. Conclusion
There is a statistical difference between the preoperative
and postoperative ultrasonographic ovarian reserve indicators
of Day-3 total ovarian volume and anthral follicle count in
patients undergoing tubal sterilization by electrocoagulation.
The reason for not encountering such a difference in hormonal
ovarian reserve indicators between the preoperative and
postoperative period is that ultrasonographic parameters are
early indicators of deteriorating ovarian reserve. These
findings suggest that tubal sterilization by electrocoagulation
is very likely to have an adverse effect on the ovarian reserve in
the postoperative period. Nevertheless, further long-term
studies are needed to confirm these findings.
