Abstract
To compare the effectiveness and safety of the Filshie Clip System™ and Hulka Clip System when applied via minilaparotomy and
laparoscopy, we conducted 2 multicenter randomized controlled trials of 2126 women (878 in the minilaparotomy study and 1248 in the
laparoscopy study) who received either the Filshie or Hulka Clip. A physician other than the operator evaluated patients postoperatively and
again at 1, 6, and 12 months after surgery. We compared the cumulative incidence of pregnancy and the frequency of safety related events
for the device groups. Twenty-four month follow-up was planned for a subset of 599 women in the laparoscopy study. One woman who
received the Filshie Clip and 6 women who received the Hulka Clip became pregnant within one year. The 12-month life-table pregnancy
probability was 1.1 per 1000 women in the Filshie Clip group and 6.9 per 1000 women in the Hulka Clip group. The difference in the risk
of pregnancy through 12 months between device groups neared statistical significance (p 5 0.06). Among the extended follow-up subset,
the 12- and 24-month cumulative pregnancy probabilities were 3.9 and 9.7 per 1000 women for the Filshie Clip group and 11.7 and 28.1
per 1000 women for the Hulka Clip group (p 5 0.16 for comparison through 24 months). Both the Filshie and Hulka Clips are effective
and safe for use in tubal occlusion. © 2000 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction
In 1996, the US Food and Drug Administration approved
the Filshie Clip for tubal sterilization. The Filshie and Hulka
clips vary slightly in their mechanism of action. While the
Hulka Clip [1] has a spring mechanism that holds the clip
closed against the fallopian tube, the Filshie Clip uses the
pressure exerted by the applicator to close the clip around
the fallopian tube and flatten the curved upper jaw of the
clip [2]. This action causes the upper jaw’s leading edge to
extend under the lip of the lower jaw, locking it into position, and simultaneously trapping and occluding the fallopian tube.
Published reports of failure rates with the clips have
varied widely. This may reflect several factors, including
the level of experience of the surgeon, the timing of the
surgery (postpartum or interval), the procedure used, the
method used to calculate failure rates, and characteristics of
the study population [3–9]. A randomized trial of 289
women found that the Filshie Clip performed better than the
Hulka Clip with respect to ease of application and perioperative pain [10]. To evaluate clinically the relative effectiveness and safety of the 2 methods, we conducted 2 randomized controlled trials of the Filshie and Hulka clips
when used for interval sterilization, one when applied via
minilaparotomy and the other when applied via laparoscopy.
2. Materials and methods
Except for the type of surgical approach used (laparoscopy or minilaparotomy), the two study protocols were
identical. The lead investigator at each site was required to

be an experienced surgeon and in most sites served as the
operator, while another experienced surgeon served as the
evaluator.
Family Health International’s (FHI’s) institutional review board (IRB) approved the two protocols on November
9, 1984. In addition, each study center obtained approval to
conduct the study from its own IRB prior to study initiation.
If a local IRB was not available, FHI’s IRB acted in lieu of
a local IRB.
Women who were at least 21 years of age, legally able to
consent to sterilization and who had a normal physical and
pelvic examination results were eligible to participate in the
studies. We did not enroll women if they had undergone a
pregnancy termination within the past 42 days or if they had
a pre-existing clinically important abnormal condition such
as diabetes, renal or cardiac disease. We did not enroll
women who were already pregnant or women undergoing
surgery other than routine curettage or IUD removal concurrent with sterilization. For example, a woman was not
eligible if she was coming in for both an induced abortion
and a sterilization procedure. Nor did we enroll women who
required sterilization for reasons other than voluntarily limiting the size of their family.
After each participant signed an informed consent agreement, we randomized her to receive one of the two tubal
occlusion devices using a computer-generated randomization scheme stratified by center. Her group assignment was
then revealed to the operator by opening a sealed, sequentially numbered, opaque envelope provided to the site at
study initiation by FHI. Minilaparotomy was used to access
and view the fallopian tubes in one study that was performed at five centers; laparoscopy was used in the other
study that was performed at four centers.
Prior to surgery, we took a medical history and conducted a physical examination, including a pelvic examination. The operator recorded the type of anesthetic, the surgical approach, and the reason for any change from the
assigned tubal occlusion method, if applicable. Before
women were discharged, another physician who was not
informed of the type of clip the women had received assessed them for complications involving the surgical incision, pelvic pain and infection, and any other complications
or complaints.
A surgeon other than the operator evaluated participants
at 1, 6, and 12 months after sterilization. At selected sites, a
24-month evaluation was planned for a subset of laparoscopy participants. At the early (1-month) follow-up visit, we
evaluated women for complications associated with the surgical procedure. At the later visits, we gave participants a
physical examination, including a pelvic examination and a
clinical assessment of pelvic infection, and asked them
questions about their menstrual patterns (including intermenstrual bleeding and pain). At all follow-up visits, we
recorded pregnancies, adverse events, abdominal or pelvic
surgery, or clinic admissions that had occurred since the
surgery. We diagnosed pregnancies with a urine pregnancy
test, pelvic examination, or other clinical evaluation, but we
did not routinely administer a chemical pregnancy test at the
12- or 24-month visits.
A total of five centers from four countries were included
in the minilaparotomy study and four centers from four
countries were included in laparoscopy study. Field-work
was completed in February of 1990. We defined three different subject populations before we analyzed the individual
trial results. The intent-to-treat population included all
women who were assigned to receive the Filshie Clip or the
Hulka Clip. The treated population included all women who
had at least one fallopian tube occluded with either a Filshie
Clip or a Hulka Clip. The efficacy population included all
women who had both fallopian tubes occluded with their
assigned device except those who had inclusion criteria
violations that might interfere with the evaluation of effectiveness. Prior to initiation of the primary analysis for either
trial, we determined the treated population to be the primary
analysis population of interest, and it is the focus of the
individual trial and pooled trial results presented here.
The effectiveness outcome of interest was pregnancy.
We calculated 12-month gross cumulative life-table pregnancy probabilities by device type (combining data collected in the studies) and by device type within study [11].
We calculated standard errors using the method described
by Peto et al. [12]. We used a log-rank test (a 5 0.05) to test
for differences in pregnancy curves by device group [13].
We also calculated gross cumulative life-table pregnancy
probabilities through 24 months for the subgroup of participants for whom extended follow-up was planned. We excluded women from the effectiveness analysis for the
treated population who were later determined to have been
pregnant at the time their tubes were occluded (i.e., women
with luteal phase pregnancies). In the event of a hysterectomy or other surgical intervention that would alter the risk
of pregnancy, women were censored from the life-table
analysis. Participants who were not reported to be pregnant
were censored from the life-table analysis as of the date of
their last visit. For pregnancies, date of conception was
estimated using an algorithm based on last menstrual period
and gestational age at termination or pregnancy confirmation. We calculated the percentage of surgical injuries and
primary incision complications, infections and other major
complications at early follow-up, by device received within
strata defined by surgical approach. Within each surgical
approach stratum, we used Fisher’s exact test (a 5 0.05) to
test for differences between device groups in the number of
women having each type of event. We did not combine
early safety results for the surgical approaches because of
the differences in characteristics of the procedures. We
summarized reports of hospital readmission and abdominal
or pelvic surgery during follow-up.

3. Results
Unless otherwise stated, we present results for the treated
population by device received. A total of 2126 women (878
in the minilaparotomy study and 1248 in the laparoscopy
study) comprised the entire intent-to-treat population (Figs.
1 and 2). Of these, we assigned 1066 to the Filshie Clip and
1060 to the Hulka Clip. We identified major violations of
the inclusion/exclusion criteria in 34 women (7 in the minilaparotomy study and 27 in the laparoscopy study). Of
these, 19 received the Filshie Clip and 15 received the
Hulka Clip. Almost half of the protocol violations were
women whose last pregnancy had been terminated less than
5 weeks before surgery. The other violations were 11
women with a variety of pre-existing conditions and 7
women with pre-existing pelvic pathology. Table 1 shows
the number of participants by analysis population, surgical
approach and country.
The women in both device groups had a mean age of 31
years and had given birth to an average of 4.2 children.
About half of the women in both device groups had been
pregnant within 6 months prior to sterilization and slightly
more than half had used some form of contraceptive method
in the 3 months prior to sterilization. About one-third of the
women in each device group reported that they had not had
menses during the 3 months prior to enrollment. The likelihood of amenorrhea at baseline was considerably higher
among women who had delivered within the 6 months
preceding study enrollment than among other women, presumably due to breast-feeding. In both device groups 10%
reported previous intraperitoneal surgery and 2%–3% had
previously had pelvic inflammatory disease.
Operators experienced some type of surgical difficulty
when operating on 5% of the women who received the
Filshie Clip and 7% of the women who received Hulka Clip.
The three most common difficulties in the minilaparotomy
study were: 1) grasping the tubes (6 Filshie Clip cases and
4 Hulka Clip cases); 2) entering the peritoneum (2 Filshie
Clip cases and 5 Hulka Clip cases); and, 3) visualizing the
tubes (3 Filshie Clip cases and 2 Hulka Clip cases). The
three most common difficulties in the laparoscopy study
were: 1) visualizing the tubes (13 Filshie Clip cases and 14
Hulka Clip cases); 2) occluding the tubes (7 Filshie Clip
cases and 16 Hulka Clip cases); and, 3) entering the peritoneum (6 Filshie Clip cases and 14 Hulka Clip cases).
Operators dropped one or both clips into the abdominal
cavity of 3 women who received the Filshie Clip. The
operator did not find a dropped clip in one of these cases; it
is presumably still there. An operator noted that a Hulka clip
came apart in the abdominal cavity of one woman and he
retrieved all parts. These four surgical difficulties all occurred in the laparoscopy study.
Operators failed to apply the assigned device to both
fallopian tubes in a total of 10 women. In 4 cases (3
assigned to the Filshie Clip and one assigned to the Hulka
Clip), the operators provided no explanation for the inconFig. 1. Participant flow chart for minilaparotomy study

sistency and this occurrence appeared to be an unintentional
error. In the other 6 women (4 assigned to the Filshie Clip
and 2 assigned to the Hulka Clip), problems encountered
during surgery prevented application of the assigned device
to both tubes. Problems encountered during surgery included the need to repair a surgical injury (3 cases) and the
discovery of ovarian or fimbrial cysts (2 cases) or of thick
fallopian tubes (one case). When a surgeon was unable to
apply the assigned clip, he used an alternate method (e.g.,
Pomeroy technique). In one of the cases where cysts were
encountered, no sterilization procedure was applied to the
tube. In one Filshie Clip group participant, the surgeon used
a pair of Hulka Clips to stop one tube from bleeding after it
was transected by a Filshie Clip. The surgeon placed one
Hulka Clip on each end of the transected tube. In the
immediate postoperative period, the participant was noted
to have moderate pelvic pain that was treated with oral
analgesics. She was followed for one year and the evaluator
noted no difficulties or complications. This woman, who
was enrolled in the laparoscopy study and assigned to receive the Filshie Clip, was the only woman who was excluded from the treated population.
Within each trial, days until discharge did not vary by
device. Over 99% of the women in the laparoscopy study
were discharged from the clinic on the day of surgery, while
only 53% of those in the minilaparotomy study were discharged on the day of surgery and 42% were discharged the
following day. The percentage of women returning for follow-up visits was similar in the two groups and declined
over time. Although over 90% of the women in both device
groups returned for an early follow-up evaluation, only
about 72% in each group completed a 6-month visit and
about 67% returned for a 12-month or later visit. Among the
subset of laparoscopy participants for whom 24-month follow-up was planned (298 women in the Filshie Clip group
and 301 women in the Hulka Clip group), about 57% in
each group returned 684 or more days after surgery.
Table 2 shows 6- and 12-month cumulative life-table
pregnancy probabilities. There were 6 pregnancies in the
Hulka Clip group and one pregnancy in the Filshie Clip
group. All reported pregnancies were intrauterine. The difference in the risk of pregnancy between device groups

neared statistical significance (p 5 0.06). Given the final
sample size and the observed discontinuation rate, the study
provided about 50% power to detect a difference between
true annual pregnancy probabilities of 1 per 1000 women
and 7 per 1000 women in the pooled analysis [14]. The
numbers “at risk” in month 12 in Table 2 are somewhat less
than the numbers of non-pregnant women in Figs. 1 and 2
who made 12-month visits, especially for the minilaparotomy study. These differences reflect the use of slightly
different definitions. A 12-month visit had been defined as
any visit between 318 and 442 days after surgery. However,
for the life-table analysis, women were at risk for pregnancy
in month 12 only if they had a visit on day 336 or later, i.e.,
the first day of the 12th month after surgery.
In the subset of laparoscopy study participants who were
to be followed for 24 months, there were 4 additional
pregnancies, all intrauterine. One of the pregnancies was in
the Filshie Clip group and 3 were in the Hulka Clip group.
Among this subset, the 12- and 24-month cumulative pregnancy probabilities were 3.9 and 9.7 per 1000 women for
the Filshie Clip group and 11.7 and 28.1 per 1000 women
for the Hulka Clip group (p 5 0.16 for comparison through
24 months). Thus, a total of 11 pregnancies occurred during
the scheduled follow-up period, all intrauterine, 2 in the
Filshie Clip group and 9 in the Hulka Clip group. The only
other pregnancies identified during the study were 6 luteal
phase pregnancies, defined as a conception occurring on or
before the date of the sterilization procedure (4 in the Filshie
Clip group and 2 in the Hulka Clip group). The 6 women
with luteal phase pregnancies were excluded from efficacy
analysis.
Table 3 shows that within each study, the number of
participants with surgical injuries, primary incision complications at early follow-up, infections at early follow-up and
other complications at early follow-up were similar for the
two device groups.
During the scheduled 12- or 24-month follow-up period

12 women in the Hulka Clip group were hospitalized or
underwent abdominal or pelvic surgery. We found no clinically significant difference between the two groups in the
various reasons for surgery or hospitalization.
In addition, one participant in the Filshie Clip group of
the minilaparotomy study appeared to have experienced a
granuloma formation related to her sterilization that led to
surgery performed after the scheduled follow-up period.
Four months after sterilization, she had presented with right
iliac pain and a left adnexal mass. At 13 months, she
underwent a pelvic ultrasound, flat-plate abdominal x-ray,
and diagnostic laparoscopy. These examinations revealed a
left ovarian cyst, an abdominal wall mass on the right, and
bilateral adhesions. Fifteen months after sterilization, her
surgeon removed the left clip with the left adnexa and found
the right clip lodged in a granuloma in the subdermic muscular abdominal wall. He left the right clip in place because
of concern that the muscles would be damaged during
removal.
4. Discussion
Our estimate of the probability of pregnancy through the
first year after sterilization with the Hulka Clip (6.9 per
1,000) was lower than the probability (18.2 per 1000) observed in the Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s
(CDCs) US Collaborative Review of Sterilization (CREST)
[8]. In our trials, the sterilization procedures were performed by a small number of investigators selected because
of their surgical expertise and experience. In the CREST
study, resident physicians at teaching centers performed the
sterilization procedures. Our lower pregnancy probabilities
may be due to the choice of more experienced investigators
as operators. Alternatively, differences in estimates of the
risk of pregnancy may be due to differences in the underlying fecundity of the study populations, incomplete follow-up or chance. Although a slightly higher percentage of
the 1595 women in the “spring clip” group of the CDC
study than in the Hulka Clip group of our study were less
than 28 years of age, both studies had a similar proportion
of women above 34 years of age. Clip recipients in both of
the studies included only women desiring interval sterilization. Our study did include a substantial proportion of
women who were reported to be amenorrheic since their
previous delivery (presumably due to breast-feeding) but
comparable data were not provided for the CDC study.
Censoring participants as of the date of their last visit
would be expected to slightly underestimate the 12-month
pregnancy probabilities since pregnancies that were not yet
clinically evident could have been missed. We performed an
additional analysis that censored women who had not become pregnant 60 days prior to their last visit. The impact
on the point estimate of the pregnancy probabilities was
small. For the Filshie Clip group the estimate went from
1.11 per 1000 women to 1.14 per 1000 women. For the
Hulka Clip group the estimate went from 6.88 per 1000
women to 7.79 per 1000 women.
Although follow-up was high with respect to short-term
safety outcomes, our long-term follow-up rate was somewhat disappointing. However, the age distributions for participants who did not complete a 12-month or later visit in
both studies were quite similar to the distributions for
women who did complete a 12-month or later visit, and
nearly all participants included in our studies had previous
live births. Less educated women and women from rural
areas were less likely to complete a 12-month or later visit
than other participants, but the pattern of loss was similar in
both device groups within each study (data not shown).
The two devices appear to have similar safety profiles,
and serious adverse experiences related to sterilization with
either device were rare. All of the primary incision complications observed were complications that might be expected
after any surgery. The choice of surgical approach did not
appear to affect the overall efficacy or safety. Clip-related
adverse events (expulsion, migration, abscess, or granuloma
formation) were uncommon. No participants reported clip
expulsions in this study. However, such events were reported in comparative trials of the Filshie Clip and the tubal
ring [9].
