A multicentre trial was conducted to compare efficacy of
postpartum sterilisation with clip and partial salpingectomy. Lifetable estimates of pregnancy probabilities were compared through
2 years of follow up. A significantly different risk of pregnancy
between the clip and partial salpingectomy groups was observed.
Nine pregnancies were observed in the clip group versus two in
the partial salpingectomy group. Cumulative probability of
pregnancy through 2 years was 0.017 with the clip and 0.004
[correction added after online publication 25 September 2012;
0.044 has been replaced with 0.004] for partial salpingectomy
(P < 0.04). Equivalent efficacy of the clip compared with partial
salpingectomy has not been demonstrated in postpartum women.

Introduction
Postpartum sterilisation is one of the most common methods of contraception globally.1
. Annually in the USA, sterilisation follows approximately 8% of all births.2 Rates are
believed to be less in the UK, because of the popularity of
vasectomy.3 Use of postpartum sterilisation internationally,
where access to long-acting reversible contraception is limited, is even higher in many countries. The postpartum
period extends up to 6 weeks, but a postpartum sterilisation procedure is typically performed within 48 hours of a
delivery.4 Postpartum partial salpingectomy has one of the
lowest failure rates of all sterilisation techniques, with a
1-year failure rate of 0.6 per 1000 and a 10-year failure rate
of 7.5 per 1000.4
An assortment of techniques is used for tubal occlusion,
with excellent efficacy and safety records.1 Partial salpingectomy with the modified Pomeroy or Parkland techniques
are two common methods used in postpartum sterilisation.5 Partial salpingectomy is a simple, safe procedure,
where a segment of fallopian tube is ligated and removed
bilaterally.6 Partial salpingectomy can be more challenging
in obese women, or in women with extensive intra-abdominal adhesions.4 The use of occlusive devices, such as a ring
or clip placed via laparoscopy, are commonly used methods
for interval sterilisation (defined as tubal sterilisation at
least 6 weeks following a birth), but have also been used in
the postpartum period.5 The use of an occlusive device,
rather than transecting and ligating with suture, has the
advantages of speed and ease of procedure.
The titanium clip (FemCare-Nikomed, Romsey, UK) is
the most commonly used method for laparoscopic interval
tubal sterilisations in the USA and the UK.6 Its use for sterilisation was first described in 1981 in a prospective cohort
study of 540 British women.5 Pregnancy outcomes and
complications were assessed over 5–17 months. The titanium clip has a silicone lining that is applied to the isthmic
region of the tube.5 The clip is applied with a unique applicator, and must encompass the entire tube for effective
compression. As necrosis ensues, the silicone lining maintains tubal collapse. Applicators have been developed for
use in both laparoscopic surgery and with mini-laparotomy.
The largest, long-term study of sterilisation is the US
Collaborative Review of Sterilization (CREST) trial, which
included postpartum sterilisation by mini-laparotomy, and
interval sterilisation using various laparoscopic techniques
and mini-laparotomy. Although the titanium clip was not
available at the time of the study, the efficacy of the titanium clip has been well established.5,6 However, with

regard to postpartum use, data to support routine use of
the clip are less clear.3 Only eight postpartum women
were included in the original efficacy trial, and their outcomes were not reported separately.5 Additional small
studies have supported its efficacy postpartum, and advocates tout its speed and ease of use.7–9 The device is
available, and widely marketed for postpartum use.
However, no study with the statistical strength to determine equivalent efficacy rates of the postpartum use of
the titanium clip versus partial salpingectomy, has been
done.
Given the physiological differences occurring in the fallopian tubes with pregnancy, such as oedema and hypertrophy, i.e. swelling and enlargement of the fallopian tubes,
results taken from the interval population should not be
directly extrapolated to postpartum women.
Given the paucity of data on postpartum efficacy of the
titanium clip, a randomised controlled trial comparing titanium clip use with partial salpingectomy was conducted.
Our objective was to compare efficacy over 24 months of
the titanium clip with the standard Pomeroy approach in
women undergoing postpartum sterilisation.
Methods
FHI 360, formerly known as Family Health International,
conducted a multi-centre, international trial to compare
the efficacy of titanium clip use with the Pomeroy technique in postpartum sterilisation. The primary outcome
was pregnancy rates over 24 months following sterilisation.
Data from this trial were reported to the Food and Drug
Administration as part of the device’s approval process in
the USA.
Studies were conducted at four independent centres in
Thailand, Taiwan, Panama and the Philippines. The centre
in Panama completed two studies during the period. Identical protocols were followed at all centres, and regular
monitoring and an audit of each centre were performed.
Approval by an Institutional Review Board was obtained
before study initiation at each site.
Contraceptive counselling was offered to women as part
of routine antenatal care. Women electing sterilisation,
were screened for study eligibility. Women were eligible for
study inclusion if they were legally able to consent to sterilisation, were 21 years of age or older, had a normal physical and pelvic examination, and were within 42 days
postpartum. Exclusion criteria were: legally incapable of
consenting, had severe, pre-existing systemic disease, profound anaemia (haematocrit < 30%), anticipated concurrent surgery other than curettage, limited accessibility to
centre for follow up, caesarean section for this pregnancy,
or request for sterilisation for reason other than voluntarily
limiting family size.
A total of 1400 women were enrolled between April 1984
and June 1989 (see Supplementary material, Figure S1). At
admission to the study, a medical history and physical
examination (including pelvic examination) were performed. After consent, directly before surgery, assignment
to titanium clip or Pomeroy technique was performed by
random allocation, using an off-site computer-generated
code that was unavailable to study staff. Although the surgeon could not be blinded to the procedure used, the
investigator in charge of follow up was. The woman was
admitted to the study by the investigator who performed
the surgery. All surgeries were performed following a vaginal delivery. Sterilisations occurred within 72 hours of
delivery. All procedures were performed by an infra-umbilical mini-laparotomy incision that was 1–2 cm in length.
Fallopian tubes were visually identified, and elevated to the
level of the incision with forceps. Tubal occlusion occurred
under direct visualisation. The Mark VI model of the Filshie clip was used for all women randomised to clip sterilisation. Pomeroy method was the standard of care, and so
was picked as the comparator. Sterilisation by Pomeroy
method was accomplished by identification of a 2-cm
length of tube. The tube was lifted with forceps, creating a
partial loop, which was then ligated with suture. The tubal
segment was then excised with scissors, and haemostasis
was assured at the base. Both types of surgery were performed under local, epidural or spinal anaesthesia, at the
surgeon’s discretion.
Women were asked to not use other forms of contraception, and were scheduled to return to clinic for follow-up
1, 6, 12 and 24 months following sterilisation. A complete
physical examination, including a pelvic examination, was
performed at each follow up. All suspected pregnancies
were evaluated with an examination and laboratory studies
as necessary. If women missed their clinic visit, they were
contacted by phone, and requested to return to the clinic.
If unable to do so, women were asked about menstrual
irregularities, pregnancy symptoms or any adverse symptoms.
Planned enrolment was 300 women per site. No formal
power calculation was included before study initiation. We
conducted a retrospective power calculation. Analysis was
based on intention to treat. The life-table method was used
to estimate the gross cumulative life-table pregnancy rate
by treatment group. One-month intervals were used for
life-table analyses. The intrauterine pregnancy survival
curves were compared using the log-rank test. For the purposes of tracking participants, personal contacts with participants completed at least 684 days since randomisation
were counted as 24-month visits. Women were terminated
from the study analysis for pregnancy, a serious adverse
reaction, or if the investigator determined that continuation was detrimental to the physical or mental health of

the woman. For life-table analyses of pregnancy, the estimated date of conception was used as the event date for
women who became pregnant. Date of last clinic, home or
phone/letter contact was used as the censoring date for
women who did not become pregnant.
All statistical analyses were performed using Statistical
Analysis System (SAS) software, version 5.18 (SAS Institute
Inc., Cary, NC, USA).
Results
Fourteen hundred women were enrolled in the study with
698 randomly assigned to receive the titanium clip and 702
to partial salpingectomy (see Supplementary material, Figure S1). Demographic variables, including obstetric and
contraceptive history, were comparable between groups at
baseline (see Supplementary material, Table S1). Mean age
of participants in the study was 30.1 years. Women in both
groups had a median of three live births. Contraceptive
history in the months before conception of the pregnancy
preceding sterilisation was similar in the study and control
groups, with most women in both groups relying on either
an oral contraceptive or no method. Type of follow up was
similar between groups. At 1 month, 92.3% of the titanium
clip group and 88.9% of the Pomeroy group were seen in
clinic, at home, or reached by phone. At 6 months, this
number had dropped to just over 70% for both groups.
Thirteen technical failures and random allocation errors
occurred. Nine pregnancies occurred in the titanium clip
group, and two in the partial salpingectomy group. All
pregnancies were noted to be intrauterine. None of the
pregnancies occurred in women with technical failures or
random allocation errors.
At 1 year, 43% of the titanium clip group could not be
reached by clinic or home visit, letter or phone call. In the
Pomeroy group, 41.9% were not reached at 1 year following sterilisation. By study end (24 months), 51% of the
titanium clip group and 51% of the Pomeroy group had
been lost to follow up.
Given the number of women present at the end of the
study (348 in each group), the power to detect a significant
difference in the pregnancy rates between the two treatTable 1. Gross life-table pregnancy rates by centre and sterilisation method

ment groups, of the size observed, with the two-sided logrank test (at a = 0.05) is 53%. Cumulative pregnancy rates
were significantly different between the two groups
(Table 1). Through 24 months, the estimate of the pregnancy probability for titanium clip group was 0.017, compared with 0.004 in the Pomeroy group (P = 0.04).
Discussion
This study represents the largest, randomised, controlled
trial that evaluates the efficacy of titanium clip use compared with partial salpingectomy in postpartum sterilisation. Although the pregnancy rates in both groups indicate
that either method provides substantial protection against
pregnancy, the data suggest that use of the titanium clip is
significantly less effective than partial salpingectomy at preventing pregnancy in the postpartum population.
Our study is not without significant limitations. This
trial was conducted over 20 years ago, when standards for
scientific research were considerably different. For example,
a power calculation is now a routine part of study design.
All of the study centres were in the developing world,
which may affect the generalisability of findings. Additionally, efforts are made to minimise loss to follow up rates to
below 5%, to reduce bias in modern trials. This is a serious
limitation in the data that we present. At 24 months, our
loss to follow-up rate was high, at just over 50% in both
groups. Although loss to follow up was evenly distributed
between both study and control group, this high risk of a
loss to follow up means that definitive conclusions should
not be drawn from these data.
Additional limitations include that follow up was limited
to 24 months following sterilisation. The CREST study provides evidence that risk of pregnancy persists for at least
10 years following sterilisation, especially among women
sterilised before 28 years of age. We were unable to stratify
analyses by nursing status, which affects fertility and may
limit generalisability. Importantly, these limitations would
probably result in an underestimate of the pregnancy rate
to be expected in the population over the participants’
reproductive life times. Regardless of the limitations in this
trial, it remains the only randomised trial, conducted to
date, with sufficient power to compare efficacy rates of the
titanium clip with partial salpingectomy in the postpartum
population. This data set, with all its flaws, represents the
highest level of evidence for use of the titanium clip postpartum, a practice for which the device is widely marketed,
and used.
Previous reports of the titanium clip have provided
mixed results among postpartum cases.10 Data from three
of the four centres in this trial have been published separately.8,11 Yan et al.8 reported the results for 200 women
cared for in Taiwan. The data for women sterilised by
both clip or partial salpingectomy were reported. Outcomes for women sterilised by clip only were reported for
women from the Philippines (n = 148) and Panama
(n = 297) in a subanalysis that focused on whether timing
of the surgery (before or after 48 hours postpartum)
affected complication rates.11 Neither of these studies had
adequate statistical power to compare efficacy. Graf et al.9
reported no pregnancies in a series of 282 women, but
their results might have been a result of better than average surgical skills, or simply due to chance. Whereas Oligbo et al.12 reported data on too small a population to
identify a statistically significant difference in pregnancy
rates, although the 1.5% pregnancy rate in his clip cases is
similar to the 1.7% cumulative rate in our data. Interestingly, Oligbo et al.’s series only included sterilisations at time
of caesarean delivery. This suggests that the failure rate
observed with the clip might be the result of a mechanism
other than misplacement of the device. Importantly, none of
these studies have been powered to evaluate efficacy.
Sterilisation is requested by women who are certain of
their decision to not have additional pregnancies. Women
requesting sterilisation should be offered a method with
known efficacy. To establish equivalence of the titanium
clip with partial salpingectomy in postpartum use, a welldesigned clinical trial is needed. The trial must include an
appropriate comparison group, adequate numbers to assess
statistical difference or non-inferiority, and a lower loss to
follow up than achieved in this study. In the absence of
such a trial, the equivalence of postpartum sterilisation
with the titanium clip compared with partial salpingectomy
is unknown.
