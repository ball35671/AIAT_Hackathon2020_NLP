Abstract
A prospective, randomized study of 365 women undergoing interval laparoscopic tubal sterilization in a residency training program was undertaken to compare method failures. Two occlusive techniques were compared, the spring-loaded clip (Hulka-Clemens) and the tubal ring (Falope Ring). Patients were randomized to either Falope Rings or Hulka-Clemens clips as the primary method. Demographic characteristics, educational level and operator experience were similar in the two groups. Follow-up at an average of 16 months (range, 6-24) revealed eight pregnancies (4.5%) in 176 women in the clip group and five pregnancies (2.6%) in the ring group. The Hulka-Clemens clip and the Falope Ring have similar incidences of method failure when employed by inexperienced operators. We question the usefulness of chromopertubation utilizing methylene blue dye to ensure proper placement of the occlusive device.
