Abstract
Objective: To determine if laparoscopic sterilization using the Filshie clip causes less postoperative pain as compared to the Falope ring
during the first 24 h after surgery.
Study design: Forty subjects were enrolled. Five milliliters of 0.5% bupivicaine was injected at each of the two incision sites and 5 mL
was dripped onto each fallopian tube. Subjects then received one Filshie clip and Falope ring on opposite fallopian tubes; the side of
occlusion was randomized. Subjects were questioned about pain prior to the first administration of analgesics postoperatively, 1 and 2 h after
surgery, at discharge, and 24 h after surgery.
Results: Forty subjects completed the study; 32 without major deviations from protocol. There was no significant difference in pain between
sides with the Filshie clip or Falope ring at any times evaluated.
Conclusion: There was no significant reduction in the postoperative pain associated with the Filshie clip as compared to the Falope ring
within 24 h after surgery. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction
In the United States, almost 39 million women aged
15–44 years are using a contraceptive method, of whom
28% are using female sterilization, making it the most
commonly used method [1]. Female sterilization, when not
performed in the postpartum period, is commonly an outpatient laparoscopic procedure. Options for tubal occlusion
via laparoscopy primarily include Hulka clips, Falope rings
and electrosurgical techniques. The relative efficacy of these
methods has been evaluated in long-term studies [2]. Filshie
clips are a relatively new option in the United States with
studies demonstrating efficacy equal to that of Falope rings
after 12 and 24 months [2–4].
Moderate to severe postoperative pain can increase hospital stay, delay return to normal activities of daily living
and decrease patient acceptance of the procedure. Operative
techniques that have been demonstrated to reduce postoperative pain during laparoscopic sterilization include injection of local anesthetic to the incision sites prior to initiation
of the surgery [5] and application of local anesthetic to the
fallopian tube prior to tubal banding [6–9].
Additionally, the tubal occlusion method may influence
postoperative pain. Comparative studies of tubal occlusion
procedures using clips and rings have suggested that perioperative pain may be less when clips are used [10–12]. A
randomized study of 79 women comparing Filshie clips and
Falope rings demonstrated that more women experienced
cramping abdominal pain on the evening of surgery in the
Falope ring group (34/36) compared to the Filshie clip
group (24/34), and the degree of pain on a visual analogue
scale (VAS) was higher in the Falope ring group (p  0.05)
[10]. However, these studies did not employ any local
anesthetic at the incision sites or on the fallopian tubes.
Thus, we performed this randomized, controlled study to
determine if the use of Filshie clips for laparoscopic sterilization results in less postoperative pain than Falope rings
for tubal occlusion when using local anesthetic dripped onto

the fallopian tubes prior to occlusion and injected into the
incision sites prior to skin incision. Each subject served as
her own control, receiving a Falope ring on one tube and a
Filshie clip on the other. Kaplan et al. [8], in a trial evaluating the use of topical bupivicaine on the fallopian tube
prior to Falope ring application, demonstrated that women
were able to discriminate pain on each side of their abdomen after tubal occlusion.
2. Materials and methods
Healthy women at least 21 years of age requesting laparoscopic tubal sterilization were recruited for a prospective,
randomized trial approved by the Institutional Review
Board of Magee-Womens Hospital of the University of
Pittsburgh Health System. For inclusion, subjects must have
had the ability to read and write, have telephone access for
follow-up evaluation and no other surgery planned concurrently with the tubal ligation.
Exclusion criteria included: (a) allergy to local anesthetic, (b) morbid obesity (100 kg), (c) more than two
previous laparotomies, (d) history of moderate to severe
endometriosis, (e) pelvic mass, (f) current chronic pelvic
pain, (g) use of pain medications (for any indication) regularly during the past 2 weeks, (h) history of depression,
anxiety or other major psychiatric disorder that has required
hospitalization or medication in the past year, (i) allergy or
intolerance of ibuprofen, acetaminophen, codeine, fentanyl
or oxycodone, (j) plan for open laparoscopic procedure, (k)
previous fallopian tube surgery and (l) intraoperative discovery of dense adhesions, endometriosis or pelvic mass
that require concurrent surgery.
After obtaining informed consent, a history was obtained
and subjects were asked to complete a VAS questionnaire
that documented their preoperative amount of pain on a line
ranging from 0 (no pain) to 100 mm (worst pain ever) [13].
The anesthetic technique was standardized in all patients.
Preoperative medication consisted of 50–100 g of Fentanyl and 1–2 mg of midazolam intravenously prior to entering the operating room. Induction of general anesthesia
included intravenous propofol 2 mg/kg and succinylcholine
1–1.5 mg/kg prior to endotracheal intubation; maintenance
of general anesthesia with nitrous oxide (50%) in oxygen,
isofluorane, 1–1.5 minimum alveolar concentration and intravenous fentanyl 3–5 g/kg titrated for hemodynamic
stability. To maintain adequate neuromuscular blockade,
rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg was used at the discretion of the
anesthesiologist and neostigmine 35–70 g/kg. Glycopyrolate 5–10 g/kg was given intravenously at the end of the
procedure for reversal of neuromuscular blockade.
The surgical protocol was also standardized. A Hulka
tenaculum was placed in the cervix for uterine manipulation. Between 3 and 5 min prior to the initial incision, the
skin at the umbilical incision site and suprapubic trocar site
were each infiltrated with 5 mL of 0.5% bupivicaine. A
Verres needle was inserted through a periumbilical incision
and pneumoperitoneum created with carbon dioxide. A
5-mm umbilical port and an 8-mm accessory port in the
midline suprapubically were placed. The participant was
randomized following laparoscopic examination of the abdomen only if the physician did not find severe adhesions,
a pelvic mass, endometriosis or any other condition that
required concurrent surgery.
Forty participants were randomized into four groups using a random number table; the group was assigned by
opening the next sequentially numbered sealed opaque envelope. A person unrelated to the study performed the randomization sequence and preparation of the envelopes. The
group assignment determined the device that would be applied to the first fallopian tube and the side that the first
occlusion method would be placed. Prior to tubal occlusion,
5 mL of 0.5% bupivicaine was dripped from the uterus to
the fimbria bilaterally through a cannula inserted through
the lower abdominal puncture site; the bupivicaine was
applied to the fallopian tubes in the same order that the tubal
occlusion methods were applied. The dosage of local anesthetic used on this protocol was our standard of care for
tubal occlusion and was initially studied by McKenzie et al.
[7] at our institution. The principal researchers (H.C.P.,
M.D.C.) usually applied the Filshie clip and the patient’s
primary physician often applied the Falope ring. After the
carbon dioxide gas was removed from the abdomen, the
skin incisions were closed using a 3-0 plain gut suture in a
subcuticular fashion. The subject was blinded to her randomization assignment.
After completion of the surgery, subjects were monitored
in the recovery room and step-down unit by registered
nurses and research staff who were also blinded to the
randomization assignment. Participants were asked if they
had nausea or abdominal pain before the first pain medication was given, 1 and 2 h after completion of the surgery,
and at discharge. If pain was present, the location of the
pain, and the amount of pain on each side was recorded by
the subject using a VAS. The subject’s verbal response
concerning presence, location, and amount of pain were
compared with their VAS. Two cutoff points of 5 mm and
5–10 mm were used in this analysis. For example, if a
patient reported equal pain on both sides and the difference
in VAS for the right and left side that was either 5 mm or
between 5–10 mm apart, the patient’s verbal report was felt
to be consistent with the VAS. The subjects received the
standardized pain medication options normally available in
the recovery room and step-down unit: fentanyl 25 g
intravenously, acetaminophen 325 mg/oxycodone 5 mg 1
tablet orally, ketorolac 30–60 mg intramuscular and ibuprofen 400–600 mg orally at the nurses’ discretion. Patients
who reported nausea or vomiting were offered ondansetron
4 mg i.v.; the presence of vomiting was recorded.
At the time of discharge, participants received a prescription for 20 tablets each of ibuprofen 600 mg and acetaminophen 325 mg/codeine 30 mg for pain. Subjects were given
146 H.C. Pymar et al. / Contraception 69 (2004) 145–150
a diary and asked to record postoperative pain medication
use and pain on a VAS at 24 h after surgery completion and
to mail this to the research office. The participant was also
telephoned by the research staff 24 h after surgery completion to determine if she was experiencing any pain, review
pain medication use, answer any questions and remind her
to mail in her diary.
The sample-size calculation was based upon the hypothesis that subjects would be 50% more likely to complain of
pain on the side with a Falope ring when compared to the
side with a Filshie clip at 1 h after surgery. Based on an
of 0.05 and a power of at least 80% with a two-tailed test
and each participant acting as her own control, 30 subjects
would be required. To allow for subjects who had major
protocol deviations (i.e., application of 2 clips or bands to a
single tube), 40 participants were randomized, with 10 in
each of the four groups. Statistical analyses were performed
using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test and Sign test where
appropriate with a p  0.05 considered significant.
3. Results
One-hundred-fifteen women were approached to participate in the study. Thirty-one women did not met
eligibility criteria and 36 women refused to participate.
Interestingly, of these latter 36 women, 16 did not wish to
participate in any study, 13 did not want the “newer”
Filshie clip, 6 wanted the same method to be used on both
fallopian tubes, and 1 was not given sufficient time before surgery to consider the study. Eight women were
enrolled in the study but not randomized because of
conversion to open laparoscopy (n  4), dense adhesions
(n  4) and discovery of an exclusion criterion in the
subject preoperatively. (One subject had two reasons for
not being randomized.) Forty women were therefore enrolled and randomized in the study. The characteristics of
the participants are presented in Table 1. The flow of
participants is described in Fig. 1.
Operative times averaged 34  11 min (range, 16 –74
min) with total time in the operating room averaging 59
 11 min (range, 40 –93 min). Of the 33 subjects who
received postoperative pain medication in hospital, 30
subjects were interviewed 42  135 min (range, 5–165
min) after leaving the operating room. The 40 subjects
were discharged 179  59 min (range, 96 –371 min) after
leaving the operating room.
There were deviations from protocol in the study that
have the potential to affect the results. Therefore, the
same 40 subjects were divided into three groups to determine if the protocol deviations affected the results.
The first group includes all 40 subjects. The second group
includes women who had no major deviations from protocol (n  32); and the third group had no protocol
deviations (n  23). The protocol deviations are summarized in Table 1. The characteristics of the women were
similar in all three groups (Table 1).
Postoperative pain medication was not used by 18% of
subjects. Oral narcotic medication (maximum two tablets) or ibuprofen (maximum 800 mg) was used by 35%
and 25% of subjects, respectively. Intravenous fentanyl
or intramuscular ketorolac (maximum 60 mg) were used
by 68% and 30% of subjects, respectively. The majority
of subjects required 100 g or less of fentanyl (maximum
200 g). There were two subjects who required more
than 100 g of fentanyl and large amounts of other pain
medications postoperatively. One subject required a total
of 200 g fentanyl, 800 mg ibuprofen, two oxycodone/
acetaminophen and 60 mg ketorolac and had more pain

(VAS difference  47 mm) 2 h postoperatively on the
side of the Falope ring. The second subject had 125 g
fentanyl, one oxycodone/acetaminophen, and 60 mg ketorolac and had more pain (VAS difference  58 mm)
at 1 and 2 h postoperatively on the side of the Falope
ring. However, her pain was felt to originate from her leg
and be related to intraoperative positioning.
Thirteen percent of patients reported no pain and had
a VAS 5 mm for both sides of their abdomen and 28%
of patients reported no pain verbally at 1 h after surgery.
The VAS results were similar to patient reports with
respect to side and equality of pain, and were most
similar when a discrepancy of 5–10 mm was used. The
number of subjects involved in the study did not permit
a subanalysis of the severity of pain with tubal occlusion
method.
Table 2 summarizes postoperative pain and its relationship to the Filshie clip in the first 24 h after surgery.
The 40 subjects are reviewed as a single group, and
divided into two further subsets based on protocol deviations. There was no significant difference or trend towards pain on a specific side at the time of first pain
medication, 1 h after surgery, discharge or 24 h after
surgery in any of the groups. In all groups, about 20 – 40
% of subjects experienced no pain and 10 –20% of subjects reported the same amount of pain on both sides over

the postoperative period. At 2 h after surgery completion,
there was a trend towards less pain on the side of the
Filshie clip noted in all groups (p  0.09, 0.11, and 0.22
in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively). At this time, about
10% of subjects had the same amount of pain on both
sides, 20% had worse pain on the side of the clip and 40%
had less pain on the side of the clip. There were no major
changes in the results whether all 40 or the subsets of
subjects were analyzed.
4. Discussion
This study was designed to determine if the amount of
postoperative pain could be further reduced by using Filshie
clips instead of Falope rings in women who received local
anesthetic at the trocar sites and over the fallopian tubes.
Follow-up was only continued for 24 h after surgery because a study comparing postoperative pain for 1 week after
female sterilization using either Filshie clips or Falope rings
found that the difference in postoperative pain was only
significant on the first day after surgery [10]. Our study
found no statistically significant difference in pain with the
use of Filshie clips compared with Falope rings when local
anesthetic was dripped over the fallopian tubes and injected
into the trocar sites prior to skin incision.
Subjects in our study were randomized to receive one
tubal occlusion method on each side so that they could
discriminate between the pain experienced on either side.
This study method reduced the total number of subjects
who were required to complete the study. In a study
performed by Kaplan et al. [8], subjects who were randomized to receive local anesthetic dripped over only one
of their fallopian tubes were able to determine which side
had been treated at 15 min, 1 h and 3–5 h after surgery.
This difference was not apparent at 24 h after surgery. In
the current study, 30 subjects were required to have 80%
power of detection if subjects who received the Filshie
clip would be 50% more likely to report pain on the
opposite side with a two-sided  of 0.05. There were 32
subjects who completed the study with no major errors.
However, 20 –30% of subjects had no pain at 1 and 2 h
after surgery completion and 10 –20% of subjects had the
same pain on both sides. At discharge, 35– 45% of subjects reported no pain.
Our study found no benefit in relation to decreasing
postoperative pain with the use of Filshie clips as compared
to Falope rings for tubal sterilization when local anesthetic
is applied to the fallopian tubes and injected into the trocar
sites prior to skin incision. The number of subjects did not
permit subanalysis of pain severity data.
