Objective: To compare the effectiveness and safety of the Filshie Clip and Tubal Ring systems when applied
via minilaparotomy and laparoscopy.
Design: Prospective, multicenter randomized controlled clinical trial, with postoperative evaluation by a
physician who was masked to the operative technique.
Setting: Healthy volunteers in a variety of hospital settings.
Patient(s): 2746 women (915 in the minilaparotomy study and 1831 in the laparoscopy study) who had
requested permanent surgical sterilization.
Intervention(s): Surgical tubal ligation, using either Filshie Clips or Tubal Rings. A physician other than the
surgeon evaluated the patients after the operation and again at 1, 6, and 12 months after surgery.
Main Outcome Measure(s): Pregnancy rates and safety-related events.
Result(s): During the 12 months after surgery, two women who received the Filshie Clip and two women
who received the Tubal Ring became pregnant, giving a 12-month life-table pregnancy probability of 1.7 per
1000 women in both groups. The Tubal Ring was more difficult to apply and had higher rates of tubal or
mesosalpingeal injuries at surgery. The Filshie Clip group had three cases of spontaneous clip expulsion
during the follow-up period.
Conclusion(s): Both the Filshie Clip and Tubal Ring are effective and safe for use in tubal occlusion. (Fertil

Key Words: Tubal occlusion devices, female sterilization, Filshie Clip, Tubal Ring
In 1996 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the Filshie Clip for tubal sterilization. The Filshie Clip and Tubal Ring differ substantially in their mode of action. The
Tubal Ring uses a special applicator to draw up
2 to 3 cm of the fallopian tube through a
stretched tubal ring (1). The Tubal Ring is then
released at the base of this loop, where it constricts tightly, cutting off the circulation to the
loop of fallopian tube. This causes tissue necrosis, followed by healing and fibrosis, leading to permanent tubal occlusion.
The Filshie Clip is a hinged device made of
titanium lined with silicone rubber (Figure 1).
The pressure exerted by the applicator closes
the clip around the fallopian tube and flattens
the curved upper jaw of the clip (2). This action
causes the upper jaw’s leading edge to extend
under the lip of the lower jaw, locking it into
position; this simultaneously traps and occludes the fallopian tube. With the use of a
Filshie Clip, only the part of the tube that is
compressed between the jaws of the clip—
about 4 mm—is damaged.
Published reports of failure rates with the
Filshie Clip and the Tubal Ring have varied
widely. This may reflect several factors, including the level of experience of the surgeon, the timing of the surgery (postpartum
or interval), the procedure used, the method
used to calculate the failure rates, and the
characteristics of the study populations (3–
8). To evaluate clinically the relative effectiveness and safety of the two methods, we
conducted two randomized controlled trials
of the Filshie Clip and Tubal Ring for cases
of interval sterilization. One study compared

laparotomy and the other when they were applied via
laparoscopy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Except for the type of surgical approach used (laparoscopy or minilaparotomy), the two study protocols were identical. The investigators/operators at each site were required
to be experienced surgeons.
The Family Health International (FHI) institutional review board approved the two protocols on June 1, 1984.
Each study center obtained approval to conduct the study
from its own institutional review board prior to the study’s
initiation. If a local institutional review board was not available, FHI’s board acted in lieu of a local board.
Women who were at least 21 years of age, legally able to
consent to sterilization, and had a normal physical and pelvic
examination were eligible to participate in the studies. We
did not enroll women if they had undergone a pregnancy
termination (either a delivery or abortion) within the past 42
days or if they had a preexisting clinically important abnormal condition such as diabetes, or renal or cardiac disease.
We excluded women who showed evidence of significant
pelvic pathologic conditions during the physical examination. We did not enroll women who were already pregnant or
women who were undergoing surgery other than a routine
curettage or IUD removal concurrent with the sterilization
procedure. For example, a woman was not eligible if she was
coming in for both an induced abortion and a sterilization
procedure. Nor did we enroll women who required sterilization for reasons other than voluntarily limiting the size of
her family.
After each participant signed an informed consent agreement, we randomized her to receive one of the two tubal
occlusion devices; this process was performed with the use
of a computer-generated randomization scheme stratified by
center. The woman’s group assignment was then revealed to
the surgeon by means of a sealed, sequentially numbered,
opaque envelope that was provided to the site at the study’s
initiation by FHI. In one study, which was carried out at five
centers, minilaparotomy was used to access and view the
fallopian tubes; in the other study, which was carried out at
seven centers, laparoscopy was used.
Prior to surgery, we took a medical history and conducted
a physical examination, including a pelvic examination, for
each woman. The surgeon recorded the type of anesthetic,
the surgical approach, and the reason for any change from
the assigned tubal occlusion method if applicable. Before
each woman was discharged, another physician, who was
not informed of the type of clip the woman had received,
assessed her for complications involving the surgical incision, pelvic pain and infection, and any other complications
or complaints.
Another physician (again, someone other than the surgeon) evaluated the participants at 1, 6, and 12 months after
their sterilization procedure. At selected sites, a 24-month
evaluation was planned for a subset of laparoscopy participants. At the early (1-month) follow-up visit, we evaluated
the women for complications associated with the surgical
procedure. At the later visits, we gave participants a physical
examination that included a pelvic examination and a clinical assessment of pelvic infection, and asked them questions
about their menstrual patterns (including intermenstrual
bleeding and pain). At all follow-up visits, we recorded
pregnancies, adverse events, abdominal or pelvic surgery, or
hospital admissions that had occurred since the surgery. If
clinical signs of pregnancy were suspected, we diagnosed
pregnancies with a urine pregnancy test, pelvic examination,
or other clinical evaluation. We did not routinely administer
a chemical pregnancy test at the 12- or 24-month visits.

A total of five centers from five countries were included
in the minilaparotomy trial and a total of seven centers from
five countries were included in the laparoscopy trial. Recruitment at most centers began in 1984 or 1985. Each center was
monitored per Food and Drug Administration guidelines,
and fieldwork was completed at most centers by 1989, and at
the last center in February 1990.
We defined three different subject populations before we
analyzed the individual trial results. The intent-to-treat population included all women who were assigned to receive the
Filshie Clip or the Tubal Ring. The treated population included all women who had at least one fallopian tube occluded with either a Filshie Clip or a Tubal Ring. When a
surgeon was unable to apply a Filshie Clip or Tubal Ring, he
used an alternate method, most commonly a partial salpingectomy. In two cases where the tubal ring was assigned no
sterilization procedure was performed on one tube because a
gross tubal pathologic condition was observed.
The efficacy population included all women who had both
fallopian tubes occluded with their assigned device except
those who had inclusion criteria violations that might interfere with the evaluation of effectiveness. Prior to initiation of
the primary analysis for either trial, we determined the
treated population to be the primary analysis population of
interest. The treated population is the focus of the individual
trial and pooled trial results presented here.
The effectiveness outcome of interest was pregnancy. We
calculated 12-month gross cumulative life-table pregnancy
probabilities by device type (combining the data collected in
the two studies), and by device type within each study (9).
We calculated standard errors using the method described by
Peto et al. (10). We used a log-rank test (a 5 0.05) to test for
differences in pregnancy curves by device group (11). We
also calculated gross cumulative life-table pregnancy probabilities through 24 months for the subgroup of participants
for whom extended follow-up observations were planned.
We excluded women from the effectiveness analysis for the
treated population who were later determined to have been
pregnant at the time their tubes were occluded (i.e., women
with luteal phase pregnancies).
Women who had a hysterectomy or other surgical intervention that would alter the risk of pregnancy were censored
from the life-table analysis. Participants who were not reported to be pregnant were censored from the life-table
analysis as of the date of their last visit. For pregnancies, the
date of conception was estimated using an algorithm based
on LMP and gestational age at termination or pregnancy
confirmation.
We calculated the percentage of surgical injuries and
primary incision complications, of infections, and of other
major complications at the early follow-up examination, by
sterilization device received, within strata defined by the
surgical approach. Within each surgical approach stratum,
we used Fisher’s exact test (a 5 0.05) to test for differences
between device groups in the number of women having each
type of event. We did not combine early safety results for the
two surgical approaches because of differences in the procedures. We summarized the reports of hospital readmission
and subsequent abdominal or pelvic surgery during the follow-up observation.
RESULTS
Unless otherwise stated, we present results for the treated
population. A total of 2746 women (915 in the minilaparotomy study and 1831 in the laparoscopy study) comprised
the intent-to-treat population (Figs. 2 and 3). Of these, we
assigned 1381 to the Filshie Clip and 1365 to the Tubal Ring.
We identified major violations of the inclusion/exclusion
criteria in 80 women (59 in the minilaparotomy study and 21
in the laparoscopy study). Of these, 30 had received the
Filshie Clip and 41 had received the Tubal Ring. Nine
women received neither study device. About one-third (27)
of the protocol violations were women whose last pregnancy

had been terminated less than 5 weeks before surgery.
Among the other protocol violations were 16 women with
preexisting pelvic pathologic conditions. The 37 other violations consisted of a variety of preexisting conditions. Table
1 shows the number of women by analysis population,
surgical approach, and country.
The women in both device groups had a mean age of 31
years (60.133 SE Filshie Clip and 60.129 SE Tubal Ring)
and had given birth to an overall average of 3.7 children.
About one-third of the women in both groups had been
pregnant within 6 months prior to sterilization and about
70% had used some form of contraceptive method in the 3
months prior to sterilization. About one-third of the women
in each group reported that they had not had menses during
the 3 months prior to enrollment. In both groups, the likelihood of amenorrhea at baseline was considerably higher
among women who had delivered within the 6 months
preceding study enrollment than among other women, presumably due to breast feeding. In both device groups fewer
than 10% reported previous intraperitoneal surgery and
2–3% reported past pelvic inflammatory disease.
Operators experienced some type of surgical difficulty
when operating on 7% of the women assigned to receive the
Filshie Clip and 8% of the women assigned to receive the
Tubal Ring in the intent-to-treat population. The four most
common surgical difficulties in the minilaparotomy study
were 1) visualizing the tube (20 Filshie Clip cases and 22
Tubal Ring cases); 2) grasping the tubes (9 Filshie Clip and
14 Tubal Ring); 3) entering the peritoneum (5 Filshie Clip
and 9 Tubal Ring); and 4) occluding the tubes (1 Filshie Clip
and 10 Tubal Ring). The four most common difficulties in

the laparoscopy study were 1) grasping the tubes (14 Filshie
Clip and 10 Tubal Ring); 2) entering the peritoneum (13
Filshie Clip and 6 Tubal Ring); 3) visualizing the tube (11
Filshie Clip and 6 Tubal Ring); and 4) occluding the tubes (8
Filshie Clip and 7 Tubal Ring).
Operators also reported details of the following less common difficulties. With the Tubal Ring an operator reported
transection of the tube, followed by application of a second
ring, and suturing of the mesosalpinx for hemostasis. Another operator reported application of a second ring to the
right tube due to difficulties with the first ring, along with
freeing up of adhesions to the ovary on the same side. With
the Filshie Clip, one operator reported that a Filshie Clip
broke during application. The pieces were removed from the
abdomen. Another operator reported a Filshie Clip that did
not close properly. It was replaced by another clip.
Operators failed to apply the assigned device to both
fallopian tubes in a total of 114 women. One center generated their own randomization schedule rather than using the
one provided by FHI, resulting in 68 women (34 per group)
receiving a device other than the device on the list FHI
generated. In a total of 37 cases (6 assigned to the Filshie
Clip and 31 assigned to the Tubal Ring), problems encountered during surgery prevented application of the assigned
device to both tubes. In 11 of these 37 cases, operators
reported adhesions as the problem preventing application of
the Tubal Ring. In five other cases where the Filshie Clip
was assigned and in four other cases where the Tubal Ring
was assigned, the operators applied a device other than the
assigned device. The operators provided no explanation for
the inconsistency, and these occurrences appeared to be due
to unintentional error.
Within each trial, the days until discharge did not vary by
device. In the laparoscopy study, 84% of the women were
discharged from the clinic on the day of surgery; whereas
63% of those in the minilaparotomy study were discharged
on the day of surgery.
The percentage of women returning for follow-up visits
was similar in the two groups. Over 90% of the women in
each device group returned for an early follow-up evaluation, and about 82% in each group completed a 12-month or
later visit. Among the subset of laparoscopy participants for
whom 24-month follow-up observation was planned (356
women in the Filshie Clip group and 347 women in the
Tubal Ring group), about 70% returned 684 or more days
after surgery.
Table 2 shows the 6- and 12-month cumulative life-table
pregnancy probabilities. There were two pregnancies in each
group. All four pregnancies were intrauterine, and all occurred among women in the laparoscopy study. Given the
final sample size and the observed discontinuation rate, the
study provided about 56% power to detect a difference
between annual pregnancy probabilities of 2 per 1000 and 8
per 1000 (12).
The numbers “at risk” in month 12 in Table 2 are slightly
less than the numbers of nonpregnant women in Figures 2
and 3 who made 12-month visits. These differences reflect
the use of slightly different definitions. A 12-month visit had
been defined as any visit between 318 and 442 days after
surgery. However, for the life-table analysis, women were at
risk for pregnancy at month 12 only if they had a visit on day
336 or later (i.e., the first day of the 12th month after
surgery).
In the subset of laparoscopy study participants who were
to be observed for 24 months, one additional pregnancy

occurred in the Filshie Clip group. The 12- and 24-month
cumulative pregnancy probabilities were 3.0 and 6.8 per
1000 women, respectively, for the Filshie Clip group and 3.0
and 3.0 for the Tubal Ring group (P 5 .58 for the comparison through 24 months).
Two additional pregnancies were reported after the end of
the 12-month follow-up period, among women in the 12-
month minilaparotomy study. Because their estimated dates
of conception were greater than 12 months since surgery,
they were not included in the life-table analysis. One pregnancy occurred in the Filshie Clip group and one in the Tubal
Ring group. The pregnancy in the Tubal Ring group was
ectopic.
Thus a total of six intrauterine pregnancies and one ectopic pregnancy were reported as poststerilization events in
the overall study population: four in the Filshie Clip group
and three (including the ectopic) in the Tubal Ring group.
Other pregnancies identified during the study which were not
considered sterilization failures included two ectopic pregnancies diagnosed in Filshie Group patients and one in a
Tubal Ring patient during the sterilization procedure itself.
In addition, nine luteal phase pregnancies, defined as conTABLE 3

ception occurring on or before the date of the sterilization
procedure, were diagnosed during the follow-up period (four
in the Filshie Clip group and five in the Tubal Ring group).
In the minilaparotomy study, the number of participants
with surgical injuries was similar for the two device groups
(Table 3). In the laparoscopy study, significantly more participants in the Tubal Ring group than in the Filshie Clip
group were reported to have surgical injuries (P 5 .01).
These were primarily tubal/mesosalpingeal injuries. Among
the nine “other” surgical injuries shown in Table 3, the only
notable event we observed was a cardiac arrest in a Filshie
Clip participant in the minilaparotomy study. This event was
ascribed to a vasovagal reaction. The patient was successfully resuscitated and was discharged 2 days later with no
further complications at long-term follow-up.
Within each study, the number of participants with primary incision complications, infections, and other complications at early follow-up was similar for the two device
groups (see Table 3).
During the scheduled 12- or 24-month follow-up period
after sterilization, 15 women in the Filshie Clip group and 20
women in the Tubal Ring group were hospitalized or underwent abdominal or pelvic surgery. Most were unrelated to
the sterilization procedure. There were no clinically significant differences between the two groups in the indications
for surgery or hospitalization.
Not included in the complications noted above were three
cases of Filshie Clip expulsions, two of which occurred after
the planned follow-up period. None of these women required
hospitalization, but one woman subsequently underwent a
diagnostic laparoscopy. This woman reported an asymptomatic expulsion of a Filshie clip from the rectum 18 months
after the sterilization procedure. She reported that she noticed the clip because she was in the habit of routinely
examining her stool in the toilet to look for parasites, a habit
that her mother had taught to her as a child. After the
expulsion, she underwent a diagnostic laparoscopy, and a
granulomatous adhesion was noted between the fallopian
tube and the descending colon. The woman was asymptomatic before and after the expulsion.
Another woman passed a Filshie Clip from the urethra 10
months after sterilization. Prior to the expulsion, she reported
lower abdominal pain and the desire to urinate. A third woman
had a Filshie Clip expelled from the vagina 34 months after the
sterilization procedure. Four and a half months prior to the
expulsion, she had undergone an abdominal hysterectomy. Following the hysterectomy, she had reported vaginal spotting and
pain on deep penetration during intercourse. She had been
examined for this complaint, and a small granulomatous area
was noted in the vaginal vault but not treated. She had no
symptoms following the expulsion.
In two other cases, surgeons reported that Filshie Clips
were displaced from the fallopian tube. These observations
were made during surgery for pelvic pain 6 years after
sterilization, and for chronic salpingitis 30 months after
sterilization, respectively. Two deaths occurred during the
study, both unrelated to the sterilization procedure: one was
due to an automobile accident, and the other due to a metastatic lymphoma.
DISCUSSION
Pregnancy Rates
Our estimate of the probability of pregnancy through the
first year after sterilization with the Tubal Ring (1.7 per
1000) was lower than the probability (5.9 per 1000 women)
observed in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) U.S. Collaborative Review of Sterilization (CREST)
(8). In our trials, the sterilization procedures were performed
by a small number of investigators selected because of their
surgical expertise and experience. In the CREST study,
resident physicians at teaching centers performed the sterilization procedures. The CREST study authors noted this
limitation regarding the generalizability of their results. Procedures done by resident physicians in a teaching program
have been shown to lead to higher pregnancy rates (4, 13).
Thus, the lower pregnancy rates we observed may be due to
the choice of more experienced investigators as operators.
Alternatively, differences in estimates of the risk of pregnancy may be due to differences in the underlying fecundity
of the study populations, incomplete follow-up observations,
or chance. The age distributions for the women in our study
and the 3329 women in the “silicone rubber band” group of
the CREST study were similar, and Tubal Ring recipients in
both of the studies included only women who desired interval sterilization. Our study did include a substantial proportion of women who were reported to be amenorrheic since
their previous delivery (presumably due to breastfeeding),
but comparable data were not provided for the CREST study.
It should be noted that the “spring clip” that was studied in the
CREST study was the Wolf Clip (also known as the Hulka
Clip), not the Filshie Clip. The Filshie Clip was not available in
the United States when the CREST study was conducted.
The number of women that we observed for 24 months
was small. At the time this study was conducted—well
before the CREST study results were reported—it was believed that most failures of surgical sterilization would become apparent within a year.
Our study was limited to interval sterilizations, rather
than postpartum sterilizations. Both of these devices may be
harder to use and/or less effective in the immediate postpartum period, although not all surgeons agree (14, 15).
Censoring participants as of the date of their last visit
would be expected to slightly underestimate the 12-month
pregnancy probabilities, because pregnancies that were not
yet clinically evident could have been missed. We performed
an analysis that censored women who had not become pregFERTILITY & STERILITYt 531
nant 60 days prior to their last visit. The impact on the point
estimate of the pregnancy probabilities was quite small. For
the Filshie Clip group the estimate went from 1.70 per 1000
women to 1.76 per 1000 women. For the Tubal Ring group
the estimate went from 1.68 per 1000 women to 1.72 per
1000 women.
On the other hand, women who become pregnant after
sterilization are likely to notify their physicians about such a
pregnancy, even after the formal end of a study. In fact, as
noted in the results, we received reports from investigators
about two such pregnancies.
Adverse Events
Serious adverse events related to sterilization with either
device were rare. The choice of surgical approach did not
appear to affect the overall efficacy or safety. Both of the
study devices have specific advantages and disadvantages.
The Filshie Clip destroys less of the fallopian tube than the
Tubal Ring, which may facilitate surgical reversal. The
Filshie Clip is associated more commonly with clip-related
adverse events, whereas the Tubal Ring leads to more frequent tubal or mesosalpingeal injuries.
Clip-related adverse events (expulsion, or abscess or
granuloma formation) are generally uncommon. The three
clip expulsions we report are an unusual number. No other
expulsions were reported among slightly over 4000 women
in other Filshie Clip trials conducted by FHI (16). However,
we have found published case reports of similar events: two
women had abscess formation involving Filshie Clip migration into the inguinal canal (17, 18); one woman had a pelvic
abscess associated with the Filshie Clip (19); one woman
had a spontaneous expulsion via the urinary bladder (20);
and one woman had a case of appendicitis attributed to
Filshie Clip migration (21). One of the expulsions reported
in this trial happened after a hysterectomy. Another author
has reported two similar events involving Wolf Clips, and
recommended that any tubal clips should be removed at the
time of hysterectomy (22).
The Wolf Clip, also known as the Hulka Clip, is similar
in size to the Filshie Clip. In the published literature regarding the Wolf Clip, there are reports of two other women who
had Wolf Clip expulsions and three women who had abscess
or granuloma formation (23–26). We have not found any
similar reports in the literature concerning spontaneous expulsion of Tubal Rings. However, given the much smaller
size of the Tubal Ring and the almost asymptomatic character of clip expulsions, it is possible that unnoticed Tubal
Ring expulsions may have occurred. We are unaware of any
reports of confirmed abscess formation involving the Tubal
Ring; however, adnexal masses in two women that resolved
following antibiotic treatment have been reported (26).
The finding of significantly more frequent tubal or mesosalpingeal injuries with the Tubal Ring is probably an
intrinsic characteristic of its mode of operation. The use of
the Tubal Ring requires the operator to draw a loop of about
2 cm of the fallopian tube into a metallic tube that is part of
the applicator. The Tubal Ring is then slipped over the base
of the loop and the fallopian tube is released. In a series of
2299 patients, Yoon and Poliakoff reported a 3.3% incidence
of tubal transections, and a 0.7% incidence of mesosalpingeal hematoma (1). More surgical difficulties in “occluding
the tube” (21 vs. 9) and more cases of inability to apply the
assigned device to both tubes (31 vs. 6) were reported with
the Tubal Ring than with the Filshie Clip. These differences
may reflect an intrinsic characteristic of the application of
the Tubal Ring, in that its application requires greater access
to and mobility of a longer piece of the fallopian tube
compared to the Filshie Clip.
Loss to Follow-Up Observation
Our pooled loss-to-follow-up rates at the 12-month visit
were 18.1% for the Filshie Clip group and 17.6% for the
Tubal Ring. In comparison, the CREST study, a prospective,
multicenter cohort study conducted in the United States, had
a loss to follow-up of only 11% at the 1-year interview (8).
The effect of the loss to follow-up on our conclusions
depends on two factors: 1) whether loss to follow-up is
correlated with the risk of pregnancy, and 2) whether loss to
follow-up was different for one device versus the other. We
cannot estimate the risk of pregnancy in the women who
were lost to follow-up observation, but we did compare the
characteristics of those women by treatment group (data not
shown). We found that the women lost to follow-up observation in both groups were similar. This suggests that, although our estimate of the absolute pregnancy rates could be
too high or too low, our comparison of the two devices’
efficacy should be fair and unbiased.
Conclusion
Though they have slightly different clinical profiles, both
the Filshie Clip and Tubal Ring are effective and safe for use
in tubal occlusion.
