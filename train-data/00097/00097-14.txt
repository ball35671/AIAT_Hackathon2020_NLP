ABSTRACT
Three methods of tubal sterilisation, viz. laparoscopy, culdoscopy and
minilaparotomy, were evaluated in a trial involving 300 voluntary acceptors
at the University Hospital in Medan, Indonesia. Equal numbers of women were
randomly assigned to the three surgical groups. The results showed little
differences among patients in the three groups for age, number of living
children, contraceptive and abortion histories and pre-existing medical
conditions. As expected, average surgical time for minilaparotomy was
significantly Ngher than the times reported for the endoscopic techniques.
Minilaparotomy also produced the highest incidence of operative
complications while culdoscopy accounted for the highest rate of
hospitalisation following operation. Four-year follow-up of the patients
revealed only one case of pregnancy in the culdoscopy group, three years
after tubectomy.

INTRODUCTION
In the denselgpopulated city of Medan on the Indonesian island of
Sumatra, the demand for sterilisation as a means for permanent control of
fertility is high. To cope with this demand, there was a need to select,
from amongst the variety of female sterilisation procedures, one that is
simple and inexpensive to perform such that it can be carried out as an
outpatient procedure and yet highly effective such that the risk of
post-operative pregnancy is minimal. From the patient's viewpoint, the
selected procedure should also be one that has minimal contra-indications
and discomfort during and after operation so as to allow for her rapid
resumption of normal activities.
Over the years, several tubal occlusion techniques have been developed
and tried in fertility control centres all wer the world. Among these
techniques are the culdoscopic and laparoscopic methods. The present paper
reports the results of a study, carried out in Medan, to evaluate the
efficacy of three tubal sterilisation procedures: (a) culdoscopic ligation,
(b) laparoscopic tubal cautery and (c) minilaparotomy.
PATIENTS AND METRODS
This study was initiated on December 1, 1977 and was conducted wet a
period of two years. A total of 300 women patients underwent elective
sterilisation performed at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology of
the University of North Sumatra in Medan, Indonesia. The patients were
assigned to the three surgical groups by random allocation such that 100
women were eterilised by culdoscopic tubal occlusion using a modified
Pomeroy technique, another 100 women were sterilised by laparoscopic tubal
cauterisation, while the remaining 100 women had ligation6 performed through
a minilaparotomy incision. All surgical procedures were performed by three
senior gynaecologists, each with at least eight years of experience with
tubal sterilisation techniques. Every surgeon performed all three
procedures.
Patient Selection
The study subjects were all women between the sges of lS-40 who had
terminated their last pregnancies at least six weeks prior to sterilisation.
A complete medical history followed by a thorough preoperative examination,
including a chest X-ray, were given to each prospective subject. Those
found to have histories of heart, pulmonary, endocrine or other systemic
illness or were diagnosed as having these problems were excluded from the
study. Those with unsatisfactory results of bimanual pelvic examinations
such as clinically obvious vulva-vaginal infection or acute cervicitis were
also excluded.
Preparation of Patients
Patients were asked to observe a sir to eight-hour fast prior to
surgery. On the morning of the day of operation, they ware instructed to
empty their bowels after which premeditation of 50-100 mg of pethidin were
administered intramuscularly about 30 minutes before operation.

CONTRACEPTION
Anaesthesia
Patients belonging to all three of the surgical groups were each given
10 mg Valium intravenously followed by local anaesthesia of 2% Novocain at
the commencement of operation.
Operative techniques
The laparoscopic procedure was carried out with an one-hole incision.
The uterine tubes were cauterized at two sites using a procedure as
described by Wheeless(1). In the case of culdoscopic procedure, the cul-desac was punctured with the patient in the knee-chest position and tubectomy
was subsequently performed using a modified Pomeroy technique (&figure
suture) as described by Najar(2). In minilaparotomy, a 2-l/2 cm transverse
suprapubic incision was first performed followed by the modified Pomeroy
method of tubectomy.
Post-operative care and follow-up
After operation, the patients were observed for about 4-8 hours and
then discharged when their vital signs were normal and no signs of bleeding
were noticed. Oral antibiotics were prescribed for prevention of infection
and oral analgesic for relief of pain. Patients were advised to abstain
from sexual intercourse for three weeks, especially for the group on which
culdoscopy was performed. Post-operative follow-up was carried out at
intervals of 1 week, 1 month, 3 months and 1 year after operation.
RESULTS
Of the 300 women who were originally recruited for the study, data from
295 were eventually processed and analysed, using a cross-tabulation
computer program written by one of us (LKC) for a Hewlett-Packard model 1000
minicomputer at Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology of the National
University of Singapore. Five patients (2 in the laparoscopy group and 3 in
the minilaparotomy group) were dropped from the study because of incomplete
information from these cases.
Patient Characteristics
Table I gives the age distribution of women for each of the three
sterilisation procedures. Apart from a relatively lower proportion of
younger (25-29 years) women for the culdoscopic group, the three age
distributions appeared to be quite homogeneous. The mean ages of women in
the culdoscopic and laparoscopic groups were 34.6 and 34.3, respectively,
while that of women in the minilaparotomy group was slightly lower at 33.6
years. All were currently married at the time of the study with the
majority (85-87%) having at least three living children (Table I).
Contraceptive History
In all three groups, the majority of the women (76~80%) claimed that
they had not used any contraceptive method prior to requesting for
sterilisation. Some 9 to 11% of them were previously using the IUCD while
an almost equal number were previously using oral contraceptives. Only a
small proportion of the women (l-22) were using such methods as the condom,
spermicides and other scientific or traditional methods of contraception.

Abortion History
Some 69% of the women in the laparoscopic group and 66% in the
minilaparotomy group had no previous history of abortion. The corresponding
percentage for the culdoscopic group was slightly lower at 55%. As many as
9 percent of the patients in the culdoscopic group had between three to four
abortions while those in the laparoscopic and laparotomy groups having this
history of Ngh abortions accounted for only 3.1% and 6.2X, respectively
(Table I).
Pre-existing Medical Conditions
At least 84% of the women in all three groups had no pre-existing
medical problems. Apart from a rather Ngh proportion (15%) of women in the
culdoscopic group who had prior pelvic surgery, the other conditions
reported included pelvic infection (2% for laparoscopic group and 3.1% for
minilaparotomy group) and abnormal pelvic findings such as adhesions,
fibroid and prolapse (1 case for each condition).
Difficulties and Complications During Surgery
Slight to noderate abdominal pains were generally experienced by the
patients in all three surgical procedures. Minor abdominal discomfort and
distension alone were categorised, in our study, as slight abdominal pain
whereas the experience of abdominal pain and distension together with
cephalagia and nausea were treated as moderate pain. If moderate abdominal
pain were to he defined as operative morbidity, then its rates for the three
surgical procedures were 54.6% for minilaparotomy, 37.0% for laparoscopy and
15.3% for culdoscopy (Table II).
No anaesthetic complications were reported. Other studies have shown
that these procedures, particularly culdoscopy and laparoscopy, can be
safely performed under local anaesthesia and that there are generally no
complications associated with the use of these surgical procedures (3).
Surgical Time and Hospitalisation
Surgical time was recorded as the period from incision through closure.
The distribution of surgical times by the three procedures are given in
Table III. The mean surgical time for culdoscopy was 9.1 minutes (with an
S.D. of 3.3 minutes) while that for laparoscopy was 9.7 minutes (with an
S.D. of 3.6 minutes). The minilaparotomy procedure was much longer than the
other two procedures, requiring an average surgical time of 22.1 minutes
(with an S.D. of 8.0 minutes). The difference in average surgical time
between the minilaparotomy procedure and each of the other two endoscopic
procedures was shown to statistically significant (P<O.OOl). The difference
was to be expected as minilaparotomy required layer by layer incision. The
difference in surgical time between laparoscopy and culdoscopy was shown to
be not statistically significant at the 5% level.
The majority of the study subjects (at least 92%) were discharged on
the same day as the operation. The duration of hospital stay varied from 4
to 8 hours with a mean of 5.5 hours for the laparoscopy group, 6.2 hours for
the culdoscopy group and 6.0 hours for the minilaparotomy group. All but
two of the patients were able to resume their full work or household
activities by the end of the third week following sterilisation.

CONTRACEPTION
Eight percent of the women in the culdoscopy group were hospitalised because
of operative complications compared with 1% for the laparoscopy group and
3.1% for the minilaparotomy group (Table IV). Pelvic adhesions from previous
pelvic infection or operation were the main causes of difficulties.
Post-operative Complications
There were only six reported cases of post-operative complications for
all three groups (Table IV). Of the six, four ware due to fever (38oC or
higher) occurring 24 hours after surgery. In all four cases, treatments
with antibiotics were given. Of the remaining two cases, one was a woman in
the culdoscopy group who developed pelvic abscess which could not be
controlled and had to be given abdominal hysterectomy. The other patient,
who belonged to the laparoscopy group, had to be given a blood transfusion
because of excessive blood loss during the operation.
Post-operative Pregnancy
No failure of operative technique was reported in this study. Further
4-year follow-up showed that only one patient in the culdoscopy group had a
pregnancy after tubectomy and delivered vaginally a healthy baby through
vacuum extraction.
DISCUSSION
Tubectomy is a relatively safe surgical procedure when performed by a
trained and skilful operator. Skill greatly influences operating time and
minimises the risks of complications arising from the procedure. Tubectomy
complications can occur during and after operation. The former category
includes such complications as anaesthetic problems, injury to the uterus,
bowel and bladder and haemorrhage. Post-operative complications include
abdominal, pelvic and back pain, haemorrhage and pelvic inflammation.
Although rare, these complications can produce adverse effects and can
affect patient compliance to permanent contraception.
Other evaluation studies of sterilisation procedures previously carried
out in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology of the University of
North Sumatra in Medan confirmed that complications arising from tubectomy
were few. For example, Tarihoran(4) reported that out of 850 laparoscopic
sterilisations by cautery, carried out during the period from 1974 through
1977, there were only 9 (1.1%) cases of uterine perforation, 7 (0.8%) cases
of haemorrhage, 6 (0.7%) cases of burnt serosa of the bowel and only 1
(0.1%) case of abdominal skin bum occurring during operation.
Postoperative complications, for the same period, consisted of 29 (3.4%)
cases of slight abdominal pain, 1 (0.1%) case of pelvic infection, 2 (0.2%)
cases of wound bleeding and 2 (0.2%) cases of prolapse of the omentum
outside the skin.

CONTRACEPTION
In cur study, the patients (more precisely, the voluntary acceptors)
were randanly allocated into the three surgical groups. As a result, we
found the patients in the three groups to be quite hancgeneoua with respect
to age, number of living children, contraceptive and abortion histories.
The distribution of patients auong the three groups with respect to
pre-existi% medical conditions were slso quite similar apart fran a
slightly higher percentage of patients in the culdosoopy group who had had
pelvic surgery. If we choose the experience of moderate to severe abdaninal
pain as our operational definition of operative morbidity, then the
incidence was highest for minilaparotany (55%) and lcwer for the endoacopic
procedures (37% for laparoscopy and 15% for culdoscopy). Studies done
elsewhere(5) have shown that cauplication rates for abdaninal and vsginal
tubal ligation ranged fraz 6.0% to 27.5%, whereas cauplication rates fran
endoscopic techniques ranged frau 0.3% to 5.3%. In terms of surgical time,
minilaparotany required, on the merage, a significantly loqer duration to
perform than the endoscopic procedures because the technique requires more
manipulation. Eight percent of the wanen in the culdoscopy group required
hospitalisation because of operative canplications canpared with 1% for the
laparoscopy group and 3.1% for the minilaparotany group. Koetsawang et al.
(31,
--
in their canparative study between laparoscopy and culdoscopy, had
also reported a higher incidence of post-operative pelvic pain and infection
following culdoscopy. In terms of post-operative pregnancy risks, ox! study
showed that after a four-year follow-up only one patient in the culdoscopy
group becsme prqnant after three years post-tubectaoy.
In conclusion, we felt that in the evaluation of the three
sterilisation pocedures we had used in mr study, laparoscopy appears to
have a slight edge cfer the other two procedures when we take into
consideration mob factors as surgical time, cauplaints and canplications
during and after operation and risk of post-operative pregnancy.
