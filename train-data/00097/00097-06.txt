Abstract
Objective: The aim of this study was to determine whether women experience significant luteal phase hormonal changes following interval
tubal sterilization.
Design: This is a partly randomized, prospective clinical study.
Setting: This study involved healthy volunteers in an academic research environment.
Patients: This study involved 118 fertile women seeking tubal sterilization and 57 fertile controls with at least three normal cyclic menstrual
periods before entry into the study.
Interventions: The patients were randomized to bipolar cautery or Hulka clip as sterilization methods. Barrier contraception or abstinence
was used by controls.
Main Outcome Measures: The main outcome measures are serum estradiol and progesterone levels and urinary estradiol and pregnanediol
levels obtained during the luteal phase before, 1 year and 2 years after sterilization.
Results: The women randomized to the bipolar cautery group had higher midluteal progesterone levels measured between Days 5 and 11
postovulation (15.5 ng/mL before sterilization, 14.5 ng/mL at 1 year and 14.5 ng/mL at 2 years) than did the other two groups. The clip group
had progesterone levels of 14.1, 12.0 and 12.5 ng/mL at baseline, 1 year and 2 years, respectively, and the control group had levels of 12.0,
11.9 and 11.3 ng/mL for the same periods. Serum estradiol and progesterone and urinary pregnanediol and estradiol were not significantly
changed over the 2-year period, nor were there significant differences between the two groups.
Conclusions: There were no significant hormonal changes in sterilized women over a period of 2 years when compared with their baseline
levels or when compared with unsterilized age-matched controls.

1. Introduction
In the United States, over 600,000 women have a tubal
sterilization each year and 10 million women in the
reproductive ages have been sterilized for contraceptive
purposes. The number worldwide is estimated to be
140 million. Forty-two percent of U.S. women between 30
and 44 years of age have undergone a tubal sterilization [1].
Since Williams et al [2] in 1951 reported that sterilized
women had more menstrual abnormalities than other
gynecologic or obstetric patients, numerous studies have
addressed this issue. Some looked at menstrual history
alone; others, at the incidence of surgery after sterilization;
and still others, at hormonal evidence of menstrual changes.
A literature review concluded that no one study adequately
looked at all the variables [3]. A recent large-scale study
concluded that sterilized women were no more likely to

have menstrual abnormalities than women who had not
undergone sterilization [4].
This prospective longitudinal study was undertaken
with nonsterilized fertile women as controls in an attempt
to look at all the relevant parameters affecting sterilized
women as they age and to correlate these with hormone
levels and menstrual changes. This analysis focuses on the
hormonal levels in women before and during the 2 years
after a tubal sterilization. We compared bipolar cautery and
the Hulka clip to determine if there are more changes in
ovarian hormone production after using a technique that
destroys a large segment of the fallopian tube and
mesosalpinx (bipolar cautery) than after a sterilization
technique that destroys only a small section of the tube
(Hulka clip).
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Patients
Women were recruited into this study from the Family
Planning Clinic at the State University of New York–
Downstate Medical Center. One hundred eighteen women
who sought voluntary tubal sterilization and 57 controls
were enrolled. Institutional review board approval was
obtained, and the women signed an informed consent.
Eligibility criteria included age between 21 and 35 years,
at least one prior pregnancy and a history of regular cyclic
menses with an interval between 23 and 38 days and a
moderate flow lasting between 2 and 7 days. If a woman had
recently completed a pregnancy, stopped breast-feeding or
used an oral contraceptive or an intrauterine device, she was
required to wait at least 3 months and until she had at least
three regular menstrual periods prior to enrollment in the
study. At the initial history and physical examination, she
had to have no evidence of endocrine or gynecologic
pathology that might adversely affect her menstrual pattern.
In addition, control participants needing contraception had
to use barrier methods or practice fertility awareness during
the study.
2.2. Study design
Subjects answered standardized questions at enrollment
regarding medical, surgical, obstetric and contraceptive
history; socioeconomic factors; use of controlled and illicit
substances and sexual practices. They also completed a life
stress instrument [5] and the Moos menstrual distress
questionnaire [6]. A physical examination, including thyroid, breast and pelvic examinations, was performed at the
time of enrollment. During the month after enrollment,
subjects measured their basal body temperature (BBT) and
collected first-voided morning urine specimens daily. The
urines were kept in the patient’s freezer, collected by the
study staff and stored at 208C until being assayed for
pregnanediol and estradiol. They also underwent phlebotomy every 3 to 4 days during the luteal phase of that
menstrual cycle. The bloods were centrifuged, and the
serum was stored at 208C until being assayed for
progesterone and estradiol. Sterilizations took place after
completion of the baseline study cycle. We used simple
randomization with a 1:1 allocation ratio to assign the 118
women seeking sterilization either to the Hulka clip (n = 62)
or to the bipolar cautery (n =56) technique. Randomization
took place after completion of consent and all other
enrollment procedures. A single clinician (GPG) performed
all examinations and all tubal sterilizations.
Subjects completed questionnaires and underwent a
physical examination annually for 2 years. In addition,
sterilized patients completed a questionnaire about reactions
to the sterilization and feelings of regret. Subjects also
repeated the BBT measurements, urine collection and blood
collection for one additional menstrual cycle at 1 year and
2 years after study entry. Blood collection stopped after Year
2, but urine specimens were collected again 3 years after
entry. Of the 175 women enrolled in this study, 102 (58.6%)
were followed for 2 years or longer. Women in the control
group who became pregnant resumed follow-up after
pregnancy termination, followed by three spontaneous
cyclic menstrual periods.
In all study cycles, both at baseline and during follow-up,
we assigned a cycle day to each urine and blood specimen
by using menstrual diaries and BBT charts. A single author
(GPG) made all assignments of menstrual cycle day.
2.3. Assay methods
Pregnanediol 3-a glucuronide and estradiol glucuronide
were measured by radioimmunoassay in unextracted urine.
Urine samples were thawed and centrifuged at 1000g for
10 min at 88C. The supernatant was then diluted 1:1000 for
pregnanediol 3-a glucuronide and 1:10 for estradiol
glucuronide in 0.1 M, pH 7 phosphate buffered saline with
0.1% gelatin prior to assay. Tritiated [3
H]-pregnanediol 3-a
glucuronide and estradiol glucuronide and antisera were
added, and the samples were successively incubated at 378C
for 30 min. Free and antibody-bound steroid conjugates
were separated by the addition of dextran-coated charcoal.
Samples were then centrifuged, and the supernatant was
counted. All samples were analyzed in duplicate. Pregnanediol 3-a glucuronide, estradiol glucuronide, antisera to
pregnanediol 3-a glucuronide and estradiol glucuronide and
tritiated [3
H]-pregnanediol 3-a glucuronide and estradiol
glucuronide were obtained from Samarajeewa (Courtauld
Institute of Biochemistry, Middlesex Hospital Medical
School, London, UK). Assay sensitivity for pregnanediol
3-a glucuronide was 15 pg/100 AL; intra-assay coefficient
of variation was 6.6% with an interassay coefficient of
variation of 15.7%. Assay sensitivity for estradiol glucuronide was 7.5 pg/100 AL, intra-assay coefficient of variation
was 5.3% and interassay was 13.2%. Urinary creatinine
levels were originally measured, but we found that the use
of creatinine as a means of adjusting urinary steroid values
was not valid [7].

All specimens were retained for laboratory analysis until
specimen collection was completed. All specimens from a
single subject were included in the same run. In order to
avoid the introduction of drift or other bias in the hormonal
measurements, equal numbers of controls and subjects in
both sterilization groups were included in each assay run.
2.4. Statistical analysis
The goal of the analysis was to compare each hormone
level (serum estradiol and progesterone, pregnanediol 3-a
glucuronide and estradiol glucuronide) between the study
groups (clip, cautery, control) over time (baseline, Year 1,
Year 2). Linear regression analyses were carried out using
the log-transformed hormone values. These analyses also
included age, weight, age at menarche and smoking (yes or
no) as covariates [8]. Each subject had multiple hormone
measurements both during a single menstrual cycle as well
as during cycles one or more years apart. These repeated
measures within the study subjects are not completely
independent; therefore, several statistical models were fitted
to the data that incorporated varying assumptions about the
correlations of each hormone level within individual
subjects. The p values presented here are from the spatial
covariance model, which assumes partial covariance of
hormone levels from adjacent study days. Alternative
models that assumed greater or lesser autocorrelations were
also evaluated and gave similar results (data not shown) [9].
3. Results
A total of 175 women were enrolled in this study, 118 of
whom were seeking voluntary tubal sterilization and 57 of
whom were controls. One woman was dropped from the
study at the time of surgery because significant tubal
abnormalities precluded performing the type of sterilization
to which she had been randomly assigned. The characteristics of the participants are summarized in Table 1. The two
groups were similar in age, menstrual cycle length, age at
menarche and weight. The controls were more likely to
work outside the home, to be white, to have more education
and to have a higher household income. The controls, who
were required to use barrier contraception during the study,
most often chose the diaphragm. The women seeking
sterilization had higher parity, were more likely to smoke
and were more likely to be Hispanic. These differences
between the controls and the women seeking sterilization
were unrelated to their hormone levels. Participants were
ovulatory for nearly all study cycles, and their general
hormonal pattern was normal [8].
There were no differences in baseline characteristics
between the women who participated throughout all 3 years
of the study and those who withdrew or were lost to followup (data not shown).
Urinary pregnanediol 3-a glucuronide was evaluated
from postovulation Days 5 to 11; the mean for each group
was obtained (Table 2). There were no significant differences between the clip, the cautery or the control groups nor
between the baseline values and the values in subsequent
years. The p value from the spatial covariance model was
0.29. Similar results were obtained when pregnanediol 3-a

glucuronide values were evaluated for the area under the
curve or for peak values (data not shown).
Serum progesterone levels during the postovulatory Day
5 through 11 interval were significantly higher in the cautery
group at baseline than they were in either the clip group or
the controls (Table 3). This elevated level persisted through
the years of the study and continued to be significantly
higher than the other two groups. There were, however, no
significant changes in progesterone level over time in this
group or in the other two groups. The p value of .04 reflects
the higher progesterone level in the cautery group. In all
groups, there was a slight decrease in progesterone values
over time, but this was not statistically significant.
There were no significant changes in midluteal serum
estradiol or urinary estradiol glucuronide levels (Tables 4
and 5) either between groups or over time, with p values of
.82 for the serum estradiol and .96 for the urinary estrogen
metabolite. Results were similar for analyses limited to
women who participated throughout all cycles of the study
(data not shown).
4. Discussion
This report provides the results of a comprehensive and
controlled study of the effects of tubal sterilization on
ovarian hormone levels in women during early to middle
reproductive years. Women who sought sterilization were
studied prior to sterilization and were randomly assigned to
one of two sterilization types (Hulka clip or bipolar cautery).
They were then followed for 2 years after sterilization along
with a group of controls who were of similar age, weight and
menstrual regularity. Our findings confirm reports of smaller
studies that sterilization does not cause major changes in
ovarian hormones [10–14]. This was true whether the
operator used the clip technique, which has minimal effect
on tubal and vascular architecture, or used bipolar cautery,
with its demonstrably greater destruction of the tube and
mesosalpinx and possibly of ovarian blood supply.
The strengths of this investigation are its large size, the
randomization of women to two different sterilization
techniques and the prospective longitudinal collection of
urine and blood for the hormonal assays.
There are limitations to this study. We did not collect
follicular phase estradiol levels; these might have allowed a
more complete analysis of the possibility of hormone
changes in sterilized women. Specifically, this would have
identified if an adequate follicular phase preceded the
demonstrably adequate luteal phase. Even more helpful
would have been a longer follow-up period. Data from the
Walnut Creek Contraceptive Drug Study showed significant
menstrual aberrations only when following women for
longer than 2 years after sterilization [15].
Luteal phase hormone levels were the focus of this
analysis. Urine for estradiol and pregnanediol determinations was obtained daily and blood for serum progesterone
levels was obtained every third day during the luteal phase
in all women at enrollment and every year for 2 years. No
statistically significant differences in these levels within and
between groups were seen. There were also no significant
changes in urinary or serum estradiol levels in the luteal
phase. The higher serum progesterone level in the cautery
group that persisted over the course of the study was present
at baseline and thus appears to be due to a chance imbalance
between the groups.
Study participants had not been on oral contraceptives,
had not used an intrauterine device, had not been pregnant
within 3 months of enrollment and had had at least three
normal cyclic menstrual periods prior to the performance of
the sterilization. Therefore, normal menstrual cycle description was based on current records rather than on distant
memory. The cycle immediately preceding the sterilization
was tracked by BBTs, urinary and blood hormone measures,
a day-by-day description of the amount and duration of flow
and the presence or absence of dysmenorrhea.
Analyses from the Collaborative Review of Sterilization
[16] suggest that the women who had menstrual problems
prior to sterilization were most likely to have subsequent
menstrual complaints. These complaints and problems led to
further gynecological surgery, including hysterectomy. We
excluded women with irregular cycles or significant
menstrual complaints from this study. This study confirms
that women with normal cycles prior to sterilization will
maintain normal ovarian function, as defined by luteal phase
hormone levels, during the 2 years following sterilization.
