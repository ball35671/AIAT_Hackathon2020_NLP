Minilaparotomy or laparoscopy for sterilization:
A multicenter, multinational randomized study
World Health Organization, Task Force on Female Sterilization, Special Programme
of Research, Development and Research Training in Human Reproduction*
A multicenter, multinational randomized comparison of minilaparotomy and modified Pomeroy tubal
ligation and laparoscopy with tubal electrocoagulation for interval sterilization of women was
conducted in eight centers. Results were analyzed for 791 women in the minilaparotomy group and
819 in the laparoscopy group. Major complications occurred in 1.5% of women in the former group
and 0.9% in the latter. Technical problems or major anesthetic complications occurred in 0.5% of
subjects undergoing minilaparotomy and 0.9% of subjects undergoing laparoscopy. For minor
complications the figures were 11.8% and 8.0%, respectively, while for minor complaints the rates
were 34.1% and 26.5%, respectively. It is concluded that the two methods of approach to the
fallopian tubes are similar in their complication rates. Because of its more simple requirements in
terms of equipment and training, minilaparotomy is the preferred approach for services provided
away from a major institution. (AM. J. OBSTET. GYNECOL. 143:645, 1982.)
FEMALE STERILIZATION is now such an established
and accepted component of many national family planning programs that its existence requires no further
justification. The provision of adequate services to ensure that all who wish to be sterilized have access to the
safest and most effective procedure presents different
problems for urban as opposed to rural populations in
developing countries. Nature and location of operating
and recovery facilities, length of stay and availability of
medical care after operation, the level of skill of the
surgeon, and the nature of the procedure itself are all
factors, among many others, which must be considered.
This communication is concerned with the choice of
surgical procedure for interval female sterilization,
with the recognition that such choice is perhaps the
central factor in determining the way in which interval
sterilization services might be organized.
By the mid-1970s, when the study described here
was formulated, the surgical procedures for approaching the fallopian tube had become well defined and the

choices lay, as they still do, between minilaparotomy,
laparoscopy, and culdoscopy or colpotomy, with the
first two being the most favored. The arguments for
and against laparoscopy or minilaparotomy have been
stated many times. In summary, laparoscopy requires
surgeons trained in the method and expensive and
relatively delicate equipment and carries with it hazards associated with blind penetration of the abdomen.
On the other hand, the method is rapid, requires only a
small incision needing little or no aftercare, can be performed with the patient under local anesthesia, and is
associated with little postoperative discomfort. Minilaparotomy requires a larger wound which may need
some aftercare and which may give rise to greater postoperative discomfort. However, the equipment required is simple, durable, and inexpensive, and the
procedure does not require special surgical skills.
Despite the claims made on behalf of the various
surgical approaches to the tube, there have been very
few comparative studies reported. Meyer and King’
conducted a randomized comparative study of outpatient laparoscopy versus minilaparotomy with 30 subjects in each group: they concluded that there were few
differences in the two procedures. Sandmire” compared 226 minilaparotomy cases with the same number
of laparoscopy cases; there were slightly more surgical
complications in the laparoscopy group, and he stated a
preference for minilaparotomy. Letchworth and associates” reported a randomized comparative study of
laparoscopy versus minilaparotomy with 100 subjects

in each group and concluded that laparoscopy had
some marginal advantages over minilaparotomy. Mumford and associates’ ha1.e reported on a large series of
\vomen who underwent either laparoscopy or minilaparotomy for sterilization. The incidence of complications at the time of operation, although low for both
procedures, was greater in the laparoscopy group, and
the authors concluded that f’or many women minilaparotomy was the preferred approach.
In the latter part of 1976, the Task Force on Female
Sterilization of the World Health Organization’s Special Programme of Research, Development and Research Training in Human Reproduction initiated a
randomized study of minilaparotomy versus either
laparoscopy or culdoscopy or colpotomy. The study
was carried out simultaneoulsy in seven developing
country centers (Bangkok, Changdigarh, Havana, Manila, Santiago, Seoul, and Singapore) and three developed country centers (London. Los Angeles, and Sydney). The aim of’the study was to compare complication
rates for the procedures up to 6 weeks after operation.
A recruitment target of 200 subjects for each procedure in each center was set. This report deals only with
the randomized study of minilaparotomy versus laparoscopy. The results of the study of minilaparotomy
versus either culdoscopy or colpotomy will be published separately.
Material and methods
Healthy women having at least one living child, wishing sterilization, and fulfilling the national criteria for
eligibility for sterilization were considered for recruitment to the study. Women eligible for the study were
those who expressed no preference for a particular
surgical approach and who were considered suitable
for either of the two approaches. The same exclusion
criteria were used for all subjects and included known
pelvic pathologic conditions, difficulty in assessing pel-

vie organs, history of previous pehic infection or peritonitis, scar below the level of the umbilicus, obesity,
and any known condition which would increase the risk
of any surgical procedure.
Eligible subjects were fully informed of the nature of
the study, and only those who freely volunteered to
enter the study were admitted.
Subjects entering the study were randomly allocated,
by an envelope system generated by WHO, to one of
the procedures in each center. The following centers
participated: Bangkok, Havana, Santiago, Seoul, Singapore, Sydney, Los Angeles, and London. Each center
aimed to recruit 200 subjects for each procedure over a
period of 2 to 2% years. Recruitment fell considerably
short of this figure in all but two centers. Reasons for
this varied from center to center and included relatively small numbers of women presenting for sterilization in some institutions, preference for postpartum
rather than interval operation, and physician or subject
preference for one procedure over the other.
Operation method. A requirement of the study was
that each subject was to be operated on by a surgeon
with the necessary skills appropriate to the procedure
and that no subject was used for the training of lessskilled operators. Tubal occlusion was achieved by a
modified Pomeroy procedure for minilaparotomy cases
and electrocoagulation (with or without division of the
tube according to center routine) for laparoscopy cases.
No attempt was made to standardize other aspects of
operative technique between centers. However, within
each center the same routine was used for all subjects.
Anesthesia. This was, as far as possible, standardized
within individual centers according to routine practice
in the institution. The objective was to ensure that all
subjects undergoing the same procedure in any given
center would have the same type of anesthesia and
premeditation.
Postoperative care. In all centers subjects were required to remain in the hospital for a minimum of 8
hours following the surgical procedure. Thereafter the
time of discharge from the hospital was determined by
local practice. Drugs for pain relief and prophylactic
antibiotics were used according to the routine practice
in each participating center.
Follow-up of subjects was at 8 hours, 1 week, and 6
weeks after operation.
Analysis of data. Levels of significance for subject
characteristics, age, number of living children, body
weight, ponderal index, etc., were assessed by Student’s
t test. For determination of the significance levels of
complications or complaints between procedures, Fisher’s exact test of probability was used on the variable
relative to all subjects. However, for complications or
complaints occurring during the follow-up period, that
is, 8 hours to 6 weeks following operation, the same test
was used with only those subjects having a second
follow-up visit taken into consideration.
Definition of complications. As with many studies of
this kind, it was not possible to provide accurate and
consistent diagnostic criteria for all the clinical situations which might arise. For this reason, and to
simplify the reporting of results, a classification of
major and minor surgical complications was devised.
Major complications included the following: excessive bleeding requiring either replacement therapy,
additional operation, or both, damage to any part of
the uterus or to any other organ requiring additional
operation, incision-related problems requiring hospitalization and additional operation, and pelvic inllammatory disease requiring extension of hospital stay or
readmission to hospital.
Minor complications included the following: blood
loss of 50 ml or more during the procedure which did
not require replacement therapy or additional operation, injury to any part of the uterus or other organ not
requiring additional operation, pelvic inflammatory disease treated with antibiotics but without hospitalization,
incision-related problems which required no additional

operation or hospitalization, and urinary tract infections confirmed by examination of urine.
Technical problems, such as abandonment of operation, change of approach (e.g., laparoscopy of minilaparotomy changed to laparotomy), and anesthetic complications which were potentially life-threatenng have
been grouped separately as such problems are, for the
most part, not a consequence of the approach used.
Complaints. i.e., symptoms, could be grouped only
by those most frequently occurring and clearly related
to the procedure or to anesthesia, such as headache,
abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.
Results
A total of 912 subjects for minilaparotomy and 915
for laparoscopy were recruited to the study. Exclusion
of 12 1 subjects for minilaparotomy and 96 for laparoscopy from the final analysis was necessary because ot
protocol violations. More than half of the exclusions
were because the operation was performed on women
with abdominal scars below the level of the umbilicus.
The numbers of subjects submitted for final analysis
in each participating center are shown in Table 1 along
with some characteristics of the study population. Mean
number of living children is shown instead of parity as
it is felt that it demonstrates more clearly the family status of the subjects at the time of decision in favor of sterilization. There was a significant age difference between
the laparoscopy and minilaparotomy groups. This difference is due to the contribution of one center (Bangkok) where subjects in the laparoscopy group not only
were significantly older than subjects in the minilaparotomy group but also had a larger number of living
children and had been married longer. No explanation
has been found for these differences.
A further within-center difference exists with regard to body weight and ponderal index. In both Havana and Bangkok the subjects undergoing laparoscopy were significantly heavier and had a significantly
higher ponderal index than those undergoing minilaparotomy. These differences are felt to be of little clinical significance, except perhaps in Bangkok, where
the women undergoing minilaparotomy were clearly
lighter in weight and also thinner than women undergoing the same procedure in the other centers.
For all other variables studied, i.e., time since last
pregnancy, husband’s occupation, standard of education of both the husband and wife, and previous medical and surgical history, there were no significant differences either within individual centers or between
the two groups in total.
The greatest between-center variations in operative
procedure. as might be expected, centered on premedication and anesthesia for the procedures. Table II
summarizes the method used in each center.
The numbers of subjects lost to follow-up, that is,
those subjects who did not report for the 6-week postoperative visit and who could not be traced, were 21
(2.7%) for minilaparotomy and 30 (3.7%) for laparoscopy.
The results of the study in terms of complications
and complaints are shown in Table III. There were no
deaths in the study. Laparoscopy was associated with
less problems overall than minilaparotomy. However,
in terms of major complications, the two procedures
were very similar. The major complications are summarized in Table IV: technical and anesthetic problems
are shown in Table V, and the minor complications are
listed in Table VI.
The most serious major complications were injury to
other organs and excessive bleeding. Injury to other
organs occurred in four subjects undergoing minilaparotomy. In two of these the bladder was incised on
entry into the abdomen. The complication was imme-

diately recognized on both occasions: the bladder was
repaired, and with bladder drainage both subjects recovered uneventfully. The third subject suffered a ruptured corpus luteum which required suturing, while in
the fourth a torn round ligament was excised. The
single instance of other organ injury in the laparoscopy
series was an unrecognized burn to the small bowel
which resulted in readmission to the hospital on the
twelfth postoperative day and resection of a loop of
small intestine. Excessive bleeding occurred in one
woman undergoing minilaparotomy. Bleeding in excess of 100 ml occurred from one tube and tubectomy
was performed after the incision had been enlarged.
Two women in the minilaparotomy series suffered
major problems associated with anesthesia. One had a
cardiac arrest while she was under general anesthesia

sage restored normal heart rhythm but the operation
was abandoned. The second subject had a prolonged
episode of apnea following general anesthesia; recovery occurred without long-term consequences after
overnight observation in an intensive care unit. She was
found to have a cholinesterase deficiency.
In nine instances in the laparoscopy series there was
either a change in the surgical approach or abandonment of operation. In one case there was failure to
establish pneumoperitoneum. In four subjects, unsuspected adhesions prevented visualization of the tubes.
In two women, previously undetected ovarian cysts requiring further operation were discovered, and in one
woman a previously unsuspected uterine fibroid was
discovered and hysterectomy was performed at a later

date. The last subject was found to have such extensive
chronic pelvic inflammatory disease that sterilization
was considered unnecessary. In four minilaparotomy
subjects, enlargement of the incision was necessary because of unsuspected adhesions involving the tube and
necessitating better access to complete the procedure.
Of the women developing pelvic inflammatory disease and requiring hospitalization, one in the laparoscopy and two in the minilaparotomy series showed
signs and symptoms of the condition prior to initial
discharge from the hospital: the remainder were readmitted to the hospital from 3 to 25 days following
initial discharge. All subjects were symptom and sign
free following treatment.
Wound hematoma requiring additional operation
occurred in two women in the minilaparotomy series.
Minilaparotomy was associated with significantly more
minor complications and complaints than laparoscopy
(Table VI). Immediate bleeding and wound complications form the greatest part of this excess. However, in
both instances the excess was created by the contribution of a single center. Immediate bleeding, defined as
operative blood loss of 50 ml or more not requiring
specific treatment, was reported in 23 minilaparotomy
and five laparoscopy subjects in Los Angeles. If the
results from this center are excluded there remains no
difference between the procedures. Similarly, incisionrelated problems, mostly small hematomas and minor
infections, were reported in 23 minilaparotomy and no
laparoscopy subjects in Havana. Again the difference
between the procedures disappears when the results
from this center are removed.
Seoul was the only center which reported fewer
incision-related problems with minilaparotomy (five
cases) than with laparoscopy (13 cases). Prophylactic
antibiotics were given to all but two of the minilaparotomy subjects but only to one laparoscopy subject in this
center.
Immediate complaints, that is, reported in the first 8
hours after operation, were more numerous in the
minilaparotomy subjects because of the greater number of subjects reporting abdominal pain in this group.
Two centers contributed the greater number of subjects reporting abdominal pain. In Bangkok 22 minilaparotomy and I1 laparoscopy subjects reported the
symptom, and in Havana 80 minilaparotomy and 17
laparoscopy subjects reported pain. The same two centers also reported the highest numbers of subjects with
nausea and vomiting: together they accounted for 3 1 of
the 40 minilaparotomy subjects and 28 of the 35 laparoscopy subjects.
There was no overall difference between the two
procedures in respect to complaints related to the procedure reported during the follow-up period. Headache, a complaint more obviously related to the anesthetic method than to the procedure, was reported in
24 women in rhe minilaparotomy group in Havana. In
this center the majority of minilaparotomy subjects had
spinal anesthesia for the procedure, with laparoscopy
being performed under general anesthesia. Of the
other two centers which used regional anesthesia for
minilaparotomy, epidural anesthesia was used in Singapore, while spinal anesthesia was used in Santiago. In
Santiago, however, women undergoing minilaparotomy were kept in the hospital for only 24 hours following the procedure, while those in Havana were kept for
3 days. The extended period of observation in Havana
may have contributed to the number of women reporting headache.
Comment
The results of the study show that in terms of major
complications there is a small but surgically manageable
incidence of injury to other organs in the minilaparotomy approach compared to the laparoscopic approach.
The single instance of unrecognized bowel injury in the
laparoscopy series might be taken as a serious criticism
of the approach. However, the increasing use of either
clips or rings for tubal occlusion by laparoscopy considerably weakens this argument. Accidental entry into
the bladder is a well-recognized, but avoidable, hazard
associated with minilaparotomy. Although this complication occurred only twice in the present series, training
for minilaparotomy clearly should include instruction
on the repair and postoperative care of bladder injury.
On eight occasions in the laparoscopy series and four
in the minilaparotomy series, there were findings of
previously unsuspected pelvic disease which rendered
the approach impractical in the case of laparoscopy or
necessitated extension of the minilaparotomy incision.
In this study a change of surgical approach or deferment of definitive operation was comparatively simple.
In other settings such changes of approach may not be
easy, and it should be anticipated that for a small number of women definitive operation may have to be
deferred.
Pelvic inflammatory disease of a severity sufficient to
merit hospitalization occurred with similar frequency
with both procedures, and all subjects recovered with
antibiotic treatment. Sandmire’ reported pelvic infection occurring in 1.2% of minilaparotomy cases and
1.3%’ of laparoscopy cases. In the present study, including those subjects treated without hospitalization, the
figures were 1.0% for minilaparotomy and 1.2%’ for
laparoscopy. Pelvic inflammatory disease is, therefore,
an uncommon complication which appears to respond

well to simple treatment. In all subjects who developed
pelvic inflammatory disease, the pelvic organs were recorded as normal at the time of operation with one
exception, in a woman with a fixed uterine retroversion. It is, therefore, difficult to see how the development of pelvic inflammatory disease could be predicted
or how it could be avoided.
Minilaparotomy was associated with more minor
complications and complaints than laparoscopy. The
results were, however, strongly influenced by the results from one center, Havana. In this center the
minilaparotomy subjects were managed in a way that
was distinctly different from that of the laparoscopy
subjects. Most of the former group received a spinal
anesthetic (95.7%) and were discharged 3 days after
operation, while the latter group all received a general
anaesthetic and were discharged 24 hours after operation. These differences in management resulted, first,
in a comparatively high incidence of headache in the
minilaparotomy group because of the anesthetic technique and, second, in more incision-related complications being reported in the minilaparotomy group, almost certainly related to the longer observation period
in hospital.
The higher incidence of excessive bleeding, which
required no treatment, at the time of operation in
minilaparotomy subjects was again due to the contribution of one center, Los Angeles. There seems no
ready explanation for this finding other than that minilaparotomy requires a longer incision than laparoscopy. However, Los Angeles also contributed eight of
the nine cases of excess bleeding occurring with laparoscopy and it is possible that there was overzealous
recording of the complication in this center.
Abdominal pain occurring within 8 hours of the procedure was reported by a considerable number of both
minilaparotomy and laparoscopy subjects in Bangkok
and Havana. Together these two centers accounted for
85% of minilaparotomy subjects and 90% of laparoscopy subjects reporting abdominal pain while contributing only 48.8% of the total minilaparotomy subjects and 47.4%; of the total laparoscopy subjects in the
study. No adequate explanation has been found for
this phenomenon, which does not seem to have been
the result of direct questioning.
The complaint of abdominal pain during the follow-up period was again common in subjects undergoing both procedures in Bangkok: 48.5% of minilaparotomy subjects and 47.5% of laparoscopy subjects
reported this symptom. In contrast, most of the subjects
complaining of abdominal pain during the follow-up
period in Havana were recorded as having symptoms
of, but not a diagnosis of, pelvic inflammatory disease.
In this center there was an excess of subjects in the
minilaparotomy group with these symptoms; again this
may have been one result of the extended hospital stay
of minilaparotomy subjects in Havana.
Complications or complaints relating more to anesthetic or premeditation than to the procedure were,
with the exception of headache, as discussed above,
fairly evenly distributed between the two procedures. It
seems probable that the two life-threatening complications, cardiac arrest and apnea associated with a cholinesterase deficiency, which occurred in the minilaparotomy group might have occurred with any surgical
procedure performed with general anesthesia in these
subjects. The question of appropriate anesthesia and
premeditation for minilaparotomy and for laparoscopy
has not been answered by this study and has largely been
ignored in the literature. Exceptions to this are the reports of Wheeless,” Wheeless and Thompson,6 and Chaturachinda7 favoring local anesthesia for laparoscopy
and Vitoon,x Sarria,” and Penfield’O favoring local anesthesia for minilaparotomy. In the randomized studies
reported by Letchworth and associates” and Meyer and
King,’ general anesthesia was used for both minilaparotomy and laparoscopy.
From the present study it seems clear that in the
variety of developing country centers which participated local anesthesia is both safe and acceptable for
laparoscopy. Most centers, Seoul and Bangkok being
exceptions, preferred regional or general anesthesia
for minilaparotomy probably because of the additional
manipulation of the peritoneum and mesosalpinx involved in the procedure. Because of the relatively high
incidence of headache with spinal anesthesia, the epidural approach may be preferred if regional anesthesia
is to be used. A variety of anesthetic techniques are
likely to be available in a hospital setting, but the same
is unlikely to be true for a rural situation. In addition, it
is probable that different anesthetic techniques will be
preferred, either by physicians or by patients, in different countries. However, there does seem to be a case
for studies designed to determine the optimum premedication and anesthesia, particularly for minilaparotomy.
In summary, this study has demonstrated small but
clinically manageable differences between minilaparotomy and laparoscopy as methods of approach to the
fallopian tube for sterilization, The implication of these
small differences for national family planning programs
is that, if a choice has to be made between the two
methods, the factors of training and cost and maintenance of equipment can be considered along with clinical factors with no major hazard to the patients. Under
these circumstances minilaparotomy appears preferable for rural facilities where surgeons other than gy-

necologists may be used. Laparoscopy probably should
be confined for use in hospital settings.
