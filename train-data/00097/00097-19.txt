Abstract
A prospective randomized comparison of
the peri-operative complications and longterm sequelae between the Fiishie clip and
Pomeroy methods was undertaken in 200
postpartum women at Tri-Service General
Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan. The peri-operative
complications in either group were mild and
infrequent. One pregnancy in the Pomeroy
group was reported after follow-up for 24
months. No significant difference between
the two groups was found in respect to longterm sequelae.

Introduction
Permanent female sterilization is one of the
most popular methods of contraception
today. There have been a variety of techniques for sterilization, e.g. excision and ligation, diathermy, ring and clip. An ideal
technique should be highly effective and carry
a low complication rate. A technique with a
high success rate of reversal would also be

welcomed. However, it is generally believed
that effectiveness and reversibility are incompatible. A large segment of the fallopian tube
is usually sacrificed to achieve high
effectiveness, thus decreasing the possibility
of reversal. The recently developed Filshie
clip, which causes minimal tubal damage, is
expected to have a high success rate in reversal [l-4]. The Filshie clip has been reported
to have a similar failure rate and complication
rate to that of the Pomeroy method [4]. There
is no prior prospective study comparing the
two methods since the Filshie clip only
became generally available in the early 1980s.
This study is designed to compare the perioperative complications and long-term sequelae between the Filshie clip and Pomeroy
methods.
Materials and methods
Filshie clip (Femcare, 113 Ilkeston Road,
Nottingham NG7 3HE, UK) is made from
titanium and lined with silicone rubber. The
rubber lining may reduce transection and fistula formation in the tubal stump and further
increase clip capacity. When applied over the
tube, the immediate effect is compression and
occlusion of the tube. As tubal necrosis
occurs, the rubber expands to keep the tubal
lumen blocked. The tube eventually divides

and the stump heals closed. The clip is 14 mm
long, 4 mm wide, and 0.36 g in weight. A special applicator is needed for application of the
clip.
From February 1984 to August 1986, 200
postpartum women at Tri-Service General
Hospital chose tubal sterilization for contraception. These women were randomly allocated into Filshie clip and Pomeroy methods
via sealed preprinted labels that were opened
by the operator immediately before the procedure. There were 100 women in the Filshie
clip group and 100 women in the Pomeroy
method group. All the procedures were performed by one of the authors (JH). Another
author (JS Yan) evaluated the patients in the
postoperative period without knowledge of
which method had been done. Sociodemographic and medical data were recorded on
standard forms.
All procedures were performed via a subumbilical minilaparotomy incision l-2 cm in
length. The fallopian tubes were identified
and pulled to the surface by fingers or forceps. Tubal occlusion was effected by either
application of Filshie clips or by the Pomeroy
method on the isthmus portion of the tube
about 2 cm from the cornu. With the Pomeroy method, a loop of tube about l-2 cm in
length was picked up and ligated with 2-O
plain catgut, the knuckle of the tube above
the ligature was then excised with scissors.
Epidural anesthesia was used in 88% of the
women in the Filshie clip group and 92% in
the Pomeroy group; the remainder were performed under local anesthesia. Eighty-eight
women in each group were sterilized within 48
h following delivery.
The patients were followed at 1, 6, 12 and
24 months after sterilization by telephone or
clinic visit. A total of 85 women from the Filshie group and 86 women from Pomeroy
group returned for l-month follow-up.
Ninety-six Filshie clip women and 97
Pomeroy women returned for at least one follow-up during 6-24 months postoperation
(Table I). The data were tested for statistical
significance by chi-square test.

clip group was similar to that of the Pomeroy
group. The mean number of live births prior
to the recent delivery was 2.0 in the Filshie
clip group and 1.9 in the Pomeroy group. The
pattern of contraceptive use prior to the
recent pregnancy was similar between the two
groups (Table II). Five patients in the Filshie
clip group and one patient in the Pomeroy
group reported a history of pelvic
inflammatory disease. Eight patients in the
Filshie clip group and 15 patients in the Pomeroy group had undergone previous
intraperitoneal surgery.
During the sterilization procedure, one
case of meso-salpingeal bleeding and one case
of tubal injury were reported among PomeTable IV. Change in amount of flow at long-term follow-up.

roy patients. None of the Filshie clip patients
reported surgical injury. Postoperative pelvic
pain was noted in 27 Filshie clip patients and
in 26 Pomeroy patients.
One pregnancy was reported in the Pomeroy group at 6-month follow-up. The estimated gestational age was 6 weeks. The
pregnancy was terminated by dilatation and
curettage. The patient refused re-sterilization,
and the reason for failure remained
unknown. There were no other complications
or hospital re-admissions in either group during the follow-up period.
There were no significant differences
between the two groups at long-term followup on the duration of menstrual flow (Table
III), amount of menstrual flow (Table IV),
and dysmenorrhea (Table V).
Discussion
We have found that the peri-operative
complications in both Filshie clip and Pomeroy sterilization were mild and infrequent.
The two injuries reported in the Pomeroy
group could be managed easily without sequelae. The percentage of women complaining
Znt J Gynecol Obstet 33
postoperative pain was similar in both groups.
Clip-related problems during operation such
as transection of tube, clip applied improperly, clip falling into peritoneal cavity [4,5,8]
have not been encountered in this study,
probably because our patients received minilaparotomy so that the tubes could be
manipulated more directly and precisely than
those done via laparoscopy.
One pregnancy was found during the follow-up period in the Pomeroy group, while
no pregnancy was found in the Filshie clip
group. However, our sample size is too small
to make the conclusion that the Filshie clip is
superior to the Pomeroy method in terms of
failure rate. The failure rate of Filshie clip
sterilization has been reported to be O-8.6%,
with the best estimate around 0.6% [3-71.
Most of the failures were due to operator
error, e.g. clip on mesosalpinx, clip on round
ligament, or clip not properly applied on the
tube. The method failure rate can be reduced
to 0.2-0.3% if the clip is applied correctly
[3,41.
There have been no complications or complaints related to sterilization at long-term
follow-up in either group. Changes in 
menstrual patterns were similar in both
groups.
In summary, although we do not prove the
Filshie clip to be superior to the Pomeroy
method in terms of effectiveness, peri-operative complications, and ‘long-term sequelae,
we can safely conclude that the Filshie clip is
at least as effective as the Pomeroy method
and both techniques carry a low complication
rate.
In our experience, we found one advantage
of the Filshie clip is that it can be applied
from a distance. This feature is especially
helpful when there is some distance between
the incision and the tubes, as in the case of
vaginal tubal sterilization. Another potential
advantage of the Filshie clip, although not
proved in this study, is that it destroys a minimal amount of the fallopian tube. Thus the
chance of successful reversal will be higher
than that of the Pomeroy method [1,2]. Filshie has reported a pregnancy rate of 84% on
reversal of Filshie clip sterilization [3]. As
shown in our study, many women with low
parity chose tubal sterilization for contraception, some of them may request reversal procedure in the future. For those women with
low parity, sterilization with the Filshie clip
would be a wise decision.
