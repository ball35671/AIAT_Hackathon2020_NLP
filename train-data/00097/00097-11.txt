Female sterilization
Modified Uchida technique
Silver clips
Objective: To compare the specific effects of 2 female sterilization methods: the modified Uchida technique and
the application of silver clips. Methods: A total of 2198 women living in rural areas who were still of reproductive
age but opting for sterilization were enrolled. The participants were randomly divided into 2 groups, and
underwent sterilization by either modified Uchida technique or silver clips. Information on acceptability,
operation conditions, effectiveness, adverse effects, and complaints was collected 3, 6, and 12 months after the
procedure. Results: No significant difference in effectiveness, adverse effects or chief complaints between the
2 procedures was found. Differences in operative outcome, bleeding volume during the procedure, and
operation time were found. Conclusion: A shorter operation time and less bleeding for the silver clip method
indicated that female sterilization by this technique was as safe as that by modified Uchida technique.

1. Introduction
There have been considerable methodologic developments in the
area of contraception during the past 15 years. For example, tubal
sterilization has become one of the most widely used methods of
fertility regulation around the world. Female tubal sterilization is a
popular method of family planning because it is simple, highly safe,
extremely effective, and culturally acceptable for pregnancy prevention,
especially for women who no longer desire children [1,2]. A large study
of women in the USA found that 22% of almost 8000 women aged 15–44
had undergone sterilization in 1984 [3]. In China in 2002, 32% of married
women of reproductive age had undergone tubal sterilization [4], and
tubal sterilization is more common among women inhabiting rural
areas than those in cities [5].
Female sterilization can be done by different surgical methods such
as laparotomy, mini-laparotomy, colpotomy, laparoscopy, and hysteroscopy [6]. Laparoscopic tubal sterilization by electrocautery is the
predominant method. The introduction of rings and clips in the 1970s
provided occlusive techniques that are safer and more effective than
cauterization [7], and rings and clips are also commonly used in
laparoscopic tubal sterilization [8]. However, tubal sterilization via
laparotomy does not require sophisticated or expensive endoscopic
equipment, rarely needs general anesthesia, and is often a cheaper
option [9]. Therefore, laparoscopic tubal sterilization is common around
the world, and in rural China is predominantly performed via modified
Uchida technique. However, tubal sterilization using silver clips is
increasing in popularity and acceptance in rural areas because it can be
taught and performed easily, is economical, and leads to a short hospital
stay and recovery time.
Studies indicate that remorse and regret are common in women
who have undergone sterilization at a young age, in women with low
parity, and in women who have experienced changes in family
structure. For example, approximately 15% of women have been
found to regret sterilization subsequently because of changes in their
life circumstances [10], and ultimately a number seek surgical reversal
[11–13]. Regardless of their number of living children, women in the
USA who are sterilized at a young age (18–24 years) are 4 times as
likely to later request information on reversal as women who undergo
the procedure aged 30 years or older [14]. When a reversal of tubal
sterilization is attempted, the probability of success is low and failure
rates have been estimated to be as high as 50% [13,15].
Some sterilization methods have higher success rates of reversal. For
example, the reversal rate of the silver clip method is significantly higher
than that of other methods of tubal sterilization [16]. As the living
standard of Chinese women improves, especially for women inhabiting
rural areas, tubal sterilization using silver clips is increasingly welcomed. The occurrence of large-scale natural disasters, such as the
earthquake in rural Sichuan that killed tens of thousands of children in
2008, has resulted in a preference for sterilization techniques that can be
reversed more easily.
In the present study, the acceptability, operative outcome, effectiveness, adverse events, and chief complaints of women were investigated

after tubal sterilization by either modified Uchida technique or silver
clips. The aim was to compare comprehensively the dominant method
of sterilization in rural China (modified Uchida) with an emerging
method (silver clips) so that women electing for sterilization would
have more information about alternative surgical techniques to enable
them to make an informed decision regarding their health.
2. Materials and methods
The study was conducted from June 22, 2007, to August 28, 2008, in
20 clinics in China—in Shandong, Zhejiang, Hubei, Henan, Yunnan, and
Gansu. A total of 2198 women electing for sterilization were enrolled in
the present study. All women were healthy, aged 20–40 years, had at least
2 living children, and were in secure marriages. The following women
were excluded: those with a history ofmajor abdominal surgery, epilepsy,
neurosis, acute or chronic pelvic inflammatory disease, or acute infectious
diseases; those with a body temperature higher than 37.5 °C when
measured twice in 24 hours; and those who had encountered severe
adhesions during previous operations. Women who were planning to
leave their home for an extended time, and those too weak for surgery
were also excluded. The silver clips used in the present study were
produced by Jin Bo Science and Technology (Dongyang, Hunan, China).
All participants were consulted and counseled before surgery. All of
the women, together with their husbands, elected to have the sterilization
procedure performed and agreed to the surgery. Written informed
consent was obtained from each participant at the commencement of the
study. Approval was obtained from the Scientific and Ethical Review
Group of the National Research Institution for Family Planning, China.
Each woman underwent a careful physical and gynecologic examination and routine laboratory tests within 1 week of their menstrual
period. The participants were randomly assigned to a standard laparotomy technique for sterilization—either modified Uchida technique
(group A) or silver clips (group B)—and this information was placed
in an envelope and delivered to the surgeon [17]. For both groups,
50 mg of pethidine was used as a premedication, and lidocaine or
ethocaine was used as a local anesthetic. The surgeries were performed as described in Figs. 1 and 2, and performed by 1–2 surgeons
only in each clinic.
After the operation, the women were monitored for 2–4 hours,
and operative records were maintained. Participants were asked to
return for a check-up at 1 week, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months
after the surgery.
The number of successful operations and the duration of the
surgery were measured. The duration of surgery was defined as the
time from the first incision to that of completion of the surgical closure. Information was also recorded on intraoperative complications,
postoperative adverse effects, and patient complaints. For example,
abnormal menstruation was defined as an abnormal menstrual cycle,
menstrual period (N7 days, b3 days), or menstrual volume (increased,
decreased) compared with the preoperative state. The chief complaints included lower abdominal pain, back pain, tenderness, vulvae
pruritus, and increased vaginal discharge. The interview also collected
information on participant acceptance of surgery, contraceptive effects, time limits, and attitudes toward adverse effects.
The outcome measures of the present study also included the rate
of discontinuation, which incorporated all reasons for discontinuing
with sterilization. For example, some women could not continue to
participate in the study because of previous complications, conditions,
and disorders, or because of changes in their circumstances such as
relocation to another part of China or divorce. The discontinuation
rate also included women who failed to attend follow-up sessions.
For analysis, the information on the questionnaires was doubleentered using EpiData version 3 (EpiData Association, Odense, Denmark).
Analyses involving demographic characters, surgical data, acceptance,
adverse effects, and complaints were performed via χ2 test using SPSS
version 13 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). The level of significance was set at
Pb0.05. Version 2 of the WHO Life Table Analysis (WHO, Geneva,
Switzerland) was used to calculate the discontinuation rate at 3, 6, and
12 months after surgery.
3. Results
A total of 2198 women electing for sterilization were enrolled in
the present study. Just over half of the participants (1116) were
allocated to undergo tubal ligation via modified Uchida technique
(group A), and 1082 women were allocated to undergo tubal ligation
using silver clips (group B). Not all of the women were included in the
final analysis and follow-up regime for the reasons described in the
materials and methods. In addition, some women subsequently
decided against sterilization, and some women did not undergo the
procedure allocated to them (that is, women allocated silver clips
underwent the modified Uchida technique, and vice versa). No more
than 5% of women were excluded from each group. In groups A and B,
1096 and 1041 women, respectively, completed the follow-up (Fig. 3).

There were no significant differences in age (group A, 32± 4 years;
group B, 31± 4 years), age of menarche (A, 15± 1 years; B, 15 ±
1 years), menstrual cycle (A, 30± 4 days; B, 30± 3 days), or menstrual period (A, 5± 1 days; B, 5± 2 days) between the 2 groups. The
groups were also similar in education level, occupation, menstruation,
and last pregnancy outcome (Table 1).
Surgical duration and the amount of bleeding differed between the
techniques (Table 2). The mean operation time was 17.61± 7.11
minutes for the modified Uchida group, and 13.38± 7.36 minutes for
the silver clip group (Pb0.05; Table 2). The number of failed
operations included women who changed their minds about
sterilization and those who underwent the wrong procedure according to randomization. Twenty-two women did not receive their
assigned operation of silver clips owing to technical reasons or
because their adnexa were unfit for the silver clip method. For
example, 5 women exhibited left- or right-tube conglutination with
the pelvic cavity and 17 women had tubes that were engorged and
thickened, and instead underwent the modified Uchida technique or
Pomeroy method.
Satisfaction across the 4 measures of acceptability, contraceptive
effect, time limits, and attitudes toward adverse effects were consistent between the groups (69% satisfaction in the modified Uchida
group; 66% in the silver clip group). However, the individual measures
of patient acceptance differed depending on the surgical method of
sterilization (Pb0.05; Table 3).
In groups A and B, 1096 and 1041 women, respectively, attended
the follow-up sessions at 3, 6, and 12 months, and their data were
used for further analysis. Comparison of abnormal menstruation and
chief complaints did not show a significant difference between the 2
groups (PN0.05; Table 4).
Overall, the rate of discontinuation was 0.58% (95% confidence interval
[CI], 0.12–1.04) for the silver clip group and 0.55% (95% CI, 0.11–0.98) for
the modified Uchida group. No difference in the rate of discontinuation
was found between the groups (χ2=0.0087, PN0.05; Table 5).
4. Discussion
Death following a sterilization procedure is rare, and no deaths
occurred during the present study. No major complications among the

study participants were detected after either sterilization method. Of
the participants that were successfully tracked over the course of a
year, all but a few participated in every follow-up session. Two
women in the silver clip group did not participate in the final followup session because the sterilization had been unsuccessful. The overall
success rate of the sterilization procedure was, therefore, 97.1% for the
silver clip method and 98.8% for the modified Uchida technique.
Previous studies comparing different types of tubal ligation have
suggested that operative complications are most commonly related to
electrocautery and the failure of devices used for the application of
clips and rings [18–20]. In the present study, 2% of women did not
qualify for the silver clip method because of either technical or
anatomic reasons. Although sterilization via silver clips is simpler than
that via modified Uchida technique, the experience and skill of the
surgeon are important and highlight the need for comprehensive
training for rural family-planning service providers across China.
In a study comparing Falope-ring and mini-laparotomy sterilization
methods, the mean operation times were 19 minutes and 23 minutes,
respectively [20]. In the present study, there was also a difference in mean
operation time between the 2 treatments (modified Uchida, 18 minutes;
silver clips, 13 minutes; Pb0.05), and less blood was lost during the
shorter surgery. There was no difference between the 2 surgical groups in
the study measures of abnormal menstruation.
The modified Uchida technique for female ligation is a traditional
method of surgical female sterilization. The popularity of this
technique is based on its long-established efficacy [21,22]. In China,
this method has been the preferred technique for sterilization at rural
family-planning clinics for the past 30 years. Most women regard the
modified Uchida technique as synonymous with female sterilization,
and we found an attitudinal bias against silver clips, even though they
are as effective as the Uchida technique. Greater education and
awareness are required so that silver clips are more widely viewed as
a viable option for rural women electing for sterilization.
Ideally, the sterilization procedure should be safe, have high efficacy,
be easily accessible, and be personally and culturally acceptable. Furthermore, the method should be affordable, simple, quick, and easily
taught among practitioners [1]. Over the follow-up time of 12 months in
the present study, there was no difference in efficacy, adverse effects, or
patient complaints between the 2 methods.
A limitation of the present study was the brevity of the postoperative observation period of 12 months. We also have no information
on reversal after tubal sterilization for the 2 methods. A longitudinal
study is now needed to determine how the women respond to and
view their surgical treatment after several years.
In conclusion, despite the higher failure rate of the silver clip
method, its shorter surgical time and decreased blood loss indicated
that it was as safe as the modified Uchida technique. In rural areas,
family-planning service providers are proficient in the modified
Uchida technique, whereas silver clips have emerged relatively
recently. The use of silver clips has been welcomed by many rural
women and family-planning service providers in China, despite a slow
rate of technical knowledge transmission. The popularity of sterilization, especially in low-income countries, is often influenced by the
high cost of the procedure, scarcity of providers, and surgical risk [23].
The cost of the operation was the same for both groups, but the silver
clip technique incurs the additional cost of the silver clips. The actual
cost of each clip is approximately US $1 and affordable for Chinese
families. Given this similarity in cost, if women were more familiar
with the silver clip method and surgeons were able to receive the
appropriate technical training, we posit that this method of
sterilization would quickly increase in popularity and acceptability.
