A retrospective chart analysis of women undergoing elective abdominal hysterectomy in Parkland Memorial
Hospital indicated significant postoperative antibiotic administration. For that reason, we conducted a
prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to determine the incidence of infection and febrile
morbidity in this patient population and to evaluate the efficacy of perioperative cefoxitin in modifying the
incidence of these conditions. Three 2 gm intramuscular doses of cefoxitin over 12 hours significantly
reduced the incidence of major infection to 12% from 32% observed in the placebo group. The mean
hospital stay for women given cefoxitin (5.6 days) was also significantly reduced when compared to that
for women given placebo (6.4 days). The incidence of febrile morbidity not requiring therapy was
significant and was not altered by perioperative cefoxitin. Febrile morbidity was observed in 42% of women
given cefoxitin and in 34% of women given placebo. Administration of perioperative antimicrobial agents is
necessary for women undergoing elective abdominal hysterectomy in our hospital, but we believe that
individual determination is required. (AM. J. OBSTET. GYNECOL. 147:520, 1983.)

Gray2 reported an incidence of overall febrile morbidity of 18% for 1,622 women following abdominal hysterectomy, but a wound infection rate of only 0.7%.
Ledger and Child,3 however, reported an incidence of
postoperative antibiotic administration of 3 1% for
8,462 women following abdominal hysterectomy. Antibiotic prophylaxis for women scheduled for an elective, nonradical abdominal hysterectomy remains controversial in spite of significant infection rates. Factors
contributing to varied results may be different definitions of febrile morbidity, the relationship of febrile
morbidity to infection requiring antimicrobial therapy,
precise definitions of these infections, and patient
populations studied.
We designed a prospective, randomized, doubleblind, placebo-controlled study to establish the incidence of major and minor infections following elective
abdominal hysterectomy in our hospital and to evaluate
the effect of perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis on
these infection rates, febrile morbidity, and hospital
stay. We chose to evaluate cefoxitin, the antimicrobial
agent proved effective in the prevention of major infection after vaginal hysterectomy in our hospital.’
Pathogens recovered from infection sites were identified and sensitivities to cefoxitin were determined.
Material and methods
Patient population. Women consecutively admitted
for elective abdominal hysterectomy were included in
the study if they were 18 years of age or older, gave
informed, written consent, and did not have one of the
following exclusions: (1) known allergy to cephalosporins, cephamycins, procaine-like drugs, and/or history
of an immediate hypersensitivity reaction to penicillin;
(2) receipt of antibiotics or urinary antiseptics within 48
hours prior to operation; (3) known urinary tract infection or preoperative urine culture with >lo” colonies of a known urinary pathogen per milliliter; (4)
temperature ~38” C (100.4” F) within 24 hours prior to
operation; (5) gynecologic malignancy requiring radical hysterectomy; (6) pregnancy; or (7) serious systemic
disease (valvular heart disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, immunosuppression, etc.)
The evening before operation, all women took a
povidone-iodine shower and douche. Povidone-iodine
was also utilized for abdominal and vaginal preparation
in the operating room. A urethral bladder catheter was
inserted after vaginal preparation and was left at least
overnight after operation. Women whose surgical procedure included repair for stress urinary incontinence
retained the catheter for at least 3 days. Primary surgeons were house staff with faculty supervision; thirdyear house officers performed the majority of procedures and general anesthetics were administered. Vital
signs were routinely recorded at least every 4 hours
during the first 24 postoperative hours and four times
daily thereafter unless a temperature reading of
~38” C was observed or there were clinical indications.
If either of these situations occurred, at least a 4-hour
interval was adopted. Each women was seen by a physician investigator twice daily during the hospital stay.
Discharge from the hospital was accomplished when
women had no evidence of active infection or other
postoperative complications and had been afebrile
more than 24 hours. Hospitalization was not extended
for subjective or nonmedical related considerations.
Follow-up was extended through a clinic visit 3 to 4
weeks postoperatively to detect late infections.
Laboratory studies. Routine preoperative laboratory
studies included a complete blood count with differential and platelet counts, serum urea nitrogen, creatinine, glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase, sodium,
chloride, potassium, carbon dioxide, glucose, and urinalysis. A midstream, clean-catch specimen of urine
was also collected for culture. A complete blood count
with differential and platelet counts and urinalysis
were routinely repeated on the third, fourth, or fifth
postoperative day.
If a diagnosis of infection M as made following operation, site-specific specimens ,md blood were obtained
for aerobic and anaerobic culrure and were processed
as described previously.,’ A complete blood count with
differential and urinalysis with culture (clean-catch,
midstream) were repeated at that time.
Drug administration. Wornen were assigned consecutive numbers upon entrv into the study. These
numbers corresponded to consecutively numbered kits
each containing vials of study drug that were labeled
only with the allocation number. The assignment of
cefoxitin or placebo to a given allocation number was
done according to a table of random numbers. Each
woman was given 1 gm of studv material diluted in 2 ml
of 0.5% lidocaine hydrochloride by deep intramuscular
injection into each hip on call to the operating room.
The second and third doses, administered similarly 6
and 12 hours after the initial dose, also consisted of 2
gm each. The study remained blinded until all women
were examined at a follow-up clinic visit.
Postoperative infections. infections were divided
into major and minor categories as follows.
Major infection.
PELVIC CELLULITIS. Pelvic cellulitis was defined as infection in the extraperitoneal spaces primarily lateral to
the vaginal cuff and including parametrial tissue. The
diagnosis was made when a woman complained of increasing lower abdominal and/or pelvic pain and had
increasing tenderness to gentle, deep palpation of the
lateral lower abdominal wall. Tenderness was almost
always asymmetric and persistent pyrexia was present.
A speculum examination was performed to allow col-

lection of material cephalad to the vaginal cuff for culture. A bimanual examination was performed to confirm the diagnosis and to detect the presence of a pelvic
abscess or infected hematoma. Salpingitis or salpingooophoritis presented similarly; only 30% of women in
both groups had adnexal structures preserved.
INFECTED HEMATOMA OR ABSCESS. This diagnosis was
made when infection was present in tissues as previously described and/or in adnexal structures and a soft
or fluctuant tender mass was palpated. Sonographic
confirmation was obtained.
ABDOMINAL WOUND INFECTION. This diagnosis was
made when a wound drained purulent material or serous fluid from which potential pathogens were recovered when cultured. Tissue induration, warmth, and
erythema were present, and the incision was more tender than at previous examination.
Minor infection.
ASYMPTOMATIC BACTERIURIA. Growth of 210” colonies per milliliter of a single uropathogen obtained
from a catheterized urine specimen in the absence of
symptoms defined this condition. This count was required from two separate clean-catch specimens.
Women who developed postoperative infections
were treated with any therapeutic regimen chosen by
physicians providing continuous care. However, the
diagnosis of infection and decision to treat were made
by the same investigator.
Febrile morbidity. We elected to define this entity as
a temperature of 238“ C on two or more occasions 4 or
more hours apart >24 hours postoperatively.
Hospital stay. Hospital stay was calculated beginning
with the day of operation. If a woman was discharged
after early morning rounds, that day was not counted.
If she was observed until 1600 and discharged thereafter, the day was counted.
Statistical analysis. Clinical, surgical, and laboratory
data were compared by means of Student’s t, paired
Student’s t, and/or Mann-Whitney tests. x2 analysis was
utilized to compare incidence of infection between
placebo and drug groups.
Poststudy analysis of risk factors for infection. Following completion of the study, a stepwise discriminant
analysis of factors possibly associated with major postoperative infection was performed on the placebo
group with the use of the Statistical Package for the
Social Sciences (SPSS) package of statistical computer
programs to determine whether or not major postoperative infection could be predicted. Discriminant
analysis was used to determine a classification function
or formula which would classify patients into the appropriate outcome group (e.g., those who would develop infection and those who would not) on the basis
of information which was known a piori. It is desirable
that such a formula include a minimum number of
variables (or measurements) but still maximize the
number of patients correctly classified into their outcome group.
In the stepwise procedure the predictor variable that
contributed most significantly to the prediction of the
appropriate outcome group was selected on the first
step. The stepwise procedure continued selecting variables until all significant variables were added. Ten historic and clinical variables were combined with surgical
data for analysis. The formula developed in this manner was prospectively applied to 127 women consecutively scheduled for elective abdominal hysterectomy.
These women were followed as described previously
and the same criteria for infection were used.
Results
Patient populations and operations. Between November, 1979, and May, 1980, 112 women were consecutively entered into the double-blind study. Twelve
were not included in the present data for the following
reasons: Two had positive preoperative urine cultures;
two had no hysterectomy at laparotomy, two had vaginal hysterectomy after examination while under anesthesia; two had undiagnosed pyosalpinges discovered
at operation and were given antimicrobial therapy intraoperatively; one had a cystotomy and was given
antimicrobial therapy; one developed cholecystitis
postoperatively and was treated with antimicrobial
agents; one developed a hematoma without evidence of
infection and was given antimicrobial agents; one was
given doses incorrectly. Fifty of the remaining women
were given cefoxitin and 50 received placebo. Racial

composition of each group was similar. Mean parity (3),
age (35.8 years), and body surface area (1.62 m’) were
almost identical for women in both groups. Surgical
procedures performed and surgical variables presented in Table I were statistically similar.
Laboratory studies. Mean preoperative hemoglobin
concentrations were identical for women in both
groups (12.8 gm/dl). Mean concentrations postoperatively on day 4 or 5 were significantly lower for each
group, i.e., 10.7 gm/dl for women given cefoxitin and
10.5 gmidl for women given placebo (paired Student’s
t test, P < 0.001). Mean hemoglobin concentrations
postoperatively were not lower for women who became
infected (cefoxitin 10.5 gm/dl, placebo 10.7 gm/dl).
There was a 13% reduction in mean platelet counts
observed in women in both groups on the first postoperative day that returned to preoperative values or
above by the fourth or fifth day after operation. These
decreases in platelet counts were statistically but not
clinically significant.
Mean leukocyte counts for women in each group
were also similar preoperatively; cefoxitin, 7.6 x lo”/
mm”; placebo, 7.4 x 103/mm:s. On the first postoperative day, there were significant (paired Student’s t test,
P < 0.001) increases in mean values for each group,
i.e., to 9.8 x 10”/mmJ for women given cefoxitin and
to 12.3 x 103/mm3 for women given placebo. The leukocyte counts observed in the placebo group were significantly higher than those observed in the cefoxitin
group (Student’s t test, P < 0.01). Leukocyte counts
prior to the diagnosis of infection were not predictive
for future infection for either group of women, however, and the mean leukocyte count at diagnosis of
major infection was 11 X 103/mm” for women in each
group.
Major infection. Six women (12%) given perioperative cefoxitin developed pelvic cellulitis postoperatively

compared to 14 women (28%) given placebo. All infections in both study groups occurred during the original hospitalization. Two women in each group developed either an infected pelvic hematoma or an abscess
in association with pelvic cellulitis that did not require
surgical drainage. No wound infections developed in
women given cefoxitin, but two women (4%) given
placebo developed an abdominal incision infection requiring suprafascial drainage. There were no significant differences in the variables relating to major
postoperative infection for women in either group, although mean duration of therapy was longer for
women in the placebo group (Table II). Surgical incision time was used to calculate time intervals for the
first two variables. Duration of therapy was measured
from initiation of treatment to discharge from the
hospital.
Seventy-five percent of women who developed major
infection following hysterectomy were treated with
cefoxitin, i.e., 67% and 79% of‘ women in cefoxitin and
placebo groups, respectively. There were no significant
intergroup differences in mean duration of treatment
(103 hours) or total hospital stay (8 days) for these
women (Student’s t test). The remainder were treated
with various combinations of antimicrobial agents. One
woman in each group treated originally with combination antimicrobial therapy had a third, anaerobic-specific agent added when the diagnosis of abscess or infected hematoma was made several days into therapy.
One woman in the placebo group treated with cefoxitin
had clindamycin added for the same reason. Histologic
evidence of chronic salpingitis or peritubal adhesions
was found in 44% of women in the cefoxitin group and
in 40% of women in the placebo group; the incidence

vaginal cuff of women with pelvic cellulitis and infected
abdominal incisions are presented in Table IV. A mean
of 3.1 isolates per site were recovered from sites of
major infection if the women had been given placebo
compared to a mean of 2.8 isolates per site for those in
the cefoxitin group. Aerobic isolates predominated,
but both aerobes and anaerobes were isolated from half
of the infection sites. Aerobes only were recovered
from 45% and anaerobes only from 5% of infection
sites. No intergroup difference in the resistance to
cefoxitin was identified in these isolates. There were no
positive blood cultures and the woman with asymptomatic bacteriuria had Eschprichia coli recovered from
the urine.
Febrile morbidity. In addition to those treated for
major postoperative infection, 21 women (42%) in the
cefoxitin group and 17 women (34%) in the placebo
group had temperature readings that met our criteria
for febrile morbidity. This occurred in both groups a
mean 55 hours after the incision was made. It was not
accompanied by symptoms or physical findings associated with major postoperative infection and antimicrobial therapy was not given.
Hospital stay. Hospital stays for women in various
categories are presented in Table III. The mean hospital stay for all women given perioperative cefoxitin was
significantly shorter than that for women given placebo
(Student’s t test, P < 0.05). There were no intergroup
differences in the other categories presented. However, there were significant intragroup differences.
The mean hospital stay for women who developed infection was significantly longer than that observed fat
those who did not (Student’s t and Mann-Whitney tests.
P < 0.001). The mean hospital stay for the two women
in the cefoxitin group who developed an infected hematoma or abscess was 8 days, identical to the mean
stay for the entire group with infection. The mean
hospital stay for the two women in the placebo group
with this diagnosis was 9 days. An incisional infection
was associated with a mean hospital stay of 13 days.
Microbiologic data. The isolates recovered from the
Poststudy analysis of risk factors for infection.
Three variables were found to be predictive of the development of major postoperative infection: the woman’s age, absence of excessive uterine bleeding, and absence of an abnormal uterus at bimanual examination
of the pelvis. The classification function (formula) that
was derived was known to allow prediction of major
postoperative infection with 73% accuracy. To utilize
the formula, one completed the following steps: (1)
The woman’s age was multiplied by a constant, 0.0781;
(2) if there was a history of excessive bleeding, a constant (1.739) was added to the product obtained in step
1 (normal menstruation increased the risk for infection); (3) if there was an enlarged uterus, a constant
(1.010) was added (a normal uterus increased the risk
for infection): (4) a constant (-3.680) was added and
addition was performed. The dividing line for these
calculations was -0.29. If a woman’s “score” was more
negative than -0.29, she was considered to be at risk
for the development of major infection and if the score
was more positive than -0.29, she was considered not
to be at risk. Practical application of this formula for
two different women presented in Table V predicted
that Patient A was at risk whereas Patient B was not.
There were 53 women whose scores predicted major
postoperative infection and who were given three 2 gm
doses of perioperative cefoxitin over 12 hours beginning preoperatively. The first dose was given in-

1964 report as those involving entry into the respiratory or gastrointestinal tract when no unusual contamination occurred.’ Swartz and Tanaree’ and others
have demonstrated that potential pathogenic bacteria
are present at the vaginal membrane despite thorough
vaginal preparation. Therefore, it would seem more
appropriate to include hysterectomy in this category.
The infection rate reported for this category was
10.8%’ and more closely approximates that appearing
in the gynecologic literature. A review of prospective,
randomized studies that used concurrent control subjects designed to evaluate antibiotic prophylaxis in abdominal hysterectomy was conducted. Fifteen studies
were identified.6-20 All authors presented explicit criteria for subject selection. The control subjects were
blinded to investigators in all but four studies.‘. ‘, “3 I7

tions in temperature elevations, infections, and hospital
stays were observed for women given antimicrobial
prophylaxis; they independently evaluated 1,382
women (Table VI).fi-‘” The antimicrobial agent administered was usually a cephalosporin and the most frequently used regimen was three doses within 12 hours
beginning preoperatively. The longest course of “prophylaxis” was 5 days. Most investigators defined febrile
morbidity as a temperature ~38” C (100.4” F) on two
occasions >24 hours postoperatively. Intervals between
temperature readings were 6 or more hours (three
studies) or on two separate days (four studies). Three
authors selected 38.3” C (101” F) on two occasions 6 or
more hours apart >48 hours postoperatively, however.“. ‘. “’ Many women with this diagnosis were given
antimicrobial therapy. Major infection included pelvic
cellulitis. pelvic abscess, and incisional infection or
abscess. Prophylaxis appeared to prevent febrile morbidity and major infection with equal efficacy. Urinary
tract infections were not included in the above data:
diminished incidence with prophylaxis was usually reported. Authors presenting data on hospital stay reported a statistically significant reduction in hospital
stay associated with prophylaxis (Table VI).
Five authors did not find prophylaxis beneficial
enough tojustify its recommendation at the completion
of their independent evaluations of 588 women undergoing abdominal hysterectomy (Table VII).‘6-20 There
was greater variation in antimicrobial agents administered by these authors although cephalosporins predominated. The duration of antimicrobial administration ranged from 4 hours to 5 days. Most authors selected temperature readings ~38” C on two occasions 6
or more hours apart >24 hours postoperatively to
define febrile morbidity. One author required 38” C on
two different days” and one author used a fever index.‘” Antimicrobial therapy was usually given to
women with febrile morbidity. Major pelvic infections
defined by these authors were similar to those utilized
by authors in Table VI. Authors in this group giving
hospital stay data reported that prophylaxis did not
significantly shorten hospital stay (Table VII).
To review our experience with this problem, we examined the medical records of the 670 women who
underwent elective abdominal hysterectomy for benign
disease in Parkland Memorial Hospital between July,
1976, and June, 1978. Beginning with the day of operation, the mean hospital stay for the 201 women
(36%) not given antimicrobial therapy at any time during their hospitalization was 5.6 days. Twelve percent
of the women treated with antibiotics were given no
definite diagnosis; their hospital stay was not prolonged. Urinary tract and respiratory infections were
infrequently diagnosed (4%). Presented in Fig. 1 are
the types of infection most frequently diagnosed and
the mean hospital stay observed for women in each
category beginning with the day of operation. It was
evident from these data that prevention of pelvic and
wound infection should dramatically reduce the requirement for postoperative antibiotic therapy and
should significantly shorten hospital stay.
Examination of the records of 112 women given
perioperative antimicrobial therapy indicated how infection rates might be altered. There were 27 women
given prophylaxis for rheumatic heart disease, 38
women treated intraoperatively because of findings
indicating previous pelvic infection, such as dilated fallopian tubes, and 47 women required hysterectomy because of failed medical management of acute pelvic
inflammatory disease. The 558 women given no
perioperative antimicrobial therapy were considered to
be control subjects. The incidences of pelvic cellulitis
were 46.5% in the control group, 22% in women given
prophylaxis for rheumatic heart disease, and 5% in
women given intraoperative antimicrobial therapy for
previous tubal infection. Incisional infections were observed in 6% of women in the control group only.
Thus, perioperative administration of antimicrobial
therapy appeared to reduce the incidence of these
major postoperative infections, although the majority
of women were actually given treatment and not prophylaxis. These retrospective data from our hospital
indicated that infection or at least postoperative antibiotic administration was significant in women undergoing elective abdominal hysterectomy (64%).
Neither literature review nor even a retrospective
review in one’s own hospital may accurately identify a
requirement for antibiotic prophylaxis in women electively scheduled for abdominal hysterectomy. Data
from our literature review indicated that prophylaxis
was not always beneficial. Sixty-four percent of 558
women in our retrospective review were treated with
antimicrobial agents. The true incidence of major infection requiring antimicrobial therapy in the placebo
group of women in this prospective study was only 
Volume 147
Number 5
32%, however. An additional 34% of women in this
group developed febrile morbidity that did not require
therapy or prolong hospital stay. The sum of these two
percentages was almost identical to the 64% given therapy in our retrospective review.
There may be a tendency to equate febrile morbidity
with infection, but such a decision in our hospital
would result in unjustified overutilization of antibiotics.
Forty-three percent of women given cefoxitin and
65% of women given placebo who developed only febrile morbidity had temperature readings 238.4” C
(101 .l” F) on at least one occasion and half had this
reading on two occasions. These women had no other
signs or symptoms of infection and their mean hospital
stay was not significantly prolonged. As was the case
when women required antimicrobial therapy, the diagnosis of febrile morbidity was usually made during the
second postoperative day (85% of cases). There were
no significant intergroup or intragroup differences in
the time interval from operation to diagnosis of febrile
morbidity for those who did and did not develop major
infection. Only 37% of women who developed febrile
morbidity required antimicrobial therapy. The diagnosis of major infection was made a mean of 29 hours
following the diagnosis of febrile morbidity, so temperature elevation alone was not a valid predictor of
infection.
Mention should be made about the selection of
cefoxitin as the antimicrobial agent for the treatment of
women who developed a major postoperative infection
in this study. It has been shown to be quite effective as a
single agent for the treatment of women with acute
polymicrobial pelvic infections.” One might assume
that if a major pelvic or wound infection developed
following prophylaxis, it would develop because resistant organisms persisted or emerged. With equal clinical success of cefoxitin as primary therapy for infections in both groups of women in this study, it is
obvious that the origin of these infections is more
complex.
The incidence of pelvic cellulitis in these two groups
of women revealed a difference that was significant
(cefoxitin, 12%; placebo, 28%) but not statistically so
(x2, P > 0.05). The same was true for abdominal incision infection alone. Combined, however, there was a
statistically significant difference between groups (x2,
P < 0.05). With a major infection rate of 32% in
women in our control group in the comparative study,
it was hoped that a high-risk group could be identified
to obviate the administration of prophylaxis to all
women. Our attempt at this was unsuccessful. With a
major infection incidence of 28% in women at lower
risk, we believe that prophylaxis is indicated for all
women undergoing abdominal hysterectomy in Parkland Memorial Hospital. However, we cannot recomPrevention of infection after hysterectomy 527
mend perioperative prophylaxis routinely for others.
If a major infection rate in women undergoing elective
abdominal hysterectomy exceeds 1 O%, prophylaxis
may be warranted.
A short course of cefoxitin prophylaxis significantly
reduced the incidence of major postoperative infection
and significantly shortened the hospital stay. There was
no evidence to suggest that infection was masked.
Cefoxitin was associated with a blunted leukocyte response to operation but not a blunted febrile response.
Febrile morbidity alone did not predict future infection, require therapy, or prolong hospital stay.

Management of patients with hyperprolactinemia and normal

Forty women with hyperprolactinemia with and without radiologic evidence of prolactin-secreting pituitary
adenoma were prospectively treated with bromocriptine. On the basis of tomographic studies, the patients
were divided into either a microadenoma group (N = 19) or no adenoma group (N = 21). Both groups had
similar distributions as to obstetric history, menstrual abnormalities, levels of baseline serum luteinizing
hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and thyrotropin. Patients in the adenoma group had significantly
higher (p < 0.001) baseline serum prolactin levels (173 ? 4.4 rig/ml) than those of patients without
adenoma (61.1 * 4.5 rig/ml). Patients without an adenoma required significantly less bromocriptine (5 to
7.5 mg) (p < 0.005) to normalize serum prolactin or establish a pregnancy than did those who had an
adenoma (5 to 20 mg). Similarly, patients with adenoma resumed ovulatory cycles (8.7 ? 1.2 versus
5.7 r 0.06 weeks), had their galactorrhea disappear (11.3 ? 2.1 versus 5.6 ? 1 .l weeks), and become
pregnant (16.2 i 2.5 versus 9.8 2 1.5 weeks) in a significantly longer time (p c 0.01) than did those who
had no adenomas. There was no significant difference in the pregnancy rate between the groups, and the
overall rate was 86% of 28 patients desiring pregnancy. No complications were observed during
pregnancy. The conclusion is that both patients with and those without radiologic evidence of a
prolactin-secreting pituitary adenoma can be safely treated with bromocriptine. In addition, the resumption
of ovulatory cycles is more important than the absolute normalization of serum prolactin. (AM. J. OBSTET.
GYNECOL. 147:528, 1983.)
The development of pharmacologic agents with dopamine agonistic effects offers a new dimension in the
treatment of patients with hyperprolactinemia.’ Although the presence of a prolactin-secreting pituitary
adenoma can be suspected on the basis of a serum prolactin level greater than 200 rig/ml, the most reliable
and accepted method has been the hypocycloidal polytomographic examination of the sella turcica or, more
recently. the use of a computerized brain scan with 2
mm cuts.‘I--’ Treatment with bromocriptine is recommended in patients with hyperprolactinemia in whom a
prolactin-secreting pituitary adenoma has been ruled
out. In contrast, the treatment of choice for patients

with a pituitary adenoma has not been definitely established. This is true especially if the patient desires
pregnancy. Transsphenoidal resection of the adenoma
has been recommended for patients with microadenomas, with a variable degree of success.“-* The use of
bromocriptine has been demonstrated to reduce the
size of some pituitary adenomas in vivo. In addition, in
vitro studies have been shown to have an inhibitory
effect on human adenomas and a deleterious effect on
rat GH3 tumorous prolactin-secreting cells but not in
normal rat lactotropes.“-”
In this study, 40 women with hyperprolactinemia,
with and without radiologic evidence of a prolactin-secreting pituitary adenoma, were prospectively treated
with bromocriptine.
