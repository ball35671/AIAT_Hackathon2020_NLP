Abstract
The literature confirms the benefit of antibiotic prophylaxis to reduce postoperative febrile and infectious morbidity in women undergoing vaginal hysterectomy; however, the ideal antibiotic to use prophylactically has not been determined. In this prospective, randomized, double-blind, multicenter study, the prophylactic efficacy of single-dose mezlocillin (4 gm) was compared with cefotaxime (1 gm). Each drug regimen was administered within five to 130 minutes prior to commencement of surgery. Thirty-eight of 41 (93%) patients receiving mezlocillin and 43 of 44 (98%) patients receiving cefotaxime had no evidence of infectious morbidity. There was no significant difference in outcome between the two groups. Because information on the pharmacodynamics of mezlocillin in pelvic tissues is scant, patients at one site were also evaluated for serum and uterine tissue mezlocillin levels. Serum samples obtained at the time the uterus was removed contained from 81.2 to 358 μg mezlocillin/ml with an average serum concentration of 207.5 μg/ml. The average tissue level was 117.2 μg/ml and ranged from 27% to 98% of the serum levels.
