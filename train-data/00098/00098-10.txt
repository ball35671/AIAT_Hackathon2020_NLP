ABSTRACT: A single dose of cefonicid given 3.5-5.0 hours or
0.5-1.0 hour preoperatively was compared with cefoxitin given as
five doses beginning 0.5-1.0 hour preoperatively for prophylaxis of
infection in 202 patients undergoing vaginal or abdominal
hysterectomy. The administration of cefonicid 3.5-5.0 hours
preoperatively was intended to simulate situations where surgery
may be delayed or prolonged. The trial was double-blind, and
patients were randomized to one of the three regimens. Operative
site infections were noted in 6.2 percent of patients (7/113) who
received cefonicid 3.5-5.0 hours preoperatively, in 7.0 percent of
patients (3/43) who received cefonicid 0.5-1.0 hour preoperatively,
and in 4.3 percent of patients (2146) who received cefoxitin
(p >0.05). Enterococci were isolated most frequently from
operative-site infections. When administered 3.5-5.0 hours
preoperatively, cefonicid was as effective as more traditional
regimens.

WOUND AND PELVIC INFECTIONS occur relatively frequently after hysterectomies and lead to lengthened
hospital stays and increased costs. Without antimicrobials, postoperative wound and pelvic infections occur
in as many as 20-30 percent of patients. 1-4 Risk factors
for postoperative infection after hysterectomy include
long operations, young age, abdominal approach, and
clinic patient status.'
Attempts to reduce the incidence of postoperative
infections following hysterectomy require recognition
of individual risk factors, application of meticulous
surgical techniques, and judicious use of prophylactic

antimicrobials. The most important factor in the use of
prophylactic antimicrobials concerns the timing of administration in relation to the operation. The antimicrobial should be administered prior to the surgical procedure so that it is available in serum and wound tissues
during the operation.?'
Appropriately timed prophylactic antimicrobials
should be administered preoperatively but not so far in
advance of a surgical procedure that the antimicrobial
effect terminates before the operation does. The use of
antimicrobials with short serum half-lives (lessthan one
hour) is unlikely to provide adequate intraoperative
antimicrobial activity when administered more than
two to three hours prior to an operation or with prolonged operations.v"
This study was designed to examine the potential benefits of cefonicid, a long-acting cephalosporin, in situations simulating delayed or prolonged operations.
Cefonicid was administered in a single dose 3.5-5.0
hours preoperatively to simulate situations where surgery may be delayed or prolonged. This regimen was
compared with a single dose of cefonicid administered
0.5-1.0 hour preoperatively and with five doses of
cefoxitin begun 0.5-1.0 hour preoperatively. The objective was to determine if cefonicid would be as effective
given 3.5-5.0 hours preoperatively as would the control
regimens.
Methods
Two hundred fifty-two hospitalized patients from two study centers were entered into the trial. The study was approved by each institution's human investigation review board and all patients provided
written informed consent prior to the study. To be considered for
study entry, the patients had to be 18years of age and scheduled for
abdominal or vaginal hysterectomy with or without salpingooophorectomy. Patients were excluded if they had a fever preoperatively (two consecutive temperature measurements of 38°C at least 4
DICp, The Annals ofPharmacotherapy • 1989 September, Volume 23 • 655
hours apart within 24 hours prior to surgery), infection that was
found at the time of surgery, if they were pregnant or lactating, if they
had a history of hypersensitivity to cephalosporins or penicillins, or
had multiple drug allergies. In addition, patients were excluded if
there was evidence of renal impairment (creatinine clearance <50
mL/min), if antimicrobials were administered within 72 hours of surgery, or if any investigational drug was administered within one
month prior to the start of the study or at any time during the study.
The operative techniques were similar at each of the institutions and
were performed by a variety of staff and attending surgeons at both
sites.
Patients were randomly assigned to one of three drug regimens.
The randomization schedule allowed for approximately 50 percent of
patients to receive cefonicid I g in a single dose 3.5-5.0 hours prior to
surgery; 25 percent to receive cefonicid I g in a single dose 0.5-1.0
hour before surgery; and 25 percent to receive cefoxitin 2 g 0.5-1.0
hour prior to surgery followed by 2 g q6h for four more doses. All
study antimicrobials were administered either iv or im so that patients
and investigators (or other personnel performing patient evaluations)
were not aware of which regimen was being administered. Patients
receiving cefonicid were given five additional doses of D5W or NaCI
0.9070 as placebo; patients receiving cefoxitin received one placebo
dose 3.5-5.0 hours preoperatively and then five antimicrobial doses.
Immediately before surgery the vagina of each patient was cleansed
with povidone iodine.
Within 48 hours prior to surgery a complete history and physical
examination were performed. Postoperatively, patients were evaluated by the investigators for the occurrence of infections and adverse
drug reactions. Patients were examined daily for the first seven postoperative days, twice weekly thereafter until hospital discharge, and
then at four to six weeks after the operation. Assessment for postoperative infection included evaluation of the operative site (skin incision sites and vagina for evidence of pelvic cellulitis and vaginal cuff
abscess). Infections occurring at sites not related to the primary operative site (e.g., urinary or respiratory tracts), as well as temperature of
38°C at any time after the first postoperative day were also noted.
Information was collected regarding potential risk factors for infection and included obesity (at least 50 percent above ideal weight for
height and sex by the Metropolitan Life scale), malignancy, diabetes
mellitus, asplenia, leukemia, lymphoma, malnutrition, neutropenia,
concomitant corticosteroid therapy, surgery exceeding two hours,
greater than two weeks duration of hospitalization prior to surgery,
and premenopausal status. The length of postoperative stay was also
noted.
Specimens (e.g., wound drainage, urine, blood, and sputum) were
collected from any sites suspected of being infected and were cultured
for aerobic and anaerobic organisms. For any suspected pathogen,
the susceptibility (minimum inhibitory concentrations or disc zone
diameters) to the study antimicrobials was determined.
Success of prophylaxis was defined as an uneventful postoperative
course without clinical and/or microbiologic evidence of infection.
Primary prophylactic failure was defined as a postoperative course
with clinical and/or microbiologic evidence of operative site infection; secondary prophylactic failure was defined as a postoperative
course with clinical and/or microbiologic evidence of distant-site
infection. The significance of differences in age or duration of operation were evaluated using the r-test, and the incidences of infection
were evaluated using a chi-square test (without Yates' correction). A p
value of sO.05 was accepted as significant.
Results
Of 252 patients entered into the trial, 202 completed
the study and were judged evaluable for efficacy of prophylaxis. Fifty patients were excluded (Table 1). Of the
202 patients evaluated, 113 received cefonicid 3.5-5.0
hours preoperatively, 43 received cefonicid 0.5-1.0
hour preoperatively, and 46 received multiple-dose
cefoxitin. There were no significant differences
(p >0.05) among the three groups with respect to age
and duration of operation. Also, the groups were similar with respect to operations performed and risk factors for infection (Table 2).
Operative-site infections occurred in 12 patients. The

overall rate ofsuch infection (primary prophylaxis failure) was 5.9 percent and was not significantly different
among the study groups (p > 0.5 by chi-square analysis)
(Table 3). Operative-site infections occurred more frequently with vaginal hysterectomies than with abdominal hysterectomies (8.9 vs. 5.1 percent, respectively),
but this difference was not significant. It appeared that
vaginal wound infections were more common in the
groups receiving cefonicid, but when the results from
the two cefonicid regimens were combined there were
no significant differences between drugs (p > 0.5, chisquare). The reasons for the slightly higher incidence of

apparent from examination of the known infectious
risk factors.
Distant-site infections occurred in 5.0 percent of
patients and febrile morbidity in 3.5 percent, both factors having no significant difference among groups
(p >0.1, chi-square). When the cefonicid groups were
combined, the difference between drugs in the rate of
distant-site infections was not significant (p > 0.05).
Eight of ten such infections were of the urinary tract
and unrelated to the surgical procedures. Most of these
urinary tract infections occurred in association with
postoperative bladder catheterization. One patient,
who underwent a vaginal hysterectomy in the cefonicid
0.5- to 1.0-hour preoperative group, had both a wound
infection and a distant-site infection (urinary tract). In
this patient, pathogens were not isolated from the
infected vaginal wound and mixed flora were isolated
from the urine.
Culture data were available for 10 of the 12 patients
who experienced operative-site infections (Table 4).
Enterococci were isolated most frequently from
operative-site infections (five patients in the cefonicid
3.5- to 5.0-hour group). Gamma streptococci were isolated from operative-site infections in two patients who
received cefonicid 3.5-5.0 hours preoperatively, and
Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated from one patient
in the cefonicid 0.5- to 1.0-hour group and one in the
cefoxitin group.
Adverse effects associated with the prophylactic regimens occurred relatively infrequently and were mild.
One patient who received cefonicid 0.5-1.0 hour preoperatively experienced a mild facial rash possibly related
to the study medication, and this patient was withdrawn
from the study. Two additional patients (one who received cefoxitin and one who received cefonicid 0.5-1.0
hour preoperatively)also experiencedmild rash, but they
remained in the study. Twopatients who receivedcefonicid 0.5-1.0 hour preoperatively complained of postoperative abdominal pain with nausea and vomiting (l
patient) or distention (1 patient). Mild elevations in liver

Discussion
The use of prophylactic antimicrobials has become
well accepted for vaginal hysterectomies but it remains
somewhat controversial for abdominal ones. A number
of controlled trials have found first- and second-generation cephalosporins to reduce postoperative infection
rates with abdominal hysterectomies. 2-4.10.11 In one
analysis, a short course of prophylactic cephalosporins
was demonstrated to reduce postoperative infection by
33 percent and this reduction was found to justify the
cost of using prophylaxis with abdominal hysterectomies.'? The authors stress, however,that the costs of the
antimicrobial regimen must remain relatively low for
this cost benefit to exist.
Although the need for preoperative (vs. postoperative) antimicrobial administration is well recognized,
the timing of that administration is an important but
less appreciated consideration. The relatively short
duration of action for some cephalosporins may pose
increased risk of infection when these agents are
ordered to be administered at a fixed time or on call to
the operating room. Delays in operating room schedules commonly occur and may result in administration
of antimicrobials too early. In one study of an obstetric/gynecologic service, the lag time from prophylactic
antimicrobial administration to incision was 0.92-1.75
hours when the agent was administered in the operating
room and 1.8-5.0 hours when the agent was administered on call. 13
Increased risk of infection may result from the use of
short-acting antimicrobials before long operations.
Shapiro et al. noted that for abdominal and vaginal hysterectomies the value of prophylactic cefazolin diminishes rapidly with increasing duration of surgery,and by
were noted in three percent or less of patients in each
group.

just over three hours after the start of the operation
prophylaxis has no effect. The data were not sufficient,
however, to determine if antimicrobial washout was
related to the greater risk of infection. 5 With delayed or
prolonged operations, cephalosporins with long elimination half-lives may be advantageous because preoperative administration will still provide antimicrobial
concentrations above the minimum inhibitory concentrations of most common pathogens.
Our trial demonstrated that a single-dose of a longacting agent, cefonicid, resulted in a rate of postoperative infection similar to that achieved with a standard
perioperative regimen (multiple-dose cefoxitin).
Cefonicid was effective whether given immediately or
3.5-5.0 hours preoperatively. The incidence of distant
infections was greater in the cefonicid groups, but these
infections are not believed related to perioperative use
of antimicrobials.
Studies using single preoperative doses of cephalosporins for hysterectomies have been previously reported and those specifically comparing single doses of
long-acting cephalosporins with multiple doses of
short-acting cephalosporins have shown the regimens
to be equivalent. 14-19 None of these studies, however,
examined the longer-acting cephalosporins under conditions simulating delayed or prolonged operations, as
did our study. Generally, antimicrobials should be given
immediately before the start of an operation. However,
in institutions where fixed timing of prophylactic antimicrobial administration is necessary and delays in
operating room schedules are common, or in surgical
procedures that are likely to be prolonged, the use of
cephalosporins with long durations of action may have
advantages.
