A double-blind, placebo-controlled and randomized trial involving a total of 295
patients was carried out to define the role of chemoprophylaxis in major gynaecological surgery in our hospital. Perioperative administration of a single dose of
ampicillin (500 mg) plus sulbactam (500 mg) (regimen A), or ampicillin (500 mg)
plus metronidazole (1 g suppository) (regimen B), gave similar results. After
abdominal hysterectomy, the rates of post-operative wound infection and febrile
morbidity were significantly reduced from 24% (12/49) and 20% (10/49) in the
placebo group to 3-4% (A = 2/51, B = 3/58) and 2% (A = 1/51, B= 1/58) respectively. After vaginal hysterectomy, pelvic/vaginal infection or febrile morbidity
was found in 30% (3/10) of patients in the placebo group but none in either treatment group (A= 10, B = 8). After other types of operation, the rates of infectious
complications were reduced, but not statistically significantly, from 11% (4/38)
to 4% (A + B 2/71). However, the rates of post-operative urinary tract infection
remained similar in the placebo and treatment groups (12-16%).
Introduction
Perioperative chemoprophylaxis has been shown to be effective in reducing the rate
of infection after vaginal hysterectomy. The benefit after abdominal hysterectomy
is less clear-cut and depends upon the local conditions, i.e. the rate of infectious complications that the surgeon has previously encountered (Hirschmann & Inui, 1980).
Sulbactam (penicillanic acid sulphone), a /?-lactamase inhibitor, has been shown to
enhance the activity of ampicillin against certain y?-lactamase-producing strains.
(English et al., 1978). The in-vilro antimicrobial activity of the combination of
sulbactam and ampicillin, appears to be suitable for chemoprophylaxis in gynaecological surgery. It is active against anaerobes and penicillinase-producing Staphylococcus aureus (Retsema, English & Girard, 1980), an apparent advantage over
the combination of ampicillin and metronidazole, which is commonly used for
chemoprophylaxis in gynaecological surgery. Until the time of this study, there was
no uniform practice of prophylaxis amongst the surgeons in our hospital. We therefore carried out a study to define the role of single dose perioperative chemoprophylaxis in our hospital and to compare the efficacy of the combination of sulbactam
plus ampicillin with that of metronidazole plus ampicillin in single dose regimens.

Materials and methods
Patients for elective major gynaecological surgery were randomly allocated to one
of three groups:
Group A: received a placebo suppository 2 h prior to surgery followed by
sulbactam 500 mg plus ampicillin 500 mg iv immediately after induction
of anaesthesia.
Group B: received a metronidazole suppository (1 g), 2 h prior to surgery followed
by ampicillin 500 mg iv immediately after induction of anaesthesia.
Group C: received a placebo suppository 2 h prior to surgery.
The study was so designed that the medical and nursing personnel would not be
aware of the group allocation of each patient studied. After surgery, the patients were
assessed daily by the independent research nurse for the first week or until discharge
if infectious complications occurred, and also six weeks after discharge in the out
patient clinic. Specimens of mid-stream urine were routinely examined microbiologically before the operation and at the end of urethral catheterization. Urinary
tract infection was denned as the presence of ^ 105
 organisms/ml of urine. All post
operative infections were treated according to normal clinical practice.
Infected abdominal wounds were graded as follows:
Minor: presence of erythematous induration, discharge of serosanguineous fluid or
pus, or stitch abscess.
Major, dehiscence or gaping of at least half the length of the abdominal wound.
Pelvic/vaginal infection was denned as the presence of offensive vaginal discharge,
vault haematoma, or pelvic pain with vaginal induration. Febrile morbidity was
denned as episodes when the oral temperature was elevated above 38°C on two
separate occasions at least 6 h apart, excluding the first 24 h.
The operations were classified according to the operative sites. Abdominal and
vaginal operations (type 1) comprises abdominal operations with entry into the
vagina, i.e., abdominal hysterectomy. Abdominal operations (type 2) include all
surgery in the pelvic cavity without entry into the vagina, e.g., tubal surgery,
oophorectomy, myomectomy. Vaginal operations with peritoneal opening (type 3)
comprises vaginal hysterectomy with or without repair. Vaginal operations without
peritoneal opening (type 4) include surgery in the vagina only, e.g., pelvic floor
repair.
Results
Two hundred and ninety-five patients completed the study. A further 50 patients
had to be withdrawn as they required antibiotic treatment because of the clinical
findings during surgery, or a change in the types of operation in the theatre, or failure
to obtain details at follow up.
Table I shows that there was no significant difference in the distribution of age,
weight, anaemia (^ ll-0g/100ml), postmenopausal status and types of operation
among patients in the three study groups.

(Tables II and III) eight were found in the placebo group, and one caused by a strain
of penicillinase-producing Staph. aureus in the sulbactam plus ampicillin group.
Swabs from six of the eight major wound infections in the placebo group yielded
Staph. aureus; four strains were resistant to ampicillin. All the seven strains of Staph.
aureus were sensitive to sulbactam and ampicillin by disc method. The wound swab
from one patient yielded no growth, and from another yielded Staph. epidermidis,
the sensitivity of which was not tested. Both patients responded to a course of
ampicillin and metronidazole.
No significant difference was found among the three groups in the rates of UTI
and in the types of urinary pathogens isolated or their sensitivity patterns. Escherichia coli was responsible for 60% of the UTIs found in all groups, faecal streptococci
and other members of the Enterobacteriaceae, e.g. Proteus, Klebsiella were the next
most common organisms found. The number of patients who required post-operative catheterization was similar for the three study groups. Among the non-infected
patients, the duration of surgery for all types of operation was similar for all three
study groups. No significant side-effect was observed during the study.

(1983) also reported a significant reduction in the incidence of post-operative UTIs
after the use of single dose, perioperative cefuroxime in abdominal hysterectomy.
During the study, we found that the regimen of giving a single intravenous injection of ampicillin plus sulbactam perioperatively was easier to administer than that
of giving metronidazole rectally in the ward followed by ampicillin given intravenously perioperatively. Because of the high cost of intravenous metronidazole, we
had chosen the rectal suppository.
There are a number of reports in the literature in which regime of single dose has
been compared with that of multiple doses. Lett et al. (1977) compared single-dose
cephazolin with three doses of cephaloridine, Mendelson et al. (1979) compared a
single dose with five doses of cephradine and Hamod et al. (1980) compared a single
dose with seven doses of cephalothin. These authors found no significant differences
in infectious complications or the length of hospital stay. More prolonged use of
antibiotics may not enhance the efficacy of prophylaxis and may, in theory at least,
increase the risk of drug-related side-effects and the emergence of resistant organisms
(Duff & Park, 1980).
In conclusion, we found the use of single dose perioperative ampicillin plus metronidazole or ampicillin plus sulbactam equally effective in reducing significantly the
number of post-operative wound infections and febrile morbidity but not urinary
tract infections after abdominal or vaginal hysterectomy.
