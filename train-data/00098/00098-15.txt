Abstract
To determine the unbiased incidence and types of postoperative infection and their alteration(s) by antimicrobial prophylaxis, a prospective double-blind study was performed using perioperative intramuscular cefoxitin or placebo given to premenopausal women undergoing vaginal hysterectomy at Parkland Memorial Hospital. The clinical and surgical profiles of the 2 groups of women were similar, but there were marked differences in their postoperative clinical courses. Only 8% of the 50 women given cefoxitin had major postoperative infection, compared to 57% of the 49 women given placebo (P < .001); this was associated with a 2.8-day reduction in the hospital stay for those given cefoxitin (P < .001). No clinically significant side effects were observed.
