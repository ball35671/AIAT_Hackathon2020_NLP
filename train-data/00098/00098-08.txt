OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to determine whether the use of preoperative antibiotics prevents serious
infections associated with total abdominal hysterectomy.
STUDY DESIGN: We identified 25 random ized controlled trials of antibiotic prophylaxis that used rigorous
protocols. We performed meta-analyses and cumulative meta-analyses for all of the trials, and then we
performed separate meta-analyses for cefazolin, metronidazole, and tinidazole.
RESULTS: Overall, 21.1% (373 of 1768) of the patients who did not receive antibiotic prophylaxis had
serious infections after abdominal hysterectomy. Among patients who received any antibiotics, we found
that 9.0% (166/1836) had serious postoperative infections ; among those who received cefazolin,
metronidazole, or tinidazole, 11.4% (70 of 615), 6.3% (17 of 269), and 5.0% (5 of 101), respectively, had
serious postoperative morbidity. The differences in the prevalence of infection between women who
received prophylaxis and women who did not receive prophy laxis were statistically significant (any
antibiotics, p = 0.00001 ; cefazolin, p = 0.00021 ; metronidazole, p = 0.015; and tinidazole, p = 0.034).
CONCLUSION: Because preoperative antibiotics are highly effective in the prevention of serious
infections associated with total abdominal hysterectomy, we believe they should be used routinely. In
addition, we believe that the use of controls who receive no treatment is no longer justified in trials of
antibiotic prophylaxis for total abdominal hysterectomy. (AM J OBSTET GVNECOL 1993;169:1119-24.)

The use of antibiotic prophylaxis for selected patients

still no conse nsus on the efficacy of antibiotic prophylaxis for elective total abdominal hyster ectomy for benign indications. In fact, of the major gynecology textbooks published in the United Sta tes, only Dro egemueller's' considers antibiotic prophylaxis for total

abdominal hysterectomy to be a standard of care on the
basis of cost-benefit analysis.
Becau se of the numerous randomized controlled trials that have already been performed, an extensive
database exists for studying this question. A traditional
literature review of these data offers a qualitative impression of efficacy, but in our view the preferable
approach is meta-an alysis- a statistical method for
combining data from individual studies to obtain a
quantitative estimate of overall effect. In this article we
present such an analysis with the intent of determining
the role of preoperative antibiotics in the prevention of
serious infectious mo rbidity associated with total abdominal hysterectomy.
Methods
We reviewed all Engli sh-language randomized controlled trials published since 1971 (no trials on our
topic were found before that year) that evaluated the
efficacy of prophylactic perioperative antibiotics in the
reduction of serious infectious morbidity in elective
total abdominal hysterectomy. Serious infectious morbidity was defin ed as one or more of the following: (1)
an abdom inal wound infection, (2) wound discharge or
abscess , (3) pelvic cellulitis, (4) pelvic abscess, (5) vagi1119
1120 Mittendorfet al.
nal cuff abscess, (6) postoperative pelvic inflammatory
disease, and (7) postoperative septicemia. Although
data on febrile morbidity and nosocomial urinary tract
infection were included in most randomized controlled
trials, we chose to exclude that information because in
our opinion it was not germane to this meta-analysis.
The various studies, which included private and
clinic patients in community and university hospitals
from several countries, were collected by means of a
MEDLARS computer-assisted literature search after
which a search of review articles and bibliographies was
conducted. After a review ofthe various study protocols,
we assigned a quality score to each of the randomized
controlled trials." To control bias, our scoring system
emphasized the comparison of a priori standards.
The studies included in this meta-analysis met the
following criteria: (I) The antibiotic-treatment and the
control regimens were assigned at random; (2) the
outcome was evaluated prospectively in relation to the
serious infectious morbidity; (3) one of the study groups
was placed on a control regimen. Each trial was counted
onl y once for the meta-analysis. However, in five trials
two different antibiotic regimens were compared with
the control.
The outcome we sought in all studies was the presence or absence of postoperative infection. Thus the
results were dichotomous (yes or no), and in each study
the rates were compared between the experimental
(antibiotic) and the control (usually a placebo) groups.
Many methods and reporting units are available to
the meta-analyst interested in combining such data.
Some use the fixed effects model such as that of Mantei
and Haenszel' and Yusuf et al.S, whereas others use the
random-effects models of Cochran" and Dersimonian
and Laird." We employed both methods to detect differences," although we preferred the random-effects
model.
The results of the accumulated fourfold tables can be
reported as risk ratios, log-odds ratios, or risk (percentage) differences. Again, we preferred the log-odds
method. The results of our meta-analysis are thus
presented as the random effects , log-odds ratio, and
accompanying two-sided p and Z values are reported.
An important principle of all meta-analyses is that each
study is treated as a unit of observation, and the
estimates and variances of each study are considered.
The software that we used calculates the meta-analytic results by both the random and fixed-effects models, the former having a more conservative result when
heterogeneity ofthe data exists ." When the results differ
according to method and units, the differences are
mentioned in the text. Differences between the methods become clinically important only when the numbers
of studies are small, the summation fourfold table
contains occasional zeros, and there is some heterogeNovember 1993

neity of the results. All of those factors applied to our
three meta-analyses of individual drug effects, but none
of them applied when all of the trials were combined.
The technique of cumulative meta-analysis is important in this and most "retrospective" meta-analyses
because the year in which any demonstrated effect
became statistically significant is of interest. In this
technique, a new meta-analysis is performed every time
a new trial is reported. Trends may be as important in
interpretation of the data as the year in which various
levels of statistical significant are achieved."
Results
Twenty-five trials'":" met the criteria for inclusion in
this meta-analysis and provided outcome data in an
extractable format. Six additional trials met the initial
criteria for inclusion but did not present extractable,
serious infectious morbidity data for abdominal hysterectornies .i"?" Cefazolin was evaluated against a placebo
in seven ofthe 25 acceptable studies, metronidazole was
evaluated in five trials, and tinidazole (a nitroimidazole
that has been used in Europe) was evaluated in three
studies. Mezlocillin, cefoxitin, and cephradine were
each used in two trials . The following antibiotics were
used in one trial each: cephaloridine, penicillin, cotrimoxazole, cephalothin, carbenicillin, cefoperazone,
cefamandole, ampicillin-sulbactam, ampicillin-metronidazole, and clindamycin. In five of the studies two
different antibiotics were tested against a placebo, and
in one study two different doses of the same drug were
used. Thus 31 separate drug-placebo comparisons occurred in 25 trials. The mean quality score of the
protocols for the 25 randomized controlled trials that
we included in our meta-analysis was 0.39 (95% confidence interval 0.35 to 0.44; range 0.17 to 0.63). In 20
of the trials, preoperative antibiotics were given
parenterally. In three of the trials, preoperative drugs
were given by mouth (tinidazole in two studies and
metronidazole in one study) , and metronidazole was
given as an intravaginal suppository in two other control trials. Fig. I shows the odds ratio and 95% confidence interval for the combined studies. The point
estimate of the odds ratio failed to show a protective
effect of prophylactic antibiotics in only three studies.
Thirteen of the trials whose point estimates showed a
protective effect for preoperative antibiotics reached
statistical significance. It is clear that prophylactic antibiotics lower the frequency of serious infection rates.
The graph of the cumulative meta-analysis data indicates that the effect has been statistically significant
since the first reported trial in 1972 .
Three or more randomized controlled trials compared the effects of three drugs - cefazolin, metronidazole, and tinidazole-with a control. In all instances

tinidazole are included.
[tinidazole]), the antibiotic protected against infection
with statistical significance, but the year in which the
effect became statistically significant varied according to
the technique used, for reasons discussed in the Methods section. It should also be emphasized that the
numbers of events in these studies are small, and, as in
the case of tinidazole, changing one seriously morbid
patient from the therapeutic group to the control
group could change the conclusion.
Among all of the controls in the 25 separate randomized controlled trials included in the meta-analysis,
21.1 % (373 of 1768) had serious postoperative
morbidity; among patients who received any antibiotic
prophylaxis, only 9.0% (166 of 1836) had serious infections. Among patients who received cefazolin in randomized controlled trials, 11.4% (70 of 615) had serious
postoperative morbidity, and serious infection deve'loped in 6.3% (17 of 269) of patients who received
prophylactic metronidazole. Of all of the patients who
received tinidazole, 5.0% (5 of 101) had serious postoperative morbidity.
Comment
Our cumulative meta-analyses have shown that antibiotics are highly protective against serious infectious
morbidity associated with total abdominal hysterectomy. Overall, antibiotic prophylaxis can prevent more
than one half (9.0% versus 21.1%) of the serious infectious morbidity experienced by women who undergo
this surgical procedure. Although controversy may still
exist concerning the benefits of one antibiotic versus
another, we believe that the question of antibiotic prophylaxis for this indication has been answered by this
meta-analysis.
Volume 169, Number 5
AmJ Obstet Gynecol
Why has there been such controversy over the use of
antibiotic prophylaxis, and why has there been such a
long delay in recognizing the efficacy of antibiotic
prophylaxis for abdominal hysterectomy? First, trials
are often performed simultaneously. Thus the published results of one controlled trial cannot exert influence on the design of another concurrent trial. Moreover, even when trials are not running simultaneously,
there is a median 3-year delay between initiation of a
study and the publication of its results. For example,
because five of the randomized controlled trials that
used cefazolin were published between 1978 and 1980,
when the inappropriateness of a no-treatment control
group became clear, it was not possible for any of the
prinicpal investigators to have been aware of that fact.
The latest study that compares the outcome of patients
who received cefazolin with a group of controls who
received no treatment was published in 1986.
Naturally, those who test the efficacy of antibiotics in
the prevention ofserious infection after total abdominal
hysterectomy are obligated to review the available results of past trials before deciding whether to conduct
another study. Moreover, to help ensure that a study
has adequate power to minimize the occurrence of a
type II error (an error in which the researcher fails to
establish the benefits of antibiotic prophylaxis when, in
fact, there is a benefit), it is necessary to determine the
adequacy of sample sizes before conducting a randomized controlled trial. Of the 25 trials included in this
meta-analysis, we found that only seven protocols provided evidence that sample sizes had been calculated,
and to our knowledge none of the protocols considered
past trials when the numbers of patients necessary for
inclusion in their trials were determined.
Second, despite the usefulness of meta-analysis, some
investigators object to pooling the results of both statistically significant and statistically nonsignificant trials.
Opponents of pooling cite differing definitions of drug
regimens and end points and inherent differences in
patients and hospitals that exist between the various
randomized controlled trials . Although 15 different
antibiotics and three different modes of administration
(parenteral, oral, or intravaginal) were used in our
meta-analysis, all were intended to decrease the risk of
serious infectious morbidity after total abdominal hysterectomy. In our opinion, all 25 of the randomized
controlled trials included in our meta-analysis were
sufficiently alike in both definition of end points and
regimen so that pooling did not violate statistical principles. If the results of the various studies had been
pooled at an earlier date, the inappropriateness of
controls who received no treatment would have been
discovered in 1980 for cefazolin, in 1984 for metronidazole, and in 1986 for tinidazole.
Third, some clinicians may have rejected the concluMittendorf et al. 1123
sions of the statistically significant randomized controlled trials because of doubts concerning their quality.
As we have already reported, the average quality score
of the protocols for the 25 randomized controlled trials
that we included in our meta-analysis was 0.39 (95%
confidence interval 0.35 to 0.44, range 0.17 to 0.63). By
comparison, the mean quality score for > 300 miscellaneous randomized controlled trials was found to be
0.42 .41 Thus in terms of this comparison there is no
reason to believe that the protocols used for studies that
assess the value of prophylaxis in total abdominal hysterectomy are of statistically significantly lower quality
than are the protocols used for certain other clinical
trials.
In conclusion, we believe that randomized controlled
trials of antibiotic prophylaxis in abdominal hysterectomy that use controls who received no treatment are
no longerjustified. Our meta-analysis has shown that at
least three drugs- cefazolin, metronidazole, and tinidazole-are effective in the prevention of serious infectious morbidity associated with this surgical procedure.
Future randomized controlled trials conducted to find
other efficacious prophylactic antibiotics should use one
of these three drugs as a control. In our opinion,
however, a more useful study would be one that compares metronidazole with cefazolin. To determine
whether metronidazole is 50% more effective than cefazolin in preventing serious infectious morbidity, the
study would require 518 subjects in each of the two
treatment arms to achieve = 0.20 (80% power) and
a. = 0.05 (two tailed).
