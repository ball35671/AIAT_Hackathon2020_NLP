serum a-fetoprotein levels below the 0.5 multiples of
the median cutoff.
Our significantly lowered amniotic fluid a-fetoprotein values (a finding confirmed by Cuckle et al.2 but
not by Merkatz et al.') suggest a decrease in synthesis
of the protein by the fetal liver rather than altered

trophoblastic production or diminished placental clearance as suggested by Merkatz et al.
Our data suggest that a cutoff >0.5 multiples of the
median would have to be used in order to achieve
appreciable sensitivity in detecting Down syndrome .
Using a cutoff of ~0.7 multiples of the median, we
would have detected 34% of our trisomies (39% of
Down syndromes); however, 20% of our normal pregnancies had levels at or below this level. This not only
would be an inefficient screening test but would overwhelm our current prenatal diagnosis resources. Until
more data are obtained, we believe it is premature to
recommend maternal serum a-fetoprotein determination as a screening test to identify women at risk for a
trisomy.

Preoperative cefoxitin prophylaxis for elective

Fifty women were randomly given one, two, or three 2 gm parenteral doses of cefoxitin with placebo
blinding perioperatively at abdominal hysterectomy. A single preoperative intramuscular dose was more
efficient, less frequently associated with the development of bacterial resistance, and less expensive than
two or three doses. (AM J OBSTET GYNECOL 1985;153:225-6.)
Key words: Single-dose prophylaxis, abdominal hysterectomy
Identification of the requirement for antimicrobial
prophylaxis and an agent effective in the prevention
of major infection after elective abdominal hysterectomy,' combined with a need to identify every possible
avenue for reducing costs of medical care, resulted in

doses of cefoxitin.
Material and methods
Women were sequentially entered into this study if
they gave written informed consent and did not have
standard exclusions. They were randomly given one,
two, or three 2 gm doses of cefoxitin* with placebo
blinding. Endocervical material was cultured preoperatively and vaginal cuff culture was obtained imme-

Surgery was performed by residents with faculty supervision. Febrile morbidity and major postoperative
infections (pelvic cellulitis and wound infection) were
previously defined. 1 Non discrete data were analyzed by
using Newman-Keuls multiple comparisons, KruskalWallis, Mann-Whitney, or Welch's approximation tests.
Discrete data were compared by using x2 analysis.
Results
One hundred fifty women were evenly divided
among the three regimens. Clinical and surgical variables were statistically similar (p > 0.05). From 276 uninfected cultures, 1415 bacterial species were isolated.
Gram-positive bacteria predominated (61 % ) aerobic
isolates in both culture sets without significant interregimen differences; Bacteroides species were the most
common anaerobic isolates (57%). There was a significant increase in gram-negative isolates postoperatively
(p < 0.00 I), primarily Escherichia coli (p = 0.012). Increased recovery of enterococci and Bacteroides fragi1is
group species was observed in all regimens after surgery, but fewer other Bacteroides species were recovered
postoperatively (p > 0.05). Interregimen in vitro sensitivity patterns were comparable for preoperative and
postoperative isolates.
Evidence for the development of resistance was
sought by comparing the in vitro minimal inhibitory

concentrations to cefoxitin when the same species were
present in both culture sets, in the realization that the
organisms might not have been the same. Four of 109
such pairs were observed in the one-dose group, significantly fewer than 15 of 90 pairs in the two-dose
group (p = 0.004) and 9 of 75 pairs in the three-dose
group (p = 0.03). Differences between the two-dose
and three-dose groups were not significant.
Clinical outcome was statistically similar (Table I). A
mean of 3.3 aerobic and 3.1 anaerobic bacteria were
recovered from infection sites; preoperative cultures
were not predictive for infection. The mean temperature for women who acquired major infection was
102.1° F, and they were treated for a mean of 5
days. Significant prolongation in hospital stay resulted
(p = 0.042 top< 0.001). Febrile morbidity in women
who required antimicrobial therapy for infection occurred a mean of 80.3 hours following surgery, some
30 hours beyond the mean for women who developed
febrile morbidity only. Clinical and surgical variables
for women who became infected were combined and
compared to those of women who remained uninfected. No predictive variables or risk factors were identified, including extra procedures.
No late infections were observed for the 148 women
who were seen following surgery. Two women in the
two-dose group did not have a clinic visit. A rash was
observed in one woman in the two-dose group.
Comment
The numbers in each arm of this study were small,
as were the numbers of women who acquired infection
requiring antimicrobial therapy. Febrile morbidity only
was easily differentiated from temperature elevation
associated with major postoperative infection. Since two
women in the one- and three-dose groups required
antimicrobial therapy, we are comfortable with the clinical protection afforded by a single preoperative dose
of cefoxitin. The development of in vitro bacterial resistance to cefoxitin was significantly reduced with one
dose compared to that observed with two or three doses.
When cefoxitin is given for prophylaxis in our hospital,
one intramuscular dose will be our regimen.
