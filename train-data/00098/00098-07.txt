Abstract
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a single dose (2 g) of tinidazole before abdominal
hysterectomy could reduce the incidence of
postoperative infection. METHOD: A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study
was undertaken with a single oral dose (2 g) of
tinidazole, 12 h before surgery, in 100 patients
undergoing abdominal hysterectomy for various
benign diseases. Other antibiotic use was
withheld until there was no postoperative infection. RESULT: A signiJicant reduction (P <
0.05) of infectious morbidity (28% vs. 8%) as
well as a decrease in additional antibiotic use
(P < 0.01) and duration of hospital stay (P <
0.001) was observed. Febrile morbidity was
also reduced from 36% to 14% (P < 0.05).
Tinidazole was tolerated well by all the
patients. CONCLUSION: Tinidazole prophylaxis (2 g oral dose) is considered to be a simple, safe and effective way to reduce
postoperative infection in abdominal hysterectomy.
Keywords: Antibiotic prophylaxis; Tinidazole;

Introduction
Abdominal hysterectomy is the most common major gynecological operation performed today. It carries the risk of infection,
especially soft tissue infection, at the site of
operation. About 30% of women undergoing
this type of surgery suffer significant febrile
morbidity [I]. This is partly because the
vagina contains naturally occurring aerobic
and anaerobic bacteria, which can become
opportunistic pathogens following surgery.
As a preventive measure against postoperative infection, prophylactic antimicrobials
have been used. However, Duff observed
variable results in a review of 12 prospective
randomized placebo-controlled trials in abdominal hysterectomy [2]. Only 2 studies have
documented a pronounced reduction in pelvic
cellulitis. With the growing concern about
anaerobes as pathogens in female genital tract
infection [3], it would be logical to use antianaerobic antimicrobials for prophylaxis.
However, tinidazole, a nitroimidazole having
specific activity against commonly encountered anaerobes, was only used in 1 out
of 12 trials and no significant benefit was
observed [2]. The efficacy of tinidazole has
been examined recently by a few other investigators [1,4-81. Their results are contradictory and no valid conclusion could be

drawn due to lack of uniformity in their study
designs.
A prospective randomized double-blind
placebo-controlled trial was planned to determine whether a single dose (2 g) of tinidazole
before operation could reduce the incidence
of operative site infection after abdominal hysterectomy. This single 2 g dose was chosen
because it can maintain an effective serum
level, which is twice that of minimum inhibitory concentration, throughout surgery
and during first 24 h after operation [4].
Materials and methods
One hundred women who were scheduled
for elective abdominal hysterectomy ‘for a variety of benign conditions during July 1986 to
December 1988 were included in this study.
Patients were excluded from the study if they
had evidence of pre-existing infection;
diabetes or obesity; renal, hepatic or cardiac
disease; received an antibiotic in the preceding
week, or were using corticosteroids for any
reason. Informed consent was obtained from
all subjects. Patients were enroled and received 4 capsules (single dose) equivalent to either
2 g of tinidazole or placebo matched for
shape, size, color and taste 12 h before operation. Only the hospital pharmacist had access
to the drug code before completion of the
trial.
Swabs for anaerobic as well as aerobic cultures were taken from the vaginal vault on
three occasions; before giving drugs, after repair of vaults, which was taken through
abdominal incision; and on 5th postoperative
day or earlier if there was morbidity. Swabs
were soaked in Sorensen’s buffer before
taking samples for anaerobic culture. They
were transported in Carry and Blair media
and processed within 2 h in an anaerobic
handling enclosure. Anaerobic bacteria were
further identified according to Willis [9].
Hysterectomy was done by Consultant or
Registrar. Antibiotics were prescribed only
for febrile patients, after specimens for cultures were taken. A diagnosis of febrile morbidity was made, after 2 temperature
recordings were 38°C or more at 6-h intervals
excluding first 24 h and without any concurrent urinary or respiratory tract infection.
Febrile patients were detected to have vaginal
cuff cellulitis, if they had abdomino-pelvic
pain, serous or serosanguinous vaginal discharge, and cuff tenderness and induration.
Vault/pelvic abscess was defined as collection
of purulent material at the vault, detected by
clinical as well as ultrasound examination
with fever.

Results
Of the 100 patients, 2 were excluded from
final analysis; one had a tubo-ovarian abscess
and the other malignant ovarian tumor
(dysgerminoma), detected at surgery. Both of
them had received tinidazole. Forty-eight of
the remaining patients received tinidazole and
50 received placebo. Population characterTinidazole in abdominal hysterectomy 123
istics in respect of age, parity, social class,
menstrual status, weight and height ratio and
hemoglobin level between two groups were
comparable (Table 1). Perioperative factors
including indications for surgery, anesthesia,
blood loss and operating time were also
similar (Table 2).
The frequency of febrile morbidity and
vaginal cuff cellulitis were significantly less in
patients who received tinidazole (7 (14%) and
4 (8%) cases, respectively, in the tinidazole
group as compared with 18 (36%) and 14
(28%/o) cases, respectively, in the placebo
group) (P < 0.05). Only 4 patients in the
tinidazole group required additional antibiotic as compared with 15 patients in the
placebo group (P < 0.01). The mean duration
of hospital stay was also significantly (P <
0.001) reduced from 9 days in the placebo
group to 7 days in the tinidazole group (Table
3). A single dose of tinidazole (2 g) did not
produce any adverse side effects in our
patients.
Nineteen and 18 preoperative cultures in
the tinidazole and placebo group, respectively, produced anaerobic bacteria. However,
their isolation did not have any predictive
value for postoperative infection. Among
postoperative cultures, anaerobes were less
frequently isolated in the tinidazole group (8
cultures), whereas the anaerobic isolation rate
increased (22 cultures) in the placebo group
(Fig. 1). A total of 43 isolates were identified
in various combinations from 18 patients with
vaginal cuff cellulitis (14 and 4 in the placebo
and tinidazole group, respectively). In the
placebo group they were, in order of decreasTable 3. Postoperative morbidity.

Discussion
Postoperative infections continue to be a
major problem in gynecologic surgery. The
frequency of infectious morbidity after
abdominal hysterectomy varies greatly in
different studies [1,4-81. Some of these studies achieved pronounced reduction of pelvic
infections with tinidazole [4-81, whereas,
others did not observe any significant benefit
[l]. In this study, we have demonstrated a
significant reduction in febrile morbidity and
vaginal cuff cellulitis with a single dose of
preoperative tinidazole. Our results compare
favorably with that of Evaldson et al. [8] as
they also achieved a 3-fold reduction (18-6%)
of infectious morbidity. It is, however, difficult to compare our results with the rest.
They either included various operations in addition to abdominal hysterectomy [4,6,7],
used systemic antibiotics along with
tinidazole [ 1,6] or did not clearly define pelvic
infection [5-71. Senior and Steigrad [l] concluded that a low infection rate in their population may be the reason why they have not
achieved significant improvement with
tinidazole. Our population came from middle
and lower socio-economic class and showed
an inherent high risk of pelvic infection (28%),
which further stresses the need for prophylaxis. In addition, we achieved a reduction in
postoperative antibiotic use and duration of
hospital stay, resulting in a reduction of hospital costs. In agreement with others [4,7,8]
we have also observed anaerobes as an important pathogen for postoperative pelvic infetion in the control group. However, when
infection occurred even after prophylaxis,
gram negative facultative anaerobic bacilli
were encountered more frequently.
Whether antibiotic prophylaxis should be
prescribed in abdominal hysterectomy, will
remain a debatable issue for some time. From
our observations, we suggest that a single
dose of tinidazole fulfills the guidelines for
antibiotic prophylaxis [lo]. In a population
such as ours, we recommend it as an economic
and effective method to reduce operative site
infection after abdominal hysterectomy.
