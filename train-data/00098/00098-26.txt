Abstract. The efficacy of a preoperative single-dose of co-trimoxazole in reducing postoperative urinary tract infection and febrile morbidity after abdominal hysterec­ tomy was evaluated in a randomized placebo-controlled study of 90 patient s undergo­ ing surgery. Among the co-trimoxazo le patients, 6.2% developed urinary tract infection
compared to 31% in the placebo group (p <0.001) and 12.5% febrile morbidity com­
pared to 38% in the placebo patients (p < 0.025). No adverse side effects of co-trimoxa­
zole were observed and this regimen seems both safe and effective.


 
Introduction

The use of prophylactic antibiotics in gynecological surgery continues to be a controversia l issue. Most of the reports on prophylactic antibiotics in gynecological surgery have suggested prolonged regi­ men s [1-3]until it was shown that by reduc­ ing the duration of the prophylaxi s the dangerous side effects could be minimized while the same results were achieved [4]. Lately, several authors [5, 6] reported  that a short course of cephalosporin was effec­ tive in reducing infection after abdominal hysterectomy and the same results were achieved by others [7-9] using metronida­ zole. The incidence of morbidity following
 
abdomina l hysterectomy has been re­ ported to be as high as 30-50 % [l, 3, 6, 7] with the urinary tract infection responsi­ ble for over 50% of the morbidity, results supported by many authors [3, 5, 9]. Co­ trimoxazo le, a broad-spectrum antibiotic particularly effective in preventing uri­ nary tract infections [10, 11], has been shown by Mathews et al. [12] and Ireland et al. [13] to reduce postoperative urinary tract infection in gynecological surgery when given perioperatively. As very few studies have evaluated the single-dose pre­ operative prophylaxis with co-trimoxa­ zole the purpose of this present trial was to evaluate the effect of a single preoperative dose of co-trimoxazole in reducing the in-

Material and Methods

All patients admitted to the department for elec­ tive abdominal hysterectomy for benign conditions during the study period were included in the trial. Pa­ tients on antibiotic therapy during the 2 weeks before surgery or with known hypersensitivity to co-trimox­ azole were excluded from the trial. The patients were randomly assigned to either the treatment or  the placebo group. The treated group  received 15 ml co-trimoxazole (1,200 mg sulphamethoxazole and 240 mg trimethoprim) diluted in 500 ml saline in a slow intravenous infusion during the last 30 min be­ fore surgery. The placebo group received the saline with the placebo in the same manner.
Preoperative laboratory studies included a com­
plete blood count, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin ,

creatinine, albumin, globulin and preoperative urine cultures taken from the catheter when inserted under aseptic conditions I h before surgery. Abdominal wall and vagina were prepared in the operating room and general anesthesia was administered to all pa­ tients. All operators used a clamp, cut and ligate technique. The vaginal cuff was left open in all pa­ tients. Surgical chromic catgut and dexon sutures were used for internal ligatures and the skin was ap­ proximated with mersilk sutures. The catheter was left in place for 24 h in all patients.
Postoperative urine for cultures was taken from the catheter when removed 24 h after surgery and on the 3rd and 6th postoperative day. A diagnosis of fe­ brile morbidity was made if a temperature reading of 38•c or more was observed on at least two occasions 4 h or more apart excluding the first 24 postoperative
hours. Urinary tract infection was established with the presence of HP colonies/ml accompanied by uri­ nary symptoms. Antibiotic therapy was started only when the urine cultures so required. Statistical analy­ sis was performed by the chi-square test.



Results

Ninety-eight patients took part in the study. In the treated group, 2 were ex­ cluded due to positive preoperative urine cultures. In the placebo group, 3 patients were excluded due to positive preopera­ tive urine  cultures,  2 due to  malignancy

Discussion

 
found in the uterus and 1 because of a mis­ take in following the protocol. The two groups were similar with regard to rele­ vant clinical and surgical data as shown in table I. No case of hypersensitivity to the drug was noted.
Table II shows a significantly lower in­ cidence of febrile morbidity (p <0.025): and urinary tract infection  (p < 0.00 l) in the co-trimoxazole group. In the treated group, the organisms responsible for the 3 postoperative urinary tract infections were Escherichia coli in 2 cases and Klebsiella sp. in l. Only one (E. coli) was insensitive to co-trimoxazole and was treated with nalidixic acid. In the treated group, no pa­ tients required recatheterization, and  on the 7th postoperative day all cultures were negative. In the placebo group, the organ­ isms responsible for the infections are shown in table III. Only two organisms (one Klebsiella sp. and one Proteus sp.) were insensitive to co-trimoxazole which was successfully given to the rest of the patients. In the placebo group 2 patients required recatheterization with one developing an infection treated with co­ trimoxazole .
 
The results of this trial suggest that a single-dose preoperative prophylaxis of co-trimoxazole is an effective way of re­ ducing the incidence of febrile morbidity and urinary tract infection following ab­ dominal hysterectomy. The incidence of urinary tract infection following abdomi­ nal hysterectomy has been reported to be as high as 25-50 % [3, 5, 8], and numerou s studies of a single-dose prophylaxis with co-trimoxazole [12, 13] and other antibiot­
ics [3, 5, 9] have reduced the incidence and clearly ju stify this regimen.
Co-trimoxazole   is  a  broad-spectrum
antimicrobial agent with activity against a wide	range	of	organisms	including gram-positive and negative aerobes, many anaerobic bacteria,  chlamydia  and  some protozoa  [ll]. The  positive  effect  of  co­ trimoxazole	on	the   urinary		tract	is achieved  by  the  prolonged  excretion  of of active drug in the urinary tract and the reduction of numbers of E. coli in the va­ gina and introital area due to secretion of the  drug by  the vaginal  epithelium  [14]. Several investigators have reported the ef­ fective prophylaxis of a single-dose of co­ trimoxazole [10, 15] and have shown the
 

 
superiority of this drug compared with other commonly used antibiotics [11, 16] in preventing urinary tract infections.
The results of this trial support these conclusions, and as urinary tract infection can lead to severe discomfort and possible later complications, chemoprophylaxis seems ju stified in gynecological  surgery.
We suggest that a single intravenous dose of co-trimoxazole given prior to ab­ domin al hysterectomy is a safe and an ef­ fective way of reducing febrile morbidity and urinary tract infection in these pa­ tients.
