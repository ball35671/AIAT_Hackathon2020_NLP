Summary. We studied the effect of perioperative clindamycin (3 x 600 mg in
100 ml 0.9% saline), metronidazole (3 x 500 mg in 100 ml 0.9% saline) and a
placebo (3 x 100 ml of 0.9% saline) in 120 patients having a vaginal
hysterectomy without colporrhaphy. The rate of postoperative urinary tract
infections was significantly higher in the placebo group, but there was no
significant difference between the three groups in the days of postoperative
fever (a temperature above 37 ~ C) or in the length of hospital stay. One patient
on placebo had a vault infection and another had a fever of unknown origin.

Introduction
Perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis has been used in recent years in many
gynecological operations for a variety of reasons. Many studies have demonstrated the prophylactic value of antibiotics (Cunningham 1987, Grossman 1979,
Roberts 1978) and a significant reduction in postoperative morbidity, as shown
e.g. by wound infection rates or the frequency of abscesses (Cunningham 1987).
The frequency of postoperative complications obviously varies with the type
of gynecological intervention, the institution, the surgeon, and the patient
population.
Vaginal operations in particular have been associated with an elevated
frequency of postoperative infections (Jackson 1975), and it was therefore
hoped that prophylactic use of antibiotics in this sector would be of the greatest
benefit. The local infections encountered after vaginal hysterectomy are usually
soft-tissue infections, and anaerobic bacteria play an important role (Vincelette
1983). The role of oral metronidazole has been investigated in several studies

(Appelbaum 1987, Hamod 1978) and short-term perioperative prophylaxis has
proved at least as efficient as antibiotics given over a long period (Duff 1980,
Hemsell 1987, Pateisky 1987). In addition to lower costs, this method has the
advantages of lower rates of bacterial resistance, superinfections, enterocolitis,
and allergic or toxic side effects. Sufficiently good penetration of tissues (e.g.
endometrium and myometrium) and appropriate therapeutic levels exceeding
the minimal inhibitory concentration have already been demonstrated for
cephalosporins, metronidazole and clindamycin (Johnson 1985).
In many of the earlier studies, however, data from patients with abdominal
and vaginal hysterectomy and with or without anterior or posterior colporrhaphy were evaluated together. We saw the need for a study of antibiotic
prophylaxis using an exactly defined group of patients namely those having a
vaginal hysterectomy without colporrhaphy. Since we do not generally use
prophylactic antibiotics for this operation, we decided to compare results for
placebo with those obtained by using metronidazole (Anaerobex | and clindamycin (Dalacin|
Patients and Methods
After giving the patients appropriate explanations and obtaining their consent, a total of 120 women
were recruited to the study. We excluded patients with a history of sensitivity to antibiotics,
treatment with antibiotics in the last 72 h, impaired liver or kidney functions, fever, and concomitant
infections.
The study was carried out in the double-blind mode, the women being allocated to the treatment
groups at random. Patients in the clindamycin group received 600 mg clindamycin in 100 ml of 0.9%
saline as an intravenous infusion 1/2 to 1 b before the start of the operation, followed by two
additional doses of 600 nag in 100 ml of 0.9% saline at 6-hourly intervals. Patients in the
metronidazole group received 500 mg metronidazole in 100 ml of 0.0% saline at the same intervals;
the placebo patients were each time given only 100 ml of 0.9% saline.
Only patients with a vaginal hysterectomy without a repair and with or without salpingectomy
were included in the study.
The surgical technique of the "Viennese medical school" which we generally use, has been
described elsewhere (Gitsch 1977). Local antiseptics were only permitted preoperatively. All
patients had a vaginal pack and an indwelling bladder catheter and these were removed not later
than 36 h after operations. The indication for surgery, restdts of chest x-rays, the blood picture
(including a differential count), serum creatinine, BUN and results of urine analysis were ascertained for all patients before operation.
All patients had a pelvic examination, a complete blood picture, and urine analysis taken at the
time of removal of the urinary catheter usually one day after operation. An axillary-temperature
chart was kept. The patients were asked to come back for an examination 4-6 weeks after the
operation.
Statistical evaluation was performed using Tukey's studentized range test, the Kruskal Wallis
test, and the chi-squared test. The values given are means + standard deviations.
Results
The main clinical characteristics of the three groups were similar (Table 1).
There were no significant differences in the preoperative chest x-rays and liver
and kidney function tests. Also similar were the preoperative and postoperative

The number of postoperative infectious complications was higher in the
placebo group (Table 2). One patient in the clindamycin group and one patient
in the placebo group suffered a fever of unknown aetiology, which required
additional antibiotic treatment for several days. One patient in the placebo
group also required additional treatment with antibiotics because of an infection
of the vaginal vault. Comparison of the postoperative temperature charts
showed that temperature was raised (above 38 ~ C) for almost a day longer in the
placebo group (Table 3), but the difference is not statistically significant (P <
0.28).

The frequency of postoperative urinary-tract infections in the metronidazole
group (4/40) and the placebo group (7/40) was significantly higher than that in
the clindamycin group (1/40), but a statistically significant difference in the
actual duration of the infection could not be determined. One patient in the
clindamycin group, 2 in the placebo group and 2 in the metronidazole group
required treatment for postoperative hemorrhage. The duration of hospitalisation was not significantly shorter than in the placebo group (Table 4). At 4-6
weeks after operation none of the patients had any noteworthy problems.
Discussion
Some centers not using routine perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis report a
very high (up to 50%) incidence of postoperative infections after vaginal
hysterectomy (Jackson 1975). We have a substantially lower infection rate
without antibiotic drugs possibly because after closing the peritoneum we leave
the vaginal vault open to allow free drainage. Another reason for this discrepancy may be an inexact definition of the initial groups as regards the operation
performed. We have limited our present study to vaginal hysterectomy without
colporrhaphy. These points may explain why the prophylactic antibiotic therapy
which we used appeared to confer only slight benefit in terms of postoperative
urinary tract infections and not in other regards. The results of our study do not
allow us to give strong support to the use of prophylactic antibiotics for patients
having a straightforward vaginal hysterectomy without a repair.
This conclusion may not be true in hysterectomy combined with anterior and
posterior colporrhaphy in view of the larger wound area (Cunningham 1987,
Roberts 1978).
