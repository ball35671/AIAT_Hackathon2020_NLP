Abstract
OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy and
side effects of a single dose of tinidazole for
infection following vaginal hysterectomy.
METHOD: A randomized double-blind
placebo-controlled trial using 2 g tinidazole 12
h before vaginal hysterectomy in 50 patients
was conducted. No other antibiotic was used
until the development of infection. RESULT.
There was a signi$icant reduction (P < 0.01)
of post-operative vaginal cuff cellulitis
(54-16X). A similar reduction (P < 0.0.5) in
febrile morbidity was also observed. The duration of postoperative hospital stay (P < O.OOI)
and use of additional antibiotics (P < 0.01)
were also reduced. No adverse effect of
tinidazole was noted. CONCLUSION: A
single dose of tinidazole appears to be a safe
and effective alternative prevention against
infection in vaginal hysterectomy.
Keywords: Antibiotic prophylaxis; Tinidazole;
Vaginal hysterectomy.
Introduction
Infections following major gynecological
surgery is a continuing problem. As the
vagina contains various microorganisms,
vaginal hysterectomy results in the risk of
post-operative infection. Duff and Park [ 11, in
a review of 20 trials of antibiotic prophylaxis
in vaginal hysterectomy, concluded that postoperative pelvic infection may approach
40-50%, without antibiotic prophylaxis.
Polk’s [2] review of 11 randomized doubleblind placebo-controlled trials, in which only
48 h of perioperative antibiotics were administered, showed significantly fewer infections following vaginal hysterectomy in 10 out
of 11 trials. Unfortunately, neither of these
reviews included nitroimidazoles. With the
knowledge of anaerobes as pathogens in pelvic infection, metronidazole [3] and more
recently, tinidazole [4,5], have been used as
suitable alternatives to the many and varied
prophylactic regimens. However, Kuhn [6]
failed to observe any significant benefit with
tinidazole.
Few reports from India and Bangladesh
[7,8] have shown a significant improvement in
infective morbidity with tinidazole. These
reports have included other operations in addition to vaginal hysterectomy, and one of
them [7] did not carry out anaerobic culture.
With this background, a prospective randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial
with tinidazole in vaginal hysterectomy was
conducted. A single dose (2 g) of tinidazole
was chosen because it is easily administered,
and is effective against commonly encountered anaerobes, both during surgery and
up to 24 h postoperatively [5].

Materials and methods
Fifty patients undergoing vaginal hysterectomy with pelvic floor repair for genital prolapse at the Postgraduate Institute of Medical
Education and Research, Chandigarh from
July 1986 to Dec. 1988 participated in our
trial. Patients excluded were those who were
below 35 years or above 60 years, those with
hemoglobin below 10 g/d1 or with evidence of
concomitant infection; those with systemic
diseases such as diabetes, renal, hepatic or
cardiac disease; those who had received any
antimicrobial medication in the week
preceding surgery, or those who were using
corticosteroids for any reason. Informed consent was obtained and patients were randomly
assigned to receive 4 capsules equivalent to
either 2 g of tinidazole or placebo matched for
size, shape, color and taste, 12 h before surgery. Only the hospital pharmacist had access
to the protocol code before completion of the
study.
Vaginal swabs were taken for anaerobic
and aerobic cultures on the preoperative day
before administering the drugs. Second and
third sets of cultures were also taken on the
operative day after surgery as well as on 7th
postoperative day, respectively. Additional
cultures were obtained at the time of development of infection. Specimens for anaerobic
cultures were obtained using swabs pretreated
with Sorensen’s buffer, transported in Carry
and Blair media and processed within 2 h in
an anaerobic handling enclosure. Anaerobic
isolates were identified according to Willis [9].
Operations were performed either by a
Consultant or Registrar. In the postoperative
period, antibiotics were only prescribed after
samples for microbiological study were collected from the infected patients. Febrile morbidity due to pelvic infection was considered
if the patient’s temperature increased to 38°C
or more on 2 occasions 6 h apart excluding
the first 24 h and without any evidence of concurrent infection (urinary or respiratory).
Febrile patients were diagnosed to have vaginal cuff cellulitis if there was abdomino-pelvic
pain, serous or serosanguinous vaginal discharge and cuff induration and tenderness.
Vault/pelvic abscess was defined as collection
at the vault (diagnosed by pelvic examination
and ultrasound) with purulent vaginal discharge and fever.
Student’s t-test and the x2-test (with Yates’
correction where necessary) were applied for
statistical analysis.
Results
Forty-nine patients were finally evaluated
after excluding one who had vomited ingested
capsules (placebo). Twenty-five patients
received tinidazole and 24 received placebo.
Both groups were similar with regard to age,
parity, weight and height ratio, hemoglobin
level, operating time and blood loss (Table 1).
Most of them (90%) were from middle and
lower socio-economic class and half of them
were postmenopausal. The postoperative
morbidity experienced by these patients
(Table 2) were analyzed and a significant
reduction of febrile morbidity (6 cases (24%)
compared to 13 cases (54%) in tinidazole and
placebo group, respectively) and vaginal cuff
cellulitis (4 (16”/0> vs. 13 (54’/,> cases) were
observed. Only 3 patients who had received
tinidazole required additional antibiotics
compared to 11 patients in the placebotreated group (P < 0.01). Patients in the

group, whereas it increased (13 cases) in the
placebo group (Fig. 1). However, detection of
anaerobes preoperatively did not correlate
with the development of postoperative infection. Cultures from infected patients revealed
mixed bacterial growth in both groups. In the
tinidazole group E. coli (3 cases) and K.
pneumoniue (2 cases) were the predominant
bacteria followed by anaerobic cocci, S. faecalis, and B-hemolytic streptococci S. epidermidis (1 case each). Whereas Bacteroides (8
cases) and anaerobic cocci (6 cases) were
predominantly isolated in the placebo group
followed by E. coli (4 cases) K. pneumoniae (4
cases) S. aureus (3 cases) S. faecalis (2 cases)
S. epidermidis and Acinetobacter (1 case each).
There was no adverse side effect of drugs
reported by these patients except one patient
who had vomited out placebo capsules
immediately after ingestion.
Discussion
The prophylatic use of antibiotics in gynecology is a controversial subject. When surgery is performed in the reproductive tract,
seeding of bacteria into the surgical margins
of pelvic tissue occurs. This provides an excellent medium for infection in the avascular
devitalized tissue bed. It is essential that a
short perioperative course of an antibiotic
with adequate tissue level at the time of operation should be selected. This antibiotic should
have scientific evidence of efficacy and when
used, infection rate should be predictably
reduced [lo].
The incidence of infectious morbidity in the
placebo-treated patients was 54%, which was
reduced 3-fold (16%) with tinidazole prophylaxis. Although comparison with different
reported results is difficult due to differences
in definition and study design, our results are
comparable few of them [4,8]. They reported
reduction in febrile morbidity from 35 to 13%
[4] and wound infection from 45 to 21% [8].
In addition they included abdominal hysterectomy [4,8], Fothergill’s operation [8] and did
not clearly define wound or pelvic infection
Article 
120 Dhar et al.
[8] Crosthwaite et al. [5] achieved a much
lower rate of infective morbidity (1.9%) with
tinidazole, however, in their series infection
rate without prophylaxis was also low
(12.2%). Our study also indicates that
tinidazole prophylaxis reduces the duration of
hospital stay. This will help to reduce hospital
expenses.
The observations made in this trial indicate
that vaginal hysterectomy is associated with a
high risk of postoperative infection suggests a
need for suitable antibiotic prophylaxis. It is
also evident that anaerobes play a major role
in the pathogenesis of postoperative infection.
The knowledge of the association of E. coli
and K. pneumoniae with infectious morbidity
in patients who had received tinidazole may
assist surgeons who need to select additional
antibiotics. A single oral dose of tinidazole (2
g) appears to be a safe, effective and convenient prophylaxis in vaginal hysterectomy.
