Abstract
A randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial was initiated to compare the safety and efficacy of piperacillin, cephalothin and cefoxitin in the prophylactic treatment of patients undergoing vaginal hysterectomy. The total dose of each antibiotic was 6 grams given in three equally divided doses. A satisfactory prophylactic response was obtained in 143 of 151 (95 per cent) patients treated with piperacillin, in 82 of 87 (94 per cent) patients treated with cephalothin and in 57 of 60 (95 per cent) patients treated with cefoxitin. The pooled data indicated that the piperacillin treatment group did not differ from the combined cephalosporin treatment groups with respect to prophylactic response, presence of febrile morbidity, fever index, duration of postoperative hospitalization and incidence of reported adverse experiences.
