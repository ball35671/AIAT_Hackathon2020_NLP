Summary: To assess the efficacy of a single dose of ampicillin or cefazolin in preventing fever and infection
after elective abdominal hysterectomy, we conducted a multicentre, randomized, double-blind, controlled trial
at Srinagarind Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Khon Kaen University and Khon Kaen Regional Hospital.
Three hundred and thirty patients scheduled for elective abdominal hysterectomy were randomly allocated
into either placebo, ampicillin or cefazolin groups. Patients received sterile water (3 mL) or ampicillin (1 g) or
cefazolin (1 g) intravenously according to random assignment 30 min before the operation. After the operation,
all patients were assessed by blinded independent evaluators until discharged from the hospitals. Our main
outcome measures were postoperative fever and infectious morbidity. We found that 321 patients (97.3% of
recruited patients) were available for data analysis, 108 in placebo, 106 in ampicillin and 107 in cefazolin group.
Febrile morbidity occurred in 13/108 (12.0%), 14/106 (13.2%) and 12/107 (11.2%) of patients in the placebo,
ampicillin and cefazolin groups, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference in febrile
morbidity between the three groups. Infectious morbidity was found in 29/108 (26.9%), 24/106 (22.6%) and
11/107 (10.3%) of patients in the placebo, ampicillin and cefazolin groups, respectively. There was a statistically
significant difference between the placebo and cefazolin groups (P  0.002). Between the placebo and ampicillin groups, the result was not significantly different (P  0.476). There was a statistically significant difference between the cefazolin and ampicillin groups (P  0.015). The common causes of infectious morbidity
were urinary tract infection, vaginal cuff infection and surgical wound infection. We concluded that antibiotic
prophylaxis by cefazolin should be recommended for elective total abdominal hysterectomy.

Introduction
Abdominal hysterectomy is the most common gynaecological operation in Srinagarind and Khon Kaen
Regional Hospitals. The two most frequent
complications of abdominal hysterectomy are fever
and infection.1,2 The incidences of postoperative
fever varied from 18 to 45% and of infection from
14 to 51% in patients who did not receive preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis.1,3±5 With prophylactic antibiotics the incidence of fever was 1 to
45% and the incidence of infection was 0±29%.1,3±5
The most common site of postoperative infection was
urinary tract. Other sites included vaginal cuff,
pelvic cavity, surgical wound, lungs, blood etc.1,6,7
Risk factors for these infections included low age,

obesity, diabetes, anaemia, prolonged operation,
inexperience of the surgeon, massive blood loss
and lack of antibiotic prophylaxis.8,9 In contrast to
vaginal hysterectomy, the benefit of prophylactic
antibiotics in abdominal hysterectomy was less uniformly demonstrated in prospective, randomized,
double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. Recently
a meta-analysis showed that cephalosporins were
useful in preventing fever and infection after
abdominal hysterectomy.
3 Due to the lack of information about the efficacy of ampicillin, we conducted this multicentre, double-blind, randomized,
controlled trial to determine the efficacy of ampicillin
and first generation cephalosporin (cefazolin)
in preventing fever and infection after elective
abdominal hysterectomy.
Methods
Women scheduled for elective total abdominal hysterectomy at Srinagarind and Khon Kaen Regional
Hospitals from February 1997 to September 1999
were approached to participate in the study. We
excluded patients with fever and/or infection prior to
surgery caused by tuboovarian abscess; urinary tract
infection, etc., patients who are allergic ampicillin
and/or cefazolin; patients who had received any antibiotics within 48 h before surgery; and patients
who received emergency abdominal hysterectomy
or abdominal hysterectomy related to pregnancy.
Gynaecologists caring for these patients explained the
objectives and methods of the study and gave them
the opportunity to decide about the participation.
After informed consent was obtained, 330 patients
were randomly allocated into either placebo, ampicillin or cefazolin groups by using computer-generated
randomization and opaque sealed envelopes. These
patients received sterile water (3 mL) or ampicillin
(1 g) or cefazolin (1 g) intravenously according to the
random assignment 30 min before the operation,
administered by the anaesthetist).
The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of a single dose of ampicillin or cefazolin in
preventing fever and infection after elective abdominal hysterectomy. Our hypothesis was that patients
who received prophylactic antibiotics would have
lower rates of fever and infection. Patients, their
gynaecologists, all investigators and evaluators were
blinded to the random allocation throughout the
study. Patients were examined by external evaluators
every day until they were discharged from the hospital. Four weeks after surgery, patients received
a follow-up physical and pelvic examinations. Two
main outcome measures of this study were fever
and infection. Fever was defined as a temperature of
38.0C that occurred in any two of the first 10 days
postoperation, exclusive of the first 24 h, taken by
mouth by a standard technique at least four times
daily.1±3 Infection of one or more sites was diagnosed
by clinical symptoms and signs and/or laboratory
tests. The infections included abdominal wound
infection, pelvic cellulitis, septic pelvic thrombophlebitis, pelvic or intra-abdominal collection, urinary
tract infection (both symptomatic and asymptomatic), vaginal cuff infection or pneumonia.2 Given
that the febrile morbidity rate in patients who did
not receive antibiotic prophylaxis was around 25%
and   0.05, 80% power to detect a 15% difference
between antibiotics and placebo groups, 100 patients
were needed in each group.
10 We also recruited an
extra 10% in case some participants were lostto follow
up in each group. Thus we needed 110 patients in
each group. The data was analysed by using STATA
6 software to detect rate differences (two-sample test
of proportion) of the rates of fever and infection
in each of the groups. Multiple logistic regression
analysis was used to control for potential confounding factors. This study was approved by the Ethics
Committee of the Faculty of Medicine, Khon Kaen
University.
Results
From February 1997 to September 1999, there were
330 eligible patients (Figure 1). One hundred and
sixty patients from Srinagarind Hospital and 170
patients from Khon Kaen Regional Hospital. Nine
patients were excluded from the study because hysterectomy was not performed as planned. There were
two, four and three patients excluded in the placebo,
ampicillin and cefazolin groups, respectively. Thus
321 patients were available for data analysis, 108,
106, and 107 in the placebo, ampicillin and cefazolin
group, respectively. Characteristics and risk factors
for postoperative infection were similar among the
three groups (Table I). The most common indication
for surgery was myoma uteri (Table II). Fever
occurred in 13/108 (12.0%, 95% CI 6.6±19.7%), 14/
106 (13.2%, 95% CI 7.4±21.2%) and 12/107 (11.2%,
95% CI 5.9±18.8%) in the placebo, ampicillin and
cefazolin groups, respectively. Two-sample tests of
proportion did not reveal a statistically significant
difference in the occurrence of fever between the
three groups.

Infection was diagnosed in 29/108 (26.9%, 95% CI
18.8±36.2%), 24/106 (22.6%, 95% CI 15.1±31.8%) and
11/107 (10.3%, 95% CI 5.2±17.7%) in the placebo,
ampicillin and cefazolin groups, respectively. There
was statistically significant difference between the
placebo and cefazolin groups (P  0.002). The result
showed no significant difference (P  0.476) between
the placebo and ampicillin groups. There was

a statistically significant difference between the
cefozolin and ampicillin groups (P  0.015). Infection was evaluated, in the early postoperative period
and four weeks after the operation. There were five
patients who were lost to follow-up (two patients in
the placebo and three patients in the cefazolin
groups). After sensitivity analysis was performed, the
statistical result did not change.
The most common cause of immediate postoperative infection was asymptomatic bacteriuria
(Table III). Vaginal cuff infection was the major
cause of delayed infection (Table IV). Multiple
logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the efficacy of antibiotic prophylaxis. After
adjusting for potential confounding factors, we
found that cefazolin use could significantly reduce
postoperative infections by about two thirds when
compared with the placebo (adjusted odds ratio 0.33,
95% CI 0.15±0.74). Ampicillin use did not cause
a statistically significant reduction of infection rate
(Table V). No adverse events were observed in any
intervention groups.
Discussion
The incidence of postoperative fever in the three
groups was 11±13% and was not significantly different. When compared with other studies,
11±17 the
incidence fever was similar in patients who received
antibiotic prophylaxis before the operation. In the
placebo group,we found thatfeverwas less frequently
observed than in previous studies2,11,16,18±21 Probably because of the definitions used. We found a
high incidence of infection in the placebo and
ampicillin groups, similar to most previous
studies.2±5,11,16,20,22,23 However these infections
were not severe. There were no deaths or severe
infections in this study.
The incidence of infection in the cefazolin group
was very low when compared with the placebo
and ampicillin groups and this difference was statistically significant. Multiple logistic regression
analysis showed that prophylactic cefazolin could
significantly reduce infectious morbidity by two
thirds when compared with the placebo group. There
was a higher rate of infection in the placebo group
compared with the placebo groups in the metaanalysis.3 This finding may be because we included
asymptomatic bateriuria (the most common infection in this study) in the definition of infectious
morbidity while the meta-analysis did not.
The incidence of infection in the ampicillin group
was similar to that observed in the placebo group.
This study did not show a significant reduction in the
risk of infection in ampicillin group when compared
with placebo group. A larger sample size may be
needed.

Prophylactic antibiotics in abdominal hysterectomy 305
The present study had many strengths namely it
was multicentric and had appropriate methodology,
and double blinding. The efficacy of ampicillin has
not been studied in previous randomized, controlled
trials.
However there were weaknesses in the present
study infection. We diagnosed postoperative by
using clinical symptoms and signs and/or culture. In
many patients the causative agent of infection was
not documented particularly vaginal cuff infection,
which was mostly anaerobic bacteria in nature.
Specimen collection for anaerobic bacteria culture
was very difficultto perform and had a high error rate.
In conclusion our study indicated that antibiotic
prophylaxis in elective total abdominal hysterectomy
is beneficial. Giving cefazolin 1 g intravenously
30 min before the operation was the best option when
compared with giving a placebo or ampicillin.
