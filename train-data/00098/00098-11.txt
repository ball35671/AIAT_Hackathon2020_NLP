Abstract
One hundred patients undergoing vaginal hysterectomy were enrolled in a randomized double-blind comparative antibiotic prophylaxis study. Forty-six patients received mezlocillin and 54 patients received cefoxitin. No significant difference was found among patients who developed febrile morbidity. Failure rate for mezlocillin was 17 per cent and for cefoxitin, 15 per cent. There was an increase in colonization of Streptococcus faecalis and Enterobacter species in patients receiving three doses of cefoxitin prophylaxis.
