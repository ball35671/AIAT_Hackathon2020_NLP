Single-dose prophylaxis in hysterectomies
An interim analysis

Introduction
Post-operative infections pose additional problems for patients and may lengthen their stay in
hospital. In recent years, peri-operative antibiotic prophylaxis came in vogue. A great deal of
research has been conducted in English-speaking
countries, but little has been published in Dutch
literature concerning antibiotic prophylaxis in
hysterectomies. Consequently, to reach a wellfounded opinion regarding the benefits of this
prophylaxis at the Medical Centre Alkmaar a
prospective, randomized, double-blind trial was
initiated.
Methods
Patients
Patients hospitalized for an abdominal hysterectomy (group I), a vaginal hysterectomy (group
II) or a vaginal hysterectomy with vaginal repair
(group III), were recruited. Operations were performed by the staff gynaecologists and residentsin-training, the Medical Centre Alkmaar being a
teaching hospital.
Criteria for exclusion were an emergency operation; known sensitivity for cephalosporins; pre,
existing infection or antibiotic therapy in the
48 h preceding the operation.
The patient was informed in writing, prior to
the operation, of the objective of the trial and
asked for permission to be included. The trial
was approved by the local medical ethical hospital board.
Procedure
The prospective, double-blind and randomized
study consisted of an antibiotic coverage of cefuroxime and metronidazole versus a placebo.
The 'active' group received 1,500 mg cefuroxime plus 500 mg metronidazole by rapid intravenous infusion in 10 min during induction of
anaesthesia, whereas the 'control' group received placebo infusions. In view of the doubleblind nature of the trial, both the active and the
placebo infusions were coloured yellow with
0.15 ml vitamin B complex. Patients in group III
received a vaginal packing post-operatively to be
removed on post-operative day 2 and an indwelling urinary catheter up to and including day 4.
Pre-operatively and post-operatively (on day 5)
haematological and biochemical examinations
were performed: haemoglobin, leukocytes, urea,
creatinine and a 'midstream' urine sample for
culture.
The following criteria were applied:
-fever: body temperature measured rectally
>38~ (except on the day of surgery);
-wound infection: local tenderness of vaginal
and/or skin wound with or without local infiltration, subdivided into:
* mild: purulent discharge only;
* moderate: with general symptoms, such as
pyrexia and/or a leukocyte count exceeding
10 l~ per l;
* severe: if surgical intervention was required;
- urinary tract infection: bacteriologically
proven infection i.e. >105 colony-forming
units (CFU) per ml with a leukocyte in the
sediment, as well as with one of the following
signs of infection: fever >38~ urgency, frequency, dysuria or supra-pubic tenderness;
- days in hospital: number of days in hospital
with reason for discharge: social or medical

Abstract
The efficacy of single-dose prophylaxis with intravenous cefuroxime 1,500 mg plus 500 mg
metronidazole in vaginal or abdominal hysterectomies was investigated in a randomized,
double-blind, placebo-controlled study, involving 396 evaluable patients. A significant
reduction of the number in urinary tract infections was observed in the groups undergoing
abdominal hysterectomy or vaginal hysterectomy with vaginal repair. The incidence of
wound infections and the duration of hospitalization were significantly reduced in patients
undergoing vaginal hysterectomy with or without vaginal repair. Body temperature
normalized faster in all three groups receiving peri-operative antibiotic prophylaxis. It is
concluded that a single injection of antimicrobial prophylaxis is sufficient and useful in both
abdominal and vaginal hysterectomies.

An interim analysis was performed when more

a P value of 0.05 or less was regarded to be significant in other tests9
Results
Altogether, 396 patients were evaluable. 5
Patients in group III (2 'active,' 3 'placebo') were
excluded, because they underwent a different
surgical procedure (vaginal hysterectomy with
posterior wall colporrhaphy). 2 Patients in group
12(6A) 1990 Pharmaceutisch Weekblad Scientific edition 281 
I (1 'active,' 1 'placebo') were excluded, because
the type of operation (surgery for urinary incontinence) did not fulfil the eligibility criteria.
Table 1 shows the classification of the patient
data, average length of operation and blood loss
in the different groups. There was no difference
between treated and control patients in the
3 groups.
Figure 1 represents the number of patients
with post-operative fever: in all groups there
were significantly fewer periods of fever in the
treated patients than in the control groups. This
was especially evident in vaginally operated
groups (II and III).
The average number of days with fever also differed significantly in all patient groups [group I:
1.4 versus 1.8 days (P = 0.016); group II: 0.9 versus 3.0 days (P = 0.001); group III: 1.2 versus 3.5
days (P < 0.001); antibiotics versus placebo using
the Mann-Whitney test].
The incidence and severity of wound infections
are given in Table 2. Treated patients in groups
II and III exhibited a significant reduction in the
infection rate.
Table 3 shows that in groups I and III the difference in number of urinary tract infections
reached statistical significance. No difference
was observed between treated and control
patients in group II.
In general, the duration of hospitalization was
not related to the use of peri-operative antibiotic
prophylaxis in the vaginally operated groups
(Table 4). A significant increase in the use of
post-operative antibiotics was observed in all
patient of placebo-treated groups.
Discussion
There is now general agreement that antibiotic
prophylaxis is useful in vaginal hysterectomies.
The few studies that were to demonstrate a benefit of prophylaxis in reducing pelvic infections,
urinary tract infections or hospital stay, have
been superseded by a large number of prospective, controlled studies showing a significant reduction in rates of post-operative infections [1].
The efficacy of prophylaxis with 3 doses of cefuroxime and metronidazole in vaginal hysterec-
' tomy, with and without vaginal repair, had been
shown by Brouwer et al. [2] and Eckenhausen
and Joncker [3]. This study shows that a single
peri-operative dose of cefuroxime plus metronidazole significantly reduces the incidence of
wound infection and hospital stay in patients undergoing vagina] hysterectomy with and without
vaginal repair. The incidence of urinary tract infection was significantly reduced only in the 'repair' group, while normalization of body temperature occurred faster in both groups.
The usefulness of antibiotic prophylaxis in abdominal hysterectomy is still controversial. Yet,
our results suggest that prophylaxis is effective
in reducing urinary tract infections and fever,
and are in accord with those of WttewaallEvelaar's meta-analysis [4]. We could not demonstrate a significant reduction of wound infections
and hospitalization.

The results of this interim analysis prompted
us to terminate this study for ethical reasons.
Conclusions
In vaginal hysterectomy, with or without repair, a significant reduction in the rate of wound
infections is achieved with peri-operative antibiotic prophylaxis.
Antibiotic prophylaxis significantly reduces
the occurrence of post-operative urinary tract infections in abdominal and vaginal hysterectomies with repair, and patients body temperature normalizes faster. Hospital stay is also significantly shorter in vaginal hysterectomies.
A single dose of cefuroxime plus metronidazole
is sufficient in reducing morbidity in abdominal
and vaginal hysterectomies.
