and M. LOWY. A Randomized Trial to Increase Physical Activity in Breast Cancer Survivors. Med. Sci. Sports Exerc., Vol. 41, No. 4,
pp. 935–946, 2009. Purpose: Interventions to increase physical activity among breast cancer survivors are needed to improve health and quality
of life and possibly to reduce the risk of disease recurrence and early mortality. Therefore, we report the feasibility and preliminary outcomes of a
pilot randomized trial designed to increase physical activity in sedentary breast cancer survivors receiving hormone therapy. Methods: Forty-one
sedentary women on estrogen receptor modulators or aromatase inhibitors for stage I, II, or IIIA breast cancer were randomly assigned to
receive a 12-wk multidisciplinary physical activity behavior change intervention or usual care. Results: Recruitment was 34%, intervention
adherence was 99%, and complete follow-up data were obtained on 93%. Most participants (93%) were white with mean age of 53 T 9 yr.
Differences favoring the intervention group were noted for accelerometer physical activity counts (mean difference = 72,103; 95% confidence
interval (CI) = 25,383–119,000; effect size (d) = 1.02; P = 0.004), aerobic fitness (mean difference = 2.9; 95% CI = j0.1 to 5.8; d = 0.64;
P = 0.058), back/leg muscle strength (mean difference = 12.3; 95% CI = 0.4–15.9; d = 0.81; P = 0.017), waist-to-hip ratio (mean difference =
j0.05; 95% CI = j0.01 to j0.08; d = j0.77; P = 0.018), and social well-being (mean difference = 2.0; 95% CI = 0.3–3.8; d = 0.76;
P = 0.03). However, the intervention group also reported a greater increase in joint stiffness (mean difference = 1.1; 95% CI = 0.1–2.2;
d = 0.70; P = 0.04). Conclusions: A behavior change intervention for breast cancer survivors based on the social cognitive theory is feasible
and results in potentially meaningful improvements in physical activity and selected health outcomes. Confirmation in a larger study is
warranted. Key Words: BODY COMPOSITION, EXERCISE, INTERVENTION, ONCOLOGY, PREVENTION, SURVIVORSHIP
Adopting a healthy lifestyle after a cancer diagnosis
is important for improving health and quality of life
(11). Receiving a diagnosis of cancer may motivate
an individual to adopt healthier choices, providing an optimal time to initiate lifestyle behavior change interventions
(11). Focusing such interventions on physical activity adherence in breast cancer survivors is warranted because
physical activity may reduce breast cancer mortality, independent of diet and body mass index (BMI) (23,24).
Moreover, physical activity interventions may not be generalizable across cancer types because physical activity barriers, correlates, and preferences may differ on the basis of
cancer site and treatment status (9,10,37).
Change in physical activity behavior as the primary study
outcome identifies a study as ‘‘behavior change’’ rather than
exercise dose or efficacy study. Among the currently available randomized trials of physical activity behavior change
studies in cancer survivors, five focused on breast cancer,
one on prostate cancer, and four on mixed cancer types
(3,4,7,12,13,28,33,34,42,45). It is encouraging that seven of
these studies demonstrated significant improvements in
physical activity and two of the three without activity increases reported improvements in the exercise stage of
change. Despite this initial success, as many as 79% of
participants in physical activity behavior change interventions failed to meet public health recommendations (28,33)

and only one study has demonstrated improvements in
objective measures of physical activity (33).
Behavior change programs can improve effectiveness by
basing program elements and techniques on changing the
underlying cognitive variables known to be associated with
the behavior of interest (19). The social cognitive theory
has proven useful in identifying such variables for physical
activity behavior in breast cancer survivors (35,40,41). Although self-efficacy is the central construct of the social
cognitive theory, other important constructs exist [e.g., expectations of outcomes, importance of the expected outcomes, environment (including social support), etc.] (19).
Several prior behavior change studies have used the social
cognitive theory but have often focused on self-efficacy
rather than comprehensively considering multiple social
cognitive theory constructs (7,12,13,34).
Because physical activity behavior is the primary outcome of interest for behavior changes studies, there is a
potential for public health and medical professionals to assume that if an intervention increases activity, it will also
improve the health of its participants. Unfortunately, inconsistent results suggest that this assumption is not always
correct. When previous physical activity behavior change
studies in cancer survivors have included health outcomes
such as quality of life, functioning, symptoms, and body
composition (3,4,7,12,13,33,34,42,45), intervention effects
have been inconsistent owing to the differences in study
power, activity adherence rates, and exercise program goals.
Including health-related outcomes in physical activity behavior change intervention studies validates the health benefits that are assumed to occur with increased activity.
Importantly, several health outcomes particularly relevant for breast cancer survivors have not been reported in
physical activity behavior change intervention trials. Specifically, sleep dysfunction may affect more than half of
breast cancer survivors and may improve with regular
exercise (27). Cognitive impairment, albeit a less prevalent
complaint, may occur during chemotherapy for breast cancer with symptoms persisting after treatment completion
(44). Hormonal therapy (i.e., aromatase inhibitors and
estrogen receptor modulators) can cause vasomotor symptoms and joint pain, which may interfere with regular
exercise participation (8,18,25). Although it is unknown
whether regular exercise will improve these symptoms in
breast cancer survivors, studies in postmenopausal women
and individuals with osteoarthritis suggest that such symptoms may improve with regular physical activity (15,30).
Physical activity behavior change interventions are especially germane for breast cancer survivors on hormonal
therapy because exercise may counteract the potential deleterious effects of therapy on serum lipids and/or vascular
thrombosis risk (25). Moreover, survivors with hormone
receptor positive tumors may have the greatest potential for
reducing cancer recurrence and mortality with exercise (24).
Although several studies have focused on breast cancer
survivors in general (3,28,33,34,42), no study has focused
primarily on breast cancer survivors receiving hormonal
therapy.
Owing to the paucity of data supporting effective physical activity behavior change interventions in breast cancer
survivors on hormonal therapy and the inconsistent or not
previously reported impact of such interventions on healthrelated outcomes, we carried out a pilot randomized controlled trial. Our study aim was to determine the feasibility
and preliminary effectiveness of a physical activity behavior
change intervention for breast cancer survivors receiving
hormonal therapy, which attempted to comprehensively address multiple social cognitive theory constructs. Program
effectiveness in changing physical activity, fitness, muscle strength, body composition, perceived health, sick days
missed from work, quality of life, fatigue, endocrine symptoms, cognitive function, sleep dysfunction, and joint pain
were assessed.
METHODS
Setting and Participants
Participants were recruited through newspaper advertising, public service announcements, physician referrals from
local academic and private practice oncology offices, and
placement of flyers in clinical waiting rooms and beauty
salons. The study protocol was approved by the local institutional review board, and informed consent was obtained
from all participants before implementing study procedures.
Eligibility criteria included English-speaking female breast
cancer survivors between the ages of 18 and 70 yr with a
diagnosis of stage I, II, or IIIA. Participants were currently
taking aromatase inhibitors or selective estrogen receptor
modulators and were expected to remain on hormonal therapy for the duration of the study (i.e., at least 8 months).
Medical clearance for participation provided by primary
care physician or oncologist was required. If the patient had
undergone a surgical procedure, enrollment was delayed
until at least 8 wk after the procedure. Participants with the
following criteria were ineligible: diagnosis of dementia
or organic brain syndrome; medical, psychological, or
social characteristic that would interfere with the ability to
fully participate in program activities and assessments (e.g.,
psychosis, schizophrenia, etc.); contraindication to participation in a regular physical activity program (e.g., unstable
angina, debilitating arthritis pain); breast cancer recurrence
or metastatic disease; inability to ambulate; planning to relocate out of the study area during the 8-month study
period; and engaged in Q60 min of vigorous physical
activity or Q150 min of moderate plus vigorous activity per
wk during the past month (based on self-report).
Design and Procedures
The study piloted a two-armed, randomized controlled
trial comparing an intervention to usual care group. Interested participants were provided an explanation of the study
and screened by telephone for eligibility using a structured
936 Official Journal of the American College of Sports Medicine http://www.acsm-msse.org

interview format. If participants were interested and eligible, an appointment was made with the study coordinator
for completion of the consent and other related study forms
(e.g., HIPAA authorization). After consent was obtained, the
participant was given specific instructions related to scheduling and appropriate completion of each study measure:
submaximal treadmill test, dynamometer testing, anthropometric measures, accelerometer, diet record, self-administered
survey, and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Measurements
were obtained at baseline (preintervention) and after 3 months
(immediately postintervention). A small monetary incentive
was paid after completion of each set of study measures.
Random Assignment
Participants were randomized after completion of all baseline assessments. Randomization was computer generated
and kept in sealed envelopes until randomization to prevent
bias in group allocation by study personnel.
Physical Activity Behavior Change Intervention
The 12-wk physical activity behavior change intervention was entitled the BEAT Cancer program (i.e., Better
Exercise Adherence after Treatment for Cancer) and was
based on the social cognitive theory, other physical activity
correlates, and program preferences determined from prior
needs assessments among breast cancer survivors (e.g., faceto-face counseling from knowledgeable staff, home-based,
private setting, walking, moderate intensity, self-efficacy,
important exercise benefits, fatigue, time management, social
networking, role modeling, exercise enjoyment, and importance of avoiding risk) (38,40). The goal of the intervention,
based on current public health recommendations (22), was
to gradually increase all participants to 150 min of moderate
walking per wk. Intervention participation occurred in four
cohorts or ‘‘waves’’ to facilitate the group format.
The intervention consisted of group and individual sessions with Table 1 providing the number of each type of
session per week during the 12-wk intervention. Participants attended six discussion group sessions with a clinical
psychologist who encouraged social support, provided breast
cancer survivor exercise role models, and covered the following topics: journaling, time management, stress management,
dealing with exercise barriers, and behavior modification. The
specific social cognitive theory constructs addressed by the
group sessions included self-efficacy, emotional coping,
reciprocal determinism, perceived barriers, outcome expectations, behavioral capability, goal setting, environment, observational learning, and self-control. Participants also attended
12 individual supervised exercise and 3 individual ‘‘face-toface’’ update counseling sessions with an exercise specialist
that tapered to a home-based program by the end of the intervention. The supervised and update sessions were based on
exercise prescriptions derived from fitness testing described
below and used a structured interview format based on a standardized encounter form. In addition to walking, flexibility
exercises and exercise barriers were discussed. The specific
social cognitive theory constructs addressed by the individual
sessions included self-efficacy, outcome expectations, behavioral capability, perceived barriers, and goal setting with selfmonitoring. To further enhance self-monitoring, participants
were encouraged to ‘‘convert’’ the minutes spent in physical
activity recorded on their weekly exercise logs into ‘‘miles’’
(i.e., 1 min = 2 miles), which were graphed on a map indicating travel across the country to the west coast (i.e., ‘‘Race
across America’’). This activity was intended to provide participants with a feeling of accomplishment and a possible
competitive opportunity. The exercise specialists were certified by the American College of Sports Medicine (or certification eligible) with training, supervision, and periodic
monitoring for quality control performed by an exercise physiologist with experience in exercise programming for cancer
survivors. Participants met with different exercise specialists
during the intervention because assignment was made on the
basis of scheduling logistics.
Usual Care Group
The usual care group was provided written materials
related to physical activity obtained from the American
Cancer Society (published pamphlets and Web site resources: www.cancer.org). These materials were considered
‘‘usual care’’ because of their availability to the general
public. No specific instructions were given to the usual care
group concerning physical activity behavior change. Participants randomized to the usual care group were given the
opportunity to receive the intervention at no charge once the
postintervention assessments were complete.
Assessment of Primary and Secondary End Points
Feasibility framework. Feasibility was on the basis
of the RE-AIM (Reach, Efficacy/effectiveness, Adoption,
Implementation, and Maintenance) framework (14). Specifically, ‘‘Reach’’ was assessed by the percent recruitment
(or accrual) rate and comparison of participant characteristics
to public domain cancer registry data for the study

community. Program adherence rates, participant program
evaluation, physical activity, health outcomes, and adverse
events assessed ‘‘Efficacy/effectiveness.’’ The number of
oncology clinical offices referring participants assessed
‘‘Adoption,’’ whereas process evaluation and cost assessed
‘‘Implementation.’’ Finally, ‘‘Maintenance’’ was assessed by
attrition rates, barriers to participation (i.e., reasons for
refusals and withdrawals), and likelihood that the intervention would be repeated.
Process and program evaluation. Successful implementation of intervention activities as planned was monitored by the investigators, study coordinator, exercise
physiologist, and psychologist. A 21-item program evaluation form with primarily open-ended and yes/no questions
was administered to intervention participants during the
postintervention assessment.
Objective activity monitoring. All participants wore a
GT1M accelerometer (ActiGraph, Pensacola, FL) for seven
consecutive days; the accelerometer was removed when
bathing or asleep. Four valid days were required for an
adequate assessment with valid days determined according to
published protocols by reconciling data printouts with a record
of time in and out of bed completed by the participant (32).
The accompanying computer software used a combination of
the work energy theorem and Freedson equations to calculate
total activity counts, total steps, and minutes of light,
moderate, hard, and very hard activity (User’s Manual,
www.theactigraph.com). Although all outcomes were explored, the primary study end point was total activity counts.
Self-reported leisure time physical activity. The
Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire, a valid measure of self-reported physical activity behavior (20), was
used to assess leisure time activity. Participants were asked
to report the average weekly duration and frequency of
light, moderate, and vigorous leisure time activity for the
past month. Reported duration was multiplied by frequency
to determine the minutes per week spent in each of the three
intensity levels (light, moderate, or vigorous).
Stage of motivational readiness for physical
activity. Although the intervention was based on the social cognitive theory, stage of change [a component of the
transtheoretical model (19)] was assessed to describe the
characteristics of cancer patients willing to participate in
exercise studies (i.e., the ‘‘Reach’’ potential) and ensure
similarities between the study groups about readiness for
change. All participants were asked to report their physical activity stage of readiness (i.e., stage of change) before
learning about the study and postintervention using a previously validated scale (31). Responses were classified into
one of five stages: precontemplation (do not exercise regularly and do not intend to do so in the next 6 months),
contemplation (do not exercise regularly but intend to do
so in the next 6 months), preparation (exercising some
but not regularly), action (regular exerciser for less than
6 months), and maintenance (regular exerciser for 6 months
or more) (31).
Fitness. A submaximal treadmill test using the Naughton
protocol with the end point of 85% of predicted maximal heart
rate was used to determine fitness on the basis of a published
regression equation estimating total oxygen cost of walking
at the treadmill grade and speed achieved (2). The Naughton
protocol was chosen because of its lower starting speed and
more gradual progression, which is preferred when testing
older sedentary participants who may be fatigued and/or who
suffer balance difficulties related to breast cancer treatment.
Also, maximal oxygen consumption testing is uncomfortable
for participants and may increase study drop-outs (15,39).
Muscle strength. A back/leg extensor dynamometer (Takei Back-A Model No. TKK5002, Tokyo, Japan)
and handgrip dynamometer (Lafeyette Model No. 78010,
Lafayette, IN) were used to measure muscle strength. At each
assessment period, the participant completed three trials with
1-min rest between trials. The maximum reading (best of the
three efforts) provided the absolute strength measure in
kilograms.
Body composition and anthropometrics. Body
mass index was calculated [weight per height squared
(kgImj2
)] using scale and stadiometer. Waist and hip circumference was measured using a nonstretching tape measure with the participant standing with abdomen relaxed and
arms at sides. The waist circumference was measured at the
smallest circumference of the torso and end of exhalation
with no clothing at the waist. Hip circumference was measured at the level of the maximum extension of the buttocks
with only undergarments at the hip. At each testing, three
measurements were obtained and the results averaged before
calculation of the waist-to-hip ratio. To determine percent
body fat and bone mineral density, dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) was performed using a Lunar Prodigy with
Version 5.60.003 software (Lunar GE, Madison, WI).
Patient-rated health-related outcomes. The remaining health-related variables were determined by selfadministered survey. Perceived health was assessed by asking
participants to rate their general health on a 5-point Likert
scale from 1 = poor to 5 = excellent. The participants were
asked to report the number of sick days missed from work in
the past month using a single, fill-in-the-blank question. Using
the sum of 5-point Likert scales, quality of life was measured with the 37-item Functional Assessment of Cancer
Therapy—Breast (FACT-B) (5), which includes the subscales of physical well-being (PWB), social well-being
(SWB), emotional well-being (EWB), functional well-being
(FWB), and additional concerns (AC). PWB, SWB, EWB,
and FWB are summed for the FACT—General (FACT-G)
with total FACT-B score including FACT-G plus AC. The 13-
item FACT—Fatigue (FACT-F) (46), the 19-item FACT—
Endocrine Symptoms (FACT-ES) (17), and the 42-item
FACT—Cognitive (FACT-Cog) (43) were used to assess
fatigue, endocrine symptoms, and cognitive function, respectively. All FACT scales are self-report and have proven
validity and reliability (5,17,43,46). Sleep dysfunction was
assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)
938 Official Journal of the American College of Sports Medicine http://www.acsm-msse.org
APPLIED SCIENCES

with scoring according to published protocol so that a higher
score indicates greater sleep dysfunction (i.e., habitual sleep
efficiency, sleep latency, sleep duration, subjective sleep
quality, use of sleeping medication, daytime dysfunction, and
global score) (6). Owing to limited survey space, the sleep
disturbances subscale was not included requiring that the
global score be on the basis of the sum of six rather than the
usual seven domains. Because the intervention primarily
encouraged a lower extremity weight bearing activity (i.e.,
walking), joint pain, stiffness, and physical function were
assessed using the 5-point Likert scale version (i.e., 1 = none
to 5 = extreme) of the 24-item Western Ontario and McMaster
Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), a measure of
lower extremity pain and function (36).
Covariates, intervention adherence, and adverse
events. With the exception of beta-blocker use and comorbidity score, the demographic characteristics, medical
variables, and prior physician exercise counseling information provided in Table 2 were assessed by self-administered
survey (multiple choice, yes/no, or fill-in-the-blank items).
Owing to the potential influence on the results of the submaximal treadmill test, participants were asked to provide a
list of all current medications that were reviewed by the
research staff to identify beta-blocker use. The comorbidity
score was calculated by summing responses to the Functional Comorbidity Index, which asks participants to report
history of 18 different health conditions (1 = yes, 0 = no)
(21). Diet intake was assessed with the 3-d diet record
(i.e., 1 weekend and 2 weekdays) and was analyzed with Diet
Analysis Plus software, version 7.0.1 (www.Thomsonedu.com;
Florence, KY). Intervention participation and adverse events
were monitored by the investigators, study coordinator, psychologist, and exercise specialists.
Statistical Analysis
Participants randomized to the intervention group were
compared with the usual care group on demographic,
medical, diet, physical activity, and other health-related outcomes at baseline using independent t-test, chi-square,
or Kruskal-Wallis procedures depending on the nature
and distribution of the variable. To achieve the stated study
aim, the change for postintervention minus baseline for the
intervention versus usual care group was assessed with independent t-test, chi-square, or Kruskal-Wallis procedures
depending on variable and distribution characteristics. An
intent-to-treat analysis was done, and a P value G 0.05 was
set as the level of significance. All differences are provided with calculated effect sizes regardless of statistical
significance owing to the pilot nature of the study and the

usefulness of the effect sizes for designing future studies
assessing physical activity behavior change interventions.
About the missing data, 1 of the 38 participants completing follow-up measures refused to answer four of the
endocrine symptom items and two of the cognitive function
items on the follow-up survey. Because these were above
our a priori thresholds for the minimum number of missing
values allowing imputation (e.g., missing values were not
imputed if 92 of the endocrine scale items or 91 of the
cognitive subscale items were missing), the following three
scores could not be calculated for this participant: endocrine
symptoms, cognitive function interference with functioning,
and the total cognitive function. There were no missing
values related to non–survey measures with the exception of
missing daily steps on one participant because of accelerometer malfunction. Also noteworthy, DXA results are
available on 39 rather than 38 participants because one of
the participants not completing the follow-up measures
completed the follow-up DXA measurement.
An a priori sample size of 20 participants per study
group was based primarily on logistical and budgetary
constraints. When the study power for this feasible sample
size was assessed, information related to the expected betweengroup difference for physical activity counts was not available. However, power calculations based on daily kilocalorie
expenditure (which is derived from both frequency and intensity of activity similar to activity counts) demonstrated
that enrolling 20 intervention participants would provide 81%
study power to detect an increase of 200 kcal expended per day
using a paired t-test with a significance level of 0.05 in the
intervention group. Because 100 min of walking per week is
equivalent to 150 to 200 kcal expended daily, we felt that our
sample size, although logistically restricted, was adequate for
detecting meaningful differences.
RESULTS
Participants were recruited from April 2006 to April
2007. Flow of participants through the study is provided in
Figure 1. All of the community and academic oncology clinics
involved in the study referred participants for possible
enrollment. Of the 119 women responding to a physician
referral, study flyer, public service announcement, or newspaper advertisement, 49 (41%) were consented. Because
8 withdrew between consenting and randomization owing to
time (n = 7) or to being physically unable (n = 1), 41 (34%)
completed baseline testing and were randomized, achieving
our a priori sample size estimate of 20 participants per study
group. Attrition after randomization for the trial overall was
7% (3/41) with 1 not completing follow-up in the intervention
group owing to unrelated illness, 1 not completing follow-up
in the usual care group owing to distance, and 1 providing
incomplete follow-up data (i.e., DXA only) in the usual care
group owing to unrelated illness.
The only deviation from protocol was the enrollment of
a participant who did not initiate hormonal therapy until
several weeks into the intervention owing to miscommunication with study staff. Although not a protocol deviation,
one participant in the intervention group completed all
intervention activities and meetings but did not exercise at
home during the final 6 wk of the study because of activity
restrictions related to receiving elective cosmetic surgery.
Although intent-to-treat analysis was the primary analyses,
post hoc supplementary analysis was done excluding both
of these participants for the following reasons: 1) initiating
hormonal therapy during the trial may unduly influence
changes in endocrine symptoms and joint pains and 2) lack
of exercise adherence was not a volitional choice of the
participant receiving cosmetic surgery. Because a similar pattern of change in the study outcomes was seen with exclusion of these two participants, only the intent-to-treat
analyses are reported.
Table 2 provides the baseline characteristics overall and
by group assignment. Study participants were primarily
white (93%) with a mean age of 53 T 9 yr. Half (51%) had
stage II disease with 27% taking estrogen receptor modulators and 73% taking aromatase inhibitors. An oncologist
had advised 39% of the participants to exercise, and most
(80%) were in the contemplation or preparation exercise
stage of change. As described in Table 2, the two study
groups did not significantly differ in age, race, education,
income, medical factors, prior physician counseling about
exercise, and readiness for physical activity behavior change.
Because only two participants dropped out of the study after
randomization, comparison with those who did not drop out
was not made.
Process evaluation and adherence. All components of the intervention were successfully implemented
with the exception of a group ‘‘competition’’ (or ‘‘Race
across America’’ activity) involving conversion of activity
minutes to miles for participants to track progress during the
group sessions, which many participants did not find helpful.
About adherence, the intervention participants completed
100% (252/252) of the individual exercise sessions, 95%
(60/63) of the individual update sessions, and 98% (123/126)
of the group sessions for an overall 99% adherence to all
possible intervention sessions (435/441). Of the 63 individual
update sessions with the exercise specialists, 4 (6%) were
administered by telephone rather than face-to-face owing to
logistical reasons and participant preference.
Of the 21 intervention participants, 19 (90%) completed a
program evaluation with 89% feeling that the group sessions were helpful, 79% stating the number of sessions was
appropriate, and 84% reporting that the behavioral modification plan was helpful. About the individual exercise sessions, 100% felt the exercise specialists were knowledgeable
and helpful with 95% feeling that the sessions were tailored
to their needs. When asked if their exercise behavior had
changed during the program, 89% indicated ‘‘yes’’ with 11%
being uncertain. When asked which part of the program was
most helpful regarding their exercise change, the following
were listed: interactions with exercise specialists (47%),

experiencing the beneficial effects of exercise (16%),
‘‘everything’’ (11%), keeping the exercise log (11%),
developing a routine (11%), and beginning slowly (5%).
Most (89%) would recommend the BEAT Cancer program to
others with the program ranked as excellent by 21% and very
good by 37%. Participants who rated the program as good
(37%) or fair (5%) represented the full range of age, education, and income; however, these individuals recommended that the program be revised to include strength training,
diet counseling (for a more ‘‘complete’’ program), and a
variety of exercise options.
Physical activity, fitness,andmuscle strength. Table 3
provides the change in physical activity, fitness, muscle
strength, and body composition from baseline to postintervention for the usual care versus intervention group.
Significant improvements were noted in total physical
activity counts for the intervention versus usual care group
(+51,744 vs j20,359; mean difference = 72,103; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 25,383–119,000; effect size (d) =
1.02; P = 0.004). Although not statistically significant,
large effect size increases were noted in moderate and
vigorous (i.e., hard + very hard) activity minutes. A small
nonsignificant effect size increase in self-reported moderate + vigorous activity was noted (79.4 vs 62.8; mean
difference = 16.6; 95% CI = j53.1 to 86.2; d = 0.16; P =
0.63). Consistent with the physical activity improvements,
a medium to a large effect size increase was noted for
stage of change (+1.45 vs +0.5; mean difference = 0.95;
95% CI = 0.75–1.83; d = 0.71; P = 0.034).
Accelerometer data were classified into meeting or not
meeting current public health recommendations (i.e., Q150
minIwkj1 of moderate or vigorous activity). From baseline
to follow-up, the proportion meeting recommendations in the
usual care group increased from 28% to 33% (McNemar,

change, increases were noted in the intervention group for
left handgrip (0.1 vs j1.9; mean difference = 2.0; 95% CI =
0.3–3.9; d = 0.76; P = 0.03) and back/leg extensor strength
(+8.2 vs j4.1 kg; mean difference = 12.3; 95% CI = 0.4–
15.9; d = 0.81; P = 0.017).
About body composition, no difference was noted for BMI
or percent body fat. However, there was a significant decline in the waist-to-hip ratio for the intervention versus
the usual care group postintervention (j0.03 vs 0.02; mean
difference = j0.05; 95% CI = j0.08 to j0.01; d = j0.77;
P = 0.02). Also, no difference was noted for femoral neck
and lumbar (i.e., L2–L4) bone mineral density (i.e., j0.01
change for each measure in both groups). Relevant to
body composition, the intervention group demonstrated a
nonsignificant decline in daily kilocalorie intake when
compared to the usual care group (i.e., j302 vs j206;
mean difference = j95; 95% CI = j449 to 259; d = j0.18;
P = 0.59).
Patient-rated outcomes. No significant difference in
mean change was noted for perceived health (usual care = 0.17
vs intervention = 0.15, P = 0.94) or sick days missed from
work (usual care = j0.20 vs intervention = 0.20, P = 0.80).
Also, no difference for the usual care versus intervention
group was noted for fatigue (j4.2 vs j1.9, P = 0.53) or
endocrine symptoms (j2.9 vs j0.9, P = 0.45).
Table 4 provides the change in quality of life from baseline to postintervention for the usual care versus intervention group. Social well-being demonstrated significantly
greater improvements in the intervention group versus usual
care group (i.e., 0.8 vs j1.2, P = 0.03).
Table 5 provides the changes in cognitive function, sleep
dysfunction, and joint symptoms from baseline to postintervention for the usual care versus intervention group.
The effect sizes were variable in size and direction depending on the component of cognitive function or sleep
dysfunction measured with no significant differences note.
For joint symptoms, no improvement was noted with the intervention but, unexpectedly, joint stiffness was greater
among the intervention versus usual care group (i.e., 0.4 vs
j0.72, P = 0.04).
No adverse events related to the intervention or other
study procedures occurred. The following nonserious, nonrelated events were recorded: wheezing requiring physician

DISCUSSION
Our randomized controlled trial is unique in its focus on
breast cancer survivors receiving hormonal therapy and
comprehensive assessment of health-related outcomes. Our
physical activity behavior change intervention (BEAT Cancer program) was feasible and well-accepted by the participants. The BEAT Cancer program significantly improved
physical activity counts measured by accelerometer, muscle
strength, and social well-being with large effect size increases in moderate activity, vigorous activity, and fitness
that were not statistically significant owing to limited study
power. Although no improvements in BMI and percent body
fat were noted, a significant decrease in waist-to-hip ratio
was noted in the intervention group. Unexpectedly, the intervention group reported a significant increase in joint
stiffness. The intervention did not significantly change
perceived health, sick days missed from work, fatigue,
endocrine symptoms, cognitive function (based on selfreport), or perceived sleep dysfunction.
Our intervention was highly feasible from the standpoint
of efficacy and implementation. Most intervention sessions
were successfully completed, most participants felt the
intervention was worthwhile and helpful, and no related
adverse events were reported. It is noteworthy that our
‘‘competition’’ among the participants was the only intervention component not well received suggesting that this
activity be dropped from the intervention. Because such an
activity has proven helpful in other populations (e.g.,
physicians in training [39]), this occurrence reinforces the
importance of considering the specific preferences of the
target population when designing interventions. It is also
interesting that the individual sessions with the exercise
specialists were felt to be the most helpful intervention
component. This is consistent with prior reports that faceto-face counseling is the preferred physical activity delivery channel among breast cancer patients (38) but is
contrary to our expectation that the group sessions would
provide the most assistance in changing behavior by
emphasizing issues such as behavioral modification.
The high intervention completion rates suggest that our
intervention has short-term ‘‘maintenance’’ potential within
the RE-AIM framework with the fact that 89% would
recommend the program to others suggesting long-term
‘‘maintenance’’ of program dissemination, as well. Although
these results are encouraging, the intervention required significant staff time to ensure that each session was scheduled
and completed according to protocol. Furthermore, distance,
lack of time, and the development of unrelated combordities
were the most frequent reasons for refusing to participate in
or complete the intervention and study follow-up. Although
a multidisciplinary intensive intervention may be effective
in changing behavior, its complexity carries the risk of
refusal to participate owing to these identified barriers.
Future studies to determine the most effective components
of the intervention to simplify implementation, reduce cost,
and enhance participation are warranted. Such studies should
encourage oncologists to recommend the study to patients, a
recruitment strategy we found effective because all oncology
clinics referred participants for possible enrollment demonstrating broad ‘‘adoption’’ by local oncologists.
Importantly, our study is among only a few behavior change
studies in cancer survivors to use an objective measure
of physical activity. Because significant improvements in

self-reported physical activity may occur without significant
increases in objectively measured physical activity (34,42), it
is unfortunate that only three of the studies have reported
objectively measured physical activity (33,34,42). We also
demonstrated a greater between-group difference for selfreport versus the accelerometer (i.e., 16.6 min of moderate +
vigorous for self-report vs 9.2 min of moderate + vigorous
for accelerometer), further supporting the importance of
using an objective measure. However, the effect size was
smaller for self-report physical activity in our study owing to
the relatively large SD of the between-group difference (i.e.,
16.6 T 105.7). The small percentage of individuals in
the action or maintenance exercise stage of change at baseline
despite the study participant criteria may be related to participants incorrectly considering occupational rather than leisure exercise when answering the stage of change items or
initiating exercise between the screening interview and completion of baseline study measures. Fortunately, there was no
difference between the study groups concerning stage of
change, and the inadvertent inclusion of more active
individuals at baseline would bias the results toward a null
finding, further emphasizing the potential effectiveness of our
intervention.
It is notable that significant improvements in objective
physical activity were found with our intervention because
only one of the three prior behavior change studies assessing
objective physical activity has demonstrated significant
improvements in the intervention group (33). Furthermore,
the large effect size increase in fitness is important because
only two of the prior four behavior change studies assessing
fitness have demonstrated improvements (3,34). Despite
significant improvement in activity counts, the absolute
between-group differences for moderate and vigorous activity were below the recommended 150 minIwkj1 of moderate
activity with only 60% of the individuals receiving the
intervention meeting current recommendations based on
objective monitoring. This suggests that future interventions
should focus on assisting participants in adequately assessing
and achieving at least moderate intensity activity.
Several reasons may explain the counterintuitive greater
increase in daily step count in the usual care group, a result
noted in a prior behavior change study as well (42). Because
activity counts are based on intensity and frequency of movement, a shift into higher intensity activity by participants in
the intervention group could contribute to an increase in activity counts without a comparable increase in daily steps. In
addition, the usual care group may have increased their activity because of a readiness to change without increasing
their intensity contributing to an increase in steps without a
comparable increase in activity counts. Finally, some participants in the intervention group may have transitioned to
exercise types not measured in a vertical plane (as with the step
function) during the home-based portion of the program
but exercise logs indicated that all were participating in walking with the exception of two who were using the elliptical
machine.
About study limitations, physical activity and social wellbeing improvements may have been due to study staff
attention and not specifically related to intervention activities because study staff contact time was not similar for the
intervention and usual care group. Therefore, definitive
conclusions related to social well-being cannot be made
without confirmation in future studies providing equal staff
attention to both the usual care and intervention groups.
Although study outcomes may have been influenced by
different exercise specialists leading the encounters, the
sessions were standardized by consistent training, periodic
quality control monitoring, and use of structured interview
format. Moreover, the fact that the intervention was
effective despite using different individuals suggests a
greater intervention translational potential. Also, exercise
specialists performing the treadmill and muscle strength
testing were not blinded to participant group allocation
owing to staffing availability. Although the exercise
specialists were carefully trained and monitored for objective, standardized administration of the protocol, measurement bias may have occurred if participants in the
intervention group were provided additional encouragement, enhancing treadmill or dynamometer test performance. Although blinding of the testing personnel should
not have influenced the primary outcome measure (i.e.,
accelerometer measurement) or the remaining study measures, the inability to blind participants to group allocation
is an inherent limitation of exercise studies, which may bias
participant responses and behaviors because of their awareness of the study purpose and desire to please the study
staff. Also, exercise logs were used as a part of the intervention materials but were not used concurrent with the
accelerometer to identify activities that are not measured by
the accelerometer (e.g., swimming, bicycling). Nevertheless,
the two intervention participants logging activities other
than walking reported use of an elliptical machine, an activity which can be detected by the accelerometer. Finally,
our sample size precluded analyses of the potential moderating effects of demographic and medical factors (e.g., age).
Although our recruitment rate of 34% is similar to rates
reported for randomized clinical trials in cancer survivors
(16), this percentage may reduce the generalizability (or
‘‘Reach’’) of our study. For example, on the basis of public
domain data from the state cancer registry, our mean age
was slightly lower than the mean age of 61 yr for all breast
cancer survivors in the state, suggesting that our program
may be more attractive to the younger survivor. In contrast,
it is encouraging that the percent minority representation is
similar to that of the breast cancer survivor population in
the study community. Also relevant to ‘‘Reach,’’ the low
percentage of participants in the precontemplation stage of
change suggests that different interventions will be required
to attract survivors in this stage.
Because body composition influences breast cancer risk
before and after diagnosis, the improvements in waist-to-hip
ratio may be clinically important (1). The lack of change in
944 Official Journal of the American College of Sports Medicine http://www.acsm-msse.org

percent body fat or BMI may be caused by the short followup period and the intervention focus on physical activity
rather than weight loss. Our findings are consistent with a
recent review suggesting that physical activity interventions
may alter body composition rather than body weight (26).
The significant reductions in waist-to-hip ratio are especially
important because abdominal obesity is associated with
greater risk of breast cancer recurrence and mortality (1).
Although conclusions about whether the intervention could
possibly reduce cancer recurrence cannot be made, the waistto-hip ratio changes may serve as a biomarker suggesting
that the increases in physical activity are sufficient for
achieving important health benefits.
Effects on quality of life and fatigue have been inconsistent in other randomized exercise behavior change studies with improvements noted in three of the seven studies
assessing quality of life (3,42,45) and in two of three studies
assessing fatigue (34,42). The lack of effect in our study
may have been related to relative high quality of life and
low fatigue scores at baseline causing a ceiling or floor
effect (29). Because the greatest improvements in fatigue
and quality of life can be expected immediately after treatment, the large variation in cancer stage and time since
treatment may have prevented the study’s ability to detect
differences. Future studies should consider focusing inclusion criteria or enrolling an adequate sample size to assess
potential moderation of the intervention effect on the basis
of time since treatment or cancer stage. Furthermore, a
single dimension rather than a multidimensional fatigue assessment was used precluding the assessment of differential
effects on fatigue dimensions that might occur. Nevertheless, the increase in social well-being suggests that future
behavior change trials should assess whether intervention
effects vary for the individual aspects of quality of life.
As with fatigue, a floor effect may have contributed to the
lack of improvement seen with endocrine symptoms,
cognitive function, and sleep dysfunction. Also, our feasibility study was not powered to assess the potential
moderating effect of chemotherapy on cognitive function,
which may have been important because cognitive impairment is more often associated with chemotherapy. Nevertheless, our results suggest that future studies, which include
these outcomes, should enroll larger sample sizes allowing
adequate study power and stratification by treatment type.
Such studies, when appropriate, should assess the individual
construct domains because of the variability in intervention
effect that may occur and should include all seven sleep
domains to allow comparison of the absolute global score to
other reports. Moreover, objective measures of cognitive
function and sleep dysfunction may need to be included
because our assessment was based on self-report alone.
The increase in joint stiffness in the intervention group
compared with the usual care group was surprising because
exercise is a proven nonpharmacologic therapy for arthritis
(30). Joint stiffness is not a major adverse event that is
generally assessed or reported in physical activity intervention studies. Also, most individuals who are older (e.g., our
study population had a mean age of 53 T 9 yr) consider mild
joint symptoms as ‘‘normal’’ and may not report these
unless specifically asked about them. Nevertheless, no previous exercise trial has monitored joint stiffness in breast
cancer survivors receiving hormone therapy and possibly
exercise may exacerbate joint stiffness that results from
aromatase inhibitors. Although confirmation of this finding
in larger studies is needed, future interventions should
monitor this possible adverse event.
Additional research is needed to confirm our intervention
effectiveness (short and long term), evaluate dissemination
potential, and determine the most cost-effective components.
Future interventions, including a refinement of the BEAT
Cancer program, should emphasize achieving adequate
activity intensity with the provision of personal heart rate
monitors and/or rigorous training in accurately rating perceived exertion. Efforts to decrease joint complaints by
emphasizing adequate shoe support and the stretching/
flexibility exercises prescribed before and after each exercise
session are also warranted. Future studies assessing the
effectiveness of physical activity behavior change interventions should include an objective physical activity assessment
whenever feasible and confirm health benefits by measuring
relevant health outcomes. Furthermore, identifying possible
differential effectiveness of the group versus individual
intervention components will advance current understanding
of the most cost-effective modalities for enhancing physical
activity behavior change and maintenance.
