432/fibrinogen gel, did not survive for more than 3 years,
although they were subsequently treated with chemotherapy or
radiation therapy. The other 4 cases of primary carcinomas
(cases 3, 4, 5 and 10) and 8 of the recurrent carcinomas (cases
6-9, ll-14), which were unaffected by OK-432, were also
treated with surgery and/or palliative chemotherapy plus radiation therapy after local injection of OK-432/fibrinogen gel. It is
difficult to assess the clinical benefit of applications of OK-432/
fibrinogen gel because of the small number of patients and the
short observation time in this trial. However, it is relatively easy
to apply multiple, local treatments to tumours existing in the
head and neck in comparison with tumours of other organs. In
this respect, a multi-institutional collaborative study would
clarify the clinical applicability of local administration of OK432Zbrinogen gel to head and neck carcinomas.

One-year follow-up of the ‘Starting Again’ Group
Rehabilitation Programme for Cancer Patients
G. Berglund, C. Bolund, U.-L. Gustafsson and P.-O. SjiidCn
In a randomised prospective study, a brief structured rehabilitation programme, ‘Starting Again’, was evaluated
over a follow-up year. 98 patients were assigned to the programme, and 101 to the control condition. The 11,2-h
sessions emphasised physical training, information and coping skills. Patients in the programme improved
significantly more than the controls with respect to appraisal of having received sufficient information, physical
training, physical strength and fighting spirit. Results indicate improvement with respect to the three areas
focused on in the ‘Starting Again’ programme: physical training, information and coping skills training.

with risk for psychosocial morbidity [4]. Several studies [5-71
have reported a positive relationship between extent of disease
and/or medical treatment a.nd higher risk for psychological
morbidity.
The most salient points of criticism of existing studies, raised
in the reviews, are that: there is confusion about the theoretical
framework; the types of psychosocial support are insufficiently
described; there is a failure to report statistical analysis in enough
detail; therapy and assessment are very often carried out by the
same person; evaluation methods vary, thereby complicating the
comparison of results between studies, and long-term effectiveness is rarely reported.
Very few randomised studies of psychosocial group interventions for cancer patients include follow-ups. However, these
are discussed below, with regard to the distinction proposed by
Andersen [4] between interventions for low, moderate and high
risk groups.
Only one study of patients having a low risk for psychosocial
morbidity has been reported 1[8], which was a randomised study
of a brief intervention, focusing on health education, problemsolving skills, stress management and social support for malignant melanoma patients. Assessments were made immediately
after the intervention and at 6 months [S]. When patients had
been informed of group assignment, 25% of the control group
withdrew and the base-line values of several outcome measures
differed significantly. After intervention, the intervention group
used more active-behavioural coping us compared with the
controls. With respect to affective states, the controls reported
more lack of vigour than the intervention group. At the 6-month
follow-up, differences in coping were maintained, were more
pronounced and extended to active-cognitive coping. In
addition, depression decreased further in the intervention group.
There are two studies of interventions for moderate risk
patients. Cain and co-workers [9] obtained an 83% response rate
at the 6-month follow-up. Thematic counselling (individually or
in a group) was found to be superior to no counselling in
this randomised study. However, the study comprised a small
number of patients, and the most powerful statistical methods
were not employed. The intervention programme focused on
information about cancer and strategies for health promotion,
such as progressive relaxation, diet and exercise. Telch and
Telch [IO] performed a randomised study comparing group
coping skills instruction with supportive group therapy. The
former was superior to the 1atte:r at postintervention with respect
to psychological adjustment. The design included a 3-month
follow-up, data from which were not reported, since 40% of the
patients were unavailable.
Three studies have been performed with high risk patients.
Ferlic and colleagues [ll] is referred to by Telch and coworkers [2] as a randomised study, while the authors say that
patients were “assigned to the treatment group . . . balanced
for age, sex and education” (p. 762). A follow-up questionnaire
was mailed at 6 months, but the return rate was insufficient and
the data were not reported. Spiegel and co-workers evaluated
the outcome of a supportive group activity in a randomised,
prospective study for women with metastatic

carcinoma [12, 131. This study is referred to by Watson [3] as
a matched design, although the original publication indicates
randomisation. The support groups ran for 1 year, and assessments were made every fourth month during that year. The
Spiegel studies concern a long-term intervention but no followup.
Thus until now, no long-term (1 year) randomised evaluation
of a relatively time-limited group intervention for cancer patients
exists. A reasonable hypothesis is that thematic counselling is
more effective than no counselling [9], and that coping skills
training is more effective than support group therapy [lo]. In
addition, altering coping strategies in a positive and active
direction might improve affective states, even long-term [8].
The ‘Starting Again’ (SA) group is an 11-session programme
run for 7 weeks with an emphasis on information, physical
training and coping skills training. The programme has been
described in detail elsewhere [14, 151. The present study
employs a randomised, prospective design. There were five data
collection points: before and after the intervention and at 3-, 6-
and 12-months follow-up. Short-term results from pre-, postintervention and 3-month assessments have been presented
elsewhere [ 151. They indicate a level of physical training and
strength significantly higher than before the intervention in the
SA group participants compared with controls; SA patients’
appraisal of having received sufficient information increased
significantly; frequency of sleeping problems diminished in the
SA group and changes of the psychological ‘Fighting Spirit’
response to cancer favoured the SA group [ 151.
Previous research supports the conclusion that after a structured programme, cancer patients show at least short-term
improvements with respect to many variables [9-11, l&19].
The main aim of the present study was to investigate the
development of short-term programme gains over a follow-up
period of 1 year.
Design
MATERIALS AND METHODS
A prospective, randomised control group design was utilised.
Patients were informed about the ‘Starting Again’ (SA) programme, and about the randomisation process by the nurse
responsible for the groups. They were then asked to fill out the
base-line questionnaires. Patients who accepted were randomised to the SA programme or to a control condition. Efron’s
method for randomisation of small samples was used [20]. At
the randomisation of each individual patient, group sizes were
forced towards equality by proportionately increasing the probability of assignment to the smaller group. Postmeasure questionnaires and those at the 3-, 6- and 12-month follow-ups were
mailed to patients, who were to return them by mail. If necessary,
they were reminded three times.
The control group was divided into two subgroups: one third
received a single information session (n = 36), consisting of the
oncologist and dietitian information packages included in the SA
programme, and two thirds received no intervention (n = 65).
Patients
Inclusion criteria were age below 75 years, curative treatment
for a primary tumour and inclusion within 2 months after postoperative treatment with radio- or chemotherapy.
98 patients were randomised to the SA programme and 101 to
the control condition. Table 1 illustrates response rates and
reasons for non-response for all assessments. 73 other patients
declined participation, but agreed to complete the question-

naires. The most frequent reasons for non-participation were no
perceived need for an intervention, no interest in the group
model, competing activities, long distances to the hospital and
dislike of the randomisation procedure. 20 patients declined
both participation and monitoring. The non-participants had
lower problem levels than the participants [2 I].
There were no differences with respect to background variables between the SA and the control groups [ 171. 80% in both
groups were breast cancer patients, 7-8% had ovarian cancers
and the rest represented a variety of cancer diagnoses. The
typical patient was a woman, 52-53 years of age with a primary
breast tumour. She had terminated post-operative radiation, was
married or lived with a man and had two children who had left
home. Her profession was secretarial or office work.
The ‘Starting Again’ programme
The programme has been described fully elsewhere [14, 151.
It emphasised physical training, information and coping skills
training. Eleven sessions were held in 7 weeks. The mean
absenteeism among participants was one session. This represents
a variation of the number of participants per session between 3
and 7 (mean 4.9). During the first 4 weeks, patients met twice a
week, once for information and once for physical training. The
last 3 weeks were devoted to one session of coping skills training
each week. An oncology nurse, specialised in psychosocial issues
conducted the groups during all sessions. She was mostly
accompanied by a specialist of the theme dealt with at each
session.
Physical training. The sessions included exercises to increase
mobility, muscle strength, general fitness and relaxation in the
form of progressive muscle relaxation or deep relaxation with
positive images. Patients were given instructions for progressive
relaxation at home.
Infmmation. Four themes were considered: the effects on the
disease of curative and adjuvant treatments, appropriate diet
and the relation between diet and health, crises and development
through crises [22] and alternative treatments.
Coping skills. Role plays were employed for returning to work
situations, such as how to handle peculiar attitudes towards
cancer, meeting people asking too much or too little, and
problem situations at the hospital when returning for control
visits. One session was devoted to anxiety, and how to handle it
with different coping strategies (relaxation, distraction, cognitive techniques).
Outcome measures
A full description of the outcome measures has been previously
published [ 14, 151. Besides demographic variables, the following outcome variables were included: work status, sick leave,
patients’ appraisal of having received sufficient information,
physical strength and activity (21 items in six subscales: physical
strength, physical training, tiredness, body image, pain and
global health), a shortened HAD-scale (Ref. 23.; 5 anxiety and
6 depressive items, Cronbach alpha for pre- and postanxiety
scores were 0.79 and 0.81 and for depression scores 0.76 and
O.Sl), quality of life, activities at home and in the community
(Sjiidtn, 1983, unpublished), physical symptoms from breast
cancer (frequency and burden), communication with staff items
selected from Heinrich and colleagues [24] and the Mental
adjustment to cancer (MAC)-scale [25].
Factor analysis of base-line data from the symptom list
permitted a reduction of the 20 items (frequency) to six
subscales [14, 151. Oblique varimax rotation was applied and
factor loadings > 0.45 and interitem correlations of > 0.35 were
required. Subscales were (1) worry (three items: anxiousness,
worry for health, sleeping problems); (2) aversions (four items:
nausea, food aversions, smell aversions, vomiting); (3) mixed
symptoms A (five items: fatigue, decreased stamina, joint problems, pain, infections); (4) mixed symptoms B (two items:
weight problems, hair loss; (5) surgery effects (two items:
problems with operation scar, problems with appearance
changes); and (6) cognitive effects (two items: memory problems, concentration problems). Because of the different contents, two items were not included in the subscales, though
factor loadings were above 0.45. Those were sexual problems
and mucous membrane disturbances.
Statistical methods
Chi-squared tests were applied to category variables and ttests to all continuous background variables. Repeated measures
analyses of variance (ANOVA) were applied to all dependent
continuous variables when there was no significant betweengroup (r-test) difference at base-line. In the case of significant
base-line differences, gain scores were employed. Tukey’s [26]
HSD-test was employed for post hoc between-group differences.
For within-group differences, including comparison of more
than two means, Scheffe’s test was applied as recommended [26]. ANOVA scores are based on those patients
who provided data for all points of assessment (SA = 84,
C = 85).
Work
RESULTS
There were no significant between-group differences at any
time assessed. However, there was a strong effect of time. At
the base-line, a mean of 67% (SA = 72%, n = 71, C = 63%,
n = 64) did not work. At the postmeasure, 8-12 weeks later,
29% in both groups were still not working (SA: n = 26, C:
n = 28). For SA and control groups, respectively, the percent-

ages not working were 21 (n = 19) and 25 (n = 23); 19 (n = 16)
and 27 (n = 25); and 22 (n == 18) and 29 (n = 25) at 3,6 and 12
months, respectively. Of those, 9% (n = 8) and 12% (n = 10)
in the SA and control groups were above 65 years of age, which
means that 13-17% (n = 11-14) remained unemployed.
Sick leave
There were no significant group differences. At base-line,
70% of the SA participants (n = 69) and 56% (n = 57) of the
controls had some degree of sick leave. Some patients combined
half-time sick leave with half-time work. At postmeasure, this
number had decreased to .20% in both groups (n = 18 and
n = 20). Over the year, there was a steady decrease, but at the
l-year follow-up, 11% (n = 9 and n = 9) were still on sick leave.
Patients’ appraisal of having received sufficient infmmation (six
items)
There was a significant group by time interaction [F(4, 167)
= 27.08,P = O.OOOl] due to the fact that SA patients considered
themselves more satisfied than controls at each point of assessment from postmeasure throughout the follow-up year (Tukey
HSD-test, Table 2). Thus, patients in the SA group maintained
a significant improvement with respect to satisfaction with
information. Testing of within-group differences (base-line verTable 2. hlean values for the SA (n=77-84) and control (n=78-85) groups for dependent variables

sus each of the postmeasures) confirmed that the SA participants
improved significantly from base-line to postmeasure and maintained this improvement over the year, while the control group
did not change.
The SA programme was more effective than one information
session (mean values for the one-session group: 13.18, 12.11,
12.68, 13.46 and 13.21). There was a significant group by time
interaction in the three-group ANOVA [F(4, 162) = 13.86,
P = O.OOOl], and Tukey HSD testing showed the SA condition
to be superior at every data collection point after intervention.
There were no significant changes within the one session group.
This group was considered separately only in the above analysis.
In all others, all 101 control participants were analysed together.
Physical strength (six items)
The SA and control groups differed signilicantly with respect
to physical strength at base-line [t(197) = 2.82, P < 0.011, the
SA reported more problems. ANOVA based on gain scores
showed a main effect of groups t&1,164) = 14.74, P < O.OOOS]
(Table 2) and post hoc testing demonstrated significant differences at all points of assessment. Thus, in comparison with the
base-line, the SA improved significantly more than the controls.
Scheffk’s test confirmed a significant improvement in the SA
group but not amongst the controls.
Physical training (three items)
Problems with physical training differed significantly between
groups at the base-line [t(195) = 2.66, P < 0.011, the SA group
with more problems than the control group. ANOVA of gain
scores indicated a significant group difference favouring the SA
condition [F(1,162) = 10.23, P < 0.005] (Table 2). Tukey’s
HSD test demonstrated that differences between groups were
significant at postintervention, at 3 months and at 12 months,
but not at the 6-month follow-up. In the SA group, there was a
significant difference between base-line and all the remaining
assessments, while the control group did not change.
Tiredness (three items)
Tiredness diminished significantly with time [F(4,167) =
21.15, P = O.OOOl], and development was similar in both
groups (Table 2).
Body image problems (four items)
In an earlier publication [ 151, the body image scale was
divided into one scale of two items, called body avoidance, and
two single items (problems with getting used to body and
body acceptance). Using that analysis, body avoidance changed
positively in the SA and negatively in the control group from
pre- to postmeasure. The data from the follow-up year showed a
similar pattern, irrespective of whether the scale was divided or
not. Therefore, we chose to present a single scale including all
four items. Problems with body image decreased significantly
with time [F(4,156) = 4.67, P = O.OOl]. There were no group
differences (Table 2).
Pain (three items)
There was a significant group by time interaction [F(4,170) =
16.52, P = 0.0001) (Table 2). At base-line and postmeasure,
there was no significant difference but at the 3 and 6 month
follow-ups, the control group suffered significantly more from
pain than the SA as confirmed by the Tukey HSD test (Table
2).
Health problems (‘global assessment) (one item)
Health problems diminished significantly with time [F(4,169)
= 11.46, P = O.OOOl] (Table 2) in both groups.
The modified HAD-scale
Anxiety eve items). HAD-anxiety symptoms diminished
significantly with time [F(4,165) = 30.95, P < O.OOOl] and,
with respect to absolute values, more in the SA than in the
control group, although there were no significant between-group
differences at any point of assessment (Table 2).
Depressive (six items). Depressive symptoms diminished significantly with time [F(4,165) = 4.45, P = O.OOS]. The SA
group improved in absolute values while the control group
worsened. At the 12-month follow-up, problems had decreased
in both groups. There were no significant between-group differences (Table 2).
Problems with quality of life (two items)
Problems with quality of life were very similar and stable in
both groups over time (Table 2).
Problems (= low frequency) with activities at home (nine items)
Activities at home were very frequent during the whole
year. Most of them were performed four to six times a week
independently of time or group assignment (Table 2).
Problems (= low frequency) with activities in the community ( 11
items)
Activities in the community did not change over time nor
differ between groups.
Communication with staff (11 items)
This variable was not influenced either by time or by the
intervention (Table 2). Overall, there were very few problems in
patient-staff communication. However, problems in
patient-doctor communication were significantly more pronounced than in patient-nurse communication. Throughout,
communicating with doctors was significantly more difficult for
the control group than for the SA group [F(4,101) = 4.93,
P < 0.051 and decreased significantly with time in both groups
[F(4,101) = 3.44,P < 0.011.
Physical symptoms (frequency and burden)
In general, the physical symptoms related to breast cancer
diminished with time, and many of them significantly so. Worry,
aversions, mixed symptoms A and B and surgery effects, sexual
problems and mucous membrane disturbances diminished significantly with time, while cognitive effects did not (Table 3).
The MAC-scale
The three MAC-scale variables which diminished significantly
with time were anxious preoccupation [F (3,125) = 8.23,
P = O.OOOl] (ANOVA of gain scores due to significant base-line

change over time nor was there any group difference (Table 4). symptoms as the control group did.
DISCUSSION
Patients’ appraisal of having received sufficient information
and of physical strength, physical training and fighting spirit
were improved in the SA group compared with the controls
during the entire follow-up year. The design permits the conclusion that this is an effect of the ‘Starting Again’ programme [27].
It cannot be excluded that the modification of the HAD-scale
resulted in a less sensitive measure. However, there may be
other reasons for the lack of anxiety changes. One is that patients’
satisfaction with information does not strongly influence the
level of anxiety. Another possibility is that a reduction of anxiety
requires more specific and extensive interventions [18] than
those used in the present study.
This is in contrast to the short-term observations, where three
scales, that is body avoidance, depression, and avoidance (MACscale, one item), differed significantly at postintervention or at 3
months, but were not maintained.
Maintenance of therapeutic gains is a long-standing problem
in all forms of psychological interventions. Due to the lack of
studies, maintenance problems have not yet been emphasised in
studies of cancer patients. However, there is no reason to
suppose that interventions for cancer patients differ from other
psychological interventions in this respect. Wilson [28], in an
up-to-date overview, described research on relapse and its
prevention following behavioural and cognitive interventions for
a variety of problems. These treatment methods are successful
in the short-term in many problem areas, but the factors
underlying successful maintenance are still largely unknown.
Wilson [28] concluded that research on maintenance still suffers
from methodological problems especially low statistical power
and conceptual difficulties. The most common forms of relapse
prevention are: (1) booster sessions; (2) treatment programmes
with relapse prevention strategies integrated into the initial
treatment; and (3) procedures that require minimal therapist
contact. Each of these have a certain amount of empirical
support and should therefore be included in future studies of
psychological interventions with cancer patients [29].
In conclusion, the ‘Starting Again’ programme seems to be
successful with respect to patients’ appraisal of having received
sufficient information, fighting spirit, physical strength and
physical training as late as 1 year after treatment termination.
This is encouraging since the effects of time-limited interventions tend to diminish with time. To increase the effect of
physical exercise, we could have had more of them (overlearning)
and also a maintenance programme. The effects of the information programme with respect to patients’ appraisal of having
received sufficient information is promising, but this feeling of
being better informed did not lead to a decrease of anxiety
or depressive symptoms. With a more extensive programme,
containing more coping skills training and home assignments,
that goal may be attainable.

In a recent review, Andersen [4] stated that the spontaneous
recovery with respect to psychosocial morbidity is so high in low
risk patients that it is difficult for an intervention to achieve
superior results. This is not the case in moderate and high risk
groups. The present study included low risk patients (defined
by the high response rate at the l-year follow-up) and, according
to Andersen [4], large improvements as compared to controls
should not have been anticipated. However, a few dependent
variables did improve as a result of the intervention. Of 27
dependent variables, 19 improved significantly with time, and
of those, four had significantly better improvement in the SA
group than in the controls. The control group did not have better
improvement than the SA group with respect to any dependent
measure.

One weakness of the present study is the use of the modified
HAD instead of the whole scale. At the time when our decision
was made to modify the scale, no studies of the HAD-scale were
published. We were advised to omit three items said to have the
lowest correlations with the scale as a whole. In fact, these items
are the ones with the highest factor loadings [30]. There is no
reason to assume that the results would have been very different
if the entire scale had been used. Alpha coefficients for the
Swedish version of the HAD exceed 0.80 when each of the items
is excluded individually (Brandberg, personal communication).
In addition, alpha values for the present HAD scales were
approximately 0.80, which is acceptable. Over the follow-up
year, the modified HAD scale failed to show any group differences or significant group by time interactions. However, at

A Classification After Radical Cystectomy of
Patients{ With Bladder Cancer Associated With
Schistosomiasis
M. Rafla, A.S. Ibrahim, A. J. Valleron and J.Y. Mary
The aim of this study was to classify the bilharzial bladder cancer patients after radical cystectomy into several
prognostic strata with increasing risk of recurrence. 310 patients through the period 1977-1983 at the National
Cancei Institute of Cairo were systematically analysed for 12 variables evaluated after radical cystectomy. Eight
factors were shown to have a significant influence on the recurrence-free survival curve after radical cystectomy
namely: tumour stage, size, grade and location in the bladder, lymph node involvement, metastasis, renal
insufficiency and urinary diversion. Using the proportional hazard model, five factors were significantly related to
a lower recurrence-free survival, one major prognostic factor, tumour grade (G2 or G3) (relative risk estimate of
5.5), and four minor prognostic factors (relative risk estimates around 2), namely tumour diameter greater than
5 cm, anterior or trigod location of the tumour, tumour stage (T3 or T4) and presence of renal insufficiency
before surgery. Four plrognostic strata have been defined in relation to the presence of these prognostic factors.
This classification was validated on a second sample of 122 patients by comparing for each prognostic stratum,
the recurrence-free survival curve observed on this sample and the corresponding predicted curve by Cox model.
No statistically sign&ant difference could be detected. This classification of bladder cancer patients appears to
be adequate for bilharzial bladder cancer patients after radical cystectomy, at least in the conditions they
presented and were treated for at the NIC in Cairo.

Africa and the Middle East. It is a major health problem in urinary diversion [2]. Recurrence after surgery occurs locally in
Egypt since it represents approximately 20% of the total cancer the pelvis and 90.6% of the recurrences occur during the first
incidence. It is the most frequent cancer in males and the second postoperative year [3].
