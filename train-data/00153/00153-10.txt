A consecutive series of 197 women under 70 years of age with operable breast cancer, randomised to treatment
by a conservation technique in comparison to mastectomy, were assessed using structured interviews. The
prevalence of cases of anxiety and depression was high before treatment commenced, there were fewer cases in
the conservation group but no significant difference at 3 or 12 months in the number of new cases, social
adjustment, or capacity to return to work. Attitudes to treatment showed significant differences between the
groups, more women in the conservation group were able to wear their usual clothes and most women rated the
cosmetic result highly. Patients were more likely to stop sexual intercouse completely after mastectomy. An
effective conservation technique should be an attractive treatment choice available to selected women with early
breast cancer.

INTRODUCTION
IN SELECTED PATIENTS with operable breast cancer, conservation
treatment is a safe alternative to mastectomy in terms of local
control and overall survival [l-3]. High levels of depression,
anxiety and distress have been reported following mastectomy
[4-6]. The view arose that breast conservation might protect
women from this psychiatric morbidity. When our work began
only one study had been published comparing the psychological
effects of breast conserving treatment with mastectomy, and
this had design faults including potentially biased recruitment,
testing postsurgical factors over a wide time range, and using a
poor measure of general psychological adjustment [7]. Since
then, further studies have been published and have been critically reviewed by Kiebert et al. [8] and Hall and Fallowfield [9].
One reported only 38 patients responding to a non-validated
postal questionnaire [lo]. A better designed study, but with
only 21 patients treated by breast conservation, did not find
these patients to be less anxious or depressed [ll]. A further
study of 39 patients, again using a postal questionnaire, reported
body image to be more severely impaired after mastectomy, fear
of recurrence of the cancer to be unrelated to treatment type,
and no significant difference between the groups with respect to
“psychological complaints” [ 121. A larger study, using a more
satisfactory measure of psychiatric symptomatology, found 38%
of women with states of anxiety or depression among the breast
conservation group, compared with 33% in the mastectomy
group [13]. However, this study had a retrospective design,
pooled results with a wide time range, and did not analyse the
relationship between morbidity and treatment variables. Hence,
it is difficult to draw clear conclusions from these studies. In

particular, it remains unclear whether psychiatric morbidity is
affected by the type of treatment.
We have investigated the relationships between primary treatment and psychiatric morbidity in patients with early (stage I or
II) breast cancer entered into a prospective randomised study
comparing breast conservation with mastectomy. The main
hypothesis we have tested is that conservation of the breast with
a good cosmetic result leads to less psychosocial morbidity.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Initial sample
The patients were a consecutive series admitted to the Breast
Unit, Guy’s Hospital, who fulfilled the entry criteria for the
EORTC multicentre trial 10801 [ 141. Ethical approval was given
to this study, which was begun in the early 198Os, by the
Guy’s Hospital ethical committee. Patients were randomised to
treatment by either modified radical mastectomy or breast
conservation comprising tumorectomy, axillary clearance, iridium implant, and subsequent external beam radiotherapy [ 151.
Eligibility criteria included a single invasive breast carcinoma
4 cm diameter or less in patients less than 70 years. All patients
aged less than 65 years who had axillary nodal metastases (found
at axillary clearance) were further randomised to receive 12
cycles of adjuvant therapy (CMF) or no further treatment
(control).
A pretreatment psychosocial assessment was completed before
a biopsy confirmed diagnosis had been made. This was completed by 332 patients; additionally, 8 refused to take part in
the psychosocial study, 7 refused the pretreatment assessment
having initially agreed, 2 patients refused the treatment offered
and another, a schizophrenic patient, was too mentally ill to be
included. Subsequently, 197 were found to have a malignant
tumour fulfilling the eligibility criteria, of whom 97 were treated
by modified radical mastectomy and 100 by breast conservation.
The remaining 135 women had benign tumours.
Psychosocial assessments
Patients were interviewed before treatment by a psychiatrist
using the structured interviews of the Present State Examination
1340 
Mastectomy or Conservation for Early Breast Cancer: Psychological Morbidity 1341
[16] and the Social Adjustment Scale [ 171. The latter is an
observer rated structured interview which gives scores for role
areas of work, social and leisure, extended family, marital,
parental, family unit and economic. These scores can be analysed
in three different ways: by deriving role area scores, qualitative
scores (performance, interpersonal behaviours, friction, feelings
and satisfactions) or by factor analysis.
All interviews were tape recorded, all three psychiatrists were
trained in the use of the structured interviews and one (M.L.)
acted as a referee for any rating difficulties.
Final sample
It was hoped to re-interview all patients at 3 and 12 months
using the pretreatment measures and a structured interview to
assess their attitudes to breast surgery, pain and side effects
from treatment.
However, of the 197 women in the study, 14 (7%) refused to
be interviewed at 3 months (10 treated by breast conservation, 4
treated by modified mastectomy) and one mastectomy patient
had experienced a recurrence. At re-interview 12 months postoperatively, 24 (12%) refused to be interviewed (15 treated by
breast conservation and 9 treated by mastectomy), a further 12
had experienced recurrences (6 in each group). The general
practitioners and the physician conducting the follow-up were
contacted to determine evidence of psychological morbidity in
these women.
Analysis
The symptoms recorded in the interviews using the Present
State examination were analysed using the CATEGO computer
programme. The programme sorts symptoms into syndromes
and thereby into an eight level “index of definition” (ID).
Surveys [18] have shown high agreement between the global
clinical judgement of “not a case” vs. “a case” and the ID level
l-4 vs. 5-8. Patients with an ID of 5 or more have thus been
regarded as being psychiatric “cases”.
Tables were analysed using the x2-test. For 2 x 2 tables, if
the total number of observations was less than 20 or 20-40 with
at least one expectation less than 5 the Fisher’s exact test was
used, otherwise Yates continuity correction to the standard x2
was used. For larger tables with a priori logical trend across
groups, the more sensitive x2-test for linear trend was used.
Baseline variables
RESULTS
The two groups were comparable in variables which might be
expected to affect morbidity, including age, parity, menopausal
status, staging, receipt of adjuvant therapy, marital status,
education, occupational status and religious conviction. With
regard to social class, there was a greater proportion of conservation patients in social class 1, but this was offset as a group by
a lower proportion in social class 3N. The proportion of patients
in social classes 1, 2 and 3N combined, compared with classes
3M, 4 and 5 combined, was comparable between the two groups.
Psychiatric nwrbidity
The cases resulting from the CATEGO ANALYSIS of the
PSE are shown in Table 1. Pre-operatively, 29% of patients
treated by mastectomy and 21% of patients treated by conservation had either anxiety or depression which warranted treatment (caseness). Considering the high levels of caseness preoperatively, new cases of depression or anxiety were defined
where patients had been neither depressed nor anxious before
treatment. At 3 months there was less anxiety/depression overall
among the breast conservation group (14 vs. 21%) but this
difference was not statistically significant. By 12 months 8% of
the conservation group were cases compared to 11% of the
mastectomy group (x2 = 0.14; d.f. = 1; P = 0.71).
In terms of new cases at 3 months, there were six (6.8%) of
depression or anxiety in patients treated by conservation and 10
(11.2%) in the mastectomy group (Fisher’s exact test P = 0.5).
At 12 months there were four new cases in each group (Fisher’s
exact test P = 0.4). Of the 9 women in the mastectomy group
refusing interview at 1 year, 4 were reported to show some
symptoms of anxiety or depression and 3 of them had been
treated by their family doctor and one referred to a psychiatrist.
In the conservation group, 4 of the 15 women refusing interview
had some symptoms of anxiety or depression and 3 had been
treated by their family doctor.
Postoperative pain predisposed to caseness. At 3 months, 81%
of cases and 60% of non-cases had experienced some pain, this
being severe in 31 and 1 l%, respectively. When cases/non-cases
were analysed with regard to no/moderate/severe pain, the x2
for linear trend was 6.8, d.f. = 1, P = 0.01; after I2 months
the same comparison gives x2 for linear trend 10.8, d.f. = 1,
P = 0.001.
There were 32% of cases within the group given CMF
compared with 13% in the control group but the difference was
not statistically significant at either 3 or 12 months.
Age interacted with caseness in an interesting way; pretreatment there were more cases in the youngest age group (< 40
years) with a decreasing level with age (x2 linear trend = 9.81,
d.f. = 1, P = 0.003). However, after treatment, at both 3 and
12 months there were more cases in the 41-55 year age group.
The presence of a partner did not affect the likelihood of being
a case.
Social adjustment
There were no significant differences between the groups by
role score or qualitative category at 3 and 12 months. Factor
analysis produced six elements interpreted as representing work
performance, interpersonal friction, inhibited communication,
submissive dependency, family attachment and anxious rumination. Comparisons of the factors at 3 and 12 months postoperatively showed no significant differences between the groups.
Most women in paid employment returned to work by 12
months. In the mastectomy group 38 (81%) returned to their
original employment compared with 31 (71%) in the conservation group (x2 = 1.38, d.f. = 1, P = 0.25).
Sexual adjustment
There were no significant differences between the groups
comparing the median of the summed scores for diminished
sexual intercourse, sexual problems and disinterest in sex for
those women in a permanent relationship who had engaged in
intercourse in the previous 2 months (Mann-Whitney test
P = 0.9 at 3 months and 12 months).
At 3 months approximately one third of the women with
partners, in both groups, had not engaged in intercourse in the
previous 2 months. At 12 months mastectomy patients were
more likely to have stopped sexual intercourse completely (22
mastectomy vs. 10 conservation; x2 = 4.03, d.f. = 1,
P = 0.04).
Attitudes to treatment
The attitudes of the patients to the surgical scars are shown in
Table 2 which shows that patients treated by mastectomy had

significantly more distress. After 3 months 19% of the mastectomy cases were unable to wear their usual clothes compared
with 9% of the conservation group (P = 0.06). Similarly, at 12
months more were unable to wear their usual clothes (33 vs.
14%,P = 0.004).
The emotional reactions to change in breast contour are
shown in Table 3, with significantly more mastectomy patients
moderately or severely upset.
Cosmetic outcome was rated by both patient and doctors. At
3 months the opinions were in agreement in 52% of cases. In 23
(27%) the doctor’s opinion was higher and in 18 (21%) the
patients’ opinion was higher. There was concordance in 49% of
cases at 12 months with the doctor’s opinion being higher in I1
(15%) and the patients’ opinion higher in 27 (36%).
DISCUSSION
Our study confirms a high prevalence of psychiatric morbidity
in women presenting with a breast lump. Cases identified had a
symptom level compatible with diagnoses of anxiety neurosis or
depressive neurosis of a severity expected to be found in outpatient or in-patient psychiatric clinics.
Both anxiety and depression diminished with time as noted
in other studies [ 191. It has to be questioned whether the fewer
cases found at follow-up related to the patients refusing reinterview. Our survey of GPs and the physician assessing their
physical well-being provided no evidence that the morbidity in
the refuser group would have affected between group comparisons. Nearly twice as many women in the conservation group
refused follow-up interview. This probably resulted from more
hospital attendances for postoperative radiotherapy, and some
women simply expressed the view that they were “fed up” with
hospital appointments, examinations and interviews.
Total cases of depression and anxiety were fewer in the
conservation group but the difference was not significant at 3 or
12 months. There was no significant difference in the number
of new cases of depression and anxiety subsequent to treatment.
Pain and adjuvant therapy were clinical variables contributing
to caseness. Younger women were more likely to be cases

pretreatment and middle-aged women post-treatment. No evidence was found to support the view that the presence of a
partner reduced the chance of being a case.
There was no significant difference between the groups in
respect of social adjustment and capacity to return to work,
although it is possible that the instrument was not sensitive
enough. However, most women lived within supportive social
networks which might have reduced any potentially adverse
effect of the treatment on social functioning. A significant
difference was found in psychosexual adjustment in that mastectomy patients were more likely to have stopped intercourse
completely by 12 months.
Patients treated by mastectomy were significantly more distressed by the scars resulting from the operation and were more
upset by the loss of a breast in comparison to the conservation
patients’ distress concerning change in contour of their conserved breast. Additionally, more of the conservation group
were able to wear the same clothes as they did before treatment
and almost all were happy that the breast had been conserved.
The study is open to the criticism that informed consent was
not sought before patients were entered into the clinical trial.
The trial was given ethical approval at its commencement; a
time when informed consent was not widely sought. Attitudes
of patients and doctors have changed over the past 10 years and
the difficult and sensitive ethical issues given further debate
[201.
This study has not shown a significant difference in cases of
anxiety and depression between the treatment groups although
there were fewer cases in the conservation group, these findings
being in line with other recent studies (see Kiebert et al. [S]). It
is likely, therefore, that morbidity relates to stressors common
to both groups, particularly that of having cancer. Fallowfield
[21] found that, for most women, fear of cancer was their
primary fear rather than losing a breast. However, distress
concerning the operation, difficulty wearing usual clothes and
sexual dysfunction after mastectomy suggests that an effective
conservation technique should be an attractive choice to selected
women requiring treatment for early breast cancer. Shorter
courses of radiotherapy might improve patients’ tolerance of the
conservation treatment. Clinicians treating women with breast
cancer must be vigilant for symptoms of anxiety and depression,
both before and after treatment, and particularly in patients
experiencing pain or receiving adjuvant therapy.

Comparison of Three Protracted Antiemetic
Regimens for the Control of Delayed Emesis in
Cisplatin-treated Patients
Isabel Moreno, Rafael Rosell, Albert Abad, Agusti Barnadas, Joan Carles,
Nuria Ribelles, Victoria Solano and Albert Font
Antiemetic activity of three protracted regimens for the control of cisplatin-evoked delayed emesis was explored.
63 patients were randomly assigned to receive one of three protracted antiemetic schedules over 4 days. Group C
patients received dexamethasone 8 mg twice daily on days 2 and 3, then 4 mg twice daily on days 4 and 5; in
group B, alizapride 2.5 m&kg four times daily on days 2-S plus dexamethasone as in group C was administered;
and in group A, metoclopramide 0.5 mg/kg four times daily on days 2-S plus dexamethasone was given at the
same dose-schedule as in groups C and B. Complete protection from delayed vomiting was achieved in 44% of
group C, 30% of B and 70% of group A (P = 0.02). Mild side-effects were noted in all three groups. A higher
complete protection for delayed emesis was obtained in metoclopramide-dexamethasone-treated patients.
Neither of the regimens used in the protection of delayed emesis controlled late nausea.

INTRODUCTION
AN ACCEPTABLE CONTROL of acute cisplatin-induced emesis has
been achieved with intermittent high-dose metoclopramide plus
the addition of dexamethasone and diphenhydramine or lorazepam [l-3]. Less often are efforts marshalled to successfully
develop protracted antiemetic trials to enhance the prevention
of delayed emesis. The incidence of delayed emesis has been as
low as 16-25% [I, 41, but later when patients received cisplatin
doses of 120 mg/m2 incidence was as high as 74% [5]. In
our experience, in spite of complete protection (CP) of acute
cisplatin-evoked emesis in half of the high-dose (3 mgikg x 2)
metoclopramide-treated patients, delayed emesis syndrome was
witnessed in 65%. In this randomised trial when alizapride was
given instead of metoclopramide with both dexamethasone and
lorazepam, although less acute Cl’ was recorded, the frequency
of delayed emesis (68%) remained similar to the metoclopramide
arm [6].
These findings prompted us to undertake the current trial

in which three protracted antiemetic regimens are compared:
metoclopramide-dexamethasone, alizapride-dexamethasone or
single dexamethasone. The object of this trial, therefore, is to
evaluate the control of delayed vomiting and nausea.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
From October 1987 to November 1988, 63 chemotherapynaive patients were included in this trial. All patients with
histologically-proven cancer were to receive cisplatin-based
chemotherapy and those with a Karnofsky index equal to or
greater than 60% were eligible. Each patient received cisplatin
at doses between 60 and 120 mgim’ administered over 30 min
intravenously on an in-patient basis on day one. They also
received other chemotherapeutic agents in several of the following combinations: ifosfamide 3 g/m2, mitomycin 8 mg/m2, vindesine 3 mg/m2, etoposide 170 mg/m*, cyclophosphamide
600 mglm2 or 5-flurouracil (5-FU) 1000 mg/m2. All patients
were hospital in-patients during the 24 h before cisplatin administration. Each patient signed an informed consent.
This study was a randomised, single-blind, parallel group
