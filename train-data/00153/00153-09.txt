ABSTRACT
Purpose
The study’s objective was to compare the quality of life (QoL) of patients with endometrial cancer
undergoing surgical staging via laparoscopy versus laparotomy.
Patients and Methods
The first 802 eligible patients (laparoscopy, n  535; laparotomy, n  267) participated in the QoL
study in a Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) randomized trial of laparoscopy versus laparotomy
(GOG 2222). Patients completed QoL assessments at baseline; at 1, 3, and 6 weeks; and at 6
months postsurgery.
Results
In an intent-to-treat analysis, laparoscopy patients reported significantly higher Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy–General (FACT-G) scores (P  .001), better physical functioning
(P  .006), better body image (BI; P  .001), less pain (P  .001) and its interference with QoL
(P  .001), and an earlier resumption of normal activities (P  .003) and return to work (P  .04)
over the 6-week postsurgery period, as compared with laparotomy patients. However, the
differences in BI and return to work between groups were modest, and the adjusted FACT-G
scores did not meet the minimally important difference (MID) between the two surgical arms over
6 weeks. By 6 months, except for better BI in laparoscopy patients (P  .001), the difference in
QoL between the two surgical techniques was not statistically significant.
Conclusion
Although the FACT-G did not show a MID between the two surgical groups, and only modest
differences in return to work and BI were found between the two groups, statistically
significantly better QoL across many parameters in the laparoscopy arm at 6 weeks provides
modest support for the QoL advantage of using laparoscopy to stage patients with early
endometrial cancer.

INTRODUCTION
In the early 1990s, the Gynecologic Oncology Group
(GOG) began evaluating minimally invasive surgical approaches to staging women with endometrial
cancer. In comparing laparoscopy with laparotomy, surgical complications, perioperative morbidity, length of hospital stay, the incidence of
subcutaneous metastases, and patients’ quality of life
(QoL) were evaluated. Potential benefits of laparoscopic surgery include a reduction in wound complications and adhesion formation and decreased
hospital stay when compared with laparotomy.1-8
Potential complications associated with laparoscopy
include visceral and vascular injuries owing to trocar
insertion, trocar site recurrences, hernias, and bowel
and urinary tract injury.1
There is little information concerning the QoL
outcomes associated with laparoscopy compared
with laparotomy in patients with endometrial cancer. A retrospective study of 30 patients with endometrial cancer demonstrated a reduction in time to
return to work (2.4 v 5.3 weeks) when comparing
laparoscopy with laparotomy.7 In their study of 84
patients with endometrial cancer, Zullo et al9 found
that QoL (physical and emotional functioning) 1
month postoperatively was significantly better in the
laparoscopic versus the laparotomy group (P.05).

By 6 months, no significant QoL differences were identified between
the two groups.
Differences in QoL among patients treated with laparoscopy
have been studied in other patient populations. In a large randomized trial of patients with colon cancer, only pain medication
required during hospitalization and global QoL at 2 weeks favored the

et al11 found a significantly better QoL in patients with colon cancer
undergoing laparoscopy compared with those undergoing open colectomy at 12 months, whereas at 24 months, the only remaining significant
advantage in the laparoscopic group was social functioning.
The lack of outcome information pertaining to patients
with endometrial cancer undergoing laparoscopy versus laparotomy prompted the GOG to conduct a randomized clinical
trial (GOG 2222) to compare the two procedures in terms of the proportion of serious complications (initial primary end point) and
recurrence-free interval (subsequent primary end point), staging information, complications, operative time, hospital stay, recurrence pattern,
and QoL.12 The study was designed to test whether laparoscopy would

consequence, less psychological distress compared with those undergoing laparotomy.

PATIENTS AND METHODS
This study was approved by the institutional review boards of all participating
GOG institutions, and patients provided written informed consent. All patients participating in the QoL component of this study were accrued to the
GOG clinical trial; had no clinical evidence of metastatic disease; had adequate
bone marrow, renal, and hepatic function; had a GOG performance status of 0
to 3 (0, normal activity, to 3, symptomatic and in bed  50% of time); and
spoke English, French-Canadian, or Spanish. To maximize information about
laparoscopy, a 2 to 1 randomization scheme was chosen, as there was less
known about clinical and QoL outcomes in patients undergoing laparoscopy.
Patients’ QoL was assessed before surgery; at 1, 3, and 6 weeks; and at 6 months
postsurgery. At baseline, patients were provided with four copies of all postsurgery assessment forms and stamped, self-addressed envelopes for use in
returning completed questionnaires to the clinician/data manager. Questionnaires were reviewed for completeness. Patients having difficulty in reading the
questionnaires were interviewed by the clinician/data manager either in person or by telephone. Reminder calls were placed to patients by data managers
a few days before the expected return date of the questionnaires. Questionnaires
not received in a week’s time were followed up with a second reminder call.
QoL Measures
The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Scale–General (FACT-G;
version 3.0)13 consists of five subscales: physical, social, emotional, and functional well-being and relationship with one’s doctor. The FACT-G total score
is based on 27 items that include only the physical, social, emotional, and
functional well-being subscales, with scores ranging from 0 to 108. Higher
scores indicate a better QoL.
Additional Treatment Related Symptoms (AP) consists of six items related to surgical side effects such as fever, constipation, diarrhea, shortness of
breath, the ability to eat, and problems urinating. Higher scores indicate worse
symptoms. The total AP scores range from 0 to 24.
The Physical Functioning Subscale of the Medical Outcome Study–Short
Form (MOS-SF36; PF) is a 10-item scale with items designed to assess activities
of daily living.14 The item scores are summated and are then transformed to a
scale of 0 to 100. Higher scores indicate better physical functioning.
Resumption of Normal Activities is a single item rated on a 0% to 100%
scale designed to assess the extent that the patient was able to resume all of their
normal activities.
Two items from the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI)15 were selected to assess
pain severity at its least and worst in the previous 7 days. Seven items measure
pain’s interference with different domains of QoL. The pain severity total
scores range from 0 to 20 and 0 to 70 for pain’s interference with QoL, with
higher scores indicating worse pain or more interference of pain on QoL.
Fear of Recurrence is a five-item scale measuring patients’ beliefs about
recurrence of their cancer.16 The total score ranges from 0 to 20, with higher
scores indicating a greater fear of recurrence.
Body Image (BI), a seven-item scale created for all follow-up assessments
and developed by the authors, assesses patients’ concerns about their physical
appearance as a consequence of having surgery and its relationship to other
areas in their life. Higher scores indicate a better body image. The total score
ranges from 0 to 28. The Cronbachcoefficient of 0.67 for the seven-item scale
at 6 months indicated marginal internal consistency.17
Return to Work is a single item that asks patients who were employed the
date on which they returned to work after their operation.
Statistical Methods
The data were analyzed as an intent-to-treat analysis, although 21% of
patients in the QoL study who were randomly assigned to laparoscopy converted to laparotomy. Because of the multiplicity of QoL outcome measures
and potential correlations among the scales, each QoL scale was tested at a
significance level of .01 (.05/5) to control for the overall type I error at .05. As
the overall measure of QoL was the FACT-G, it was considered the primary
QoL outcome. A required sample size of 600 eligible patients was estimated
based on the original primary clinical end point: the proportion of serious
complications. This provided 96% statistical power to detect the minimally
important difference (MID) of 5 points on the FACT-G at a significance level
of .01. The difference of 5 points on FACT-G is comparable to a one-unit
change of the GOG performance score and is considered an MID.18 To allow
for approximately 20% patient attrition and noncompliance, 800 patients
were accrued to the QoL study. In April 2001, the study group increased the
sample size to include recurrence-free survival as a primary study end point.
Because the original QoL sample size provided sufficient statistical power, it
was decided to terminate enrollment for the QoL study in April 2001.
The comparison of the postsurgery QoL scores between the two randomized arms was focused on the 1, 3, and 6-week postsurgical assessments. A
linear mixed model was fitted for each QoL scale score, adjusted for corresponding baseline assessment scores, time effect, patients’ age, weight (in
kilograms) at study entry, and marital status (married v not married). The
interaction between treatment and time was first examined for the similarity of
treatment effects at 1, 3, and 6 weeks postsurgery, with the significance level for
an interaction set at .05. If the interaction effect was significant, then treatment
effects at each postsurgical assessment were tested at the significance level of .01
by comparing least-square means between the two arms. Otherwise, the mixed
model was refitted without the interaction, and treatment effects were tested as
an overall effect over the postsurgical assessments. The 6-month evaluation
was considered exploratory and was examined only if there was a significant
difference between surgical groups in a particular QoL score within 6 weeks
postsurgery. The general linear model was used to explore whether the difference persisted at 6 months, adjusting for corresponding baseline scores, patients’ age, weight at baseline, and marital status. Each scale was tested at a
significance level of .05 for this purpose.
The treatment effect on the completion rates of QoL assessments across
time were examined using the Generalized Estimating Equations method with
an unstructured working correlation matrix.

RESULTS
Between April 1, 1996, and April 1, 2001, the first 808 patients
(laparoscopy, n  539; laparotomy, n  269) of the 2,616
patients from the clinical trial were enrolled onto the QoL
component of GOG 2222. Six patients (laparoscopy, n  4;
laparotomy, n  2) were deemed unassessable because of refusal
of treatment. The QoL results presented here are based on the
remaining assessable 802 patients with endometrial cancer
(laparoscopy, n  535; laparotomy, n  267).

Ninety-two percent of laparoscopy patients and 88% of laparotomy
patients provided valid baseline QoL assessments. Completion rates were
slightly but significantly higher in the laparoscopy group at 1 week (87%v
81%; P  .02) and 6 months (84% v 77%; P  .02) postsurgery (Fig 1,
CONSORT diagram). Reasons for noncompliance included patient
refusal (laparoscopy, 9%; laparotomy, 12%), incomplete questionnaires (1.5%), illness (1%), death (0.5%), and other (2%).
To test for sample bias, the sample of participants in the QoL
study (n  802) was compared with those who were randomly assigned and received treatment after April 1, 2001 (n1,789), but were
not offered participation in the QoL study. The only sociodemographic difference between groups was that more non-Hispanic patients were enrolled before April 1, 2001, as compared with those
accrued after that date (96.8% v 83.9%; 2 test P  .001). However,
204 patients did not report their ethnicity.
Patient characteristics are presented in Table 1. The patients’
mean age was 63.6 years, the majority were white, and approximately
half were married. There were no significant differences between the
two randomly assigned groups with respect to age, weight, race, Hispanic ethnicity, and marital status.
QoL of Patients With Endometrial Cancer Assigned to
Laparoscopy Versus Laparotomy
Before surgery, there were no significant differences in any QoL
measures except for the MOS Physical Functioning Scale, in which
patients assigned to laparoscopy had a score that was 6.8 points higher
in physical functioning (95% CI, 2.3 to 11.3; P  .003) than those
assigned to laparotomy (Table 2).
Within 6 weeks postsurgery, patients assigned to laparoscopy reportedbetterQoLonallscalesotherthanFearofRecurrenceascompared
with those assigned to laparotomy (Table 2). The observed treatment
differences between laparotomy and laparoscopy did not vary from 1 to 6
weeks for the FACT-G, PF, Pain Interference with QoL, and BI. After
adjustment (baseline scores, assessment time, age, weight, marital status),
patients assigned to laparoscopy reported an average of 3.0 points higher
in FACT-G scores (99% CI, 0.63 to 5.3;P.001), 6.0 points higher in PF
scores (99% CI, 2.6 to 9.5;P.001), 2 points higher in BI (99% CI, 1.2 to
2.9; P  .001), and 3.0 points lower in Pain Interference with QoL (99%
CI, 0.26 to 5.8; P  .005) than those assigned to laparotomy during the 6
weeks postsurgery period. The difference in averaged adjusted FACT-G
scores between the two surgical arms did not reach the MID of 5 points
overthe6weekspostsurgeryperiod(Fig2).However,52%oflaparotomy

25% of laparoscopy patients (107 of 424).
The observed treatment differences in AP, Pain Severity, and
Resumption of Normal Activities varied over the 6-week postsurgical
period. Patients randomly assigned to laparoscopy reported significantly lower AP scores (0.8 points lower; 99% CI, 0.1 to 1.5; P  .003)
and lower Pain Severity scores (1.4 points lower; 99% CI, 0.4 to 2.4;
P  .001) than those randomly assigned to laparotomy at 1 week, but
not at 3 and 6 weeks. In addition, patients randomly assigned to
laparoscopy reported that more daily activities were resumed after
surgery compared with those randomly assigned to laparotomy at 3
weeks (6.9% higher in the laparoscopy group; 99% CI, 1.1% to 12.7%;
P  .002) and 6 weeks (9.8% higher in the laparoscopy group; 99% CI,
3.6%to16.2%;P.001),butnotat1week.Of273patientsreportingthe
time to return to work, the median time to return to work was 42 days for
the laparoscopy group compared with 45 days in the laparotomy group, a
small but significant difference (Wilcoxon rank sum test, P  .04).
At 6 months postsurgery, all reported differences in QoL scales
between the two arms were not statistically significant, except for BI,
which was 1.32 points higher (95% CI, 0.61 to 2.04; P  .001) in the
laparoscopy compared with the laparotomy arm.
Although there were significant differences in physical functioning at baseline, this did not affect the overall results, as the analyses
were adjusted for baseline levels. Given this approach to statistical
analyses and the fact that there were no other statistically significant
baseline differences between the two groups in the other QoL variables, it is unlikely that the differences in physical functioning at
baseline would have affected other QoL findings.
DISCUSSION
The purpose of the study was to test whether there would be an
improved QoL as a result of laparoscopy being less invasive than
laparotomy in staging women with endometrial cancer. Patients
treated with laparoscopy were found to have similar rates of intraoperative complications and ability to identify metastatic disease, a
shorter length of hospitalization, and significantly fewer moderate
to severe (Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events grade 2)
postoperative complications than those treated with laparotomy.1
In addition, patients undergoing laparoscopy were found to have a
superior overall QoL during the 6-week postoperative period, with
fewer physical symptoms, less pain and pain-related interference
with functioning, better physical functioning and emotional state,
earlier resumption of normal activities, earlier return to work, and
better BI as compared with those undergoing laparotomy.
However, adjusted scores of the FACT-G did not reach the predefined MID between the surgical arms19 and differences between
surgical arms in return to work and BI were modest. Yet approximately 10% (9% at 3 weeks and 12% at 6 weeks) more patients in the
laparotomy arm experienced a decline in FACT-G scores beyond the
MID than patients in the laparoscopy arm. In other words, for every 10 Quality of Life As Measured With FACT-G Score

patients offered laparoscopy, one patient would be spared the short-term
declineinQoL.TheconvergingQoLbetweenthetwogroupsat6months
may reflect the slower, but eventually equal recovery experienced by laparotomy patients in all areas other than BI, which persisted at 6 months.
Some of our findings are consistent with studies comparing laparoscopy to laparotomy.7,9-11 Zullo et al9 found that physical and emotional
functioning was significantly better in the laparoscopy group versus the
laparotomygroupat1monthpostsurgery.Asignificantlyearlierreturnto
work in the laparoscopy compared with the laparotomy group was also
found by Spirtos et al,7 with a bigger difference in the length of time to
return to work than our results showed. Both Zullo et al9 and our results
showed no QoL differences between the two groups by 6 months. Yet
Brega et al11 found in patients with colon cancer that the significantly
better QoL in the laparoscopy group compared with the open colectomy
group at 12 months resolved at 24 months, a longer time to resolve
differences than was found in our study. However, Weeks et al10 found
that only pain medication and global QoL in patients with colon cancer
was significantly better in the laparoscopy compared with the open colectomy group at 2 weeks. These differences resolved by 2 months.
Perhaps the reason for our modest but statistically significant QoL
differences between the surgical groups and that the FACT-G did not
reach a MID between groups can be explained by similar clinical outcomes, including intraoperative complications and identification of metastatic disease, and minor differences in length of hospitalization (4 v 3
days for laparotomy and laparoscopy, respectively) found in the clinical
trial.1These findings might have outweighed the significantly fewer postoperative complications in the laparoscopy than the laparotomy group
(14% v, 21%, respectively; P  .0011
) found in the clinical trial, in its
impact on QoL, as these differences between surgical groups were not
large. Additionally, 21% of patients who participated in the QoL study
who were randomly assigned to laparoscopy were converted to laparotomy. QoL differences between the laparoscopy and laparotomy arms
might have been greater if there had not been such a large proportion of
laparoscopy patients who converted to laparotomy. It should be noted
that the FACT-G scores of laparoscopy patients who converted to laparotomy approached the findings of those randomly assigned to laparotomy(Fig2).Last,themodestdifferencesfoundinreturntoworkmightbe
accounted for by employers’ sickness leave plans that allowed for a specified time for patients to be out sick.
Long-term QoL findings could be affected if a difference is
found in survival when comparing the two treatment arms. We
also intended to measure the effect of the two surgical techniques
on sexual functioning. However, only 45% (n  362) answered
questions on sexual functioning at baseline, decreasing to 38%
(n  307) at 6 months. This was partly due to the number of
patients without sexual partners, in addition to those who refused
to answer the sexual functioning questions.
In conclusion, although the FACT-G did not reach the MID
between surgical groups, and there were only modest statistically significant improvements in QoL in laparoscopy compared with laparotomy patients in return to work and BI, the significant improvement in
all QoL variables except for Fear of Recurrence in patients undergoing
laparoscopy provides some support for a QoL advantage in the use of
laparoscopy over laparotomy.
