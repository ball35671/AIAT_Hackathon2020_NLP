Abstract: Background. We report the results of a multicenter
randomized phase III study, assessing quality of life (QOL) in
intra-arterial (IA) versus standard intravenous (IV) chemoradiation in advanced head and neck cancer.
Methods. Two hundred seven patients with inoperable stage
IV disease—152 men and 55 women; mean age, 55 years—
were included in this study. The patients were treated with
standard radiotherapy with 4 weekly IA or 3 weekly IV cisplatin
infusions. The QOL assessments carried out were EORTC-C30,
H&N35, and trial-specific questionnaires.
Results. Overall QOL deteriorated in all patients during treatment, is gradually improving over 1 year. IA patients showed
significantly less nausea and vomiting at week 7 (p <.001). IV
patients were significantly more fatigued (p <.006). At 1 year, no
significant difference in tube feeding was found. Voice quality
slightly exceeded the pretreatment values at 1 year. Forty-two of
62 employed patients returned to work.
Conclusion. During treatment, significantly fewer problems
with nausea and vomiting occurred in IA than in IV patients. Both
groups showed improved voicing and oral intake during followup, often exceeding pretreatment values at 1 year. VC 2008

Quality of life (QOL) issues have become indispensable study outcome parameters when the
impact of different treatment modalities in head
and neck cancer has to be assessed. Locally
advanced head and neck cancer, if treated by surgery followed by radiotherapy, may change the
anatomy and may therefore end in problems concerning functionality and disfigurement.1 The

areas most commonly affected by this approach
are eating, speaking, and, despite advances in
reconstruction, facial appearance.1–6 These problems have a serious impact on the psychosocial
and overall well being. And, on top of these problems, the prognosis of these patients is rather
poor; 5-year survival rates often do not exceed
30%.
7
Nowadays, an additional treatment modality,
concurrent chemoradiation, is increasingly used
for the treatment of locally advanced disease.7–10
A clinical study from our institute, evaluating the
effect of intensive targeted chemoradiation (RADPLAT), showed that an initial complete local tumor response could be achieved in 91% of the
patients, with 1- and 2-year locoregional control
rates of 82% and 69%, respectively.10 QOL assessment, as an integral part of this study, also demonstrated that the impact of an organ preservation protocol such as RADPLAT seems somewhat
less severe than found earlier with a pure surgical
approach in terms of QOL effects.11
Because of the above-mentioned promising
results of targeted chemoradiation (RADPLAT)
protocol, a multi-institutional randomized phase
III study was conducted to assess whether the
more complex intra-arterial (IA) cisplatin infusion
indeed yields better results than the standard intravenous (IV) chemoradiation approach. QOL
assessment was integrated into this trial to evaluate possible differences between both treatment
arms in that respect as well. In this work, we present the first-year QOL results of 207 patients,
whereas primary study endpoints, including disease-free and overall survival, locoregional and
distant control, incidence of adverse events, and
incidence and pattern of recurrence between the 2
treatment arms in the total study population (N 5
236) will be presented in a separate work.12
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Between December 1999 and November 2004, 207
of 236 patients in the registered, phase III trial
(M99RAD; CKVO 2000–01), were referred to the
persons responsible for the QOL part of this
randomized, multi-institutional study. The 4
hospitals, participating in the QOL part of the
study, were The Netherlands Cancer Institute,
Medical Center Haaglanden, Radiotherapy Institute Friesland, all in The Netherlands, and the
Waikito Hospital in New Zealand. The internal
review boards of the participating hospitals
approved the study protocol, and written informed
consent was obtained from all patients before
entering the study. Twelve of the 29 ‘‘missing’’
patients were treated in a fifth participating center, where the infrastructure for an adequate collection of the QOL data was lacking, and the other
17 ‘‘missing’’ patients were randomly distributed
to the other centers.
Before referral to the QOL part of this study,
patients were randomly assigned (using the minimization technique stratifying by center, T classification, N classification, and tumor site) either
into the IA cisplatin arm (N 5 104) or into the IV
cisplatin arm (N 5 103). In the IA arm, patients
received weekly cisplatin 150 mg/m2 as a targeted
rapid IA injection with sodium thiosulphate IV
rescue in weeks 1 to 4.8,10 In the IV arm, patients
received 100-mg/m2 cisplatin as a 4-hour IV infusion on days 1, 22, and 43. Radiotherapy 70 Gy in
35 fractions was administered over 7 weeks starting concurrently with chemotherapy. Roughly,
one fourth of the patient population was treated
with intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT).
Patient characteristics, including sites and
classifications, are shown in Table 1. All patients
had inoperable or functionally inoperable (eg,
requiring total glossectomy without or even with
total laryngectomy) disease. Forty-six percent of
the patients were employed, 32% did not have a
job, and 22% of the patients were retired before
they started with their treatment. The majority of
patients had a history of smoking and (social) alcohol consumption. Just before the start of the treatTable 1. Patient characteristics (N 5 207).

ment, 99 patients (49%) were still smoking
(mean, 12 cigarettes per day; range, 1–60) and 84
patients (40%) were still consuming alcohol
(mean, 3 U per day; range, 0.15–10 U per day).
The remaining patients indicated that they had
just quit these habits.
As shown in Table 2, during the first 12 months
of follow-up, 60 patients died (32 patients in the
IA group and 28 in the IV group), and at the 12-
month assessment point, 21 patients could not be
interviewed (refusal 2 [1 IA, 1 IV], too ill 4 [2 IA, 2
IV], protocol violation 3 [all IA], extensive salvage
surgery 4 [2 IA, 2 IV], and missing 8 [4 IA, 4 IV]).
This resulted in 126 patients at 12 months for further detailed analysis (IA arm N 5 60, IV arm N 5
66).
QOL assessment was performed before treatment, and at 7 weeks (last day of treatment period), 3 months, 1, 2, and 5 years after initiating
treatment, using the EORTC QLQ C-30 core questionnaire and the special head and neck module,
EORTC H&N 35.13,14 In addition, to get more
detailed information about certain aspects, such
as eating and speaking (see below), a structured,
validated trial-specific questionnaire (TSQ) was
used as well.2,11
Because the questionnaires are rather extensive, in this analysis, we primarily focused on
those aspects most likely to be affected by treatment and most relevant for patients with cancer
in the head and neck. The scales of interest
derived from the QLQC30 were physical functioning, role functioning, emotional functioning, cognitive functioning, social functioning, fatigue,
nausea and vomiting, and dyspnea. From the
QLQH&N questionnaire, pain, swallowing, trouble with social eating, dry mouth, sticky saliva,
pain killers, and feeding tube were studied. And
from the TSQ, the items/scales such as ‘‘eating’’
(diet, mastication, oral transport, and swallowing), speaking (intelligibility, loudness, pitch, and
fluency), social contacts, and social anxiety (summated Likert scales) were evaluated. Furthermore, the TSQ includes some items addressing
the (pretreatment and posttreatment) smoking
and/or alcohol habits, the work situation, and the
satisfaction with the pretreatment and posttreatment information c.q. counseling.
All EORTC scale and item scores are linearly
transformed to a scale of 0 to 100. A high score for
the functional scales and for the overall QOL scale
represent a better QOL. In contrast, which is
somewhat confusing, for the single items and for
the symptom scales, a higher score means a
higher level of symptoms and thus a lower QOL.
The scores are calculated according to the EORTC
QLQ scoring manual.
Statistics. The data were analyzed using the statistical package Splus 6.2 and SPSS 12.0 for Windows. In case of missing responses for 1 or more
items of the multi-item EORTC scales, a ‘‘halfscale’’ solution was adopted, in which at least half
of the responses to the items of a given scale are
available. The mean score for the remaining items
of the scale then replaces the missing item
responses for that particular patient. If more than
half of the item responses for a given multi-item
scale were missing, then the scale score for that
patient was treated as missing.
For the scales of interest, the maximum
change from pretreatment levels was calculated
for each patient. Nonparametric Wilcoxon rank
sum test was conducted to determine if the distributions for the 2 arms significantly differed. The
resulting p values were adjusted for multiple testing using the Sidak technique.
For 2 scales, fatigue and nausea and vomiting,
further multivariate analysis was conducted. For
the former, this was to determine if there was a
significant difference between trial arms in the
duration of fatigue experienced by patients. For
the latter, this was to determine if the significant
difference between the levels of nausea and vomiting in the 2 trial arms was independent of other
factors.
In the case of the fatigue scale, a linear mixed
model was constructed in which trial arm, time
since randomization, pretreatment fatigue levels,
sex, age at randomization, time off-study, and tumor classification were taken as fixed effects, and
a patient variable was taken as a random effect.
The time covariate was modeled using a natural
cubic spline with 3 degrees of freedom. Interaction
terms were investigated, and a Wald F test was
used to determine the significance of excluding
the trial arm variable from the model. It is noted
that the scale date is ordinal rather than numeric;
however, the distribution of values for the fatigue

scale was such that the linear mixed effects model
assumptions were not violated.
For the nausea and vomiting scale, an ordinal
proportional odds model was constructed, using
the same predictor variables as in the fatigue
model. Proportionality and ordinality assumptions were checked and interaction terms were
examined.
Correlations were assessed by Pearson’s correlation coefficient. A 2-tailed p value <.05 was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS
The fact that only a subgroup of patients (207 of
236) participated in the QOL assessment part of
this study did not result in distribution problems,
as can be seen in Table 1; there were no differences
in age, sex, tumor site, or classification in both
treatment groups.
Symptom Scales. Figure 1 presents the distributions for 13 scales of the maximum change from
pretreatment to 12 months by trial arm for all participating patients (the IA arm is depicted on top
and the IV arm below that), including the (raw) p
values. Especially, scales such as physical functioning, role functioning, and also social functioning are negatively influenced by the treatment.
Also, an increase in problems such as dry mouth
and sticky saliva can be observed. The only symptom scale showing a statistically significant difference between the 2 groups (irrespective of sex, age
at randomization, time off-study, and tumor classification) is the nausea and vomiting scale (raw p
value <.001, adjusted p value 5 .001). Twice as
many patients in the IV group than in the IA
group complained of these symptoms at 7 weeks (p
<.001; Table 3). At 3 months, these complaints/differences have almost disappeared. Fifty-nine percent (N 5 56) of the IV patients reported weight
loss during treatment compared to 49% (N 5 43)
of the IA patients, but this difference was statistically not significant (p 5 .23).
Another interesting finding is the difference in
fatigue level between the 2 arms and pretreatment and 7 weeks and 3 months (p <.006).
Patients in the IV group dying before the second
or third interview had a significantly higher level

of fatigue, already pretreatment, than patients
completing the 1-year follow-up and patients in
the IA arm (Figure 2).
Focusing on the patients who were able to complete the 1-year follow-up (N 5 126), irrespective
of treatment arm, many of the EORTC C30 functioning scales appeared to deteriorate at the end
of the 7-week-treatment period followed by a gradual improvement up to 12 months, sometimes
exceeding the pretreatment levels (Table 4). Also,
the items/scales of the H&N35 representing problems specifically related to H&N cancer treatment
showed an increase in problems at 7 weeks,
followed by a decrease over time. Especially,
pain and speech problems, considerably increased
at week 7, showed a clear improvement at
12 months compared with the pretreatment data.
As expected, a Wilcox test showed that patients
who indicated they used painkillers, especially
during the treatment period, experienced more
pain than those who did not take them (p <.001;
no differences between both treatment arms). The
majority (96%) of the patients had no problems
with their appearance 12 months after initiating
treatment.
Swallowing/Eating. There was an increase over
time in problems such as dry mouth and sticky saliva. Xerostomia (quite a bit to very much) was
reported by 35 patients (52%) in the IV group and
36 patients (60%) in the IA group, whereas sticky

saliva was reported by 37 patients (56%) in the IV
group and by 26 patients (46%) in the IA group,
but also this difference as not statistically significant (p 5 .7).
An overview of patients who needed tube feeding during the 12-month assessment period is
shown in Table 5. Pretreatment 31 patients in the
IA and 30 in the IV group needed tube feeding,
whereas, at month 12, 10 of 60 IA patients (16%)
still had tube feeding, compared with 16 of 66
(24%) in the IV group (not statistically significant;
p 5 .3). Based on the TSQ, it appeared that the
remaining 100 patients were able to return to a
more or less normal diet at month 12. At that
moment, 61% of the patients reported that the
sense of taste was good or excellent, whereas 39%
of the patients indicated that the taste was still
poor to moderate.
Voice. Voice quality (intelligibility—face-to-face,
as well as on the telephone—loudness, pitch, and
fluency; also assessed with the TSQ) deteriorated
during the 7-week treatment period, but then gradually improved over time, slightly exceeding the pretreatment values at month 12. As a result, 83% of
the patients reported that they had reasonably good
understandable voice at month 12, with no statistically significant differences between both groups.
However, the question ‘‘is your voice like it used to
be?’’ was answered affirmatively by only 33% (same
percentage in IA as in IV group) of the patients.
Social Aspects. For both the groups, social contacts, visiting, or receiving friends/family
decreased during and immediately following
treatment and went back to the usual pretreatment routine at 1-year follow-up. Of the 62
patients, who were employed before treatment, 42
were able to return to their job (gradually from a
couple of hours per day for some to their regular
intensity for most of them) within 12 months (22
in IA group and 20 in IV group). At month 12,
approximately 50% of the patients smoked (mean
9 cigarettes per day) and consumed alcohol (mean
2.5 U per day). Many of them, who had not stopped
already before the treatment (49% and 40%,
respectively), did not quit this habit during or immediately after treatment.
Information/Counseling. Ninety-three percent of
all participating patients were quite satisfied with
the pretreatment information. No differences over
time or differences between groups could be
found. They also indicated that they understood
quite well what the effect of the treatment (temporarily) might have on functional aspects such as
eating and speaking and their appearance. However, it appeared that the posttreatment information was given less regularly. Many patients
expressed the need for more follow-up information
about aspects such as the duration of tube feeding
and/or when the sense of taste would be back to
normal.
In summary, our study results show that most
well-known treatment-related QOL problems do
not significantly differ between treatment arms,
except for nausea, vomiting, and fatigue, which
are significantly less severe in the IA arm than in
the IV arm.
DISCUSSION
Because any chemoradiation treatment, either
through IA or IV administration, poses a heavy
burden on patients, it is expected that all participating patients (irrespective of treatment arm)
showed a clear deterioration in most QOL aspects
at the end of the 7-week-treatment period followed
by a gradual improvement up to 12 months.
Obvious examples are the changes in physical,
role, and social functioning scales. The negative
change in physical functioning is inherent in the
7-week treatment, whereas a decrease in role
functioning and also social functioning is primarily due to the fact that many patients are hospitalized at the end of the treatment.
In general, it can be said that the groups of
patients did not differ much with respect to QOL
issues. The only statistically significant differences between the 2 groups concerned nausea and
vomiting and feelings of fatigue (pretreatment, 3
months). Twice as many patients in the IV group
than in the IA group had complaints of nausea
and vomiting at the 7-week assessment point.
However, these feelings of nausea and vomiting
gradually disappeared over the next months. Concerning the feelings of fatigue, it appeared that
the patients in the IV arm who died before the second or third assessment point were more troubled

by the feelings of fatigue, also already pretreatment, than patients in the IA arm. This finding
confirms in part some of the results mentioned in
our RADPLAT IA feasibility study.11 In that study,
patients who died or had to undergo extensive salvage surgery within 1 year following RADPLAT
IA treatment, often already pretreatment, had
less positive scores on functional and physical
well-being scales and on several H&N scales of
the FACT questionnaire than patients benefiting
from the RADPLAT treatment. In general, it
might be suggested that a ‘‘good’’ pretreatment
condition may influence or predict the outcome of
this treatment in a positive way.
Feelings of pain in the head and neck area,
clearly present pretreatment and increased during treatment, diminished during the 12-month
follow-up. As a result, the need for (nonnarcotic)
painkillers decreased as well. An exception on
these improvements over time was the development of xerostomia (involving a decrease in the
amount of saliva and a thicker, stickier consistency), a common encountered consequence of
radiotherapy. In this study, approximately half of
the patients had xerostomia problems, whereas
the literature mentions percentages between 50%
and 77%.
15–18
This somewhat more favorable result might be
due to the fact that approximately 1 fourth of the
patients were treated by means of IMRT. Also, in
this randomized chemoradiation study, there was
a frequent need for tube feeding, especially during
the first 3 months. It is a commonly seen consequence of the treatment that patients lose weight
due to trouble in swallowing and eating problems.19,20 And, despite the tube feeding, more
patients in the IV group reported weight loss during treatment in comparison with the IA group.
Feelings of nausea and vomiting, more present in
the IV group, were probably of influence as well.
At month 12, approximately 20% of the patients
(N 5 126) still needed tube feeding. This percentage is in accordance with our previous RADPLAT
IA study, in which 19% of the patients still needed
tube feeding at the 1-year follow-up. Also,
researchers from the University of Chicago
reported that following chemoradiation treatment, 18% to 20% of the patients were unable to
take anything orally at 12 months.4 The remaining 100 patients were able to return to a more or
less normal oral diet. Some patients remarked
that eating meat presented some problems, especially if the meat was somewhat leathery. Also,
because of xerostomia, many patients have to
drink (more than they were used to) during meals
to get the food down. For two-third of the patients,
taste returned to normal within 12 months. However, some patients remarked that especially spicy
food tasted sometimes somewhat peculiar and
that it was different before the chemoradiation
treatment. From the literature4 and from personal observation (based on incidental patient
remarks), some continued improvement with
regard to aspects of taste is possible, even after 12
months.
For approximately 80% of the patients (same
percentage as in the RADPLAT feasibility
study11), the voice was reasonable to good. However, only 33% of the patients reported that their
voice/speaking was like it used to be. The remaining patients mentioned that they got tired of
speaking sooner, resulting in a weaker voice or a
somewhat hoarse voice especially at the end of the
day; and/or that to keep on talking requires more
effort, also often due to dry mouth/lack of saliva.
It is a positive finding that two thirds of the
patients who had a job before starting treatment
were able to return to that job within 12 months,
also very similar to our previous phase II IA
study.11
Fifty percent of the patients continued or
returned to their smoking and alcohol habits, but
one has to keep in mind that many already had
(temporarily) quit these habits before the treatment (51% and 60%, respectively). These percentages were also found in the RADPLAT pilot study
as well as in the study assessing the consequences
of composite resections.2,11 Because all patients
are nowadays informed about the risks of smoking
and drinking, many patients hasten to say that
they drink and smoke less than before their treatment. However, it has to be said that it can be
assessed correctly by means of a questionnaire
whether a patient smokes or drinks alcohol, but
when it comes to the number of cigarettes or the
amount of alcohol units per day you may assume
that those answers are probably not reliable.
As a result of our earlier studies and to meet
the need for more follow-up information as
expressed by some patients in this study as well
an extra outpatient clinic visit, approximately
half-year following treatment was initiated by the
nursing staff. During this visit, patients could

needed. Most of the time, the nursing staff could
resolve these questions themselves, but sometimes they had to refer the patient to the appropriate persons/departments.
One-Year QOL in IA versus IV Chemoradiation HEAD & NECK—DOI 10.1002/hed January 2009 83
CONCLUSION
This 1-year follow-up analysis reveals that the differences in QOL issues between the IA and the IV
group are quite limited and maybe somewhat less
than expected in view of the potential differences
in toxicity between treatment arms. As expected,
however, it could be shown that patients in the IA
group had significantly less problems with nausea and vomiting at the end of the treatment than
patients in the IV group. Also, with respect to the
feelings of fatigue, the IA group ‘‘scores better’’:
these feelings are more prominent in the IV
group, especially in those patients who died
before the 3-month assessment point. Problems
with voicing and oral intake, clearly present at
the second assessment point in both groups,
improved during the 12-month follow-up, often
exceeding pretreatment values. The fact that two
thirds of the patients were able to return to their
job within the 12-month follow-up period emphasizes the extent of recovery. Xerostomia remains a
residual complication inherent to the nature of
radiotherapy.
Although the IA treatment thus appears to
cause less early toxicity, the decision whether this
advantage outweighs the advantage of the less
complicated IV chemoradiation mainly will
depend on the clinical outcomes with regard to
locoregional control and disease-free survival.
And for this we have to wait for the final analysis
of the completed trial.
