Abstract
Relatively few studies have addressed problems regarding return to work after primary treatment for early-stage breast
cancer. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether socio-economic and treatment-related factors were associated
with problems of returning to work among pre-menopausal women included in a randomized trial of adjuvant endocrine
therapy. The duration of all endocrine treatments in the trial was two years. At 24 months after randomization 35 of the
222 recurrence-free patients (16%) had not returned to work. The use of adjuvant endocrine therapy was associated with a
twofold increase in the odds ratio of not having returned to work, although the confidence interval of this ratio was wide and
included unity. Tumour stage was negatively associated with work status, possibly because of its association with adjuvant
chemotherapy and radiotherapy to the regional nodes. Age and investigated social factors (educational level, matrimonial
status and presence of under-age children) were not significantly associated with return to work. Determining the
significance of other social factors such as vocational motivation, level of income and vocational rehabilitation merits further
research.
Breast cancer is the most common cancer among
women in western countries. In Sweden breast
cancer constitutes about 30% of all female cancer
cases. The incidence has increased over the past few
decades. The relative survival has likewise increased
continuously, probably owing to earlier diagnosis,
particularly since the introduction of mammography
screening, and adjuvant systemic treatments [1].
These improvements have resulted in an increasing
number of survivors.
Breast cancer treatment today may involve not
only surgery but also, multiple postoperative treatments such as irradiation, chemotherapy and endocrine therapy, often administered in combination or
sequentially [1,2]. Each of these treatments may
have significant side effects that may influence the
ability to return to work [2]. Axillary lymph node
dissection and irradiation may cause arm morbidity,
such as oedema, pain, numbness, loss of strength
and restriction of shoulder function [3,4]. A frequent
consequence of breast cancer therapy for pre-menopausal women is premature menopause [5,6]. Some
of the women in the present study were treated with
adjuvant chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and fluorouracil (CMF)), which is a risk
factor for vasomotor symptoms and weight gain. [7].
Quantitative reports on the work status of breast
cancer patients are scarce [8]. Previous studies have
shown that the ability of cancer survivors to continue
their employment appears optimistic. In a recently
published article the authors stated that more than
80% of patients returned to work during a period of
18 months after diagnosis [9]. Slightly more survivors were not working three years after diagnosis
compared with women never diagnosed with cancer
[10]. However, in a mail survey about the effect of
the illness on their vocational status, answered by
378 women who had survived breast cancer without
recurrence for at least two years, over 40% stated
that cancer had altered their priorities or progress at

work [11]. Women treated for breast cancer are
also reported to experience an excess of job loss,
demotion, unwanted changes in tasks, problems with
the employer and co-workers, personal changes in
attitudes towards work, and diminished physical
capacity [2]. Though several studies have been
conducted about the need for social support of
cancer patients, the importance of support from
their work life has just recently been pointed out
[9,12].
The aim of the present study was to investigate
whether factors such as tumour stage, type of
treatment, age, educational level, matrimonial status
and presence of under-age children were associated
with long-term problems in returning to work in
breast cancer patients. By identifying risk factors,
methods of reducing exclusion from the labour
market may be found.
Material and methods
From 1990 to 1994 a prospective, multi-centre,
randomized trial of different types of adjuvant
endocrine therapy was conducted in pre-menopausal
women with invasive breast cancer. Four European
breast cancer trial groups were involved in the study,
the Cancer Research Campaign Breast Cancer Trials
Group (CRC BCTG) in the UK, the Stockholm
Breast Cancer Study Group and the South-East
Sweden Breast Cancer Group, both in Sweden, and
the Gruppo Interdisciplinare Valutazione Interventi
in Oncologia, in Italy. The design of the Stockholm
part of the study has been reported elsewhere in
detail [13,14]. A total of 927 patients were included
in the Swedish part of the trial.
The inclusion criteria for the trial were histologically verified invasive breast cancer, pre-menopausal
status (last menstruationB/6 months previously),
primary surgery consisting of a modified radical
mastectomy or sector resection plus axillary dissection, node-positive axillary nodes or node-negative
disease provided the histopathological tumour
size was ]/10 mm, and no clinical evidence of
distant metastases. Exclusion criteria were inoperable breast cancer, prior radiotherapy, prior neoadjuvant chemotherapy and/or prior endocrine therapy, and current endocrine therapy.
About four weeks after primary surgery the
patients were randomly allocated to treatment
with tamoxifen, tamoxifen plus the luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) analogue goserelin (Zoladex), goserelin alone or no adjuvant
endocrine therapy. The duration of all endocrine
treatments was two years. All patients with axillary
nodal involvement were offered six courses of
adjuvant chemotherapy (CMF). Patients with conservative breast surgery received irradiation of the
breast parenchyma (50 Gy/5 weeks). Patients with
four or more positive axillary lymph nodes were
offered radiation therapy to the chest wall and
regional lymph nodes (46 Gy/4.5 weeks).
Between 1990 and 1994 patients in five hospitals
in the Stockholm area who agreed to participate in
the randomized clinical trial were asked to also
participate in a study assessing self-reported social
factors. The questionnaire included questions related to e.g. sick leave, occupational status, matrimonial status and presence of under-age children.
Data concerning medical factors were collected from
the regional oncological centre and checked against
patient records. The women were also asked to
indicate why they had not returned to work. They
could choose one or more alternatives among four
statements.
A total of 270 of the eligible trial patients
participated in the present study. Reasons for nonparticipation were administrative problems (n/27),
language difficulties (n/20) and concurrent disease
(n/7). A number of women were excluded because
they were not active in the labour market at baseline
(n/23). The reasons for not being active in the
labour market were early retirement, having been
sick-listed or unemployed for a long time, being a
housewife or studying. Only 21 women (7% of the
314 women invited) declined to participate.
In conjunction with information about the clinical
trial, a nurse informed the women both orally and in
writing about the present study. The voluntary
aspect of the study was stressed and confidentiality
was guaranteed. The study was approved by the
Regional Ethics Committee of the Karolinska Institute.
On seven occasions, assessments were made. A
pre-assessment was performed 34 weeks after surgery  before randomization and therefore prior to
any decision about adjuvant systemic treatment.
Follow-up assessments were carried out 34 months,
12 months, 18 months, 24 months, 30 months and
36 months after randomization. In the present study
we used the assessments at 12, 18, 24 and 36 months
although the focus will be on the follow-up at
24 months.
In the present study we defined a ‘‘return to fulltime work’’ as working at least 75% of the reported
rate of employment at baseline. The reason for this
was that it was impossible at every assessment to
establish exactly what percentage of women worked
full-time. Several of the women had schedules that
varied over time. We estimated the educational level,
basing our estimates on the occupational titles of the
women.
Return to work after breast cancer 91
The distribution of the independent variables of
the women across the randomized groups is shown
in Table I (treatment characteristics) and Table II
(demographic and social characteristics).
Statistical methods
We used unconditional logistic regression to determine whether the work status for women still alive
and free from recurrence 24 months after start of
treatment was associated with the type of endocrine
treatment. The same procedure was used to analyse
the impact of the tumour stage, chemotherapy and
radiation, age, educational level, matrimonial status
and presence of under-age children on work status.
Results are presented as odds ratios supplemented
with 95% confidence intervals. Distributional comparisons of the categorical factors and work status
were made using the x2 test for independence. All
data were analysed using SPSS, version 14.0.
Missing values
We assumed that women who had not completed a
questionnaire confirming their return to work had in
fact not returned to work. Missing values were
replaced by the nearest previous value for each
woman.
Results
A total of 270 women were eligible for this study. At
12 months 245 were still alive and recurrence-free.
Fifty-two of these patients (21%) had not yet
returned to work. At 24 months the number of
recurrence-free patients was 222 and 35 of these
women (16%) had still not returned to work. The
number of recurrence-free women at 36 months was
204. Twenty-nine of these patients (14%) had not
returned to work. The women participating in the
present study had stayed out of the labour market for
a total of 1 044 months in the period between 12 and
36 months after baseline. Among the women who
had not returned to work after 24 months a total of
30 were still sick-listed, four were early retired and
one had begun to study.
Use of adjuvant endocrine therapy was associated
with a twofold increase in the odds ratio of not
having returned to work after two years, although the
confidence interval for this ratio was wide and
included unity (Table III). The result is adjusted
for age and treatment factors which were found to
covariate. The other factors were not included since
they did not influence the result.
Treatment with chemotherapy/nodal status was
negatively associated with work status. Neither
adjuvant radiotherapy (Table IV) nor age matrimonial status nor presence of under-age children (Table
V) was associated with work status. There was a
numerical, though not statistically significant, working frequency in favour of patients with more than
nine years’ schooling (Table V). The results are
adjusted for age and treatment.
The women were also asked to indicate why they
had not returned to work. The most frequent answer
among 35 women who had not returned to work
after 24 months was that they were not able to work
to the same extent as previously because of the
working environment and/or the nature of the work.
The second most common reason was physical
exhaustion and deterioration after the illness and
its treatment (Table VI). Four women, not working
at 24 months, stated that environment and/or the
nature of the work was the only reason why they had
not returned to work.
Discussion
The purpose of this study was to investigate whether
factors such as endocrine therapy, tumour stage,
treatment with chemotherapy and radiotherapy, age,
educational level, matrimonial status and presence of
under-age children were associated with long-term
problems in returning to work in women randomized
to different types of adjuvant endocrine therapy.

after 24 months. The ‘‘cut-off-time’’ for return to
work  24 months after surgery  was chosen since
after 24 months all active cancer treatment had been
completed and most of the side effects of medical
therapies had subsided.
Regarding the finding that adjuvant endocrine
therapy was associated with a twofold increase in
the odds ratio of not having returned to work after
two years. This may be interpreted as a consequence
of findings in a study on physical symptoms and
perception of anxiety and depressive symptoms,
which may be of importance for sick leave, such as
mixed physical symptoms and muscle weakness
[14].
We also found that nodal status was negatively
associated with return to work, possibly because of
its association with adjuvant chemotherapy and
radiotherapy to the regional nodes. In this material
there was 100% correlation between axillary nodal
involvement and treatment with CMF owing to
the design of the study. Adjuvant radiotherapy was
probably not negatively associated with return to
work because patients given radiotherapy only to the
breast parenchyma most likely had smaller tumours
and were younger.
Patients treated with CMF have reported ongoing
problems that may have an effect on work status,
such as vasomotor symptoms and weight gain as late
as three years after primary therapy [7].
Both surgery and radiotherapy to the regional
nodes may cause arm morbidity [3]; while adjuvant
radiotherapy to the regional nodes significantly
increases arm morbidity [3,15]. Arm morbidity after
breast cancer treatment also causes psychological
problems and has consequences for daily living as a
whole [3,4,1518].
The treatment received was probably not the only
reason why the nodal status was significantly associated with the work status. The knowledge of the
greater risk of recurrence because of axillary nodal

involvement may have had a psychological impact
that affected the return to work. However, it was not
possible to detect such an association with the design
used in this study.
Patients in the present study treated with conservative breast surgery, and with fewer than four
positive axillary lymph nodes, received radiotherapy
only to the breast parenchyma. These patients
seemed to have had a better chance of returning to
work within two years of randomization. Factors
behind this finding may include lower frequency of
treatment with chemotherapy, smaller tumours and
fewer arm problems.
We found no association between age and work
status. One reason for this may have been the limited
age range. Neither matrimonial status nor presence
of under-age children was statistically associated
with return to work. Since the median age of the
women included was 45 years, the women’s children
were probably not infants, which may have influenced the result. In an overview of the few studies
examining factors that have an impact on return to
work, no clear association with sociographic characteristics such as age, education and marital status
was found, although it is generally assumed that
increased age is an important hindrance to return to
work [19].
A limitation of the present study is the small
sample size and the fortunate fact that the number
of patients who had not returned to work was
small. The study may therefore have failed to detect
a possible association between the studied factors
and the ability to return to work [20]. Another
limitation of the study may have been the choice
of social factors. For example, low income or
physical demands at work (manual work) may be

better associated with an increasing number of
problems among respondents of working age than
may the respondents’ educational level. The level of
income probably indicates the participants’ vocational motivation and also, the support at their place
of work.
Manual work has been reported as being
negatively associated with return to work [21,22].
Women treated for breast cancer have reported
experiences such as job loss, demotion, changes in
tasks, problems with the employer and co-workers,
and personal changes in attitudes towards work [2].
These social factors, which have not been examined
in the present study, are probably worth further
research. The reason why these factors have not been
examined in the present study is that all data had
already been collected for the study on physical
symptoms and perception of anxiety and depressive
symptoms when the design of the present study was
decided.
The most frequent answer among the women who
were still on sick leave after 24 months was that they
were not able to work to the same extent as
previously due to problems in the working environment and/or the nature of the work. The importance
of a supportive working environment has emerged
from a Finnish study. Additional emotional and
practical support was needed among cancer survivors both from the workplace and from the company
health service [12].
Although only 270 patients were included, there
are few studies concerning work status in women
treated for breast cancer with even such a small
number of subjects. Another advantage of the study
is that the medical study from which the patients
were selected was randomized; also, that this study
was based on a full clinical population. The clinical
study includes nearly all eligible women treated for
breast cancer in the region of Stockholm during the
full trial period.
Conclusion
In this randomized trial of pre-menopausal women
treated for breast cancer, only chemotherapy/nodal
status was significantly associated with return to
work.
Relatively few studies have addressed problems
with return to work after primary treatment for
early-stage breast cancer. More, systematic research
using a longitudinal design to also assess other social
factors such as vocational motivation, level of
income and vocational rehabilitation is needed.
Through such research, it will be possible to better
distinguish between factors that are and factors that
are not associated with problems in returning to
work in breast cancer patients. This information
could be used to find methods of reducing exclusion
from the labour market.
