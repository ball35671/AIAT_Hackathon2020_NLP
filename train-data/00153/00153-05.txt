Summary
Background Most allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplants now use peripheral blood progenitor cell
transplantation (PBPCT) instead of bone-marrow transplantation (BMT). Long-term data on outcome and late eff ects
of PBPCT compared with BMT are scarce. Here we present long-term data from a randomised study comparing
PBPCT with BMT.
Methods Between February, 1995, and September, 1999, 329 patients with leukaemia received either PBPCT (n=163)
or BMT (n=166) from HLA-identical sibling donors after central randomisation accounting for stratifi cation criteria.
Follow-up data were collected via questionnaires from 87% (176 of 202; 84 PBPCT, 92 BMT) patients who survived for
more than 3 years (median of 9·3 years) after transplantation. Effi cacy analyses included all patients who received
treatment. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01020175.
Findings 10-year overall survival was 49·1% for patients who underwent PBPCT and 56·5% for patients who underwent
BMT (HR 0·83, 95% CI 0·60–1·15; p=0·27). Leukaemia-free survival was 28·3% with BMT versus 13·0% with
PBPCT (0·61, CI 0·32–1·16; p=0·12) for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia; 62·3% with BMT versus 47·1% with PBPCT
for acute myeloid leukaemia (0·67, 0·39–1·16; p=0·16); and 40·2% with BMT versus 48·5% with PBPCT for chronic
myeloid leukaemia (1·12, 0·73–1·74; p=0·60). More patients developed chronic graft-versus-host disease after PBPCT
(n=56, 73%) than after BMT (n=46, 56%; p=0·021), with more frequent involvement of skin, liver, and oral mucosa,
and more patients who underwent PBPCT needed immunosuppressive treatment 5 years after transplantation (n=20,
26%) than patients who had BMT (n=10, 12%; p=0·024). Nonetheless, there was no diff erence in performance status,
return to work, incidence of bronchiolitis obliterans, and haematopoietic function between the two groups. 14 cases
of secondary malignancies occurred (fi ve after BMT, nine after PBPCT), resulting in a cumulative incidence of 3%
and 7% after BMT and PBPCT (p=0·17), respectively.
Interpretation More than 9 years after transplantation, overall and leukaemia-free survival remain similar in patients
who underwent BMT and PBPCT. Diff erences in the incidence of chronic graft-versus-host disease and the duration
of immunosuppression exist, but do not aff ect survival, general health status, or late events.
Funding No external funding was received.
Introduction
In 2008, most allogeneic stem cell transplantations used
granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (GCSF)-mobilised
peripheral blood as the source of haematopoietic stem
cells (HSC).1
 Compared with bone marrow, peripheral
blood results in faster haematopoietic recovery, but the
relative eff ect of both sources of HSCs on other endpoints
of allogeneic stem-cell transplantations, including acute
and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), relapse
rates, leukaemia-free survival, and overall survival remain
controversial.2
 Short-term results of randomised studies
have been reported,3–8 and two meta-analyses comparing
peripheral blood with bone marrow grafts have been
published.9,10 Cutler and colleagues9
 found that acute and
chronic GvHD were more common after peripheral
blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) than bonemarrow transplantation (BMT), and that PBSCT was
associated with a trend toward lower rates of malignant
relapse. One of the major fi ndings of the recent metaanalysis by the Stem Cell Trialists’ Collaborative Group10
was that PBSCT was associated with a decreased relapse
rate in haematological malignancies, and improved
survival in patients with late-stage disease and a
signifi cant risk of extensive chronic GvHD.10 The followup reports of these trials focused on chronic GvHD;
however, the median follow-up of 41 months,11 45 months,12
and 36 months13 was still relatively short.
We aimed to collect information on the long-term
outcome of patients treated in, to our knowledge, the
largest randomised trial to compare peripheral blood
with bone marrow grafts. We paid particular attention to
chronic GvHD and late eff ects, including secondary
malignancies.

(AML) or acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) in fi rst
or second remission, chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML)
in fi rst chronic or accelerated phase, or myelodysplastic
syndrome (MDS). Patient accrual took place between
February, 1995, and September, 1999. The study was
approved by the institutional review board or ethics
committee of each of the participating institutions, and
all donors and patients gave written informed consent.
Randomisation and masking
Donor–recipient pairs were randomly assigned to
undergo either BMT or PBPCT. The initial study was
open label, including two diff erent procedures for the
donor (bone-marrow harvest vs aphaeresis of fi lgrastimmobilised peripheral blood stem cells). After obtaining
written consent, the donor–recipient pairs were enrolled
by the sub-investigator (treating physician of the
transplant centre). The central randomisation centre
(International Institute for Drug Development, Brussels,
Belgium) used minimisation to achieve the best balance
of treatment allocations within centres and groups,
defi ned by patient characteristics. Stratifi cation criteria
were the following: (1) if donor is female and has ever
been pregnant; (2) sex mismatch between donor and
recipient; (3) recipient diagnosis of CML. The randomised
treatment was communicated by fax to the investigator
after the patient was registered.
Procedures
Full details of the study design have been reported
previously.8
 Briefl y, pre-transplant conditioning combined
total body irradiation (TBI) and myeloablative doses of
cyclophosphamide, melphalan, or etoposide. Alternatively,
standard myeloablative therapy used at the individual
transplantation centre was also allowed. GvHD
prophylaxis consisted of ciclosporin and methotrexate
(day 1, 3, and 6). Methylprednisolone was recommended
for fi rst-line treatment of acute GvHD.
For the present analysis, questionnaires specifi cally
addressing long-term events after allogeneic stem-cell
transplantations were sent out to the treating centres of
all 202 patients who were known to have survived at least
3 years after transplantation. There was only one
questionnaire per patient; this long-term follow-up was
not part of the original study design. In addition to the
presented data, we asked for the current medication of
the patients, but this showed no conclusive results.
Questionnaires were answered by the patients’ physicians
between October, 2007, and October, 2008.
We examined overall survival, leukaemia-free survival,
recurrence, the incidence of secondary malignancies
and chronic GvHD, and the type, duration, and numbers
of treatment for chronic GvHD. The population in
which effi cacy analyses were done was per protocol.
Chronic GvHD status was recorded at 5 years after
transplantation and at time of last follow-up. Time to
chronic GvHD was calculated from day 100 after
transplantation to the onset of chronic GvHD. Overall
survival was calculated as the time from transplantation
to death; leukaemia-free survival was the time from
transplantation to leukaemia recurrence or death,
whichever occurred fi rst. Patients remaining alive were
censored at the date of last follow-up. For the calculation
of overall survival, leukaemia-free survival, recurrence,
and overall incidence of chronic GvHD, the entire
population was analysed. Time and lines of
immunosuppressive treatment, organ involvement of
chronic GvHD, incidence of bronchiolitis obliterans,
cataract formation, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
(ECOG) performance status, the number of patients
returning to work (assessed at last follow-up), and
haematopoietic recovery (at 5 years after transplantation)
were assessed for patients surviving at least 3 years after
transplantation.

Statistical analysis
The χ² test was used to compare the distribution of
patient-related, disease-related, and transplant-related
variables. The cumulative incidences of chronic GvHD,
relapse and secondary malignancies were estimated with
death without an event as the competing risk using the
package cmprsk of the free statistical software
R version 2.7.1. All further analyses were done with SPSS
version 17.0.
The estimates of overall survival and leukaemia-free
survival at 10 years were calculated using the KaplanMeier method. Diff erences in overall survival and
leukaemia-free survival between both treatment groups
were compared using the log-rank test at a signifi cance
level of 0·05, and by estimating the hazard ratio and the
95% CI. A Cox proportional hazards regression analysis
was done to identify survival predictors. Multivariate
analysis was done using predictors that were signifi cantly
associated with survival in a univariate analysis using a
backward-selection procedure with entry signifi cance
level set at 0·05. All statistical tests were two-sided. This
study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number
NCT01020175.

Results
350 patients from 42 transplantation centres (webappendix)
in 13 European countries, Israel, and Australia were
randomly assigned to receive either peripheral blood or
bone marrow from their HLA-identical sibling donor.
329 patients were eligible for transplantation (fi gure 1).
Completed questionnaires collected at a median of
9·3 years (range 3·0–12·1) after transplantation were
available for 176 patients; 87% of all patients reported to be
alive 3 years or more after transplantation (92 [52%] BMT,
84 [48%] PBPCT). The median time between
transplantation and the completion of the questionnaire
was 10·8 years in both groups. Four centres representing
21 patients did not respond, and fi ve patients from
responding centres were lost to follow-up. There were no
diff erences in patient or disease characteristics between
the patients included and the patients not included in this
long-term study. The groups (PBPCT vs BMT) were well
matched in terms of patient sex, age, disease type, and
remission status. Information on duration of immunosuppressive treatment was available for 158 of 176 patients
(82 BMT and 76 PBPCT patients; table 1). Patients’
enrolment and outcomes in the assessment of the lateeff ect study are shown in fi gure 1.
At 10 years after transplantation, overall survival was
49·1% after PBPCT versus 56·5% after BMT (HR 0·83;
95% CI 0·60–1·15; p=0·27). Median survival was 9·3 years
(95% CI 3·6–not yet reached) for peripheral blood
recipients, while it was not reached for bone-marrow
recipients (fi gure 2A). 10-year leukaemia-free survival was
42·3% after PBPCT versus 45·5% after BMT (HR 0·88;
95% CI 0·65–1·19; p=0·41). Median leukaemia-free
survival was 5·6 years (95% CI 2·6–10·5) after BMT
compared with 4·8 years (2·0–10·3) after PBPCT
(fi gure 2B).
Patients with ALL had an overall survival at 10 years of
32·9% after BMT compared with 18·2% after PBPCT

(HR 0·52; 95% CI 0·26–1·06; p=0·071), translating into
a median overall survival of 3·3 years and 1·0 year after
BMT and PBPCT, respectively. Leukaemia-free survival
at 10 years for patients with ALL was 28·3% for bonemarrow recipients compared with 13·0% for peripheralblood recipients (p=0·12; fi gure 3A).
In patients with AML, 10-year overall survival was
65·3% for bone-marrow recipients compared with 52·3%
for peripheral-blood recipients (HR 0·71, 95% CI 0·40–
1·26; p=0·24). 10-year leukaemia-free survival estimate
was 62·3% for bone-marrow recipients compared with
47·1% for patients who received peripheral blood (p=0·16;
fi gure 3B). In patients with CML, 10-year overall survival
was 61·1% for bone-marrow recipients, compared with
56·8% for peripheral blood recipients (p=0·81). 10-year
leukaemia-free survival was 40·2% for bone-marrow
recipients and 48·5% for peripheral blood recipients
(p=0·60; fi gure 3C). No diff erences between BMT and
PBPCT were noted when patients were divided into
good-risk (AML or ALL in CR1 [fi rst complete remission
or CML in fi rst chronic phase], CML in fi rst chronic
phase) and poor-risk categories (AML or ALL ≥CR2, CML
in accelerated phase; fi gure 3D).
The cumulative incidence of relapse at 10 years was
24% and 20% after BMT and PBPCT, respectively
(p=0·46). Late relapses (after more than 3 years)
occurred in 11 patients (nine after BMT; two after
PBPCT; ALL n=4, CML n=7) resulting in a cumulative
incidence of 18% for BMT and 7% for PBPCT (p=0·06).

acute leukaemias, patients with CML showed a
signifi cantly lower incidence of relapse after PBPCT
(BMT 19%, PBPCT 7%; p=0·036). During the fi rst
3 years after transplant, 21 patients in the PBPCT group
but only 10 patients in the BMT group relapsed, after
which time more relapses occurred in patients who
underwent BMT (nine after BMT; two after PBPCT).
The overall incidence of relapse is now similar in both
treatment groups.
162 patients have died; 72 patients (44%) after BMT and
90 patients (55%) after PBPCT. 138 patients died in the
fi rst 3 years after transplantation; 62 patients (37%) after
BMT and 76 patients (46%) after PBPCT. Late deaths
(>3 years) occurred in 24 cases (10 BMT [11%], 14 PBPCT
[17%]); six patients died due to relapse (four BMT; two
PBPCT). Other causes of death included secondary
malignancy (n=1), GvHD (n=9), brain haemorrhage
(n=2), suicide (n=2), traffi c accident (n=1), unknown
(n=3), and did not show diff erences between the bone
marrow and peripheral blood groups (table 2).
Signifi cantly more patients alive at 3 years and
transplanted with peripheral blood had developed chronic
GvHD than those transplanted with bone marrow
(table 3). The cumulative incidence of extensive disease
at 10 years was also higher after PBPCT (table 3). 5 years
after transplantation, signifi cantly more patients who
had been transplanted with peripheral blood were still on
immunosuppression than of those transplanted with
bone marrow (table 3). After PBPCT signifi cantly more
patients had involvement of the skin, liver, and oral
mucosa (table 3). No diff erences were seen in the
incidence of ocular and gastrointestinal GvHD (table 3).
The overall incidence of bronchiolitis obliterans was 11%,
with no diff erence between bone-marrow (n=10 [12%])
and peripheral-blood recipients (n=7 [9%]). All of these
patients had chronic GvHD and 77% (n=13) had extensive
disease. Six of 82 patients (7%) who received bone
marrow needed additional immuno suppression,
compared with 13 of 76 patients (17%) who received
peripheral blood (p=0·067; table 3).
The incidence of cataracts was 11% in both treatment
groups (nine in the BMT group, eight in the PBPCT
group). 14 cases of secondary malignancies were

reported (fi ve in the BMT group, nine in the PBPCT
group). Specifi cally, three cases of basalioma, two
thyroid cancers, and one case each of lymphoma, lung
cancer, prostate cancer, squamous-cell cancer, histiocytofi broma, ependymoma, tongue carcinoma, breast
cancer, and cervical carcinoma were diagnosed. The
cumulative incidence of secondary malignancies at
10 years was 5% for the entire study population; 3% after
BMT, and 7% after PBPCT (p=0·17). Among 3-year
survivors, the cumulative incidence was 7% for bonemarrow and 16% for peripheral-blood recipients
(p=0·16); the median ECOG performance status
assessed at last follow-up was 0·5 (range 0–3), with no
diff erence between bone-marrow grafts or peripheralblood grafts. 77% of patients (n=114) had returned to
work (n=61 [79%]) after BMT, n=59 (75%) after PBPCT.
Haematopoietic function assessed 5 years after
transplant was normal, and showed median haemoglobin
concentrations of 138 g/L (range 88–166) versus 141 g/L
(range 98–174) and median platelet counts of 251×10⁹/L
(range 38–425) versus 225×10⁹/L (range 44–554) for
bone-marrow and peripheral-blood recipients,
respectively. Only a small number of patients had
platelet counts lower than 100×10⁹/L (two in the BMT
group, three in the PBPCT group) or haemoglobin lower
than 100 g/L (one patient each in the PBPCT and BMT
groups; table 4).
In univariate analysis, diagnosis of ALL and age above
40 years were independent predictors of survival at
3 years (p<0·0001 and p=0·032, respectively).13 In our
10-year survival analysis, diagnosis of ALL remained
signifi cant (HR 2·86, 95% CI 1·82–4·53; p<0·0001), but
age over 40 years was of borderline signifi cance (HR
0·77, 95% CI 0·66–1·03; p=0·089). Although the study
was not randomised for this comparison, the use of a
TBI-containing preparative regimen compared with
chemotherapy alone showed a trend toward increased
survival (HR 0·81, 95% CI 0·64–1·09; p=0·091) in
univariate analysis after 10 years, whereas it had not been
signifi cant in the 3-year analysis. As the eff ect of type of
transplant on survival was the primary endpoint of this
study it was also included in the multivariable model.
Diagnosis, age, and the use of TBI continued to be predictive for survival in the multivariable model (table 5).
Discussion
This study reports long-term follow-up data of patients
treated within the largest randomised study comparing
allogeneic PBPCT with BMT. Earlier studies with median
follow-up of 3–4 years had repeatedly shown that patients
transplanted with peripheral blood experienced more
severe chronic GvHD more often than patients who
underwent BMT.9–11,14 Furthermore, the study by Flowers
and colleagues11 indicated that patients who underwent
PBPCT experienced protracted courses of GvHD and
needed higher numbers of successive treatments to
control chronic GvHD. However, the duration of
immunosuppressive therapy overall had been similar
between the two groups.11 Here, we report that signifi cantly
more peripheral-blood recipients remained on systemic
immunosuppression 5 years after transplantation (26% vs
12%, p=0·024). After PBPCT, patients had an increased
risk for the development of chronic GvHD of the skin,
liver, and oral mucosa, while no diff erences were found
for ocular and gastrointestinal involvement. Of note, even
with over 9 years of follow-up, the higher incidence of
chronic GvHD did not result in signifi cantly more deaths
due to chronic GvHD, nor did it aff ect change of health
status, social integration, and late eff ects.
While overall survival and leukaemia-free survival was
comparable between groups when all patients were
considered together, better overall survival and leukaemiafree survival after BMT was seen in patients with acute
leukaemias. Compared with other studies, the survival
rates for ALL, especially after PBPCT, are particularly low,
mainly due to high early mortality.15 This fi nding is not
explained by a bias due to a high number of patients with
advanced disease or unfavourable cytogenetics.13 In the

fi rst 3 years after transplantation a surprisingly high
incidence of relapses after PBPCT had been reported.13
With longer follow-up, more relapses occurred after
BMT; the overall incidence of relapse is now similar in
both treatment groups. This has also been noted in a
recent meta-analysis of all major randomised trials.10
Relapse remains a primary cause of late death, especially
for patients with ALL and CML. This is in line with the
largest study on long-term survival after allogeneic stemcell transplantation.16
Patients with CML in fi rst chronic phase showed
signifi cantly fewer relapses after PBSCT than after BMT,
while no diff erences were found for patients with acute
leukaemias. This fi nding was fi rst described in the recent
meta-analysis and might refl ect the exquisite sensitivity of
CML cells to the graft versus leukaemia eff ect exerted by
donor T cells.10,17 Because tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs)
are now used worldwide as fi rst-line therapy in CML,
allogeneic stem-cell transplantation is now used in more
advanced disease for patients with an insuffi cient response
to TKIs.18 In such patients, the use of peripheral blood
should be strongly considered, especially as other studies
have indicated that peripheral blood is better for patients
with advanced-phase CML.19 We showed in a multivariable
model adjusted for age and diagnosis that patients who
received TBI-based preparative regimens had better
survival than patients receiving chemotherapy alone as
conditioning. Other studies comparing outcomes of TBIcontaining with non-TBI-containing regimens also showed
that TBI was associated with lower relapse rates and better
survival.20 Comparing four randomised studies with a longterm follow up of over 7 years, Socié and colleagues21 also
showed a trend but no signifi cant diff erences between
TBI-containing and non-TBI-containing regimens.
We noted 14 cases of secondary malignancies resulting
in a cumulative incidence of 3% for bone-marrow
recipients and 7% for peripheral-blood recipients
(p=0·17). Previous studies reported risks to develop solid
cancers ranging between 2% and 6% at 10 years after
bone-marrow transplant.22,23 While 10 of the 14 patients
with secondary cancers had chronic GvHD, no correlation
could be shown with the duration of immunosuppressive
treatment. A recent work by Janin and colleagues24
showed that a number of secondary squamous-cell
carcinomas in allogeneic transplant recipients were of
donor origin. Of note, three of the 14 secondary
malignancies noted in our cohort were from squamous
epithelia. We did not have a chance to determine its host
or donor origin, although it is tempting to speculate that
the interaction of host and donor cells resulting from
GvHD might contribute to the development of cancer in
skin and mucous membranes.
Despite diff erences in the incidence of chronic GvHD,
other late eff ects did not diff er between the two treatment
groups. Bronchiolitis obliterans was reported in 11% of
the patients who all had chronic and mostly extensive
GvHD, an association found in earlier studies. However,
by contrast with a retrospective study identifying PBPCT
as a risk factor for bronchiolitis obliterans, the higher
incidence of chronic GvHD after PBPCT in this study
was not refl ected in a higher proportion of patients with
bronchiolitis obliterans.25 The overall incidence of cataract
(11%) is low compared with a large retrospective analysis
of the European Group for Blood and Marrow
Transplantation.26 However, heterogeneity in terms of
ophthalmological follow-up in diff erent centres might
have aff ected these results.
When long-term remission is achieved, the patient’s
quality of life is a crucial objective. In line with other
studies,27,28 85% of the survivors showed good clinical
performance status (ECOG 0–1), and 77% of the patients
had returned to work. This might be related to better
treatment strategies for GvHD, but might also indicate
that our means to assess quality of life were not sensitive
enough. Clearly, more detailed prospective quality-of-life
assessment needs to be integrated into future studies.
Today, many aspects of haematopoietic stem-cell
transplantation have changed. Transplantation indications
vary due to alternative treatment options or the discovery
of new risk factors. Reduced-intensity conditioning is
increasingly being used, and myeloablative TBI is less
popular. Overall, this update comparing two important
stem-cell sources did not fi nd diff erences in survival after
10-year follow-up. However, subgroup analyses did show
notable diff erences in survival in patients with acute
leukaemias between those who received allogeneic blood
cells and those who received bone marrow, while no
diff erences were seen in patients with CML. Our
observations support previous reports that diff erent
patient groups might still benefi t from transplantation
with bone marrow.29,30 These data alone do not currently
support the return to bone-marrow transplantation for
specifi c indications, but we believe that long-term data
from other randomised trials should be collected.
