Abstract
Objective: One key aspect of cancer survivorship is return-to-work. Unfortunately, many cancer survivors face problems
upon their return-to-work. For that reason, we developed a hospital-based work support intervention aimed at enhancing
return-to-work. We studied effectiveness of the intervention compared to usual care for female cancer patients in a multicentre randomised controlled trial.
Methods: Breast and gynaecological cancer patients who were treated with curative intent and had paid work were
randomised to the intervention group (n = 65) or control group (n = 68). The intervention involved patient education and
support at the hospital and improvement of communication between treating and occupational physicians. In addition, we
asked patient’s occupational physician to organise a meeting with the patient and the supervisor to make a concrete
gradual return-to-work plan. Outcomes at 12 months of follow-up included rate and time until return-to-work (full or
partial), quality of life, work ability, work functioning, and lost productivity costs. Time until return-to-work was analyzed
with Kaplan-Meier survival analysis.
Results: Return-to-work rates were 86% and 83% (p = 0.6) for the intervention group and control group when excluding 8
patients who died or with a life expectancy of months at follow-up. Median time from initial sick leave to partial return-towork was 194 days (range 14–435) versus 192 days (range 82–465) (p = 0.90) with a hazard ratio of 1.03 (95% CI 0.64–1.6).
Quality of life and work ability improved statistically over time but did not differ statistically between groups. Work
functioning and costs did not differ statistically between groups.
Conclusion: The intervention was easily implemented into usual psycho-oncological care and showed high return-to-work
rates. We failed to show any differences between groups on return-to-work outcomes and quality of life scores. Further
research is needed to study which aspects of the intervention are useful and which elements need improvement.

Introduction
In recent years, advances in cancer screening and cancer
treatment have improved the survival rates for patients with
cancer. An increasing number of cancer patients are therefore able
to live many years beyond the original cancer diagnosis and face
new challenges upon cancer survivorship. For cancer patients of
working age, returning to work is a key aspect of survivorship
because it is often experienced as an important part of their
recovery [1]. Furthermore, work contributes to personal, social,
and economic well-being, and therefore return-to-work is associated with the quality of life of cancer patients [2–4].
Unfortunately, not all cancer patients are able to return-to-work
and many of these patients have more adverse work outcomes in
comparison to the general population. For instance, the risk of
unemployment is estimated to be 37% higher for cancer patients
compared to non-cancer controls [5] and return-to-work rates are
estimated to vary between 30–93% depending on for instance
cancer type and treatment [6,7]. Furthermore, a portion of cancer
patients face a decrease in income [8] and suffer from impaired
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 May 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 5 | e63271
work functioning compared to the general population [9,10].
Finally, the employer and the society at large are also affected due
to the costs of absenteeism, disability pension, and loss of
productivity [11].
Intervention studies aimed at enhancing the return-to-work of
cancer patients are rare, especially randomised controlled trials
[12,13]. However, we developed an intervention based on
previous studies that demonstrated effective results for enhancing
the return-to-work of cancer patients [12], and we developed this
intervention together with various stakeholders involved in the
return-to-work process of cancer patients [14]. An early intervention – meaning soon after diagnosis or early in treatment - is most
appropriate because the longer the duration of sick leave, the more
difficult return-to-work is to achieve [15]. For delivering an early
intervention, a hospital-based intervention is most appropriate, as
most cancer patients do not have contact with their employer or
occupational physician during early phases of their cancer
treatment and their advice seems to be influential [16,17]. In
addition, previous studies have shown that early interventions
could be most effective [12]. Furthermore, return-to-work should
be part of the complete psycho-oncological care package and
should not be dealt with in isolation [18].
Our hypothesis is that a hospital-based intervention will
enhance the return-to-work of cancer patients, as work is not
typically addressed at the hospital [19]. Furthermore, an
important and modifiable prognostic factor for the return-to-work
of cancer patients is self-assessed work ability which varies
according to treatment type and cancer diagnosis [7]. Self-assessed
work ability may readily be improved by providing patient
education and support that addresses misconceptions concerning
return-to-work [20]. The objective of this study was to determine
the effect of a hospital-based work support intervention for cancer
patients on return-to-work and quality of life, which was achieved.
Materials and Methods
The medical ethics committee of the Academic Medical Center
approved the study, and the medical ethics committees of the six
participating hospital advised positively regarding feasibility of the
study. Patients signed informed consent forms prior to participation in the study. This trial was registered at the Dutch National
Registry:NTR1658 (http://www.trialregister.nl/trialreg/admin/
rctview.asp?TC = 1658).
Both the design of the study and the content of the hospitalbased work support intervention have been described in detail
elsewhere [14]. We used items from the CONSORT statement for
improving the quality of reporting randomised trials [21]. The
protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist is
available as supporting information; see Checklist S1 and Protocol
S1.
Patients
Cancer patients between 18 and 60 years of age who had been
treated with curative intent at one of the six participating hospital
departments, had paid work, and who were on sick leave were
eligible to participate. Treatment with curative intent was defined
as an expected 1-year survival rate of approximately 80%. We
excluded patients who were not sufficiently able to speak, read, or
write Dutch, had a severe mental disorder or other severe comorbidity, and for whom the primary diagnosis of cancer had
been made more than two months previously. We monitored nonresponse by assessing the proportion of patients who participated
in comparison to all eligible patients.
Hospital-based work support intervention
The hospital-based work support intervention began a few
weeks after the onset of the study and was spread across a
maximum of 14 months. The hospital-based work support
intervention consisted of the following components: 1) delivering
patient education and support at the hospital, as part of usual
psycho-oncology care; 2) improving communication between the
treating physician and the occupational physician; and 3) drawingup a concrete and gradual return-to-work plan in collaboration
with the cancer patient, the occupational physician, and the
employer [14]. We integrated patient education and support
regarding return-to-work into the usual psycho-oncological care in
the form of 4 meetings that lasted 15 minutes each. This care was
delivered by an oncology nurse or medical social worker (hereafter
referred to as nurse). In addition, a least one letter was sent to the
occupational physician to enhance communication. We also asked
the occupational physicians to organise a meeting between the
patient and the employer to draw-up a return-to-work plan. The
key aspects of the hospital-based work support intervention
included the patient education and support at the hospital and
the provision of information to the occupational physician. In the
Netherlands, patients must provide their consent to allow medical
information to be sent from a treating physician to an occupational
physician. Therefore, we were only able to inform the occupational physicians of patients who provided this form of consent.
Study design
This study was designed as a multi-centre randomised
controlled trial with a follow-up period of two years. Here we
report the results of the first follow-up year. Eight departments
from six hospitals in the Netherlands participated in the study.
The treating physician or nurse informed the cancer patients of
the study a few weeks after their diagnosis and determined patient
eligibility by assessing the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The
research team contacted patients who were eligible and willing to
participate and enrolled these patients in the study. After the
patients had filled in the baseline questionnaire, one of us [ST]
allocated the eligible patients to the intervention or to the control
group using the computerised randomisation programme ALEA
[22]. The allocation ratio was set as equal in the programme.
Stratified randomisation was applied for two important prognostic
factors for return-to-work [23]; age (,50 or $50) and cancer
diagnosis (i.e. hospital department). Minimisation was applied to
equalise group sizes. The patient date of each consecutive patient
were entered in the programme and according to the conditions
mentioned above the programme randomly assigned the patients
to the intervention or the control group. The allocation was
irrevocable and was not changed during the study nor during the
analysis. Patients and providers were immediately informed of the
allocation as it was impossible to conceal allocation for this
intervention.
Questionnaires were administrated to the patients at baseline
and at 6 and 12 months of follow-up. The follow-up questionnaires
were mailed to the patients’ homes with a postage-paid envelope
enclosed. Both the questionnaire data and the information from
the nurses who delivered the intervention were gathered for the
economic evaluation. Outcome measures and cancer treatment
were assessed at all time points. Socio-demographic factors and
prognostic factors for time until return-to-work were assessed at
baseline only.
Measurements
The primary outcomes were return-to-work and quality of life.
The intervention was considered effective if patients in the
Effect of Hospital-Based Work Support Intervention

intervention group had a significantly shorter time to return-towork (in days) than did patients in the control group, provided that
their quality of life had not significantly deteriorated.
Return-to-work was measured both as the rate of return-towork at one year of follow-up and as the number of calendar days
between the first day of sick leave and the first day at work (either
part-time or full-time) that was sustained for at least 4 weeks.
Quality of life was assessed with the Short Form-36 (SF-36) [24],
which included all subscales and a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS).
Secondary outcomes included work ability, work functioning, and
costs. Work ability was assessed using the first question of the
Work Ability Index (WAI) [25]. Impaired work functioning was
assessed with the Work Limitation Questionnaire (WLQ) [26],
which could only be filled in if a patient had (partly) returned to
work.
We conducted the economic evaluation from a societal
perspective. We included lost productivity costs and work
adjustments costs for both groups and costs to deliver the
intervention for the intervention group. Productivity loss was
determined by multiplying the cumulative net number of hours on
sick leave by the estimated price of productivity loss based on age
and gender [27]. We assumed that when a patient partially
returned to work, his/her productivity was 100% during the hours
of partial work resumption. We calculated productivity losses using
both the human capital approach and the friction costs approach
[27]. For the human capital approach, all hours on sick leave were
included for 100%. For the friction costs approach, all hours on
sick leave with a maximum of 167 days were included for 80%
[27]. Costs to deliver the intervention were determined by
combining the training costs and the costs to deliver the
intervention. Training costs consisted of trainer costs, study
material costs, and attendance costs for the nurses. Costs to
deliver the intervention consisted of the mean hour of investment
multiplied by the average nurse wage and subsequently multiplied
by 42% overhead costs [27], and the mean hour of investment of
the secretary for sending of the letters to the occupational
physician, as well as the printing costs for the information leaflet.
As the letter from the treating physician to the occupational
physician was a copy of the letter to the general practitioner, no
additional costs for the treating physician to produce these letters
were taken into account.
The socio-demographic factors measured at baseline included
the number of days between the first day of sick leave and
enrolment in the study, marital status, time since diagnosis,
breadwinner status, position at work, shift work, years in current
position, years of paid employment, income, importance of work
(VAS), and company size.
Prognostic factors for time to return-to-work of the cancer
patients included [7,23] age, gender, education, diagnosis, cancer
treatment, number of working hours according to contract,
physical workload (Questionnaire of Perception and Judgement
of Work (VBBA)) [28], fatigue (Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI)) [29], depression (Centre for Epidemiologic Studies for
Depression Scale (CES-D)) [30], co-morbidity, self-efficacy (general self-efficacy scale (ALCOS)) [31], and clinical characteristics
(i.e. diagnosis and treatment).
Sample size
The calculation of the patient sample size was based on two
earlier studies focused on return-to-work in cancer patients
[23,32]. Based on the return-to-work rates in these studies, we
assumed a relative risk of not returning to work of 0.53 for
individuals in the intervention group versus those receiving usual
care [14]. With a power of 80% and two-sided significance level of
p,0.05, the sample size required was 109 patients in each group
[33]. Assuming that 20% of the initial patients would be lost to
follow-up, 270 patients should have been recruited to gather 246
patients at 12 months of follow-up. To account for at least 10%
missing data at baseline, 300 patients sought to be included in the
study.
Statistical analysis
Data entry was verified by means of a 20% double data entry
and a 100% double data check regarding the rate and time of
patients until return-to-work. Participants who did and did not
whish to participate were analysed on age using Student’s t-test.
All analyses were performed according to the intention-to-treat
principle, which meant that all patients were included in the
analysis. We censored patients who dropped out of the study
because of missing data. Therefore, differences between patients
who dropped out or completed the study were analysed according
to their baseline quality of life scores.
All data were analysed by means of descriptive statics using
PASW version 18. The baseline data were assessed to evaluate
whether there was an imbalance between the intervention group
and the control group using Student’s t-test for continuous
variables and the x2 test for categorical variables. We considered
a p-value#0.05 to be statistically significant.
We calculated relative risks and 95% confidence interval for
returning to work (full and partial) at 12 months of follow-up for
the intervention group versus the control group. The median time
until return-to-work was analysed with a Kaplan-Meier survival
analysis, and differences between groups were tested with the log
rank test. In addition, the Cox proportional hazard model of
survival analysis was applied to estimate hazard ratios and the
corresponding 95% confidence intervals for the time until returnto-work (full and partial) with a hazard ratio ,1 indicating a
longer time to return-to-work.
Improvements in the subsequent primary outcome of quality of
life and the secondary outcomes of work ability and work
functioning between groups were examined using a longitudinal
multilevel analysis. Mean costs between the groups were analysed
using Student’s t-test.
Results
Cancer patients who were diagnosed at one of the participating
hospital departments between May 2009 and December 2010 and
who were eligible and willing to participate were enrolled in the
study. The enrolment of new patients ended in December 2010 to
enable the inclusion of patient follow-up data within the time
constraints of the study. A total of 755 of the 855 cancer patients
were excluded; 611 did not meet the eligibility criteria primarily
because they were too old, 119 declined participation, and 25 were
excluded for other reasons, and this led to an overall response rate
of 47% (Figure 1). In total, 133 cancer patients were included in
the study; 65 were assigned to the intervention group and 68 were
assigned to the control group. At baseline, all 133 patients
provided complete data on the primary outcome, whereas 132
(99%) patients provided complete data on the secondary outcomes
(Figure 1). The response rate at 12 months of follow-up was 128
(96%) for the outcome of return-to-work and was 108 (81%) for
the outcome of quality of life and secondary outcomes. The reason
why patients did not return the questionnaire included cancer
recurrence (4 patients; 3%), decline (6;5%) or were unknown 11
(8%), while 4 (3%) patients died within the 12-months follow-up
period (Figure 1). Patients were on average 47.567.9 years old.
Breast cancer was the most common diagnosis (62%), followed by

cancer diagnosis of the female reproductive system (34%) (Table 1).
No statistically significant differences between the intervention
group and the control group on any of the socio-demographic or
prognostic characteristics measured at baseline or any medical
characteristics measured at follow-up were identified (Table 1).
Hospital-based work support intervention
No harm or unintended effects were reported by patients as a
result of participating in the intervention.
Seven patients (12%) assigned to the intervention group did not
receive the patient education and support from the nurse [34]. For
all patients who provided this type of consent (86%), at least one
letter from the treating physician was sent to the occupational
physician. In five cases (10%), the patients’ occupational physician
organized a meeting between the patient, supervisor, and himself
to draw-up a return-to-work plan.
The median number of contacts made between the nurse and
the patient was 4 (range 1–4) and the median duration of each
meeting was 23 minutes (range 7–60). Eight (12%) patients
assigned to the control group reported having received patient
education or support regarding their return-to-work from their
nurse.
Primary outcome – return-to-work and quality of life
The return-to-work rate (full or partial) of all 128 randomised
patients with follow-up data at 12 months was 79% for the
intervention group and 79% for the control group (p = 0.97), and
these rates were 86% and 83%, respectively (p = 0.61), when
patients who died within the follow-up period or those with a life
expectancy of only a few months were excluded. The relative risk
of returning to work (full or partial) for the intervention group
versus the control group was 1.03 (95% CI 0.84–1.2). Of the
patients who did not return-to-work (intervention versus control
group); 2 versus 2 died, 3 versus 1 had a life expectancy of few
months, 4 versus 5 lost their jobs, 2 versus 5 experienced adverse
side-effects, and 2 versus 0 had other reasons.
Median time from the initial sick leave until partial return-towork was 194 days (range 14–435) for the intervention group and
192 days (range 82–465) for the control group (log rank test;
p = 0.90). Median time from initial sick leave until full return-towork was 283 days (range 25–394) for the intervention group and
239 days (range 77–454) for the control group (log rank test;
p = 0.52). Figure 2 summarizes Kaplan-Meier survival analyses for
the two groups on partial and full return-to-work. The hazard
ratio for partial return-to-work was 1.03 (95% CI 0.64–1.6) for the
intervention group versus the control group and was 0.88 (95% CI
0.53–1.5) regarding full return-to-work.
Quality of life scores showed statistically significant improvements over time (p ranged between 0.014 to #0.001) but did not
differ statistically significant between groups (p ranged between
0.15 to 0.99) (Table 2).
Secondary outcomes – work ability, work productivity,
and costs
Work ability improved statistically significant over time
(p#0.001) but did not differ statistically significant between groups
(p = 0.58) (Table 2). Work functioning did not improve significantly over time (p = 0.3) and did not differ significantly between
groups (p = 0.48) (Table 2).
Table 3 shows that the intervention costs were 119 Euros per
patient in the intervention group. The mean (6 SD) lost
productivity cost according to the human capital approach was
41.393 (639.269) Euros in the intervention group and 38.968
(638.399) Euros in the control group. The mean (6 SD) lost

productivity cost according to the friction costs approach was
14.030 (63.614) Euros in the intervention group and 13.529
(63.313) Euros in the control group. The mean work accommodations cost was 2.975 and 3.025 Euros in the intervention group
and control group, respectively. These costs did not differ
statistically between groups.
Discussion
The objective of this study was to determine the effect of a
hospital-based work support intervention for female cancer
patients on return-to-work and quality of life. In general, returnto-work rates were high. We failed to show any differences
between groups on return-to-work outcomes and quality of life
scores.

Strengths and limitations
One strength of our study was the innovative approach that was
used to address the adverse work outcomes of cancer patients. Few
studies have addressed this important subject by developing an
intervention that is primarily aimed at enhancing the return-towork of cancer patients [12,13,34]. Furthermore, another strength
of this study was the use of a low-cost intervention that could be
implemented without substantially increasing the time required,
which is important because of the burden on cancer care. In
addition, this intervention was easily adapted to the existing
variation in usual psycho-oncological care, which yields high
external validity. One limitation of our study was the inability to
include sufficient patients, according to our predetermined power
analysis, which led to greater uncertainty in the results.
Interpretation of findings
We found that the intervention was easily accepted in usual
psycho-oncological care and we found that patients were notably
satisfied with the intervention [34]. For those reasons, addressing
the return to work of cancer patients is highly relevant for usual
psycho-oncological care. We found similar return-to-work outcomes and quality of life scores for both groups. There are several
possible explanations for the lack of statistically significant
difference between groups, which can be sought in the intervention content and the study design. The basic assumption behind
the intervention was that return to work would increase by means
of improved self-assessed work ability as a result of patient
education and support that addressed misconceptions about
cancer and work. We found that self-assessed work ability
increased significantly over time but did not differ significantly
between groups. It is possible that addressing these misconceptions
could have required a more intense intervention or that the
training we provided to the nurses was not sufficient. We do not
know precisely which misconceptions impede return to work and
which should be addressed. On the other hand, this later
possibility was indicated as a number of nurses mentioned that
they were not completely convinced of their competence to deliver
the return-to-work advice. It may be that our half-day training
course was too short to enable nurses to gain the knowledge
required to adequately address patients’ misconceptions about
return to work adequately. For these reasons, it is possible that
certain misconceptions regarding cancer and work could have
persisted and may have resulted in the absence of an intervention
effect.
In addition, we experienced difficulties in involving the
occupational physician and the employer for the intervention
while their involvement appeared to be important [35] and may
have caused the absence of an intervention effect.
There are some observational studies that showed that the
treating physician’s advice about return-to-work influenced work
resumption considerably either with a shorter or with a longer
return-to-work [16,17,34]. However, our study shows that
apparently this is an overestimation that is not reproduced in an
experimental study.

Methodological considerations
Another potential explanation for similar findings between
groups may be related to the study design. Several sources of
potential bias may have influenced our findings. To start with, the
contrast between groups may have been reduced in several ways.
The quality of usual care regarding work advice was probably
higher in hospital departments that were willing and able to
participate at the onset of the study compared to those that were
not willing or able to participate, as nurses who worked in hospital
departments that participated recognised the importance of work
for cancer patients prior to the study. Furthermore, we attempted
to reduce contamination between groups by separating the nurses
who delivered the intervention from those who delivered usual
care. However, this separation was not possible in all cases, and
therefore contamination occurred to a larger extent. Next, the
contrast between groups may have been reduced due to the fact
that all cancer patients were informed about the general aim of the
study (i.e. information bias). Finally, the contrast between groups
may have been reduced due to a patient selection bias; patients
participating in this study may already be of the opinion that work
is an important subject that should receive attention.
In accordance with the intention to treat analysis we included in
the survival analysis patients who died within the follow-up period
as censored. However, an assumption in survival analysis is that
when a patient is censored, the change that a patient will be able to
achieve the outcome is still 50% [36,37], which is not the case in
this situation. However, on a population of 133 patients, we do not
expect that the 4 patients who were equally divided between the
intervention group and control group, influenced the findings
significantly.
External validity
It is generally acknowledged that the disability legalisation of a
country influences the return-to-work outcomes of employees on
sick leave and that disability legalisations varies widely among
countries [38]. For that reason, the effect of interventions on
return-to-work may also vary from one country to another. The
results and conclusions of this study are relevant for the
Netherlands due to its social security legislation. However, the
early hospital-based work support intervention integrated into
usual psycho-oncological care could be adapted and generalised to
other countries because cancer patients in other countries
experiencing a lack of support about their return-to-work from
the hospital as often as patients in the Netherlands [39]. The exact
content of the intervention should be adapted to the social security
legislation of the country it is implemented in.
Recommendations for further research and practice
In terms of recommendations for clinical practice, this study
revealed that psycho-oncological care can address the return-towork of cancer patients early in their treatment, as well as followup, as the intervention was appreciated by patients and was
perceived as useful and feasible by the nurses. Since, the
occupational physician and employer involvement is pivotal for

a successful return to work but appeared problematic in our
intervention, it seems important to solve what impedes their
involvement and to adapt the intervention accordingly. As we
found similar work outcomes between the intervention group and
the control group, a recommendation for further research is to
study if an improved intervention leads to shorter time to returnto-work.
Due to the large range in time to return to work, it seems
important to identify patients who have a higher risk of getting
adverse work outcomes based on a clinical prediction rule.
Therefore, a recommendation for further research is, to develop
such a clinical prediction rule for work outcomes and to evaluate it
for the accuracy in identifying patients with a higher risk of
adverse work outcomes. Furthermore, apart from identifying
patients with a higher risk, it is also important to make the
intervention more tailored as it appeared that some patients do not
need an intervention to achieve a successful return to work while
other patients might have benefited from a more intense
intervention. A possibility to make an intervention more tailored
is by using a stepped care model. This means that a low-intensity
intervention can be offered to all patients while a high-intensity
intervention is only offered to patients, for whom work resumption
turns out to be problematic.
We found that the contrast between groups was reduced, due to
the study design. Therefore, another recommendation for further
research would be to consider alternative study designs, such as a
cluster randomised controlled trial [40].
