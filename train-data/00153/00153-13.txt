Abstract
Purpose The use of education is recommended to teach
patients self-care behaviours to reduce cancer-related
fatigue, however, there is little evidence of its effectiveness
or optimal timing. This educationally based cancer-related
fatigue intervention trial, CAN-FIT, aimed to reduced
severity of fatigue in radiotherapy patients.
Methods One hundred and ten participants aged ≥18 years
undergoing curative radiotherapy were randomly assigned to
receive (1) pre- and post-radiotherapy fatigue education and
support (RFES); (2) pre-RFES only; (3) post-RFES only; or
(4) no RFES (standard care). Data collection occurred at preand post- radiotherapy and at 6-weeks follow-up.
Results The intervention was not associated with reduction in
fatigue levels at any assessment point. Significant changes
were seen with secondary activity-based outcomes: Physical
activity participation: Pre-RFES was associated with significantly greater increase in vigorous [Assessment (Ax)1-Ax2:
1.05 (0.24, 1.86) p<0.01: Ax2–Ax3: 1.24, (0.44, 2.03) p<
0.01] and moderate physical activity participation [Ax1–
Ax2: 1.4 (0.53, 2.26) p<0.01]. Post-RFES was associated
with significant improvements in walking levels [Ax1–Ax3:
5.82 (0.07, 11.56) p<0.05] compared with no pre-RFES.
Paid and unpaid employment: Pre-RFES was associated with
slower return to pre-treatment levels of paid work [Ax2–
Ax3: −0.72 (−1.41, −0.04) p<0.05] than no pre-RFES. PostRFES was associated with decreased levels of unpaid work
[Ax1–Ax3: 561.79 (51.21, 1,072.37) p<0.05] compared
with no post-RFES.
Conclusion The CAN-FIT programme did not significantly
improve the primary outcome, level of fatigue, regardless of
when it was delivered, however, significant changes were
observed in activity-based outcomes. Further investigations
into educationally based programmes should target activity
participation rather than changes in underlying fatigue to
improve overall patient health.

Introduction
Cancer-related fatigue is a widespread and complex problem
amongst all cancer patients including radiotherapy patients [1,
2]. The pattern of fatigue during radiotherapy is commonly
thought to increase towards the end of treatment and decrease
thereafter [3–5]. Cancer-related fatigue is thought to occur in
association with a number of modifiable symptom correlates

including reduced physical activity, participation in activities
of daily living, performance status, social support, anxiety,
depression, nausea and sleep problems [5, 6]. It is suggested
that identification and treatment of fatigue-related correlates
through multi-focused symptom management is likely to
have the greatest beneficial effect on reducing overall fatigue
[7, 8]. Studies examining the mediating impact of change
in one symptom on change in another related symptom
have supported this multi-focused symptom management
approach. For example, an intervention targeting sleep has
been shown to alleviate fatigue [9] and an intervention
targeting functional status similarly reduced fatigue through
its relationship with depressive symptoms [10].
To manage fatigue and its associated symptoms, a variety
of self-care behaviours have been trialled with inconclusive
results. These behaviours include exercise [11], energy
conservation/activity management [12], sleep hygiene [13],
improved nutrition [14] and psychosocial strategies [15]. Of
these self-care behaviours, exercise has undergone the most
research in recent years though the efficacy of this approach
requires further investigation [16–18].
Educational interventions involving fatigue self-care
behaviours are a commonly recommended fatigue management strategy [19]. Education is thought to prepare patients
for the manifestation, consequences and optimal management of fatigue so they are less likely to experience stress
than if fatigue develops unexpectedly [20]. Educational
interventions have potential to increase patients' knowledge
and may also assist patients to learn fatigue management and
coping strategies [20], though the evidence supporting the
efficacy of this approach is scant [21]. Given the common
use of educational interventions and their hypothesised yet
unproven benefits, there is a need to evaluate the efficacy of
education programmes to minimise the impact of cancerrelated fatigue and to identify optimal delivery timing and
approaches for this education. In this cancer-related fatigue
intervention trial (CAN-FIT) we sought to examine whether
(1) providing pre-radiotherapy fatigue education and support
(RFES) reduced severity of fatigue experienced at the end
and 6 weeks after radiotherapy, (2) providing post-RFES
reduced severity of fatigue experienced 6 weeks after
radiotherapy (3) providing pre and post-RFES reduced
severity of fatigue experienced 6 weeks after radiotherapy.
Patients and methods
Design
This study was a single-centre, factorial randomised
controlled trial with blinding of recruiters and data
collectors. Data was collected at three time-points; preand post- radiotherapy treatment and at 6-weeks follow-up.
Subjects
Subjects were recruited from the Radiation Oncology
Department of a single major metropolitan hospital in
Brisbane, Australia. All patients undergoing outpatient
radiotherapy treatment aged 18 years or over and booked
for 20 or more days of radiotherapy for cancer treatment
were candidates for inclusion in the study. Patients were
excluded if the following criteria were present (1) low
performance status (Karnofsky level of <60/100 requiring
at least considerable assistance and frequent medical care),
(2) undergoing treatment with palliative intent (3) undergoing other concurrent cancer treatments (e.g., chemotherapy), (4) involvement in other programmes or research
specifically targeting fatigue, (5) inability to complete
questionnaires due to cognitive or literacy levels.
A sample size of 110 participants was estimated to have
80% power to detect a previously identified minimally
clinically significant difference of 2.1 units of the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI) general fatigue subscale
[22] between intervention and control groups. This analysis
is based on examination of the main effect of the pre- or posttreatment interventions, not the simple effects of the complete
CAN-FIT programme compared with no treatment (assuming
a standard deviation of 4.8, one pre-intervention and two
post-intervention measures and correlation between pre and
post measures of r=0.7 using a two-tailed alpha of 0.05).
Intervention/control conditions
Participants recruited to the study were randomly allocated
into one of four groups:
& Group 1: Pre- and post-RFES sessions
& Group 2: Pre-RFES session
& Group 3: Post-RFES session
& Group 4: No RFES session (i.e., standard care only)
The intervention CAN-FIT was developed specifically
for this investigation by the research team. The CAN-FIT
programme aimed to reduce participant's level of fatigue by
employing self-care behaviours designed to minimise
fatigue. The programme was based upon the Health Belief
Model which uses attitudes and beliefs of individuals to
modify health behaviours [23]. Programme components
included RFES sessions (60 mins) delivered using a
structured PowerPoint presentation 1 week prior to radiotherapy planning and 1–2 weeks after the completion of
radiotherapy, a participant handbook, a goal setting sheet
and progress diary. Two follow-up phone calls using a
structured script were provided 2 and 4 weeks after each
education session to reinforce information. Session content
addressed radiotherapy and its processes; potential treatment side effects including fatigue; and behavioural
1430 Support Care Cancer (2011) 19:1429–1439
strategies to reduce fatigue including activity modification,
participation in exercise/activity, maintaining weight/nutrition, sleep hygiene tips and relaxation strategies.
The control group received standard care only in the
form of a one-to-one verbal nursing education about the
radiotherapy process and the patient-specific diagnosis and
a standardised written information package about radiotherapy treatment. A one-page flyer was provided with
generic information about fatigue.
Measures
Baseline descriptors of the sample were taken from medical
records and functional performance status was measured
using the Karnofsky performance status scale [24], a singleitem scale ranging from 0 (death) to 100 (normal
performance status with no complaints) [24, 25].
Primary outcome measure
The Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI) [26] was
used to measure patient fatigue. The MFI is a 20-item
assessment tool with five subscales: general fatigue,
physical fatigue, mental fatigue, reduced activity and
reduced motivation. Each subscale consists of four items,
two indicative of fatigue and two contraindicative. Each
fatigue subscale has a potential score range from 4 to 20,
where higher scores indicate more fatigue. The MFI
subscales have previously been reported to have good
internal consistency (average Cronbach's Alpha=0.81) [22]
and overall has been demonstrated to be a valid instrument
for use amongst people with cancer [26].
Secondary outcome measures
Inter-relationships between cancer-related fatigue and other
health constructs have previously been posited [27]. We
therefore sought to examine the effect of the CAN-FIT
programme on these health constructs measured using the
following participant-rated outcomes.
Health-related quality-of-life was measured using the
EuroQual-5D (EQ-5D) comprising a visual analogue scale
scored from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best
imaginable health state) and a five-item instrument converted into a utility score using the Dolan approach [28].
Utility scores range −0.59 to 1 with a higher score
indicating higher quality of life. Leisure and self-care
activity participation was measured using the 15-item
Frenchay Activities Index (FAI) [29]. The summary score
generated ranges 0–45 with a higher score indicating
increased participation in activities. Physical activity participation was measured using the International Physical
Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) short form [30]. This
assessment generated variables for participation in vigorous
and moderate activity and the amount of time per week
spent walking. Participant anxiety and depression were
measured using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale
(HADS) [31]. Subscale scores range from 0–21 with higher
score indicating more anxiety/depression. Sleep disturbance
was measured using the Medical Outcomes Study Sleep
measure (MOSS) [32, 33]. Item responses are scored from
0–100 and are averaged to create subscale scores with a
higher score indicating more sleep problems. Time in paid
employment or doing domestic work was assessed using
the Health and Labour Questionnaire (HLQ) [34].
Procedure
Potential participants were identified through screening of
radiotherapy booking forms and were provided with written
and verbal information about the study by the principal
investigator (AP). If informed consent was provided, relevant
demographic and clinical information was extracted from the
medical record and obtained from participants via interview.
Participants were subsequently allocated into groups as
determined by a simple randomisation sequence developed
using a computerised random number generator. A researcher
independent of the investigative team supervised both the
development of the random allocation sequence and placing
of the sequence into opaque, sequentially numbered envelopes stored securely in a research office. Once aware of the
allocation, the principal investigator (AP) had no further
contact with participants. A research assistant administered
assessments and was blinded to group allocation. A second
research assistant coordinated the interventions delivered by a
multidisciplinary team.
The trial was registered with the Australia New Zealand
Clinical Trials registry (ACTRN12608000171314) and was
approved by the ethics committee of both hospital and
university the ethics committees.
Analysis
Demographic information
Participant demographics and outcome surveys collected at
baseline were compared between groups using unpaired t tests
(data with normal distribution), logistic regression (dichotomous data and dummy variables for categorical data), or
Wilcoxon rank-sum tests (skewed continuous data).
Outcome measures
Where summary scores were utilised, recommended scoring methods for each questionnaire were applied. Data
Support Care Cancer (2011) 19:1429–1439 1431
transformations were employed as indicated by the data
distributions: IPAQ moderate and vigorous activity and
HLQ participation in paid work variables were dichotomised; EQ5D utility and VAS scores underwent square
transformations; and IPAQ walking and HADS depression
scores underwent square root transformations.
The overall study had a 2×2×3 factorial structure
comprising factors of “pre” intervention (pre-RFES vs. no
pre-RFES), “post” intervention (post-RFES vs. no postRFES), and “assessment” (Ax where Ax1: Preradiotherapy, Ax2: Post-radiotherapy, Ax3: 6-week
follow-up) respectively. Generalized Estimating Equations
(GEEs) were used to compare outcomes between intervention conditions due to the longitudinal nature of this design
and likelihood of incomplete follow-up (given the clinical
context of the trial). The GEE can account for missing
continuous outcomes data without list-wise deletion or need
for imputation, regardless of the nature of missing data,
through selection of a working correlation matrix [35].
Aim 1. The effect of pre-FES on patient outcomes: This
analysis examined the difference between groups
(pre-RFES versus no pre-RFES) in change in
clinical outcomes across assessments (change from
Ax1 to Ax2, and change from Ax1 to Ax3). An
interaction between receiving both the pre-RFES
and post-RFES interventions was investigated
though found not to be significant for each outcome.
Aim 2. The effect of post-RFES on patient outcomes: This
analysis examined the difference between groups
(post-RFES versus no post-RFES) in change in
clinical outcomes across assessments (change from
Ax2 to Ax3). Data from Ax2 was used as the
baseline in these analyses as the post-RFES did not
occur until after the end of treatment. Again an
interaction between receiving both the pre-RFES
and post-RFES interventions was investigated
though found not to be significant for each outcome.
Aim 3. The effect of receiving the complete CAN-FIT
programme as opposed to standard care: Outcomes were compared between those who did not
receive pre-RFES or post-RFES intervention with
those who received both. Change in clinical
outcomes from Ax1 to Ax3 was modelled to

Results
During a 10-month recruitment period from April 2008 to
February 2009, 293 patients were eligible for entry to the
study. Of these, 110 participants were recruited (37.5%)
with complete data obtained from 102 (92.7%) participants
for Ax1, 94 (85.5%) for Ax2 and 91 (82.7%) for Ax3
(Fig. 1). Participants were most commonly diagnosed with
breast and prostate cancer. Demographic variables were
broadly consistent between groups (Table 1) however some
differences in the baseline assessment of outcome variables
were identified (Table 2). These differences were in
depression (pre vs. no pre-RFES), cancer-related fatigue
reduced motivation subscale (pre vs. no pre-RFES) and
time spent walking (post vs. not post-RFES).
No significant interactions between pre-RFES and postRFES were identified indicating each aim could be
analysed independently.
Pre-RFES (compared to no pre-RFES) was not associated with change in fatigue levels for any of the MFI
subscales at any assessment point (Table 3). At end of
radiotherapy, significant treatment effects were noted with
the treatment group having a greater increase in vigorous
and moderate physical activity participation but a greater
decrease in quality of life as measured by the EQ5D utility
score. At follow-up assessment, the treatment group had
significantly greater increase in vigorous activity and
greater decrease in paid work participation.
The post-RFES (compared to no post-RFES) analysis
revealed greater improvement in mental fatigue and EQ-5D
utility scores favouring those who did not attend post-RFES
(Table 4). A significant treatment effect was seen with
walking and participation in unpaid work with those who
attended post-RFES having a greater increase in walking
and greater decrease in unpaid work from start of treatment
to follow-up assessment.
No significant treatment effects noted on the fatigue or
other secondary outcomes from the complete CAN-FIT
programme analysis (Table 5).

an optimal approach for its delivery in relation to timing of
provision. No form of the intervention achieved significant
reduction in the primary outcome, fatigue at any time point.
There are a number of potential explanations for this
finding; first, the pattern of fatigue scores did not change
significantly across the three time-points. An earlier study
by this research team which examined fatigue with identical
assessments and time-points in the same radiotherapy
population (n=220) [22] found that fatigue increased
significantly from baseline to end of treatment and then
decreased significantly by 6-week follow-up echoing
findings of similar research [3, 36]. This discrepancy may
be explained by potential compensatory rivalry between
groups aware of the aim of the study or by sample bias. The
recruitment rate for this study (37%) was significantly
lower than the previous study in the same centre (70%) [5]
potentially indicating a sample of motivated participants
who had a different fatigue experience. However, we must
also consider the impact of educational interventions which
in themselves, may not be powerful enough to mediate
substantial improvement in such a complex and multifactorial symptom as fatigue whilst it changes significantly
under the influence of an external factor (radiotherapy
treatment) [37].
Analysis of the complete CAN-FIT programme with
both pre- and post-RFES sessions did not show any
significant benefits above those of providing one session
alone for the primary or secondary outcomes. However,

significant benefits were observed on the secondary outcomes in those who attended one RFES session. Participants receiving pre-RFES reported significant increase in
physical activity participation (vigorous and moderate
activity) during radiotherapy whilst maintaining consistent
levels of fatigue. In comparison, those who did not attend
pre-RFES decreased their level of physical activity participation. Physical activity has previously been demonstrated
to improve cardiopulmonary function and quality of life
[38] and may decrease risk of cancer recurrence [39, 40].
Previous studies with more intense intervention protocols
have also demonstrated similar increased activity participation [38] however, due to the staffing required, these
protocols are difficult to implement in resource-light
clinical environments. This educational intervention has
high feasibility for clinical use based on its group-based
educational design.
Participation in paid and unpaid employment for the
whole sample decreased from start to end of radiotherapy
and increased at follow-up assessment. A significantly
slower increase in paid work at follow-up assessment was
noted in those who attended pre-RFES. Against the trend
established by the overall sample, levels of unpaid work
decreased after radiotherapy in those who attended postRFES. While the cause of these changes cannot be
conclusively ascertained from the study results, we
hypothesise participants of education groups may have
consciously reprioritised their involvement in work-related
activities to increase their involvement in physical activities
based on the activity management education provided.

Quality of life was measured using the EQ-5D utility
and VAS scores. The VAS score did not show significant
change throughout the study however, the EQ-5D results
required further examination. Pre-RFES was associated
with a significant decrease in EQ-5D utility from start to
end of radiotherapy treatment; however, this trend did
not continue at the follow-up assessment. Examination of
this result showed that changes across four of the five
domains assessed by the EQ-5D utility were small
(mobility, personal care, usual activities, anxiety/depression) whereas a large increase in the pain/discomfort
domain occurred in the pre-RFES group principally
accounting for the result. This change did not continue
at the follow-up assessment. Examination of baseline
data of participant VAS ratings of pain found the preRFES group had a greater increase (1.3 to 2.7) compared
with the no pre-RFES group (1.3 to 2.4) reinforcing the
contribution of pain to this result. Whilst further
investigation is required, this finding is unlikely to be
related to the intervention as the education provided did
not address pain.
EQ-5D utility and mental fatigue scores had significantly
less improvement after radiotherapy in the post-RFES
compared with no post-RFES group. The differences in
EQ-5D scores were distributed across a number of domains.
Whilst a cause for this relative decline in mental fatigue and
quality of life is not clear, the timing of the post-RFES
education and the need to return to the treatment centre may
potentially have prolonged participants' attention to or
memory of the experience of radiotherapy resulting in
prolonged distress.
One limitation of the study was the absence of a measure
of fatigue distress. The experimental group anecdotally
reported that their fatigue distress was reduced by attending
the education sessions. Measuring this construct may have
provided additional information about the effects of the
RFES sessions. Additionally, the lack of a matched
attentional control group could be seen as a limitation
although this design was chosen to mimic the current
clinical environment as seen in similar studies [41].
However, this design limits conclusions about whether the
treatment works, instead it allows us to investigate whether
the new treatment is more effective than standard care [42].
The most common diagnoses represented in this study
were breast and prostate cancer. Other solid tumour
diagnoses represented (melanoma and head and neck
cancer) were not equally distributed between randomised
groups. Of particular note is the presence of only one head
and neck patient in the CAN-FIT intervention group.
Haematological malignancies were not well represented
due to their lower representation in radiotherapy groups.
The findings from this study require replication in these
other diagnostic groups.
Conclusion
The CAN-FIT programme did not significantly improve the
primary outcome, level of fatigue, regardless of when it was
delivered. However pre-RFES was associated with increased participation in vigorous and moderate activity
without a corresponding increase in fatigue. It appears that
the success of educationally based programmes targeting
activity-based outcomes should be further investigated
rather than pursuing change in underlying fatigue. This
may assist patients to develop realistic expectations for their
treatment phase and to improve overall patient health.
