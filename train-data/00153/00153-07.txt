Abstract
Background: There is a paucity of methodologically robust vocational rehabilitation (VR) intervention trials. This
study assessed the feasibility and acceptability of a VR trial of women with breast cancer to inform the
development of a larger interventional study.
Methods: Women were recruited in Scotland and randomised to either a case management VR service or to usual
care. Data were collected on eligibility, recruitment and attrition rates to assess trial feasibility, and interviews
conducted to determine trial acceptability. Sick leave days (primary outcome) were self-reported via postal
questionnaire every 4 weeks during the first 6 months post-surgery and at 12 months. Secondary outcome
measures were change in employment pattern, quality of life and fatigue.
Results: Of the 1,114 women assessed for eligibility, 163 (15%) were eligible. The main reason for ineligibility was
age (>65 years, n = 637, 67%). Of those eligible, 111 (68%) received study information, of which 23 (21%) consented
to participate in the study. Data for 18 (78%) women were analysed (intervention: n = 7; control: n = 11).
Participants in the intervention group reported, on average, 53 fewer days of sick leave over the first 6 months
post-surgery than those in the control group; however, this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.122;
95% confidence interval −15.8, 122.0). No statistically significant differences were found for secondary outcomes.
Interviews with trial participants indicated that trial procedures, including recruitment, randomisation and research
instruments, were acceptable.
Conclusions: Conducting a pragmatic trial of effectiveness of a VR intervention among cancer survivors is both
feasible and acceptable, but more research about the exact components of a VR intervention and choice of
outcomes to measure effectiveness is required. VR to assist breast cancer patients in the return to work process is
an important component of cancer survivorship plans.

Background
Work is beneficial for physical and mental health [1].
Returning to work following diagnosis and treatment for
cancer is a public health concern because being in paid
employment is associated with improved quality of life
[2-5] and perceived by cancer survivors as a means of
re-gaining a sense of normality, self-concept and identity
[6-11]. In the UK around 90,000 people of working age
are diagnosed with cancer annually [12]. Breast cancer is
the most common female cancer worldwide [13] and
many women diagnosed with the disease will be in paid
employment at the time of their diagnosis.
Studies about breast cancer and employment suggest
that the overwhelming majority of women with breast
cancer return to work (rates above 80% reported)
[14-16]. Yet, a review of 26 articles about cancer survivors,
which found that return to work varies according to
the type of cancer, reports that there is an increased
risk of unemployment for breast cancer survivors versus
control participants (35.6% vs. 31.7%; pooled RR, 1.28;
95% CI, 1.11-1.49) [17]. Moreover, a recent study
conducted in Germany of 227 breast cancer patients
versus 647 comparison participants reported that 6 years
after surgery, the probability of returning to work was still
only half as high among breast cancer survivors than
among controls [18].
The duration of work absence varies, suggesting that
some women find it harder returning to work than
others [14-16]. A review found the average length of sick
leave for a person treated for cancer to be 151 missed
days from work [19]. A study conducted in North America
found that women treated for breast cancer missed an
average of 44.5 days from work within the first 6 months
following diagnosis; the median days missed was 22 [20].
Length of work absence is important because sickness
absence is a risk factor for permanently leaving the
workforce [21]. A survey of 267 cancer survivors (48%
were breast cancer survivors) in England found that the
length of sick leave was significantly related to return to
work within 18 months of cancer diagnosis [odds ratio
1.68, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.23-2.28] [22].
Treatment modality may be one contributing factor
to work absence duration. A recent study found that
women who had undergone mastectomy had longer
sickness absence compared to women who had
undergone breast-conserving surgery [22]. Other
studies report a negative impact of chemotherapy on
duration of work absence in breast cancer survivors
[20,23,24]. A systematic review of 28 cohort studies
about predictors of return to work and employment
in cancer survivors with different diagnoses found
that heavy work, chemotherapy, older age, low education
and low income were negatively associated with return to
work [25].
Studies show that women with breast cancer compared
to cancer-free controls will, over time, experience permanently reduced work ability [26,27]. A cross-sectional study
found that women with breast cancer had significantly
lower work productivity than their peers who had no
personal experience of cancer and that fatigue was associated with lower work productivity [28]. Similarly, a recent
study of breast cancer survivors who were diagnosed with
stage 0 ductal carcinoma in situ or stage I, II or III breast
cancer found a mean reduction in productivity of 3.1%
below the healthy worker norm, even at 3 years post
treatment; after controlling for stage, fatigue and hot
flashes were each associated with work performance losses
of 1.6% (p = 0.05) and 2.2% (p < 0.001), respectively [29].
Whether returning to work is a positive experience for
cancer survivors depends on a range of factors including
good organisational support, such as an employer’s
willingness to make adjustments to the workplace and
job role, and informal personal and emotional support
from colleagues [11]. A focus group study of women
with breast cancer found that disclosure of their cancer
in the workplace in particular could be distressing [30].
Other research suggests that a minority of cancer survivors
experience job discrimination [30,31] and become involved
in disputes about terms of employment [32]. Other
reasons why work experience may prove difficult include
lack of understanding of the role of occupational health by
treating doctors [33].
A consequence of over a decade of cancer and employment research is growing interest in vocational rehabilitation
(VR) services for cancer survivors [34]. However, the
availability of rehabilitation services varies considerably
[35]. A recent review found only 19 work-related interventions for cancer survivors and only 3 of these interventions
focussed primarily on improving work outcomes [36].
Another review noted the lack of services in the UK
designed to help people with cancer remain in or return
to work [37]. Systematic reviews of VR interventions for
cancer survivors have noted a paucity of methodologically
robust interventions [36,38-40]. A recent controlled trial
involving 72 cancer patients suggests that high-intensity
physical training is useful for working cancer patients;
patients in the intervention group showed significantly
less reduction in working hours per week [−5.0 h/week
vs. -10.8 h/week (P = 0.03)], and on long-term follow-up,
78% of the participants from the intervention group versus
66% from the control group had returned to work on
the pre-diagnosis level of working hours (P = 0.18) [41].
A nurse-led intervention whereby patients with breast
cancer were encouraged to return to work and become
socially active, and were counselled on feelings, found that
12 to 18 months after surgery, those who were helped by
the nurse had greater social recovery, return to work and
adaptation to breast loss than those without the nurse’s
Hubbard et al. Trials 2013, 14:175 Page 2 of 14

support [42]. In a randomised trial, patients with breast
cancer receiving information and performing physical
training supplemented by coping skills training provided
by an oncology nurse who specialised in psychosocial
matters had improved return-to-work outcomes, but no
statistically significant differences were observed when
those patients were compared with controls who received
either a single information session or no intervention [43].
Thus, there is only limited evidence of the effectiveness
of rehabilitation programmes on return to work for cancer
survivors [44,45]. To our knowledge, this is the first article
reporting the use of a general as opposed to cancer-specific
VR service for cancer patients.
AIM
The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility and
acceptability of an existing case management VR service
for women with breast cancer to inform the development
of a larger randomised controlled trial (RCT). Hence, this
feasibility study incorporated a pilot RCT with women
with breast cancer following surgery. Although hypothesis
testing must proceed cautiously in a feasibility study, it
was anticipated that participants referred to the VR service
would experience fewer days off work due to sickness in
the first 6 months post-surgery (primary outcome), lower
levels of fatigue and increased quality of life (secondary
outcomes). This article reports the feasibility and
acceptability of this trial and VR services among
women with breast cancer, as well as trial outcomes at
6- and 12-month follow-up.
Methods
Study design
The design of this feasibility study incorporating an
interventional two-arm pilot randomised controlled trial
has been previously described [46]. Trial procedures are
therefore only described briefly below, with particular
attention paid to deviations from protocol. Three changes
were made to the protocol during the pilot RCT in response
to lower than expected recruitment rates in order to
prevent the RCT failing to recruit. These changes were:
1. Inclusion of women with ductal carcinoma in situ
(DCIS) (from 1 June 2011);
2. Extension of the recruitment period by 6 months
(from 1 June 2011);
3. Inclusion of women employed in companies with
more than 250 employees (from 1 August 2011).
Changes to eligibility criteria resulted in the recruitment
of an additional four RCT participants who would
previously have been excluded. These included two
women diagnosed with DCIS and two individuals
employed in companies with more than 250 employees.
The study was closed to recruitment on 29 December
2011 and concluded, as planned, on June 12 2012.
Participants
Eligible patients were women: (1) aged between 18 and
65 years; (2) in paid employment or self-employed; (3)
living or working in Lothian or Tayside, Scotland, UK;
(4) diagnosed with an invasive breast cancer tumour or
ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS); (5) treated first with
surgery. Breast care nurses (BCN) assessed eligibility of
patients attending hospital in the preoperative phase.
Recruitment
Recruitment was conducted over a 14-month period
between September 11 2010 and 29 December 2011.
Settings
Participants were recruited from three hospitals in two
NHS Boards in Scotland [Perth Royal Infirmary (PRI), and
Ninewells Hospital, Dundee (NHS Tayside); Western
General Hospital (WGH), Edinburgh (NHS Lothian)].
Due to variation in local clinical processes, service size
and workforce capacity, the recruitment process and
timeframe differed in each of the three hospitals.
Recruitment Procedure
Trial eligibility was assessed through a two-stage process.
First, clinical eligibility criteria were assessed by either clinical teams from surgical lists (NHS Tayside) or at a weekly
multi-disciplinary team (MDT) meeting (NHS Lothian).
Second, employment eligibility criteria were assessed by
BCNs. Eligible women were given a study information
pack at a routine appointment with their BCN and
returned written informed consent to either their BCN or
the study researcher (RGK) by post.
Intervention
The Scottish Centre for Healthy Working Lives established
‘Working Health Services’ (WHS), a pilot VR service,
in NHS Tayside and NHS Lothian in 2008 and 2009,
respectively. WHS provides fast-track support to people
to remain in or return to work following a period of injury
or illness who are employed in companies with less than
250 employees where occupational health services are not
routinely available. WHS adopts a biopsychosocial model
and a multi-disciplinary approach whereby case management is used to assess individuals’ needs to enable work
retention or return through signposting or direct referral
to a range of supportive services according to need,
such as physiotherapy, occupational therapy, occupational
health nurse, occupational health doctor, counsellor/
psychological therapy and complementary therapy.
However, WHS is not cancer-specific and prior to the
commencement of this study only a few individuals with
Hubbard et al. Trials 2013, 14:175 Page 3 of 14
http://www.trialsjournal.com/content/14/1/175
cancer had been referred to WHS in both Tayside and
Lothian. The purpose of this study was therefore to assess
the feasibility of referral of cancer patients to an existing
case management VR service and, specifically, the acceptability of WHS for women with breast cancer.
Thus, the trial intervention was referral to WHS in
either Tayside or Lothian. Patients recruited from PRI
and Ninewells, Dundee, were randomised to receive
referral to WHS Tayside; individuals enrolled from
WGH were referred to WHS Lothian. All participants
allocated to the intervention arm of the trial were
contacted by WHS within 10 days following return of the
baseline questionnaire to the study researcher (RGK). As
per usual WHS practice, participants were allocated a ‘case
manager’ who conducted a telephone assessment of
supportive care needs to facilitate work retention or
return. Based on this assessment (where appropriate)
individuals were signposted or referred to relevant services
that could support patients with cancer-related and
treatment side effects (e.g., fatigue, mood changes) as
well as job-related issues (e.g., liaison with employers to
enable work adjustments such as changes to hours
worked or job role) in order to decrease duration of
sickness absence or increase overall quality of (work)
life. Hence, reflecting the personalised nature of the case
management VR approach, each individual could receive a
different (combination of ) intervention(s), which precluded
exogenous standardisation.
Usual care
Usual care following surgery involved no formal employment support. However, participants in both arms of the
trial received a copy of the booklet Work and Cancer
published by Macmillan Cancer Support [47].
Measures
The primary objective of the study was to assess the
feasibility and acceptability of trial processes and the
intervention to inform a larger RCT of the effectiveness
of a case management VR service for patients with cancer.
Data were therefore collected on eligibility, recruitment
and attrition rates to assess trial feasibility. Moreover, a
qualitative evaluation was conducted to determine trial
acceptability. This evaluation involved 11 semi-structured
interviews with trial participants (n = 6), breast cancer
clinical nurse specialists (n = 3) and VR service case managers (n = 2). Interviews with trial participants were
conducted, as planned, at 6-month follow-up. However,
due to the 6-month extension of the recruitment period,
only 12 women were entered into the trial at this time, of
whom half were interviewed. Thus, interviewees were representative of trial participants prior to the change in eligibility criteria. Interviews were audio recorded and
transcribed verbatim. Transcripts were analysed by
identifying similarities/differences in responses between
respondents to structured questions about trial acceptability
and feasibility. Frequency of particular responses was
noted and quotations selected (where appropriate) to
illustrate specific points. A structured questionnaire was
used to collect baseline data on date of birth, postcode, total
household income, clinical diagnosis and co-morbidities.
In addition, the following primary and secondary trial
outcomes were assessed. There were no changes to these
outcomes after commencement of the trial.
Primary outcome (self-reported sickness absence)
The primary outcome was number of days off work due
to ill health within the first 6 months after surgery. Sick
leave days were self-reported via postal questionnaire
every 4 weeks during the first 6 months post-surgery,
which is known to be a robust approach where recall is
limited to 2 to 4 weeks [48,49]. In addition, the duration
of sick leave in the 4 weeks before the date of 12-
month follow-up was also measured by self-report
postal questionnaire. Because it is likely to be difficult to
directly attribute a day of sickness absence to breast cancer and its treatments (particularly through a self-report
measure), all sickness absence, irrespective of its perceived
or actual relationship with cancer, was measured.
Secondary outcomes
Secondary outcome measures were change in employment
pattern, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and fatigue
between enrolment and 6- and 12-month follow-up.
Secondary outcomes were assessed by self-report postal
questionnaire at trial enrolment, 6- and 12-month
follow-up (between 17 May 2011 and 19 May 2012, and
17 November 2011 and 19 November 2012, respectively).
Employment pattern
A non-validated questionnaire measured change in employment pattern including the following indicators: left
or remained in paid employment, job role and hours
worked.
Quality of life
The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast
Cancer (FACT-B) Version 4 was used to assess breast
cancer-related quality of life (QoL) [50]. The FACT-B is a
37-item self-report questionnaire that evaluates several
QoL domains: physical, social/family, emotional and functional well-being. In addition, a ten-item breast cancer
subscale (BCS) is specific to the experiences of women
living with breast cancer and the symptoms and side
effects of treatment and includes items on anxiety, pain
and body image. Participants complete the questionnaire
in terms of the past 7 days and each item is scored on
a 5-point Likert scale that varies from 0 (not at all) to
Hubbard et al. Trials 2013, 14:175 Page 4 of 14
http://www.trialsjournal.com/content/14/1/175
4 (very much). Negatively phrased questions are reversed
prior to analysis and scores are summed for each domain;
a higher score indicates higher well-being [50]. Domain
scores vary from 0 to 28 for the physical, social/family and
functional well-being domains; 0 to 24 for the emotional
well-being domain and 0 to 40 for the BCS. The scores
of the four well-being domains are summed to calculate
the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General
(FACT-G) score and total scores of the FACT-G and
BCS are summed to calculate a FACT-B score.
Fatigue
The Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness TherapyFatigue Scale (FACIT-Fatigue) was used to assess specific
functional and physical aspects of fatigue associated with
breast cancer diagnosis and treatment. This 13-item
subscale has been determined to be a reliable and valid
stand-alone measure of fatigue [51]. In common with
the FACT-B, items are scored on a 5-point Likert scale
and relate to the past 7 days. FACIT-Fatigue scores vary
from 0 to 52 and negatively worded items are reversed
before analysis so that higher scores represent better
self-reported health [51].
Sample size
Based on local Tayside and Lothian diagnosis and surgical
data obtained from 2008, estimated employment rates and
a conservative recruitment rate of between 50% and 60%,
it was initially estimated that between 66 and 79 patients
would be recruited to the study over a 6-month period
[46]. Sample size calculations based on the primary outcome measure reported in the protocol [46] indicated
that, assuming a mean of 180 days absent from work in
the control group and an estimated standard deviation of
100 days, a sample size of 70 (35 in each group) would be
able to detect a reduction in number of days absent from
work from 180 to 110 days with a 5% level of significance
and 80% power. However, this recruitment target was not
met and consequently the study was underpowered to
identify statistically significant differences in the primary
and secondary outcome measures between the intervention
and control groups.
Randomisation
The allocation sequence was generated from a Bernoulli
probability distribution with a specified probability of
0.5, which ensured participants had an equal chance of
being in either group. Participants were randomly
assigned to the intervention and usual care arm with a
1:1 allocation ratio. A separate sequence was used for
each NHS Board (analogous to the VR service to which
participants in the intervention arm are referred) to ensure
that there was an even distribution of participants to the
intervention and usual care groups in each NHS Board.
The allocation sequences were concealed from the
researcher (RGK) responsible for recruiting and collecting
data from participants. The trial statistician (DA) provided
the allocation sequences to a research administrator in the
Cancer Care Research Centre at the University of Stirling
who was not involved in the process of random number
generation, data collection or analysis. This administrator
assigned participants to the intervention and usual care
groups and referred participants in the intervention arm
to the VR service.
Blinding
Participants became aware of their group allocation at
the point at which they did or did not receive a referral
to the VR service. Thus, it was not possible to blind
patients to their group allocation. However, the randomisation procedure ensured that researchers involved
in data collection or outcome assessment did not know
participants’ group allocation.
Statistical methods
Data analysis was conducted using SPSS (version 19)
[52]. Baseline characteristics are reported as mean and
standard deviation for continuous data and n (%) for
categorical data. Differences between the intervention
and control groups for the primary outcome measure
were tested using an independent samples t-test as per
protocol [46]. Due to the small number of participants
recruited to the trial, per protocol analysis of secondary
outcomes using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA),
adjusting for baseline values was not conducted following
advice from the trial statistician (DA). Secondary outcomes
were therefore also assessed using independent samples
t-tests. The significance level was set at 0.05 as per
protocol [46].
Ethical approval
The study protocol was approved by NHS Tayside Committee on Medical Research Ethics A (ref.: 10/S1401/15)
and the research ethics committee of the University of
Stirling. Research Governance approval was also obtained
from NHS Lothian and NHS Tayside. Informed written
consent was obtained from participants.
Results
Participant flow (trial feasibility)
Participant flow through the pilot RCT is illustrated in
Figure 1. Of the 1,114 women assessed for eligibility 951
(85.4%) were ineligible because of age > 65 (n = 637,
67%); being unemployed (n = 115, 12.1%); being
employed in companies with >250 employees [assessed
in WGH only to 31 July 2011 because of the recruitment
process (see above), n = 83, 8.7%]; surgery not being the
first treatment (WGH only, n = 64, 6.7%); non-invasive

disease (WGH only to 31 May 2011, n = 31, 3.3%);
resident/work outside the VR service area (n = 21, 2.2%).
Of the 163 (14.6%) women eligible for inclusion, 52
(31.9%) were not given information about the study for
the following reasons: failure in the distribution process
(e.g., nurse forgetfulness; n = 27, 51.9%); information
declined by prospective participant because of perceived
relevance (n = 15, 28.8%); BCN considered study inappropriate because of psychological/emotional distress
(n = 5, 9.6%) or personal/social circumstances (n = 2,
3.8%); communication difficulties (n = 3, 5.8%). Of the
111 (68.1%) women who did receive study information,
23 (20.7%) consented to participate in the study. One
woman (4.3%) did not return a baseline questionnaire
despite repeat reminders and data for four women
(17.4%) could not be analysed because more than 2
months had elapsed between the date of recruitment
and receipt of the baseline questionnaire. Data for 18
(78.3%) women were analysed (intervention: n = 7, control:
n = 11). Data for two women, both randomly allocated to
the control group, could not be included in analysis of the
secondary quality of life and fatigue outcomes as the
number of missing items on returned questionnaires
was greater than that permissible by FACT analysis
procedures [50].
Sample characteristics
Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of participants included in the analysis are shown in Tables 1
and 2. The mean age of participants was 50.5 (SD = 5.5) and
most women were diagnosed with stage II breast cancer
(44.4%), followed by stage III (27.8%). Two-thirds (66.7%)
stated that they had a co-morbidity. Most women (61.1%)
worked full time and reported an annual household
income of between £20,000 and £39,999. The mean number
of hours worked each week was 32.5 (SD = 10.2).
Intervention
Case management interventions received by participants
in the intervention group are shown in Table 3. Due to
the recruitment process all women received at least one
telephone call from a case manager. Four women (57.1%)
Figure 1 CONSORT pilot RCT participant flow diagram.
Hubbard et al. Trials 2013, 14:175 Page 6 of 14
http://www.trialsjournal.com/content/14/1/175
received only telephone support. Participants had 27
telephone contacts with a case manager (mean = 3.9).
Three women (42.9%) also had a face-to-face meeting
with a case manager, which for one individual also involved
their Human Resources (HR) advisor at work. These three
participants had a total of seven face-to-face meetings with
a case manager (mean = 2.3). Two individuals (28.6%) were
referred to another service via the VR service. One woman
was referred to Maggie’s Cancer Caring Centre for welfare
and benefits advice and for assistance with an application
for financial aid from Macmillan Cancer Support. Another
participant was referred to an employment rights service
for advice around phased return to work.
Outcome measures
Trial outcome data are shown in Tables 4 and 5.
Primary outcome (self-reported sickness absence)
Participants in the intervention group reported 53.1 fewer
days of sick leave over the first 6 months post-surgery
than those in the control group, equivalent to 1.7 months.

Although substantial, this difference was not statistically
significant (p = 0.122; 95% CI −15.8, 122.0) (Table 4).
At 12-month follow-up the intervention group reported
2 fewer days of sick leave during the preceding 4 weeks
than those in the control group, although, again, this
difference was not statistically significant (Table 5).
Secondary outcomes (employment patterns, quality of life
and fatigue)
Employment patterns No participants retired, left paid
employment or changed jobs during the trial. All participants had the same job role at 12 months as they had
reported before their cancer diagnosis. Four participants
(57.1%) in the intervention group and three participants
(27.3%) in the control group reported a change in
hours worked each week during the trial. However, no
discernible difference in the pattern of changes to
working hours was found between the intervention
and control groups.
Quality of life Participants in the intervention group
reported higher overall quality of life at 6-month follow-up
(FACT-B: 109.0, SD = 17.90) than those in the control
group (98.9, SD = 21.39). However, this difference was not
statistically significant (p = 0.333). Measures of physical,
emotional and functional well-being were all higher in the
intervention group than in the control group, although
differences were not statistically significant. Social/family
well-being was lower in the intervention group at 6-month
follow-up, but not statistically significantly. Participants in
the intervention group reported a statistically significantly
higher score on the breast cancer subscale (BCS) than
those in the control group (intervention: 26.4 [SD = 4.65],
control: 20.2 [SD = 4.68], p = 0.020; Table 4).
A similar pattern was found at 12-month follow-up
with participants in the intervention group reporting
higher levels of overall quality of life (FACT-B), physical
and emotional well-being, and a higher BCS score. Social/family well-being was, however, higher in the intervention group at 12-month follow-up. None of the
differences at 12-month follow-up were statistically significant (Table 5).
Fatigue There were only very small differences in selfreported levels of fatigue (FACIT-Fatigue) between the
intervention and control groups at both 6- and 12-month
follow-up; these were not statistically significant (Tables 4
and 5).
Trial acceptability
Trial participants
Interviews with trial participants (n = 6) indicated that
trial procedures, including recruitment, randomisation
and research instruments, were acceptable. It was clear to
participants why and how they had been recruited to the

trial and the initial approach about study involvement
through a BCN was considered appropriate. Research instruments were not deemed to be overly burdensome in
terms of either completion time or content (e.g., “I didn’t
find it a long questionnaire, the questions were brief too”).
Typically, baseline and 6- and 12-month follow-up questionnaires took 15–20 min to complete and each sick
leave questionnaire was completed in 5 min. Completion
of the sick leave questionnaire every 4 weeks was considered
appropriate as days absent from work could be more
easily recalled and checked against calendar or diary
entries over this period. Individual questions were
considered to be easily understandable and not excessively
intrusive (e.g., “I don’t remember thinking: ‘How dare they
ask me that’”). However, some individuals (n = 2) did
indicate that completing the QoL (FACT) questionnaire
in terms of the last 7 days, as instructed, was “tricky”
because of daily fluctuation in mood and symptoms (e.g.,
“Some days you feel fantastic and the next day you feel
rubbish so it’s always quite difficult to fill those in because
you’re like: ‘Well, today I feel great, but yesterday I felt
horrible and who knows what tomorrow holds?’”).
Another individual noted that she felt that the QoL
questionnaire “had been written by someone who hasn’t
been through cancer and if they had been through cancer
they would have worded some of the questions slightly
differently”. Thus, additional questions on symptoms and
timing/frequency of symptom exacerbation were requested.
Receipt and return of research instruments by post was
deemed appropriate, although all participants (n = 6)
indicated that email or online completion would also
have been appropriate. Participants were content with
their group allocation and this contentment was expressed
in relation to general appeals to altruistic motivations that
underpinned trial participation (e.g., “If it means taking a
few minutes every now and again to fill in a form that can
help somebody else further down the line then everybody
should be doing it”).
Breast Care Nurses (BCN)
Breast care nurses (n = 3) indicated that the main reasons for not providing information to women were:
heightened anxiety among prospective participants;
information overload and clinical prioritisation at the
point on the patient pathway designated for recruitment;
limited time for conversations with women at the time
of recruitment; nurse forgetfulness; nurses’ perceptions
about trial relevance for prospective participants; and
competition between trials and perceived importance of
a VR intervention study in relation to other open trials
among clinicians. Timing of recruitment was noted by
nurses as a particular challenge as it was a point in the
patient pathway of heightened cancer worry and information burden. However, nurses also suggested that an
alternative recruitment point later in the patient pathway
had potential to exclude individuals for whom employment
difficulties were experienced earlier in the pathway, such
as self-employed people or individuals on short-term contracts. An alternative recruitment procedure was therefore
suggested that relied on administrative rather than clinical
staff to retrospectively identify patients and send study
information by post. However, nurses noted that a
challenge of this approach was that patients’ current
employment status was not currently routinely recorded
and that this would have to be addressed to facilitate this
alternative recruitment procedure.
VR service staff
VR service staff (n = 2) suggested that although the
initial contact between trial participants and the
service differed from usual practice (i.e., participants
were approached by the VR service rather than selfTable 5 Pilot RCT outcome measures (12-month follow-up)

referral), the process from that point did not differ
between trial participants and other clients. However, case
managers did note that for those individuals referred to
the service via the trial, they did not perceive their work
to be case management because of its light-touch nature.
Additionally, VR staff expressed disappointment that
nurses’ perceptions of the level of anxiety and distress
among prospective participants had prevented inclusion
of some women in the trial and suggested that their role
could have contributed to the alleviation of anxiety. Thus,
VR staff indicated that further education was required for
clinical staff about the role of the VR service and,
conversely, also recognised that VR staff needed additional
training from clinical staff about the specific needs of cancer patients to better support these individuals.
Discussion
The importance of feasibility and pilot trials of pragmatic
complex interventions [53] prior to the conduct of effectiveness trials is recognised [54-56] although these studies
are under-reported, which means that few opportunities
exist to share learning from important preliminary research.
Moreover, harnessing such learning is essential to ensure
that interventions and trial designs are normalised into
routine clinical practice [55]. The feasibility and acceptability of a trial designed to measure effectiveness of a VR
intervention among women with breast cancer are
therefore discussed. In particular, we share learning
about recruitment and outcome variables for future effectiveness VR trials and discuss the type of VR intervention
required to make a difference among cancer survivors.
Recruitment
This study shows a range of factors influencing the number
of women with breast cancer recruited to the VR trial and
number of participants included in final analysis. First,
relaxing eligibility criteria may increase the number of
women recruited to future trials. Due to the pragmatic nature of this trial and use of an intervention that involved
referral to an existing case management VR service,
certain eligibility criteria were not under the research
team’s direct control. For example, conditions of VR service
funding meant that only employees from companies with
fewer than 250 employees could be referred until these
external restrictions were relaxed. Moreover, challenges
associated with integrating recruitment processes that
were broadly consistent across three hospital sites and not
overly complicated or burdensome dictated the criteria
around surgery as first treatment. Finding ways to overcome external factors, such as renegotiating terms of
service funding, may increase participation in future RCTs
of the effectiveness of existing case management VR
services. Second, future multi-centre trials should consider
variation in recruitment procedures to accommodate
different clinical routines as long as these different procedures do not introduce selection bias. In our study the
recruitment process varied marginally in each of the three
research sites, accounting for local differences in clinical
routines. Comparison of participant characteristics across
the three sites did not suggest selection bias. Third,
researchers should acknowledge that clinical priorities are
likely to supersede those of research, which will influence
recruitment rates. In our study clinicians did not approach
all eligible patients about the study (31.9% of patients who
were eligible were not approached about the study by a
clinician) due to competing clinical demands. Any future
study involving clinicians (who understandably prioritise
clinical demands above those of research) in the recruitment process should therefore factor clinical priorities
when calculating recruitment rates. Alternative methods of
recruitment that do not involve clinicians in the
process should also be considered. Fourth, reasons for
non-participation in RCTs of VR services should be
examined to increase recruitment to future RCTs. In
this study, ethical considerations restricted the ability to
ask individuals who chose not to consent to the RCT to
identify the reasons for non-participation. A survey of a
representative sample of breast cancer patients prior to a
future RCT may provide additional evidence to inform
effective recruitment strategies. Fifth, the study suggests
that age (participants had to be aged <65 years) is a useful
inclusion criterion for VR studies because it is a quick
method of identifying patients most likely to be eligible,
i.e., in paid employment and thus likely to benefit from
VR. At the time of the study the average age at which
people left the labour market in the UK rose from 63.8
years to 64.6 years for men and from 61.2 years to 62.3
years for women between 2004 and 2010 [57]. Finally,
future studies should factor the number of participants
eligible for entry into the final analysis when calculating
recruitment targets. The study shows that 21.7% of
patients were not included in the final analysis for reasons
such as failing to complete questionnaires in a timely way
or missing items on returned questionnaires.
Thus, taking into account the proportion of patients
meeting eligibility criteria, clinical priorities, patient
willingness to consent (only a fifth of eligible patients
who were given information about the study consented)
and the number of participants entered into final analysis,
we conservatively estimate that out of every 1,000 patients
with breast cancer approximately 1% are likely to be
entered into analysis of a VR trial.
Outcome variables
The study raises several issues about selection of outcome
variables for future VR trials.
Our study found that participants had an average of
87.8 days (mean) off work within the first 6 months
Hubbard et al. Trials 2013, 14:175 Page 10 of 14
http://www.trialsjournal.com/content/14/1/175
following diagnosis, which is almost double that found
in a North American study, which reported that women
with breast cancer had an average of 44.5 days within
the first 6 months [19]. This difference in findings may
reflect different policies, procedures and economic factors
in different countries, which are key variables that impact
the transition back to the workplace [58], as well as
cultural differences. Our study shows that participants in
the intervention group had an average 55.4 days (mean)
off work (i.e., closer to duration of work absence reported
in the North American study) compared to 108.5 days for
participants in the control group. However, this difference
in outcome was not statistically significant, which is why
we are recommending larger, more definitive effectiveness
VR trials that include duration of absence from work as
a key outcome variable. Self-reported sick leave was
considered appropriate by participants and is a robust
method [48,49], which is why we are suggesting that
completion of a sick leave questionnaire every 4 weeks
is a useful approach.
In relation to other employment-related outcomes, no
participants retired, left paid employment or changed jobs
during the 12 months post-diagnosis and all participants
reported the same job role at 12 months as they had
before the cancer diagnosis. A UK study of cancer
survivors [59] and studies of breast cancer survivors
[14-16] with much larger sample sizes suggest that
approximately 20% of cancer survivors will experience
one or more of these types of changes in their work
pattern. Changes in hours worked were, however, observed
in intervention and control group participants but no
discernable differences in patterns of change in hours
worked between the two groups were observed. A UK
study [59] found that 83.2% of cancer survivors taking
less than 6 months sick leave were working the same
hours as before the cancer diagnosis whereas only 57.1%
of those who took 18 months or more sick leave were
working the same hours. Thus, hours worked should be
considered as an outcome variable in any future effectiveness VR trials, particularly those with a longer term
follow-up (i.e., beyond 12 months post-diagnosis).
Participants in the intervention group reported higher
overall quality of life at 6-month follow-up (FACT-B:
109.0, SD = 17.9) than those in the control group (98.9,
SD = 21.4) but the difference was not statistically significant. Quality of life improved at 12 months for both
groups; in the intervention group it increased by nearly
5 points (FACT-B: 113.7, SD 18.5) and by 8 points for
women in the control group (FACT-B 107:1, SD 19.8).
An observational study of 2,013 women with breast
cancer in North America using the same instrument
(FACT-B) reported a slightly higher quality of life score
(FACT-B: 113.7, SD 18.8) compared to women in our
intervention group at 6 months [5]. However, quality of
life of women in North America [5] at 6 months and of
women in our intervention group at 12 months was
identical (FACT-B: 113.7). Given only slight variation in
quality of life scores between women in our intervention
and control groups (although a note of caution is
required because our study was under-powered) and
identical quality of life scores to those reported in an
observational study, we question whether quality of life,
or the specific measure of QoL used, is a sufficiently
sensitive outcome for interventions trials. The criterion
of sensitivity to change is an important consideration
when deciding outcomes for future VR intervention
trials [60]. Further, our study shows that some participants
found it difficult completing a quality of life questionnaire
because their quality of life varied daily (within the first 12
months following diagnosis) whereas the questionnaire
requested them to report their quality of life over the
previous 7 days.
Cancer-related fatigue has been described as ‘the
commonest and most debilitating symptom in patients
with cancer’ [61]. A systematic review of 14 studies
concluded that there is good evidence that fatigue occurs
up to 5 years after completion of adjuvant therapy for
breast cancer [62]. Fatigue has been found to predict
return to work in cancer survivors [63] and is an important
factor related to work productivity in breast cancer
survivors even at 3 years post treatment [29]. Nevertheless,
our study found only negligible differences in self-reported
levels of fatigue (FACIT-Fatigue) between the intervention
group and control groups at both 6- and 12-month
follow-up that were not statistically significant.
Based on these issues about outcomes highlighted by
our study, we propose further research and discussion
between key stakeholders (including patients) to determine
which outcomes to measure in effectiveness VR intervention trials. Broadly, outcomes must measure important
phenomena, be scientifically sound, provide useable
information and be feasible to collect [64]. A review
of 45 articles on cancer survivors and work, for instance,
proposed a work and cancer model where a range of
symptoms, functions, and health and well-being categories
are associated with work outcomes (e.g., return to work,
work ability, work performance and sustainability) [58].
Intervention
This study evaluated a VR case management service for
people requiring work-related support due to ill health.
There is no single definition of case management [65];
the Case Management Society of America (CMSA) defines
it as ‘a collaborative process of assessment, planning,
facilitation, care coordination, evaluation, and advocacy
for options and services to meet an individual’s and family’s
comprehensive health needs through communication and
available resources to promote quality cost-effective
Hubbard et al. Trials 2013, 14:175 Page 11 of 14
http://www.trialsjournal.com/content/14/1/175
outcomes’ [66]. Thus, patients are likely to have a case
manager who then refers and directs them to other support
services if there is a need.
A comprehensive review of the impact of VR for
people with a range of conditions concluded that there
is moderate evidence that the use of a case management
approach is effective for occupational outcomes [65],
although controlled evaluations (a more robust method
for measuring effectiveness) of the impact of these interventions were rare and none focused on cancer survivors.
A recent controlled before-and-after comparison of a case
management intervention for staff in two English hospital
trusts found that the proportion of 4-week absences that
continued beyond 8 weeks fell from 51.7% to 45.9% in 2
years in the hospital trust receiving the intervention
whereas there was an increase from 51.2% to 56.1% in the
hospital trust not receiving the intervention – a difference
in change of 10.7% (95% CI, 1.5-20.0%) [67]. Thus, based
on this evidence there was reason to believe that a case
management approach might be appropriate for cancer
survivors. This RCT found that women with breast cancer
who were referred to a VR service using a case management approach reported 53.1 fewer days of sick leave over
the first 6 months post-surgery than those in the control
group, although the difference was not statistically
significant.
Several reasons may explain why we did not find statistically significant differences between the intervention
and control group. First, the study was underpowered;
an RCT with a larger sample is therefore required to
produce more definitive findings about effectiveness of
case management approaches. Second, interviews with
BCNs indicate that patients showing signs of anxiety
and distress were excluded from the trial. Mental health
difficulties have been associated with employment-related
outcomes; an observational study of 477 patients with
cancer found that 19% were occupationally stressed, which
increased their risk of early retirement (odds ratio 5.44)
[68]. A relatively healthy participant group may partially
explain why only two patients (28.6%) were referred to
other services for support. Thus, patients with the greatest
level of need may have been excluded from the study,
which meant that most participants did not require intensive case management. A third and related factor is that
VR staff did not perceive the work as case management
because the intervention was considered light touch. Most
participants received support over the telephone about
work-related issues. This type of support, however, is
similar to that provided by other interventions with a
work-related component; a review of 19 interventions, 3
of which focussed primarily on improving work outcomes,
found that the most frequently reported work-directed
component consisted of encouragement, education or
advice about work or work-related subjects (68%) [36]. In
contrast, a recent before-and-after evaluation of a VR
intervention for patients with brain tumours reported that
patients received 11 hourly sessions over 5 months that
included a broad array of assessment and supportive interventions tailored to individuals’ needs and found a positive
impact [69]. Finally, the VR service was not specifically
designed to support people with cancer and staff requested
further formal training to support cancer survivors.
Frequently identified problems following cancer that
affect work are fatigue, tiredness and physical limitations
[2,7,70], and greater understanding of cancer patients
issues, needs and concerns may improve the effectiveness
of VR interventions.
Conclusions
Paid employment is important for a range of reasons
including financial security and mental well-being. VR to
assist breast cancer patients in the return to work
process is therefore an important component of cancer
survivorship plans. While there are likely to be health
policy and clinical contextual factors influencing study
design, conducting a pragmatic trial of effectiveness of a VR
intervention among cancer survivors is both feasible and
acceptable but more research about the exact components
of a VR intervention and choice of outcomes to measure
effectiveness is required.
