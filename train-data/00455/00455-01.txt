Summary
Background Serum CA125 concentration often rises several months before clinical or symptomatic relapse in women
with ovarian cancer. In the MRC OV05/EORTC 55955 collaborative trial, we aimed to establish the benefi ts of early
treatment on the basis of increased CA125 concentrations compared with delayed treatment on the basis of
clinical recurrence.
Methods Women with ovarian cancer in complete remission after fi rst-line platinum-based chemotherapy and a
normal CA125 concentration were registered for this randomised controlled trial. Clinical examination and CA125
measurement were done every 3 months. Patients and investigators were masked to CA125 results, which were
monitored by coordinating centres. If CA125 concentration exceeded twice the upper limit of normal, patients were
randomly assigned (1:1) by minimisation to early or delayed chemotherapy. Patients and clinical sites were informed of
allocation to early treatment, and treatment was started as soon as possible within 28 days of the increased CA125
measurement. Patients assigned to delayed treatment continued masked CA125 measurements, with treatment
commencing at clinical or symptomatic relapse. All patients were treated according to standard local practice. The
primary outcome was overall survival. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered, ISRCTN87786644.
Findings 1442 patients were registered for the trial, of whom 529 were randomly assigned to treatment groups and were
included in our analysis (265 early, 264 delayed). With a median follow-up of 56·9 months (IQR 37·4–81·8) from
randomisation and 370 deaths (186 early, 184 delayed), there was no evidence of a diff erence in overall survival between
early and delayed treatment (HR 0·98, 95% CI 0·80–1·20, p=0·85). Median survival from randomisation was 25·7 months
(95% CI 23·0–27·9) for patients on early treatment and 27·1 months (22·8–30·9) for those on delayed treatment.
Interpretation Our fi ndings showed no evidence of a survival benefi t with early treatment of relapse on the basis of a
raised CA125 concentration alone, and therefore the value of routine measurement of CA125 in the follow-up of
patients with ovarian cancer who attain a complete response after fi rst-line treatment is not proven.

Introduction
Early detection and treatment of cancer is commonly
believed to improve outcomes for patients. This idea is
the main rationale for regular follow-up after completion
of cancer treatment. However, data from the few
randomised studies that have investigated timing of
therapy1–5 are confl icting with respect to early treatment
for patients presenting with metastatic disease, and no
randomised trials have adequately addressed timing of
treatment for recurrent cancer.6,7
The serum tumour marker CA125 is used for initial
diagnosis and monitoring of response to chemotherapy
for epithelial ovarian cancer. Regular measurement
during follow-up is one of the best examples in oncology
of a test that can detect recurrence of cancer months
before symptoms or signs occur.8–12 Although most
women can expect a good response and improved
survival after chemotherapy for their fi rst recurrence,13
this treatment is rarely curative and has side-eff ects.
Concerns about CA125 testing and the implications of
raised CA125 concentration are major sources
of anxiety.
A woman with a rising CA125 concentration, who
remains well, without symptoms or signs of recurrent
disease, presents a major management dilemma.14
Because of this issue, practice varies widely in terms of
whether or not regular CA125 measurements are done
and in the timing of initiation of second-line
chemotherapy. We therefore undertook a randomised
trial with the aim of establishing the benefi ts of early
treatment on the basis of increased serum CA125
concentrations compared with delayed treatment on the
basis of clinical recurrence.
Methods
Trial design and patients
The British Medical Research Council (MRC) OV05 and
European Organisation for Research and Treatment of
Cancer (EORTC) 55955 trials were collaborative trials
undertaken with a joint trial management group and
monitored by a single independent data monitoring
committee. All statistical analyses were done at the MRC
Clinical Trials Unit. Ethics approval for MRC OV05 was
obtained from the London multicentre research ethics

committee and at each site. EORTC 55955 received local
ethics approval at each site.
Women with histologically confi rmed epithelial ovarian,
fallopian tube, or serous primary peritoneal cancer (based
on local pathology) in complete clinical remission after
completion of fi rst-line platinum-based chemotherapy
with a normal CA125 concentration were eligible for trial
registration. Written informed consent was obtained.
Procedures
After registration, trial visits occurred every 3 months
and included physical and gynaecological examinations,
ultrasound and radiological examinations according to
local practice, quality of life assessment, and a CA125
blood test. CA125 testing was done in local laboratories
that agreed to mask results to clinicians and patients,
participate in local quality assurance schemes, and send
results to coordinating centres. If CA125 concentration
increased to twice the site upper limit of normal, patients
were randomly assigned to early treatment, with the
clinical site notifi ed of the randomisation, or to delayed
treatment. Patients were informed of allocation to early
treatment, and treatment was started as soon as possible
within 28 days after an unmasked confi rmatory CA125
concentration twice the upper limit of normal. If a
woman was assigned to delayed treatment, the site was
not notifi ed, and masked follow-up continued until
clinical recurrence was detected and delayed treatment
started. Quality of life was assessed before each
chemotherapy cycle until the end of third-line treatment
with the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire.15 Choice of
chemotherapy was according to standard local practice.
Randomisation and masking
Randomisation to early or delayed treatment groups
(1:1 ratio) was done independently by each coordinating
centre. The method of minimisation was used with the
stratifi cation factors: International Federation of
Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage (I vs II vs III vs
IV); fi rst-line chemotherapy (single agent platinum vs
platinum combination without taxane vs platinumtaxane combination vs other); time from completion of
fi rst-line chemotherapy to raised CA125 concentration
(<6 vs 6–11 vs 12–24 vs >24 months); age (MRC OV05 at
randomisation, EORTC 55955 at registration; <30 vs
30–55 vs 56–65 vs >65 years); and site. CA125 results
were masked to sites and patients until randomisation
to early treatment or until clinical recurrence for those
in the delayed treatment group.
Statistical analysis
The primary outcome measure was overall survival
calculated from date of randomisation to date of last
follow-up or death from any cause. At the time of analysis,
survivors were censored at the date they were last known
to be alive. Secondary outcomes were: time to secondline chemotherapy (calculated from date of randomisation
to date of initiation of second-line chemotherapy, women
who did not receive second-line chemotherapy were
censored at the date of last contact); time to third-line
treatment or death (calculated from date of randomisation
to date of starting third-line treatment or death, whichever
occurred fi rst, survivors without treatment censored at
the last contact); quality of life with duration of good
quality of life in the global health score (defi ned as
improved or no more than a 10% decrease from

prerandomisation score); and time of fi rst global healthrelated deterioration (defi ned as more than 10% decrease
from prerandomisation score or death).
The trial was initially designed to detect a 10%
improvement in 2-year overall survival from 5% delayed
treatment to 15% early treatment. However, in 2002 (with
191 women randomly assigned to treatment groups) the
2-year overall survival of women assigned to delayed
treatment was estimated to be closer to 40%. The
independent data monitoring committee (without
reference to outcome data from the early treatment
group) recommended that sample-size estimations were
revised to give a range of registrations and randomisations
required to give suffi cient power. Revised estimates
(continuing to target a 10–15% absolute improvement),
which included a range of 2-year survival estimates in the
delayed treatment group from 40% to 50%, required
530–1400 registrations and 350–650 randomisations and
were included in a protocol amendment. After the trial
closed to registrations in August, 2005, with 1442 registered
women, the randomisation rate fell. In February, 2007,
when the study had been open for longer than 10 years
and 510 patients had been randomly assigned to treatment
groups, the trial management group carefully considered
trial closure options. At this time the estimated 2-year
overall survival in the delayed-treatment group was 54%.
To detect a 10% absolute improvement with 5%
signifi cance level and 85% power, 345 events were
needed. This target was assessed as achievable and was
agreed by the trial management group as the target
number of events for the primary analysis. All women
were followed up until randomisation or an event that
precluded randomisation and for survival. Clinical followup with masked CA125 measurements continued for
6 months after close of randomisation.
Stata (version 10.1) was used for all analyses. The
primary analysis was the log-rank test, stratifi ed by
MRC versus EORTC, applied to compare the KaplanMeier survival curves for all time-to-event outcome
measures. Cox model sensitivity analyses estimating
the treatment eff ect and adjusting for stratifi cation and
prognostic factors were done for overall survival. All
women were included in the analysis, which was by
intention to treat. All p values are two-sided. To adjust
for imbalances in follow-up between the two groups,
curtailing was used for main analyses of time-to-event
outcome measures, by censoring data at 5 years from
randomisation for MRC OV05 and 3 years for EORTC
55955. Additional sensitivity analyses were done for
uncurtailed data.
This study is registered, ISRCTN87786644.
Role of the funding source
The MRC and EORTC reviewed and approved the
study design. The study sponsors, the MRC for OV05
and EORTC for 55955, had no role in the conduct of the
study or in writing of this report. The writing
committee had full access to all study data and had
responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.

1442 women registered (1144 MRC, 298 EORTC; fi gure 1).
Women were registered from 59 centres across the UK,
Spain, Norway, the Netherlands, France, Russia, Belgium,
Ireland, Austria, and South Africa. Baseline characteristics
of registered women are shown in the webappendix. All
women had confi rmation of remission (normal CA125
concentration and no evidence of disease after surgery and
fi rst-line chemotherapy, radiologically confi rmed in all but
two patients), 94% (1362 women) within 3 months before
registration. Median time from completion of fi rst-line
chemotherapy to registration was 1·7 months (IQR 1·0–
3·2), with 1066 (74%) women registered within 3 months.
492 registered women had an event during follow-up that
excluded them from randomisation (fi gure 1). When
randomisation closed (March 31, 2008), 421 (29%) registered
women were still in clinical remission with a normal CA125
concentration and were eligible for randomisation. Median
survival from end of fi rst-line chemotherapy to last followup or death for all women registered in the trial was
70·8 months (95% CI 64·1–78·0).
Between Feb 26, 1997, and March 31, 2008, 529 women
were randomly assigned to treatment groups (37% of
those registered; 265 to early and 264 to delayed
chemotherapy). The randomised treatment groups were
well balanced for baseline characteristics at registration
(table 1). The median time from registration to
randomisation was 9·1 months (IQR 5·5–18·2). Time
from completion of fi rst-line chemotherapy to increase
of CA125 concentration to twice the upper limit of
normal was well balanced between the groups; 104 (20%)
women had a rise within 6 months after fi rst-line
chemotherapy, 176 (33%) between 6 and 12 months, and
240 (45%) after 12 or more months. Randomisation was
within 28 days of the date of the CA125 concentration
rising to twice the upper limit of normal for 483 (91%)
participants (webappendix).
When data were locked for the primary analysis on
Feb 16, 2009, with a median follow-up of 56·9 months
(IQR 37·4–81·8) from randomisation, 370 (70%) women
assigned to treatment groups had died (186 early,
184 delayed treatment). Almost all deaths were disease
related (97% early, 96% delayed; table 2). There was no
evidence of a diff erence in overall survival (fi gure 2;
hazard ratio [HR] 0·98, 95% CI 0·80–1·20; p=0·85; HR <1
in favour of delayed treatment group; table 3). Median
survival from randomisation was 25·7 months (95% CI
23·0–27·9) in patients receiving early treatment and
27·1 months (22·8–30·9) in those receiving delayed.
2-year survival was 53·7% in patients allocated early
treatment and 54·7% in those receiving delayed
treatment—a diff erence (delayed minus early) at 2 years
of 0·7% (95% CI for diff erence –5·8 to 7·6). Cox models
adjusted for stratifi cation and prognostic factors (table 3)
did not change the overall result, showing the unadjusted
results to be robust. Censored and uncensored analyses
also gave the same result (table 3).
Women assigned to early treatment started
chemotherapy 4·8 months (95% CI 3·6–5·3) earlier than
those allocated delayed treatment (fi gure 2), 179 (68%)
within 1 month from randomisation, and 241 (91%)
within 3 months. Type of second-line chemotherapy
regimen was well balanced—a platinum-taxane
combination was administered to 91 (34%) women
assigned to early treatment and 102 (39%) of those
assigned delayed (a diff erence of 11 women), and single
agent platinum to 78 (29%) of those receiving early
treatment and 67 (25%) of those allocated delayed
(fi gure 1). A higher proportion of women in the early
treatment group (169, 64%) received six or more
chemotherapy cycles than in the delayed treatment group
(134, 51%). 21 women assigned early treatment and
14 delayed treatment underwent secondary surgery. More
women assigned to delayed treatment (31, 12%) had no
second-line chemotherapy (compared with only 11 [4%]
in the early treatment group), in seven (3%) patients
because they had not clinically relapsed at the time of
data locking. Details of other reasons why second-line
chemotherapy was not received are shown in fi gure 1.
After second-line chemotherapy, 177 women (67%)
assigned to early and 142 women (54%) to delayed
treatment started third-line treatment (table 2)—a
diff erence of 13% (95% CI for diff erence 4·7–21·3). The
median time from randomisation to third-line treatment
or death was 12·5 months (95% CI 11·4–13·3) in the
early-treatment group and 17·1 months (15·6–19·1) in
the delayed-treatment group, showing that women
assigned to early treatment needed further treatment for
clinical progression on average 4·6 months (95% CI
4·2–5·8) earlier than those assigned to delayed (fi gure 2,
table 3; HR 0·69, 95% CI 0·57–0·83; p=0·0001).

There was no evidence of treatment interactions in
exploratory analyses to establish whether the eff ect of
early compared with delayed treatment varied in
subgroups of women defi ned by type of fi rst-line
chemotherapy (single agent platinum vs platinum-taxane
combination; p value for interaction=0·07), age (30–55 vs
56–65 vs >65 years; p=0·65), FIGO stage (p=0·20), and
WHO performance status (0 vs 1; p=0·51; fi gure 3). There
was no detectable diff erence in treatment eff ect before
and after June, 2003, after the shift to platinum-taxane
combinations as second-line chemotherapy (p=0·90).
The eff ect of early compared with delayed treatment did
not diff er between women who were randomly assigned
to treatment groups soon after completion of fi rst-line
treatment compared with later (<6 vs 6–11 vs 12–24 vs

randomisation; p=0·34). All treatment interaction
analyses were prespecifi ed in the statistical analysis plan,

with the exception of timing of second-line treatment
and time from fi rst-line treatment to randomisation,
which were ad hoc.
Median time spent with good global health score was
7·2 months (95% CI 5·3–9·3) for women assigned to
early and 9·2 months (6·4–10·5) for those assigned to
delayed treatment (fi gure 2). Time from randomisation to
fi rst deterioration in global health score or death (fi gure 2)
was shorter (median 3·2 months, 95% CI 2·4–4·3) in the
early group compared with delayed (5·8 months, 4·4–8·5;
HR 0·71, 95% CI 0·58–0·88; p=0·002). Subgroup analyses
of individual components of the QLQ-C30 subscales
showed deterioration in score sooner in the early group
than in the delayed group for almost all subscales, and
there was evidence of signifi cant disadvantages for role,
emotional, social, and fatigue subscales (table 4) with early
treatment. Since the QLQ-C30 questionnaire asks about
symptoms only in the previous week, and the forms were
completed just before each course of chemotherapy, this
method could underestimate any reduction in quality of
life due to chemotherapy.
Discussion
Our results challenge the widespread belief that earlier
treatment for recurrent cancer must be better, particularly
for cancers for which recurrent disease is disseminated
and curative options few. They provide no evidence that
early initiation of chemotherapy because of a rising CA125
concentration improves survival or quality of life compared
with delaying of chemotherapy until signs or symptoms of
recurrence for women with complete radiological and
biochemical remission after fi rst-line chemotherapy for
ovarian cancer. There are no other randomised controlled
trials addressing this question (see panel). With such a
large amount of information, 70% of patients having died,
a late eff ect of treatment is very unlikely. One explanation
for our fi ndings could be that the lead time between CA125
rise and clinical recurrence, particularly for rapidly
growing, possibly more chemosensitive tumours, might
be too short for early introduction of chemotherapy to
have a benefi cial eff ect. However, we found no evidence
that early chemotherapy had greater eff ect in those with a
short time from end of fi rst-line chemotherapy to
randomisation (fi gure 3).
The median lead time between randomisation with
CA125 rise and second-line chemotherapy for clinical
recurrence was 4·8 months. If more recently proposed
criteria of an early signal of CA125 recurrence were used19
the proportion of patients with a rise in CA125 might have
been higher, more patients might have been randomised,
with those starting chemotherapy in the early-treatment
group having a greater lead time. The lead time might
also have been greater if CA125 had been measured more
frequently. If we had seen any benefi t from earlier
treatment, one could anticipate that a longer lead time
could give greater benefi ts. However, since there was no
evidence that earlier chemotherapy resulted in survival or
quality of life benefi t, increasing of the lead time would
result in more women living with the anxiety associated
with an increased CA125 concentration for longer.
First-line chemotherapy had to be platinum-based, but
because the type of chemotherapy might vary according
to timing of relapse and previous experience with
diff erent treatments (eg, neuropathy), choice of secondline regimen was left to the treating clinician. There was
a small diff erence in chemotherapy regimens given for
relapse; 34% of those in the early-treatment group
received platinum-taxane combination therapy at relapse,
compared with 39% of those receiving delayed treatment.
This small diff erence (11 patients), which could favour
delayed treatment, might have arisen as a result of the

change to combination therapy due to the positive results
of the ICON4/OVAR trial,13 with oncologists wishing to
treat symptomatic patients more aggressively. However,
this small diff erence is unlikely to account for the absence
of benefi t from early treatment, and there was no
diff erence in the eff ect of treatment before and after
2003, when ICON4/OVAR was published and clinical
practice changed.13 There were other diff erences in
chemotherapy administered that might favour early
treatment, including more second-line chemotherapy,
more second-line chemotherapy cycles, and more thirdline treatments.
We have not presented adverse events from individual
chemotherapy drugs and regimens, since specifi c
chemotherapy regimens were not mandated. Thus,
toxic eff ects were not included as a secondary outcome
measure. However, the safety of individual participants
in the trial was monitored. Serious adverse events and
adverse events of all regimens and cause of death were
reviewed by the independent data monitoring
committee at each of their meetings, and no safety
concerns were identifi ed.
The extent of initial surgery was not recorded and was
not used as a stratifi cation factor. We were aware of the
importance of residual disease as a prognostic factor for
outcome after fi rst-line therapy, but felt that accurate
surgical data would be diffi cult to obtain for all patients.
We assumed that, since women who entered this trial
were in clinical and radiological remission with a normal
CA125 concentration, a good prognostic group had been
selected and other prognostic factors derived from earlier
in patients’ cancer histories would be less important.
Furthermore, with randomisation of a large number of
patients, important prognostic factors (both known and
currently unknown) should be equally distributed
between the randomised groups. Recent analysis of a
trial in which extent of residual disease was an inclusion
criterion has however shown that this factor remains
signifi cant after fi rst-line therapy.20 We are unable to
exclude an imbalance in the randomised groups with
respect to extent of residual disease as an explanation for
our fi ndings, but suggest that this eff ect is unlikely.
There was no evidence for a benefi t of early treatment
in the small group of women presenting with recurrent
FIGO stage I or II ovarian cancer after adjuvant
chemotherapy. This result is perhaps not surprising,
since outcomes after recurrence are similar for women
with early and advanced initial disease.20 For other
cancers, cure is sometimes achieved with surgery alone
or combined with adjuvant therapy, but isolated
recurrence is rare with ovarian cancer.16,21,22 Patients who
have complete resection of recurrent ovarian cancer have
been shown in observational studies to have better
survival than those with incomplete resection.21,22
Early detection of relapse by CA125 monitoring could
be said to lead to more patients being diagnosed at relapse
with completely resectable disease and having successful
surgery, and thus longer survival. However, the ability to
completely resect recurrent tumour could be dependent
on the biology of the tumour, and not time of detection.
Contrary to expectations, we have shown that earlier
chemotherapy had no survival benefi t. Therefore,
randomised trials showing a benefi t from surgery for
relapsed disease are essential before CA125 follow-up is
routinely recommended to trigger radiological detection
of relapse amenable to surgical treatment.
For the fi rst time women can be given evidence-based
advice and can make informed choices about follow-up.
Women should be informed that there is no evidence of

Systematic review
A Cochrane systematic review protocol16 evaluating follow-up
strategies in ovarian cancer after fi rst-line treatment was
assessed as up to date as of July, 2008. We therefore did
systematic searches repeating the search strategies16 for
randomised controlled trials from January, 2008, to date
using Embase,17 Medline, and The Cochrane Central Register
of Controlled Trials18 including search terms for ovarian
cancer, follow-up, and CA125. Searches returned
134 potentially relevant articles; however, no randomised
controlled trials addressing a similar question to MRC OV05/
EORTC 55955 were found.
Interpretation
MRC OV05/EORTC 55955 is the only randomised controlled
trial designed to investigate the timing of relapsed treatment
for ovarian cancer on the basis of CA125 concentration.

a benefi t from early treatment on the basis of rising
CA125 concentration, and no deterioration in quality of
life by delaying chemotherapy. If CA125 concentration
rises during follow-up, chemotherapy can be safely
delayed until symptoms or signs of tumour recurrence
develop. Regular CA125 monitoring might remain a
requirement in clinical trials, but women might wish
not to be told their results. Some women, despite these
trial results, might choose to continue regular CA125
monitoring as an aid to planning their life. However,
the results of this trial suggest that they can opt to forgo
routine CA125 monitoring if their disease is in complete
remission after fi rst-line treatment, and be reassured
that if they are worried or develop any signs suspicious
of tumour relapse they will have rapid access to
CA125 measurement.
