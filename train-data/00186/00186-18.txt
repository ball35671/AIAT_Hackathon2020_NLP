Purpose: To evaluate the efficacy of two cervical block protocols for pain management during
hysteroscopic removal of intrauterine polyps and myomas using the MyoSure® device.
Patients and methods: This was a randomized, comparative treatment trial conducted by
five private Obstetrics and Gynecology practices in the USA. Forty premenopausal women
aged 18 years and older were randomized to receive either a combination para/intracervical
block protocol of 37 cc local anesthetic administered at six injections sites in association with
the application of topic 1% lidocaine gel, or an intracervical block protocol of 22 cc local anesthetic administered at three injections sites without topical anesthetic, for pain management
during hysteroscopic removal of intrauterine polyps and/or a single type 0 or type 1 submucosal
myoma #3 cm. The main outcomes were a composite measure of procedure-related pain and
pain during the postoperative recovery period, assessed by the Wong-Baker Faces Rating Scale
(0= no pain to 10= maximum pain). The lesion characteristics, procedure time, and adverse
events were summarized.
Results: A total of 17 polyps and eight myomas were removed in the para/intracervical
block group, with diameters of 1.3±0.5 cm and 1.8±0.8 cm, respectively. In the intracervical
block group, 25 polyps with a mean diameter of 1.2±0.7 cm and 7 myomas with a mean diameter of 1.9±0.9 cm were removed. The mean tissue resection time was 1.2±2.0 minutes and
1.2±1.4 minutes for the para/intracervical and intracervical block groups, respectively. The mean
composite procedure-related pain score was low for both cervical block protocols, 1.3±1.4 in the
para/intracervical block group vs 2.1±1.5 in the intracervical block group. During the postoperative recovery period, the mean pain scores were 0.3±0.7 vs 1.2±1.7 for the para/intracervical and
intracervical block groups, respectively. There were no serious adverse events.
Conclusion: The MyoSure procedure for removal of polyps and myomas was well tolerated, with
low pain scores reported for both the para/intracervical and intracervical block protocols.

Introduction
Hysteroscopic loop resection has been a mainstay of treatment for the removal of
intrauterine pathology, including polyps and myomas. Traditionally, this procedure
has been performed in the operating room, with the patient under general anesthesia,
primarily due to the use of electrocautery, nonionic distension media, and the need for
cervical dilation.1,2 While effective, this technique has limitations, including distension
media issues, the need for frequent removal and reinsertion of the hysteroscope to
remove resected tissue, and the risk of uterine perforation. Loop resection must also
be performed with intravenous (IV) sedation or general anesthesia.1,2

A newer technique, hysteroscopic morcellation, has been
shown to be safe and effective for removing intrauterine polyps and myomas.1−3
 This technique offers several advantages
over loop resection, including decreased procedure time,
decreased number of instrument removals and reinsertions,
a faster learning curve for physicians, and a more rapid
recovery.1−4
 However, when first introduced, the size of
hysteroscopic morcellators also required that the procedure
be performed in a surgical setting with the use of IV sedation
or general anesthesia. Conversely, other hysteroscopic procedures can be performed with local anesthesia, and several
studies have shown that paracervical blocks are associated
with effective pain management and high rates of patient
satisfaction during these procedures.5−8
Recent improvements in technology, including smaller
sized instruments, indicate that hysteroscopic morcellation
can be performed using local anesthesia for pain management, in a similar manner to other hysteroscopic procedures.
However, little is known about the use of different cervical
block protocols without IV sedation for pain management
during hysteroscopic morcellation. Therefore, the goal of
this study was to compare the efficacy of two cervical block
protocols for pain management during hysteroscopic removal
of intrauterine polyps and myomas.
Materials and methods
This randomized comparative trial9
 examined the efficacy of
two cervical block protocols for pain management during the
hysteroscopic removal of intrauterine polyps and myomas.
The study was conducted at five sites in the USA, with five
investigators (one per site), and included a total of 40 subjects. Three investigators performed a total of 20 procedures
in their respective offices and two investigators performed
a total of 20 procedures at ambulatory surgical centers. The
same protocol was followed at all sites.
Premenopausal women aged 18 years or older with
intrauterine polyps and/or a single type 0 or type 1 submucosal myoma #3 cm were eligible to participate. An
indication for polypectomy or myomectomy for benign
pathology was determined by transvaginal ultrasound or
saline-infused sonogram within 60 days of the procedure.
A negative pregnancy test within 48 hours of the procedure
and willingness to use reliable birth control for the next
30 days were required. The exclusion criteria included
having a type 2 myoma; known or suspected endometrial
or other cancers; contraindication or allergy to local anesthetic or oral medications specified in the study protocol;
prior uterine artery embolization or any other uterine
artery occlusion procedure; an intrauterine device; active
pelvic infection; known or suspected hemostatic disorder;
use of anticoagulant or antiplatelet medications; a history of chronic narcotics use; or other serious medical
conditions.
The subjects were recruited between December 2009 and
July 2010 from the investigators’ clinical practices and by
radio advertisement. Enrollment was offered to all patients
meeting the eligibility criteria, and the first 40 patients
who agreed to participate were enrolled. The protocol
was approved by the Quorum Institutional Review Board
(Seattle, WA, USA) and the Wayne State University Institutional Review Board (Detroit, MI, US, USA). All subjects
provided written, informed consent and received compensation for their participation.
The subjects were randomized on the day of treatment
to either a combination para/intracervical block group
or an intracervical block group in a 1:1 ratio, using a
computer-generated randomization scheme. The specific
randomization assignment was provided to sites using
sealed, sequentially numbered opaque envelopes,9
 which
were opened in succession on the day of the treatment
procedure. The subjects were blinded to the group assignment because they were not told how many injections either
group would be receiving.
Anesthetic protocol
All subjects received the same preoperative analgesic/anesthetic treatment prior to the administration of the cervical
block. The subjects were asked to take 800 mg of ibuprofen
the night before the procedure. One hour prior to the procedure, the subjects received 10 mg of diazepam and 10 mg of
hydrocodone/acetaminophen, followed by an intramuscular
injection of 30 mg keterolac and 0.4% atropine. Both cervical blocks were a 1:1 mixture of 1% lidocaine and 0.25%
bupivicaine.
Para/intracervical block protocol
The para/intracervical block group received a total of 37 cc
of anesthetic, administered at six injections sites: 2 cc
superficially at 12:00; 10 cc at 3:00; and 10 cc at 9:00, in the
cervical vaginal junction, superficially through the mucosa
(approximately 0.5 cm deep); 5 cc at 4:00; 5 cc at 8:00,
approximately 1 to 2 cm deep, halfway between the canal
and the lateral edge of the cervix; and 5 cc submucosally
at 6:00, between the uterosacral ligaments, approximately
0.5 cm below the cervical vaginal junction (Figure 1). Topical
1% lidocaine gel was applied to the cervix, with a set time

Comparisons of cervical block protocols for hysteroscopic tissue removal
of 2 to 3 minutes prior to the injection of anesthetic, for the
para/intracervical block group only.
Intracervical block protocol
The intracervical block group received a total of 22 cc of
anesthetic administered at three injections sites: 2 cc superficially at 12:00; 10 cc at 4:00; and 10 cc at 8:00, approximately
1 to 2 cm deep (Figure 2).
The MyoSure procedure
All procedures were performed using the MyoSure® Tissue
Removal System (Hologic, Inc, Bedford, MA, USA). The
MyoSure system is a suction-based, mechanical energy
system that removes intrauterine tissue, using a 2.5 mm cutting blade (which oscillates and reciprocates at speeds up
to 6,000 rpm) within a 3 mm outer tube with a side-facing
window (Figure 3).10 After a 10-minute induction period for
the anesthetic, the cervix was dilated using a 6 French Hegar
dilator, and the MyoSure device was introduced into the
uterus through a 6.25 mm offset lens, 0°, custom-designed
hysteroscope. Sterile saline solution was used for distension.
The target lesions were resected under direct visualization
and suctioned from the cavity into a collection canister.

The investigators or study personnel communicated the
steps of the procedure to the subjects as they occurred. The
type of lesion, size, location, and the estimated percent
volume removed were assessed by the investigators. All the
resected tissue was sent for pathological evaluation. Rescue
anesthesia was available in the event that the cervical block
proved inadequate.
Outcome measures
The main outcome was a composite score for procedure-related
pain, which incorporated individual pain scores during: 1) the
cervical block injection; 2) cervical dilation; 3) uterine distention; and 4) the tissue resection. The procedure-related pain
for each stage of the procedure was assessed immediately
after the entire procedure was complete, prior to transfer to the
recovery room, using the Wong-Baker Faces Rating Scale.11
This scale provides a score ranging from 0, indicating “no
pain,” to 10, indicating “maximum pain.” Pain during the
postoperative recovery period prior to return home was a
secondary outcome. The exploratory outcomes included the
physician and subject satisfaction with the cervical block,
ranging from “very dissatisfied” to “very satisfied”.
The adverse events that occurred during the procedure
or postoperative recovery period were recorded. Follow up
was done by telephone at 48 hours, and at 7 and 30 days
postprocedure to determine the resolution of any operative
adverse events and whether adverse events occurred after
the return home.
Statistical analysis
A total sample size of 40 subjects for the pooled sites was
estimated to provide 86% power to detect a mean difference
of 1.0 in procedure-related pain. Because no previous studies
have examined pain with different types of cervical blocks
during hysteroscopic morcellation, the sample size was estimated based on reported pain scores when using local anesthetic for cervical dilation and uterine dilation.12 This study
was not powered to detect a difference in serious adverse
events, due to the low incidence of these events associated
with hysteroscopic morcellation.3,13 All statistical analyses
were performed using a modified intent-to-treat model. This
included subjects who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria
and did not have a major protocol deviation. The primary
outcome of procedure-related pain and the secondary outcome of postprocedure recovery pain were analyzed using a
one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), with the factors of
cervical block group and investigator. All of the statistical
analysis was performed using SAS® software version 9.1
(SAS Institute Inc, Carey, NC, USA). P-values , 0.05 were
considered significant.
Results
Of the 40 subjects who were enrolled in the study, 19 were
randomized to the combination para/intracervical block group
and 21 were randomized to the intracervical block group. All
randomized subjects underwent the procedure; however, two
subjects failed to meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria, in
one case, this was because of narcotics use and in the other,
because of a Type 2 myoma (<50% in the uterine cavity);
and one subject had a major protocol deviation – in this case,
the investigator converted to a loop resection procedure, due
to a vascularized type I myoma located within the uterine
fundus. As a result, the final analysis included 17 subjects
in the para/intracervical block group and 20 subjects in the
intracervical block group.
There were no significant differences in the baseline
demographic characteristics, parity, or the gynecological
history between the groups (Table 1). There were also no
significant differences in the combined number of polyps
and myomas (total lesions), the mean size of the polyps and
myomas, or in the intrauterine location of lesions between the
groups (Table 2). The majority of subjects in both groups had
one lesion, 70.5% in the para/intracervical group and 55.0%
in the intracervical group (Table 2). It was intraoperatively

Comparisons of cervical block protocols for hysteroscopic tissue removal
estimated that 95.5%±15.1% and 98.1%±9.6% of polyp
volume was removed in the para/intracervical and intracervical block groups, respectively. The mean myoma volume
removed was estimated to be 90.6%±22.8% in the para/
intracervical block group and 95.0%±16.8% in the intracervical block group. The mean procedure time from the
injection of the cervical block to the completion of tissue
removal was 29.2±10.0 minutes for the para/intracervical
block group and 28.2±7.5 minutes for the intracervical block
group. The tissue resection time was 1.2±2.0 minutes and was
1.2±1.4 minutes for the para/intracervical and intracervical
block groups, respectively.
The composite procedure-related pain score was low in
both groups. However, there was a statistically significant
difference in pain score between the para/intracervical block
group and the intracervical block group, 1.3±1.4 vs 2.1±1.5,
respectively (P,0.05) (Table 3). The pain during the tissue resection phase of the procedure and the postprocedure
recovery pain prior to return home were also lower in the para/
intracervical block group compared with the intracervical
block group (Table 3). Finally, there was a trend towards lower
pain during uterine distension in the para/intracervical block
group as compared with the intracervical block group.
All the investigators (100%) reported being “very
satisfied” with the para/intracervical block performance,
and 95.0% reported being “very satisfied” with the
intracervical block. In one case, an investigator reported
being “somewhat dissatisfied” with the intracervical block.
The subjects in the para/intracervical and intracervical block
groups were “very satisfied” with pain management in 88.2%
and 85.9% of cases, respectively. The remainder of subjects
in both groups were “somewhat satisfied” with the pain
management during the procedure.
No serious adverse events occurred. Mild adverse events
were reported, including endometritis (three events), fungal
infection (one event), and dysmenorrhea (one event). In one
case, a previously placed nickel titanium tubal occlusion
implant (for sterilization) was removed when the MyoSure
device was removed. All adverse events resolved completely
without sequelae. No signs of local anesthetic toxicity, fluid
intravasation, significant bleeding, or uterine perforations
occurred during the study. No subjects required rescue
anesthesia during the procedure.
Discussion
This study demonstrates that the procedure-related pain
during hysteroscopic morcellation of intrauterine polyps
and myomas was mild when either a combination para/
intracervical or intracervical block was used. Pain during
the recovery period was also minimal. Comparative analysis
indicated that the para/intracervical block protocol was associated with lower pain compared with an intracervical block
However, it is not known whether this difference is clinically
significant, nor is it known which particular difference(s)
between the pain management protocols contributed to this
difference. These results also showed that the majority of
physicians and subjects were very satisfied with pain management with either cervical block protocol.
Until recently, the hysteroscopic removal of polyps and
myomas has been done by loop resection and required the

use of IV sedation or general anesthesia. To our knowledge,
this is the first study examining the effect of different cervical blocks on pain management during the hysteroscopic
morcellation of intrauterine polyps and myomas. Al-Sunaidi
and Tulandi compared the effects of a combination para/
intracervical block with a lower-dose intracervical block for
pain management during hysteroscopy, but surgery was not
performed in that study.14 Consistent with our results, the
investigators reported that both the para/intracervical and
the intracervical blocks were well tolerated and associated
with mild pain during the procedure. Also, as noted in our
study, the combined para/intracervical block was associated
with less pain during the procedure and during the recovery
period compared with the intracervical block.
A number of studies compared the effects of a paracervical
block only (not combined with intracervical block) with an
intracervical block for pain during various gynecologic procedures.12 However, it is difficult to compare the results of these
studies to ours, given the significant protocol differences.
While both groups reported only mild pain during the
procedure and recovery, the lower pain seen in the para/
intracervical block group compared with the intracervical
block group may be attributed to several factors. Only the
para/intracervical group received a topical lidocaine gel
applied to the cervix before injection of the local anesthetic,
which may have contributed to pain management. The para/
intracervical block group also received a larger dose of anesthetic, 37 cc vs 22 cc, and a greater number of injections,
six vs three, compared with the intracervical block group.
This may have resulted in greater tissue area dispersion and
different effects on innervation.
No significant adverse events occurred during this study.
However, the removal of a tubal occlusion implant for sterilization in one subject resulted in a revision to the MyoSure
instructions for use. The instructions for use currently indicate
that users should exercise extreme caution when resecting tissue in patients who have implants that extend into the uterine
cavity and that users do not use the MyoSure tissue removal
device to resect tissue that is adjacent to an implant.10
This study had some limitations. The sample size was
small, and larger studies are needed to compare different
cervical block protocols and to identify best practices for
pain management during the hysteroscopic removal of intrauterine pathology. Additionally, the Wong-Baker scale can
force clustering around predefined values, and this potentially
contributed to the relatively small difference in pain scores
reported in this study. The results may have been subject to
recall bias because the procedure-related pain was recorded
during the recovery period. However, steps were taken to
decrease any potential timing effects, including the clear
communication of the procedure phases as they occurred.
Conclusion
This study demonstrated that pain during hysteroscopic
morcellation of intrauterine polyps and type 0 or 1 myomas
can be successfully managed with a local anesthetic. Two
different pain management protocols, a combination para/
intracervical block and an intracervical block, were both
associated with low pain scores for the hysteroscopic morcellation of uterine pathology.
