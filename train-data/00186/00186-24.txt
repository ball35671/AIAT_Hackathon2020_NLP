ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND: Office hysteroscopy with endometrial biopsy is usually the first
investigation for abnormal uterine bleeding and other uterine diseases. AIMS: To
evaluate the effect of oral drotaverine with mefenamic acid on pain perception during
hysteroscopy and endometrial biopsy and to compare it with that of paracervical
block using 1% lignocaine and with that of intravenous sedation using diazepam with
pentazocine. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Outpatient gynecological department and open
randomized trial. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred twenty women undergoing
hysteroscopy and endometrial biopsy were randomized into 3 groups. Group I received
tablet containing drotaverine hydrochloride (80 mg) + mefenamic acid (250 mg), group
II received lignocaine paracervically and group III received intravenous diazepam.
The intensity of pain during the procedure, 30 and 60 minutes later on visual analog
scale (VAS) was assessed. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Statistical analysis was performed
using Kruskal-Wallis test, with the Bonferroni correction, the t test, and the χ2 test.
RESULTS: Groups were similar in age, parity, vaginal birth or relevant medical history.
A statistically significant difference in pain scores was noted among the 3 groups
during the procedure (group I, 4.13± 1.28; group II, 5.93± 1.26; group III, 5.58± 1.51),
(P< 0.001); as well as 30 minutes later (group I, 1.78± 0.89; group II, 2.53± 0.81; group
III, 2.23± 0.94), (P< 0.001) and 60 minutes later (group I, 1.2± 0.46; group II, 1.98±
0.83; group III, 1.68± 0.75), (P< 0.001). VAS at different time intervals among the groups
was also statistically significant. No adverse effects were observed. CONCLUSIONS:
Oral drotaverine with mefenamic acid is effective in women undergoing hysteroscopy
and endometrial biopsy.

procedure was done under general or regional
anesthesia. Hysteroscopy with endometrial
biopsy under local anesthesia has gained
wider acceptance to avoid the risk of general
anesthesia.[1] Schoenfeld et al. and Kajve
et al. concluded that intravenous diazepam
and pentazocine is effective for pain relief
during minor gynecological operations and
tubal ligation.[2,3] A mixture of pentazocine
and diazepam was used by them for minor
gynecological procedures. Satisfactory
operating conditions were achieved in 98% of
the patients without any adverse reactions.
With the advent of locally acting better drugs,
many centers stopped using intravenous
sedation. Various methods of local anesthesia
have been studied to reduce the pain, and it
was suggested that paracervical block, topical
lignocaine, intracervical lignocaine may reduce
the pain, but the evidence is not strong.[4-6] It
could be due to inability of the paracervical
block to affect the sensitivity of the uterine
fundus. Similarly techniques involving dilatation
of cervix, like introduction of hysteroscope,
result in increased pain due to prostaglandin
release. Therefore, it seems logical to prime
the cervix and use prostaglandin synthesis
inhibitors prophylactically before the
procedure. Drotaverine hydrochloride, an
isoquinoline derivative, is a potent spasmolytic
which acts directly on the smooth muscles
by inhibiting phosphodiesterase activity
and is devoid of any anticholinergic side
effects.[7] Because of this antispasmodic
action, it is widely used in biliary and renal
colic, for augmentation of labor, dysmenorrhea
and before instrumental diagnostic
procedures.[7-10] Mefenamic acid, a nonsteroidal
anti-infl ammatory drug, inhibits cyclooxygenase
enzyme and exerts its anti-infl ammatory and
analgesic action by inhibiting prostaglandin
synthesis. It is widely used in gynecology to
treat dysmenorrhea and menorrhagia. By
virtue of two different mechanisms of action
due to different active ingredients, a fixeddose combination of drotaverine hydrochloride
with mefenamic acid would be expected
to reduce the discomfort of the procedure.
Both are well absorbed orally. Peak plasma
concentration of drotaverine is attained within
1 hour; and that of mefenamic acid, in 2 to
4 hours. The two molecules in a fi xed-dose
combination provide comprehensive pain
relief. Drotaverine allays the early-onset pain
and potentiates the sustained analgesic effect
of mefenamic acid. As the special property
of fi xed dose combination having synergistic
effects allows achieving relief in early-onset
pain by drotaverine and sustained analgesic
effect by mefenamic acid, we hypothesized
that oral tablet containing drotaverine and
mefenamic acid will be effective in relieving
pain during hysteroscopy and endometrial
biopsy, cost effective and less invasive. We
therefore studied the effect of fixed-dose
(oral) combination of drotaverine (80 mg) with
mefenamic acid (250 mg) on pain perception
during hysteroscopy and endometrial biopsy
and compared it with that of paracervical block
and with that of intravenous sedation, both of
which are more invasive.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
This randomized trial was conducted between
January 2007 and July 2007 in the outpatient
gynecology department of All India Institute
of Medical Sciences, New Delhi. The study
was approved by the ethics committee of the
institute. The sample size was calculated with

the help of a statistician, taking alpha and
beta errors into consideration and keeping
the power of the study above 80%; so a total
of 120 women with a medical indication for
hysteroscopy and endometrial biopsy (infertility,
abnormal uterine bleeding) were recruited. The
criteria for inclusion in the study were (1) all
women should be requiring hysteroscopy or
endometrial biopsy for infertility or abnormal
uterine bleeding and (2) all of them should
have given informed written consent. The
patients were informed about details of the
study in their language before taking their
written consent. The criteria for exclusion
from the study were (1) being pregnant; (2)
having a known sensitivity to nonsteroidal
anti-infl ammatory drugs, lignocaine; (3) having
peptic ulcer disease, inflammatory bowel
disease, porphyrias, genital infections, cervical
stenosis, serious cardiac disease; (3) being
unable or unwilling to provide informed consent;
and (4) having history of cervical surgery.
This study was an open-label randomized
trial where all the 120 patients were
randomized using a predetermined computergenerated randomization code into 3 groups
[Figure 1]. In each group, there were 40
patients. Group I patients received fi xed-dose
oral tablet containing drotaverine (80 mg) with
mefenamic acid (250 mg). Group II patients
received paracervical block with 10 mL of 1%
lignocaine solution. Group III patients received
intravenous sedation with diazepam (0.2 mg/
kg body weight) and pentazocine (0.6 mg/
kg body weight). In this open-label study,
the procedure was performed by the same
resident gynecologist throughout the study
period who knew the group to which the patient
belonged and accordingly administered the
drug. The outcome measure (pain score) was
evaluated by a resident doctor throughout
the study who did not know the treatment
protocol. Group I patients were instructed to
take tablet Drotin-M [Martin and Harris Private
Limited, India] 1 hour before the procedure,
and no other analgesia or anesthesia was
used on them. Women in all the groups were
placed in lithotomy position and bimanual
examination was done. After cleaning and
draping, a bivalved speculum was inserted
to expose the cervix; the anterior lip of cervix
was grasped with volsellum forceps. As most
diagnostic hysteroscopies in our department
are performed by resident doctors, volsellum
and speculum are routinely used by them for
hysteroscopies and they are not yet trained
to perform hysteroscopies by vaginoscopic
approach; hence hysteroscopies were done in
the traditional way using speculum and holding
anterior lip of cervix with volsellum forceps.
In group II, paracervical block was preformed
using 22-gauge hypodermic needle, and 10
mL of 1% lignocaine [Xylocard, Astra Zeneca
Pharma Limited, India] was injected at 3- and
9-o’clock position at the junction of the cervix
and vagina in divided doses. Group III patients
were given intravenous diazepam (0.2 mg/
kg body weight) [Lori, Neon Laboratories
Limited, Thane, India] + pentazocine (0.6 mg/
kg body weight) [Fortwin, Ranbaxy Laboratories
Limited, Ahmedabad, India]. Hysteroscopy
and endometrial biopsy were started after 1
hour, 5 minutes and 10 minutes, respectively,
in group I, group II and group III following
the drug administration. If cervical dilatation
was required, it was performed and noted. A
rigid 5-mm diameter hysteroscope with a 30°
fore-oblique view (Karl-Storz, Germany) was
inserted into the uterine cavity under direct
vision. Uterine distension was maintained by a

steady stream of normal saline solution using
a pressure bag applied to the plastic bottle
containing normal saline, which was hung at
a height of about 6 feet. The pressure bag
was inflated up to 300 mm Hg. The image
was displayed on the television monitor so
that the operator and the patient could see
the inside of the uterine cavity. Endometrial
biopsy was performed using 4-mm Karman’s
plastic cannula (Chimco Bio-Medical Eng.
Co., Sigma International, India). Vacuum was
created by the 20-mL plastic syringe attached
to the other end of the cannula. The resident
doctor evaluating the outcome measure
asked the patients to score the worst pain
experienced during the procedure and the
degree of their discomfort after 30 minutes and
60 minutes of the procedure using a 10-cm
line visual analog scale (VAS: 0 cm- no pain,
10 cm- excruciating pain). No further followup was scheduled. No woman was excluded
and the procedure was not abandoned at any
point of time after recruiting. The data was
analyzed using the statistical package for social

performed with Kruskal-Wallis test followed
by Bonferroni correction. Change in VAS
over the period of time was seen by applying
repeated measure analysis followed by post
hoc comparison. The t test and the χ2 test
were applied where appropriate. P< 0.05 was
considered statistically signifi cant.
RESULTS
The characteristics of patients are given
in Table 1. Of the 120 patients recruited,
procedure was performed successfully in all,
and at no point anyone was excluded from
the study. All the data has been mentioned as
mean ± standard deviation, 95% confi dence
interval (CI) for mean with lower and upper
bound values. There was no statistical
difference in age, parity, vaginal deliveries and
indication for hysteroscopy and endometrial
biopsy among the three groups [Table 1]. The
age ranged from 20 to 61 years with mean
being 36.28 years, 37.75 and 36.82 years
respectively. Parity ranged from 0 to 4 with
mean being 1.48, 1.40 and 1.38 in the three
groups, respectively. Infertility and abnormal
uterine bleeding were the two most frequent
symptoms of patients. The mean pain scores
during the procedure, after 30 minutes and 60
minutes among the three groups are shown in
Figure 1. Pain perception in group I patients
during the procedure was 4.13± 1.28 (95%
CI, 3.71-4.54) and was signifi cantly less (P<
0.001) than that in the paracervical block group
5.93± 1.26 (95% CI, 5.52-6.33) and intravenous
sedation group 5.58± 1.51 (95% CI, 5.14-6.01).
Similarly, pain score reported after 30 minutes
was 1.78± 0.89 (95% CI, 1.49-2.06) in group
I; 2.53± 0.81 (95% CI, 2.26-2.79) in group II;
and 2.23± 0.94 (95% CI, 1.91-2.54) in group
III. Pain score after 60 minutes was 1.2± 0.46
(95% CI, 1.05-1.35) in group I; 1.98± 0.83 (95%
CI, 1.71-2.24) in group II; and 1.68± 0.75 (95%
CI, 1.44-1.91) in group III. Pain was signifi cantly
less (P< 0.00) in group I after 30 and 60 minutes
when compared with that in groups II and III
[Figure 2]. The VAS score at different time
intervals among the groups was also signifi cant
[Table 2]. One patient in drotaverine with
mefenamic acid group complained of gastritis

after 2 hours of ingestion, 4 complained of
abdominal cramps after 1 hour of the procedure
and no other adverse effects were noted;
whereas 12 patients in group II complained of
abdominal cramps after 1 hour of the procedure.
In group III, 20 patients had dizziness, 4 had
palpitations following the injection of drug and
12 continued to have dizziness after 1 hour of
the procedure. Seven patients reported nausea
and vomiting in group III following the procedure.
In all the groups, none of the patients required
medication or hospitalization, and symptoms
subsided in the following few hours.
DISCUSSION
The data from this study demonstrates that
the combination of drotaverine and mefenamic
acid is effective in decreasing the pain during
the procedure and its effect lasts longer than
that of paracervical block or intravenous
sedation. These two drugs have synergistic
effects because their mechanisms of action are
different. Despite the use of local anesthesia
and intravenous sedation, the commonest
reason for failure to complete the procedure is
pain. Pain perceived in the cervix and uterine
corpus appears to pass through 2 distinct
neural pathways. A paracervical block aids in
decreasing pain from cervical origin, but the
extent of its effect on pain related to uterine
activity is unclear. Paracervical lignocaine was
found to be ineffective in reducing pain during
endometrial biopsy and also carried the risk of
inducing bradycardia, hypotension, convulsion,
respiratory arrest and death.[5] In another
randomized trial, Vercellini et al. demonstrated
that paracervical block is ineffective in reducing
the discomfort of hysteroscopy and noted that
it is the endometrial biopsy which is the most
painful part of the procedure.[6] Broadbent et
al. demonstrated that intracervical injection
of lignocaine does not reduce the pain during
hysteroscopy.[11] Fritz et al., in 1997, in a
randomized double-blind placebo-controlled
trial concluded that 500 mg of mefenamic acid
1 hour before hysteroscopy had no signifi cant
effect on the discomfort experienced during
the procedure but did signifi cantly reduce pain
after the procedure.[12] In another placebocontrolled trial, Dogan et al. showed that
naproxen when combined with lidocaine was
effective in relieving pain during endometrial
biopsy.[13] Drotaverine is effectively used in
gynecological conditions like dysmenorrhea
and nongynecological conditions like renal colic
and cholelithiasis.[8] In the studies by Sharma
et al. and Singh et al., drotaverine when used
during labor was shown to accelerate the labor
and no adverse effects were seen.[9,10]
In literature there are studies where plain
NSAIDs were used for pain relief before minor
gynecological procedures and compared

with placebo, paracervical block, intrauterine
lignocaine insertion, local spray of lignocaine
gel, but the results were not conclusive.[12-14]
Various reasons have been cited for this,
like cultural factors for pain tolerance, race,
diameter of the hysteroscope, etc. There is a
paucity of similar studies on Indian women.
The present study confi rms the superiority of
combination of drotaverine and mefenamic
acid over paracervical block and intravenous
sedation in pain relief for offi ce hysteroscopy
and endometrial biopsy, which is especially
signifi cant for developing countries like India,
where needles may be recycled putting the
patient at risk of acquiring viral diseases.
Moreover, the combination of mefenamic acid
and drotaverine is an oral drug; is cheaper,
costing Rs. 2; less invasive than paracervical
block (costing approximately Rs. 10-15) and
intravenous sedation (costing approximately
Rs. 30-40); and has got no major adverse
effects. To our knowledge, this is the fi rst study
to evaluate the efficacy of oral drotaverine
plus mefenamic acid and compare it with
that of paracervical bock and with that of
intravenous sedation for pain relief during offi ce
hysteroscopy and endometrial biopsy.
Yang and Vollenhoven have reviewed pain
control in outpatient hysteroscopy and failed to
obtain substantial conclusive evidence for the
routine use of local anesthesia in outpatient
hysteroscopy.[14] Recent studies have shown
that outpatient hysteroscopy and targeted
biopsies can be performed in one sitting,
called see-and-treat philosophy, without the
need of analgesia and anesthesia; especially,
speculum and volsellum forceps are not
used and vaginoscopic approach is used for
hysteroscopy.[15] Many centers in the world,
especially in western countries, are running
hysteroscopy clinics using see-and-treat
philosophy, where in one sitting, diagnosis
and management are performed. They often
use 3-mm hysteroscope and vaginoscopic
approach without the use of speculum and
volsellum, which do not need analgesia and
anesthesia.[15] However, 3-mm hysteroscope
was not available in our center; and 5-mm
rigid hysteroscope was used along with
volsellum and speculum without vaginoscopic
approach, necessitating the use of analgesia
and anesthesia. In the present study, a rigid
5-mm hysteroscope with 30° fore-oblique view
(Karl-Storz, Germany) was used, which did not
have grasping forceps to take targeted biopsies
in minor operation theater. Hence targeted
biopsies could not be done.
Outpatient hysteroscopy has been used
successfully for diagnostic purposes and for
see–and-treat philosophy, as is evident from
many papers on the subject — by Bettocchi et
al.,[15] Spiezio et al.,[16] Papalampros et al.[17] and
Cicinelli et al.[18,19] Hysteroscopy is a very useful
modality in the diagnosis of varying grades of
adhesions in genital tuberculosis, as has been
seen in our experience.[20]
In the present study, randomization was done
in the 3 groups: group I receiving combination
of oral drotaverine hydrochloride and
mefenamic acid 1 hour before the procedure;
group II receiving 10 mL of 1% lignocaine
hydrochloride paracervically 5 minutes
before the procedure; and group III receiving
intravenous diazepam and pentazocine 10
minutes before the procedure. As ‘paracervical
lignocaine’ and ‘intravenous diazepam with
pentazocine’ are the two commonly used
drug modalities, we did not randomize into 4

areas, that is, drotaverine alone, mefenamic
acid alone, combination of mefenamic acid
and drotaverine and placebo, as we wanted
to compare the effi cacy of the combination of
drotaverine (antispasmodic) and mefenamic
acid (antiprostaglandin) with that of commonly
used drugs.
This study has few limitations, like the small
number of patients, not blinded completely,
not placebo controlled; also, other secondary
outcome measures like blood pressure, heart
rate and time taken for the procedure have
not been evaluated. Since racial and cultural
factors also contribute to the pain tolerance
levels, large multicentered placebo-controlled
trials need to be done to prove the effi cacy
of oral drotaverine and mefenamic acid for
gynecological offi ce procedures.
To conclude, the present study showed
that oral combination of drotaverine with
mefenamic acid is more effective in relieving
pain during hysteroscopy and endometrial
biopsy as compared with paracervical bock and
intravenous sedation.

Author Help: Reference checking facility
The manuscript system (www.journalonweb.com) allows the authors to check and verify the accuracy and style of
references. The tool checks the references with PubMed as per a predefined style. Authors are encouraged to use
this facility, before submitting articles to the journal.
• The style as well as bibliographic elements should be 100% accurate, to help get the references verified
from the system. Even a single spelling error or addition of issue number/month of publication will lead to
an error when verifying the reference.
• Example of a correct style

needle aspiration biopsy. Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg 2002;127:294-8.
• Only the references from journals indexed in PubMed will be checked.
• Enter each reference in new line, without a serial number.
• Add up to a maximum of 15 references at a time.
• If the reference is correct for its bibliographic elements and punctuations, it will be shown as CORRECT
and a link to the correct article in PubMed will be given.
• If any of the bibliographic elements are missing, incorrect or extra (such as issue number), it will be
shown as INCORRECT and link to possible articles in PubMed will be given.
