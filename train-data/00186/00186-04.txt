INTRODUCTION
The majority of patients with endometrial neoplasm or pre‐neoplastic lesions have abnormal uterine bleeding as a first symptom. Nowadays abnormal uterine bleeding accounts for a high percentage of visits to gynaecologists because of the increased use of hormonal therapy, by both postmenopausal women for oestrogen replacement and those with breast cancer as adjuvant therapy, and because of the increasing number of women living their menopausal age in industrialised countries. Over the past three decades a significant body of evidence has documented the advantages of direct inspection of the uterine cavity and guided biopsy rather than blind endometrial curettage to diagnose endometrial pathologies1. However, one limitation to the widespread use of hysteroscopy is its invasiveness with discomfort and pain, especially if an endometrial biopsy is performed or a cervical stenosis exists. At diagnostic hysteroscopy side effects probably related to vagal stimulation, such as nausea, vomiting or dizziness and fainting, have been reported to occur in at least 20% of women in a general population2. Due to the involutive changes of the uterus and the increased incidence of cardiovascular abnormalities, it is probable that frequency and dangerousness of vasovagal reactions in postmenopausal women could be greater than in a general population.

The use of local anaesthesia in the hysteroscopic procedure to date has been limited to paracervical infiltration, but this is a traumatic method which causes pain and risk of anaesthetic intravasation. Recently, topical endometrial anaesthesia by injecting local anaesthetic into the uterine cavity for hysteroscopy and endometrial biopsy has been proposed; it seems to reduce pain during procedures and probably prevents the occurrence of vasovagal reactions3.

The aim of this randomised placebo‐controlled double‐blind study was to evaluate objectively the efficacy and safety of topical endometrial anaesthesia in reducing pain and incidence of vasovagal reactions during diagnostic hysteroscopy with endometrial biopsy.

METHODS
Eighty postmenopausal women undergoing diagnostic hysteroscopy and endometrial biopsy because of uterine bleeding entered the study after giving informed consent; ethical approval of the study was obtained from the local ethics committee. All women had been amenorrheal and oestrogen replacement therapy‐free for at least one year. Before the procedure (TO), each woman completed an affective experience rating form so that her pain expectation could be evaluated and correlated with that subsequently experienced. The form contained a 20‐cm visual analogue scale for the woman to record responses as follows: 0 cm, no pain; 5 cm, low pain; 10 cm, moderate pain; 15 cm, severe pain; and 20 cm, excruciating pain. Furthermore, each woman was asked to report pain experienced during the procedure (T1), at endometrial biopsy (T2), and 15 min after (T3) by putting a mark on the same 20‐cm visual analogue scale. During the procedure blood pressure and pulse rate were measured and recorded by an appropriate monitor (CardioCap II; Datex, Helsinki, Finland) at 1 min intervals. Randomisation was done by opening sealed envelopes containing computer‐generated block randomisation numbers. Women were randomly and double‐blindly assigned to receive topical intrauterine instillation of anaesthetic versus placebo. An 18 Gauge teflon intravenous catheter (Jelco 18 G; Ethicon, Rome, Italy) was inserted into the cervical canal up to the internal os, and the first group received 2 mL of 2% mepivacaine (Carbocaine; Astra‐Simes, Rome, Italy); the second group received 2 mL of 0.9% saline solution. Five minutes after instillation, using a Hamou office hysteroscope of 2.7 mm diameter (27,018 BH, Karl Storz GMBH, Tuttlingen, Germany) with an examination sheet of 3.5 mm diameter, hysteroscopy was performed by CO2 distension of the uterine cavity. An endometrial biopsy was performed by 3 mm Novak's curette (Martin, Tuttlingen, Germany). All procedures were performed by the same two authors (E.C. and T.D.). A heart rate of < 60 bpm or a reduction > 20% compared with baseline (calculated as mean of three measurements in succession at 3 min intervals at TO) during the procedure was considered a vasovagal reaction; similarly, a reduction in blood pressure greater than 20% compared with baseline value was also considered a result of vagal stimulation.

Clinical characteristics of the women in both groups were compared by unpaired Student's t test and significance test for proportions. Differences between the two groups in mean pain scores at hysteroscopy and endometrial biopsy were analysed using unpaired Student's t test; significance test for proportions was used for evaluating the differences in the occurrence of vasovagal reaction between the two groups. Confidence interval (CI) was calculated for the observed mean differences; a P value < 0.05 was considered a limit of significance.

RESULTS
Both groups were homogeneous in age, parity, and pain expectation (Table 1). Hysteroscopy and endometrial biopsy were performed in all patients; the examination of the uterine cavity and endometrium was not hindered either by the presence of the liquid or minimal bleeding caused, in some cases, by insertion of the catheter. The mean duration of hysteroscopy was similar in both groups (Table 1). The insertion of the catheter and instillation of the liquid were painless for the patients and lasted a few seconds. Table 2 shows the mean (SD) level of pain experienced during hysteroscopy and biopsy scored on the analogue scale and the number of vasovagal reactions in the two groups of postmenopausal women. The use of anaesthetic significantly reduced both the pain experienced at hysteroscopy and that at biopsy; 15 min after the procedure pain scoring was similar in both groups. Similar results were obtained by considering only parous women; on the contrary, in nulliparous women the difference between the two groups did not reach statistical significance. No differences were observed in mean pain scores between nulliparous and parous women in either group. On the other hand, there was a highly significant difference between groups in the occurrence of vasovagal reactions (P < 0.004); in fact, bradycardia or hypo‐tension, as previously defined, occurred in two women (5%) in the anaesthetised group, and in 13 (32.5%) in the placebo group. Moreover, from a clinical point of view the two patients in the anaesthetised group did not refer any disturbance, whereas in placebo group 7/13 women (54%) showing a vagal stimulation complained of nausea, dizziness and fainting that responded rapidly to Trendelemburg positioning for a few minutes.

DISCUSSION
In gynaecological procedures topical anaesthesia has been used in vaginal, eso‐4 and endocervical procedures5, and for tubal anaesthesia in laparoscopic sterilisation6. Zupi et al.3 in a double‐blind placebo‐controlled study suggested that intrauterine injection of local anaesthetic could prevent vasovagal reactions and reduce pain at hysteroscopy and endometrial biopsy in a general population.

The present study is the first double‐blind report in gynaecological literature on the use of topical anaesthetic versus placebo in diagnostic hysteroscopy and endometrial biopsy, which looked objectively at the occurrence of vasovagal reactions in postmenopausal women undergoing this diagnostic procedure. Due to uterine postmenopausal involution and cervical stenosis in this population, vasovagal reactions are more likely, as confirmed by our findings, occurring in the control group in up to 32.5% of cases. Moreover, due to age‐related reduced responsiveness of the cardiovascular system and the possible onset of cardiac arrhythmias, in postmenopausal women vagal stimulations represent potentially threatening situations. In order to minimise algic stimulations arising from internal uterine ostium dilatation, we used a very thin lenses‐based hysteroscope of < 4 mm diameter.

The data of the present study demonstrate that topical anaesthesia significantly attenuates, but does not suppress, pain experienced at hysteroscopy and endometrial biopsy and more effectively prevents the occurrence of vasovagal reactions. In the group of nulliparous women only, pain reduction was not statistically significant, probably because of the limited number of cases in this group; also the occurrence of vasovagal reactions resulted reduced but not significantly.

From an anatomical point of view, it is to be noted that, firstly, nerve endings are present within endometrial mucosa and, secondly, the uterine cervix and internal cervical ostium are more richly supplied by nerve fibres than the uterine body7. Impulses from the uterus reach the spinal cord and through medulla and polysynaptic, and possibly also paucisynaptic, pathways arrive to the diencephalon, where they can evoke vagal reflexes. Pain at hysteroscopy depends on cervical ostium dilatation and uterine cavity distension. One explanation of our results could be that transcervical injection of anaesthetic is able to block nerve endings at the cervical internal ostium, thus preventing the start of vagal reflexes, but does not completely block nerve endings in the walls of uterine body and fundus, which are responsible for pain due to visceral distension. Also the existence of various types of nerve endings with different responsiveness, those involved in ascending pathways through which the impulses may elicit vagal responses, and others responsible for pain sensation, may account for our results.

In the placebo group a vasovagal reaction occurred in up to 35% of women undergoing diagnostic hys‐ teroscopy and endometrial biopsy, although in most cases it was mild and with rapid and spontaneous resolution. In our opinion this finding is clinically relevant considering the increasing use of hys‐teroscopy in postmenopausal women.

In conclusion topical anaesthesia proved to be a reliable method for reducing the risks associated with endocavitary procedures. It could be used in selected patients when a cervical stenosis is suspected or if the woman reports a high degree of pain in previous intrauterine procedures, as well as to prevent a vagal reaction in very anxious patients. Other studies will be necessary to select the best anaesthetic, its concentration, its lowest effective quantity required to obtain pain suppression, and to ascertain whether it is preferable to inject it into the uterine cavity or at the internal ostium or both.
