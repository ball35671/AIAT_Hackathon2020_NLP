Abstract
Objective: To assess the efficacy of dexketoprofen (DEX) in reducing pain at different stages of the hysteroscopic
procedure in comparison with local anaesthesia in menopausal women. Methods: Menopausal patients affected by
uterine bleeding submitted to diagnostic hysteroscopy, were randomised to receive either 25 mg DEX tablet (n/148) or
intracervical injection of 5 ml mepivacaine 2% (n/150). Pain suffered during the procedure itself and 30, 60, 120 min
after, was scored on the 11 point Visual Analogic Scale, recorded and analysed. Results: No statistical difference were
noted during the procedure itself in both groups of treatment. Patients treated with DEX has significantly less
postoperative pain. Conclusions: DEX is not superior to mepivacaine in reducing the discomfort of the procedure but
does significantly reduce postoperative pain.

1. Introduction
Comparative studies suggest the superiority of
outpatient hysteroscopy over dilatation and curettage in the investigation of patients with a
variety of gynaecological disorders [1,2]. It allows
complete visualization of the uterine cavity, directed or guided endometrial biopsies, and more
appropriate therapeutic management [3]. Most
hysteroscopies are performed under general anaesthetic despite evidence suggesting it is a well
tolerated and acceptable outpatient procedure [4].
Premenopausal women well tolerate the examination and topical anaesthesia or analgesia is not
routinely administered in this patients [5].
Postmenopausal women badly tolerate and
accept this procedure because the difficulties may
be encountered when dealing with narrowed,
atrophic endocervical canals.
The inability to negotiate the cervical canal can
raise a very painful stimulation that could trigger
threatening side effects due to systemic pathologies.  Corresponding author. Tel.: /39-81-5605926; fax: /390-

Pain is the commonest reason for failure to
complete the investigation in these patients [6,7].
Therefore Downes and Al-Azzawi [8] used
routinary intracervical block to provide analgesia
in 100 perimenopausal women and in this way
demonstrated that outpatient hysteroscopy is well
tolerate by perimenopause patients.
For the first time, Nagele et al. [9] have assessed
a prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor during outpatient hysteroscopy.
The patients were instructed to take one tablet
of mefenamic acid 500 mg 1 h before the hysteroscopy.
Mefenamic acid appeared to have minimal
effects on the discomfort associated with the
hysteroscopy itself but significantly reduced the
after pains of the procedure. The partial failure of
this treatment was ascribed by the authors to the
relatively minor effect of the drug, with respect to
uterine manipulation as well as the longer time to
achieve plasma peak levels of the drug.
Dexketoprofen (DEX), the active enantiomer of
the racemic compound ketoprofen, is a new
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) of
the arylpropionate family.
A single oral capsule of DEX 25 mg (given as 37
mg of the trometamol salt) showed a very rapid
onset of the analgesic effect associated with a long
lasting activity and a level of analgesia significantly superior compared to ketoprofen [10].
Therefore it could be ipotized that this drug is
appropriate for pain relief during hysteroscopy.
The aim of our randomised study was to
evaluate objectively the efficacy and safety of
oral treatment with DEX in the treatment of
pain in postmenopausal women during outpatient
diagnostic hysteroscopy.
2. Materials and methods
From December 1999 to June 2001, 305 consecutive postmenopausal women were referred to
our outpatient Menopause Clinic for hysteroscopy
because uterine bleeding.
The patients were randomly allocated to receive
either local infiltration of the cervix by injecting of
5 ml mepivacaine 2% intracervically up to the level
of the internal os or one tablet of DEX given 1 h
before the procedure.
All the patients received 200 mg of misoprostol
placed in the posterior vaginal fornix 2/3 h before
hysteroscopy in order to render less traumatic
dilatation of the cervical canal.
Randomization was achieved with sealed envelops containing computer generated block randomisation numbers.
Their informed consent were included in the
study which was approved by the local medical
ethics committee.
Patient with a known sensitivity to NSAIDs and
prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors were excluded
from the study.
Age, parity and duration of surgery did not
differ significantly between the two groups (data
not shown).
Hysteroscopic examination was performed in a
specially prepared outpatient room with the assistance of an experienced nurse.
The examinations were performed grasping the
anterior lip of the cervix with a single-tooth
vulsellum after visualization and cleaning of the
cervix with the aid of a vaginal speculum.
The cervical os was gradually dilatated with
cervical dilators to 5 Hegar when deemed necessary.
Panoramic hysteroscopy was performed using a
4 mm telescope with a 308 fore-oblique lens and a 5
mm diagnostic sheath and an electronic Hamou
CO2 uterine insufflator set to a flow rate of 45 ml/
min. and a pressure of up to 100 mmHg.
A Storz cold light source with fibre-optic cable
allowed adequate illumination.
The images were observed on a high resolution
color monitor using chip camera.
The TV monitor was placed so that the patient
could observe if she so desired.
After assessing the endometrial cavity when the
endometrium looked abnormal sampling was
performed with a Pipelle device (Laboratorie
CCD).
At the end of the investigation, the subject were
asked to score the worst pelvic or backache or
shoulder tip pain experienced during hysteroscopy
and at 30, 60 and 120 min after the procedure
using an 11 point Visual Analogic Scale, marking a
278 F. Mercorio et al. / Maturitas 43 (2002) 277/281
cross on a 10 cm line with 0 on the left side
indicating no pain and 10 on the right side
indicating the worst imaginable pain. Heart rate
and blood pressure were monitored continuously
in both groups.
The data were statistically analysed by x2
-test
and Mann/Whitney U tests, a result of P B/0.05
being considered statistically significant.
3. Results
Seven women were excluded from the study.
Five of these thought to be too anxious to
tolerate hysteroscopy under local anaesthesia or
pharmacological sedation, two because previous
conization.
A total of 148 patients received DEX tablets and
150 patients received local anaesthetic drug. Age,
parity and duration of surgery did not differ
significantly between the two groups (data not
shown).
Hysteroscopy was unsuccessful in 10 women
(five in each group) because pain which caused
complete cessation of the procedure and in 3
women in the DEX group because unsatisfactory
view.
Fig. 1 presents values for the Visual Analogic
Scale during the procedure and at 30, 60 and 120
min in both group of treatment.
The pain suffered during the procedure was
similar in both groups.
Compared to local anaesthesia, values for
Visual Analogic Scale scores at 30, 60 and 120
min were significantly lower in the DEX group
(P B/0.05).
No complications attributable to the procedure
occurred and no patients required admission after
hysteroscopy.
4. Discussion
Metrorrhagia in menopausal women is the most
frequent indication for hysteroscopy. Often, however, the procedure turns out to be difficult or
impossible due to stenosis and reduction in size of
the cervical canal.
We assessed the efficacy of a non-steroidal antiinflammatory analgesic as premedication before
hysteroscopy in reducing the pain in a group of
postmenopausal women in the whole process and
not merely during the procedure.

Because the elevated expected rate of painful
cervical dilatation in this group of patients we used
in all patients vaginal misoprostol to lessen the
cervical resistance [11].
Compared with local anaesthesia, DEX did not
significantly affect the worst pain the women
suffered during the procedure itself but reduced
significantly the postoperative pain.
Intracervical anaesthesia is effective in reducing
the sensitivity of the cervix but is uneffective at
blocking fundal innervation of the uterus and
discomfort related to prostaglandin uterine contractions [12].
DEX produces a satisfactory level of analgesia
similar to that achieved with local anaesthesia
during hysteroscopy; indeed 3.4% of the procedures were abandoned because pain in the mepivacaine group as well in the DEX group.
The analgesic effect lasts longer and is able in
reducing the pain arising from the fundal region
because its effectiveness at blocking fundal innervation of the uterus derived from the ovarian nerve
plexus. Therefore patients recovered far better in
the DEX group so contributing to more rapid
ambulation and significantly earlier discharge.
Nagele et al. [9] first assessed a prostaglandin
synthesis inhibitor during outpatient hysteroscopy
found the mefenamic acid appears to have minimal effects on the pain associated with hysteroscopy itself but does significantly reduce the
postoperative pain.
The positive effect of a prostaglandin synthesis
inhibitor in term of postoperative pain relief has
been fully documented by many authors [13,14].
Possible explanation of the failure of the intraoperative analgesic effect of prostaglandin
synthesis inhibitor has been suggested due to the
delayed plasma levels of mefenamic acid and
possibly due to the lag time between administration of the drug and operative procedure [8].
The DEX has been demonstrated to possess a
very rapid onset of action (within 30 min of
administration) and a long lasting effect (at least
for 6 h).
The very rapid onset of action compared with
ketoprofen suggests that DEX is more appropriate
for the treatment of acute pain [15/17].
Due to these characteristics, DEX revealed on
the Visual Analogic Scale a similar intraoperative
analgesic effect confronted with intracervical injection of mepivacaine but a significantly superior
effect on the postoperative pain prevention.
Our study provide adequate evidence that outpatient diagnostic hysteroscopy under oral analgesia offers an acceptable alternative to procedures
with local anaesthetic.
We eliminated discomfort not only related to
the procedure itself and on the basis of our results
we believe in the widespread application of this
approach.
In the study presented here, the study population was exclusively postmenopausal where the
chance of failed attempts due to the pain is most
likely to occur compared with premenopausal
women.
Therefore, we have experimented a new approach in a subgroup of patients for the treatment
of pain that is far different from the one we have
adopted in our department in a general population
[18].
On the basis of our results we believe in the
widespread application of this approach.
