Abstract
STUDY OBJECTIVE: To compare the amount of pain during and after hysteroscopy using local
intracervical and combined local and paracervical anesthesia.
DESIGN: Prospective randomized trial (Canadian Task Force classification I).
SETTING: University teaching hospital.
PATIENTS: Eighty-four women who underwent outpatient hysteroscopy for evaluation of the
uterine cavity at McGill University Health Center.
INTERVENTIONS: Randomization to local intracervical or combined local and paracervical anesthesia.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Amount of pain experienced during the procedure and at
10, 30, and 60 minutes after the procedure was measured using a visual analog scale ranging from zero
to 10 (zero  no pain; 10  excruciating pain). The mean age of the patients in the local anesthesia
group was 36.1  0.7 years and in the combined local and paracervical anesthesia group was 35.2
0.7 years. Patients experienced significantly more pain during than after the procedure. The mean pain
scores in the local anesthesia group were significantly higher than in the combined anesthesia group
during the procedure (3.2  0.3 vs 2.1  0.2; p .01; 95% CI 0 –2), 10 minutes after the procedure
(1.9  0.2 vs 1.5  0.3; p  .03; 95% CI 0 –1), and 30 minutes after the procedure (1.7  0.2 vs
1.0  0.2; p  .02; 95% CI 0 –1). However, there was no significant difference in pain scores at 60
minutes after the procedure between the local anesthesia and combined anesthesia groups (0.9  0.2
and 0.7  0.1, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Outpatient hysteroscopy with local or combined local and paracervical anesthesia
was well tolerated by patients. However, combined anesthesia was associated with less pain during and
at 10 and 30 minutes after the procedure. Most patients considered the pain as mild.

Hysteroscopy for diagnostic purposes can be performed
in the office setting using CO2 or normal saline solution as
a distending medium. Pain may occur during insertion of the
hysteroscope into the cervix and during distension of the
uterine cavity. In order to alleviate the pain, various methods
of systemic analgesia and local anesthesia have been advocated.1–5 However, the results have not been consistent.2,4,6
The purpose of our study was to evaluate the amount
of pain during outpatient-hysteroscopy with local intracervical anesthesia or combined local and paracervical
anesthesia.

Materials and methods
From September 2005 through June 2006, 85 women
undergoing outpatient hysteroscopy at the McGill University Health Center were randomized to undergo hysteroscopy using local intracervical anesthesia or combined local
and paracervical anesthesia. Randomization was done using
a computer-generated random table. The hospital research
ethics board approved the study. Study participants were
counseled, and informed consent was obtained before randomization.
Following our standard practice, all patients were given an
anxiolytic: lorazepam 10 mg orally 30 minutes before the
procedure. Women randomized into the local anesthesia group
received an injection of 2 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine hydrochloride into the anterior wall of the cervix. Those randomized into
the combined anesthesia group received similar local intracervical anesthesia as well as paracervical anesthesia. Paracervical
anesthesia was administered by injecting bupivacaine into the
lateral vaginal fornix bilaterally at the 3 and 9 o’clock positions
at a depth of 10 mm (4 mL on each side).
The lag time between the injection and the procedure was
approximately 5 minutes. After administration of anesthesia,
we purposely prepared the instrumentation and connected the
hysteroscope and distending medium. When we applied the
tenaculum, none of the patients complained of pain.
Hysteroscopy was performed by first placing a tenaculum on the anterior wall of the cervix at 12 o’clock to
stabilize the cervix. We used a rigid 3.5-mm hysteroscope
and normal saline as distending medium. All patients were
observed for 60 minutes after the procedure, and they were
asked to complete a standardized pain evaluation form.
We used a visual analog scale ranging from zero to 10
(zero  no pain; 10  excruciating pain). Patients were
asked to record the degree of pain during the procedure and
at 10, 30, and 60 minutes after the procedure.
The inclusion criteria were all women who required
outpatient hysteroscopy for evaluation of the uterine cavity
and who had negative cervical culture. The exclusion criteria were women who required operative hysteroscopy under
general anesthesia, a positive Chlamydia culture, pregnancy, or allergy to local anesthesia.
Sample size and statistical analysis
The study was designed to have 80% power to detect a
difference of 30% in the amount of pain on visual analog
scale, with two-sided alpha levels of 0.05. Using sample
size calculation for independent proportions, we estimated a
sample size of 38 participants in each group (total 76 participants). In our previous experience, patients encountered
most pain in 10 minutes (unpublished data). Accordingly,
sample size calculation was based on the amount of pain at
10 minutes after the commencement of the procedure. This
estimation was based on the incidence of pain in the local
anesthesia group of 40%.
The data were not normally distributed as shown by the
Shapiro–Wilks test. We used Fisher’s exact test for proportion, Mann–Whitney’s test, and Kruskal–Wallis test to compare the pain score during and at 10, 30, and 60 minutes
after the procedure. A p value .05 was required to reject
the null hypothesis.
Results
Eighty-five participants were randomized to both groups.
A patient in the combined local and paracervical anesthesia
group could not tolerate speculum examination, and the
procedure was aborted. As a result, 42 patients were in the
local group and another 42 in the combined group.
Demographic data of the patients in both groups were
comparable (Table 1). We did not encounter any technical
difficulty in performing the procedure in all patients. The
mean duration of the procedure was similar in both groups
of patients (local anesthesia group: 5.6  0.6 minutes;
combined anesthesia group: 5.4  0.6 minutes). Patients
experienced significantly more pain during than after the
procedure. The pain scores in the local anesthesia group
were significantly higher than in the combined anesthesia
group during the procedure and at 10 minutes and 30 minutes after the procedure (Table 2). However, there was no
significant difference between the groups in the pain scores
at 60 minutes after the procedure.
None of the participants experienced hypotension or bradycardia during or shortly after the procedure.
Discussion
Hysteroscopy in an outpatient setting is useful for evaluating the uterine cavity in women with abnormal uterine
bleeding or repeated pregnancy loss. It is also useful to
examine possible factors that contribute to implantation
failure in women treated with in vitro fertilization (IVF). In

our series, most procedures were performed in women who
had failed IVF treatment.
A few authors have performed outpatient hysteroscopy
without anesthesia and reported that it is a well-tolerated
procedure.5,6 Two randomized trials have found that patient
tolerability with or without anesthesia was comparable.4,7
However, the anesthesia was only local cervical anesthesia.
In one study, approximately 30% of the patients required
anesthesia.6 The authors concluded that patient selection is
important in determining when local anesthesia is to be
administered. Others believe that outpatient hysteroscopy is
a painful procedure and should not be performed without
anesthesia. In a study of 1144 women, De Iaco et al found
that 34.8% of patients experienced severe pain.1
The ideal anesthesia for outpatient hysteroscopy remains
unknown. Broadbent et al4 found that local intracervical anesthesia was as good as placebo. In another study,3 hysteroscopy
using local intracervical anesthesia was effective; but 40% of
patients still experienced moderate pain. The cervix and uterus
are richly innervated with Frankenhäuser plexus (parasympathetic S2– 4), whereas sympathetic nerves from the ovarian
plexus innervate the uterine fundus. Intracervical anesthesia
therefore will not block fundal innervations of the uterus.
Cicinelli et al2 found that paracervical anesthesia significantly
reduced pain during hysteroscopy.
In our study, we randomized patients to undergo local
cervical or combined local and paracervical anesthesia, and
we found that combined anesthesia decreases more pain
during and in the first 30 minutes after the procedure. The
amount of pain 60 minutes after hysteroscopy was similar in
both groups. On a scale of zero to 10, the highest mean pain
score was 3.2. Although mild, patients still experienced
pain. Perhaps this is due to the pain originated from the
visceral distension of the uterine cavity.8
Instead of lidocaine, that has a narrow therapeutic index
and severe toxicity, we used up to 10 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine. Barss and Pian-Smith recommend using 5 mL of
0.2% bupivacaine.9 In addition, bupivacaine anesthesia is
associated with less pain than lidocaine.10
In contrast to our previous observation in a small number
of patients (unpublished data) that they encountered most
pain 10 minutes after the procedure, in the present series, we
found that the pain score was higher during the procedure
(Table 2). The duration of hysteroscopy was not significantly different between the 2 groups of patients.
We conclude that patients tolerated outpatient hysteroscopy well with either local or a combination of local and
paracervical anesthesia. However, combined local and
paracervical anesthesia was associated with less pain during
and at 10 and 30 minutes after the procedure.
