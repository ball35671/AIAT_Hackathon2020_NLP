Objective: To evaluate whether administration of analgesic medication one hour before undergoing office
hysteroscopy decreased pain and other side effects.
Study design: A prospective randomized study was carried out in 200 patients who underwent office
hysteroscopy from November 2011 until May 2012. 100 patients received 1000 mg paracetamol and
600 mg ibuprofen one hour before the procedure and 100 did not receive any medication.
Results: We observed significant differences (p = 0.013) regarding the occurrence of non-pain side effects,
6% in the non-medicated group and none of the patients in the medicated group. The main pain score was
always slightly higher in the group receiving no medication, though there was no statistically significant
difference when compared to the medicated group.
Conclusion: Administration of 1 g paracetamol and 600 mg ibuprofen one hour prior to office
hysteroscopy decreased statistically the occurrence of non-pain side effects such as nausea, emesis,
and hypotension. No differences in pain scores were observed.

Introduction
Hysteroscopy is nowadays a quick and easy technique that can
be performed on an outpatient basis, and that allows for the
evaluation and treatment of pathologies of the uterine cavity, tubal
ostium, and cervical canal [1]. The utilization of endoscopy towers
with a saline bag hung to gravity, and small-caliber endoscopes
with continuous flow and 5 French working channel, allows for the
resolution of numerous pathologies in the doctor’s office [2,3].
Performing this procedure in an ambulatory setting has many
benefits for health care providers and patients, such as a decrease
in complication rates, a shorter recovery time with rapid return to
work, a reduced hospital stay and reduced costs [4–6].
Hysteroscopy is well tolerated by many patients, but it can still
be a painful experience for some of them. Although it is a safe
procedure, studies on acceptability of hysteroscopy in ambulatory
patients have shown various completion rates ranging from 77% to
97% [7–9]. In 1997, Nagele reported that an increasing number of
diagnostic hysteroscopies were performed in outpatient settings,
with pain being the most frequent cause for failure to complete the
investigation [10]. In 1997, Bettocchi and Selvaggi introduced the
atraumatic insertion technique without speculum use by vaginoscopy [11], achieving a significant reduction in pain sensation. A
significant decrease in pain could be achieved with the use of
hysteroscopes of the smallest caliber possible [12].
Pain in intraperitoneal structures, such as the uterine body, is
driven by visceral afferent fibers with sympathetic fibers through
the hypogastric nerves to the T12–L2 spinal ganglia [13]. Biopsy
and destruction of the endometrium can cause additional pain
since these can induce uterine contractions [14]. Pain during
hysteroscopy has also been associated with an excessive prostaglandin concentration in the uterus [15]. There may also be
additional delayed pain, caused by the release of prostaglandins
due to cervical manipulation and uterine distension.
There is no clear consensus in the literature about the routine
use of analgesia, or the best type of it, to reduce pain during
hysteroscopy. In a British study published in 2011, analgesia was
not routinely used in 62.5% of hysteroscopy units [6].
The aim of the study is to evaluate, by a visual analog scale
(VAS), if administration of 1 g paracetamol and 600 mg ibuprofen,
one hour before office hysteroscopy, decreases pain in patients. To
assess also whether other parameters such as parity, menopause,
the type of procedure performed, or having had a previous painful
experience could influence the occurrence of pain as well as on
successful completion of the procedure.

Materials and methods
After IRB approval the trial was registered by Reference Ethical
Committee at the Local Trial Registry with #PI-11-022. We
conducted a prospective, randomized trial comprising patients
referred to the Hysteroscopy Unit of the “Sanitas La Moraleja”
Hospital in Madrid between November 2011 and May 2012.
Allergies and diseases that prevented administration of the
required analgesia were exclusion criteria. Our study included
200 patients randomized 1:1 (by means of a computed generated
randomization list, with same number of patients in each group)
for the intake of medication, or lack thereof, prior to the
intervention. 1 g paracetamol and 600 mg ibuprofen were administered orally to the group receiving medication one hour prior to
hysteroscopy. The investigators assessing outcomes and statistician were blinded to the treatment assignment. Placebo was not
used, so patients and clinician who performed the intervention
knew premedicated patients.
Inclusion criteria were: patients older than 18 years old and
who signed informed consent needing an office hysteroscopy for
their diagnosis or treatment process evaluated previously by the
general gynecologist. Those indications included: postmenopausal
endometrial thickening (over 4 mm), metrorrhagia, sonographic
suspicion of endometrial polyps or myoma, Essure device insertion
and endometrial biopsy. Patients exclusion criteria included:
Unfulfillment of inclusion criteria or medication intolerance
previously known. No patients were directly offered hysteroscopy
with anesthesia, since we considered more efficient to perform in
every case an office hysteroscopy to assess diagnosis.
Hysteroscopy was performed in all cases by the same gynecologist, in an outpatient setting, without speculum or cervical hook via
vaginoscopy, with saline solution as distension media using a
Bettocchi continuous flow hysteroscope, with a 30 HOPKINS1 II
foroblique lens of 2.9 mm in diameter and 30 cm in length, a surgical
sheathof4.3 mmwithchannel for5Charr semirigidinstruments and
a continuous flow surgical sheath with a 5 mm oval profile. Scissors,
graspers, and semirigid biopsies of 5 Charr and 34 cm in length were
used.Abipolar electrodewasnotavailable. Intrauterine pressurewas
kept constantlybelow80mm Hgbymeans of anelectronic irrigation
pump at a flow of 200 ml/min (Endomat, Karl Storz, Germany). Data
collected included: age, parity and menopausal status; reason for
hysteroscopy and procedure performed; medication used and pain
feeling during the procedure; completion of procedure, additional
side effects due to the procedure and hysteroscopy in the operating
room if required.
Since a bipolar electrode was not available, virtually all
myomectomies were performed in the operating room. For the
same reason, and depending on the characteristics of the patient,
multiple polyps and/or large polyps were also removed in the
operating room. Both myomas and large/multiple polyps underwent office hysteroscopy prior to removal at the operating room in
a different day.
Pain was evaluated during the test at the time of cervical
dilatation, as well as 5 and 30 min after completion of the test, by
means of a VAS. This is a visual system that shows five faces on a
scale of 0–10. All odd numbers are permitted [16–18].
The statistical analysis was conducted using the SPSS 15.0
software (SPSS Inc., Madrid, Spain). Quantitative variables were
compared with Student’s T-test and qualitative variables by means
of chi-square test. Alpha error was set at 5%. Sample size was
calculated for a confidence level of 95% and a statistical power of
80%. The minimum difference in pain between groups to be
detected with these parameters was set at 0.5 measured by visualanalog scale, with EPIDAT 3.1 software (SERGAS, Galicia, Spain).

Results
100 patients were randomized to each group, all of them
received medication in the analgesic group and all were analised
for the primary outcome. We had no exclusions in both groups
during the study. The trial ended as planned in May 2012 (Fig. 1).
The mean age of patients was 45.9 years in the group receiving
medication and 42.9 years in the group that did not receive it (age
range: 15–87 years). Groups in this study were homogeneous for
the variables analyzed (Table 1).
No statistically significant differences were found between the
medicated and non-medicated groups with respect to the amount
of pain experienced during the test, as well as 5 and 30 min after its
completion, as assessed by the visual analog scale. The mean pain
score during hysteroscopy in the group receiving medication was
4.52  2.82 and 4.71 2.90 in the non-medicated group. After
5 min, the mean pain score was 1.14 1.87 in the medicated group
and 1.33  2.04 in the non-medicated group. After 30 min, the
mean pain score was 0.04  0.24 in the medicated group and
0.11 0.65 in the non-medicated group. The mean pain score was
always slightly higher in the group receiving no medication,
though not significantly.
No statistically significant differences were observed in the
procedure completion rate in an office setting between both
groups (p = 0.157), though it should be noted that the percentage of
non-completed procedures was almost double in the group not
receiving medication (13% vs. 7%), with pain being the main reason
for it. Pain (6.5% of cases) and cervical stenosis (1.5% of cases) were
among the causes for failure to complete hysteroscopy. In one case,
the procedure could not be completed for fear to the test.
No statistically significant differences were observed in the
need to have the procedure completed in the operating room (in a
different day) between the two groups (p = 0.577), which was 19%
in the group not receiving medication compared to 16% in the
medicated group. The most frequent cause was pain in 6.5% of
cases, followed by the presence of large polyps or myomas in 4%
and 3% of cases, respectively. The most infrequent cause was
cervical stenosis in 1.5% of cases.
The average size of the polyps resected in the office was
10.8 mm  4.7 mm. No statistically significant differences were
found in pain, during and after the procedure, when comparing
polyp size (> or 10.8 mm).
To assess the effect of the procedure performed on the amount
of pain experienced, patients were divided into two groups: those
in which polypectomy was performed and those in which only
hysteroscopy, with or without biopsy, was performed. No
statistically significant differences were observed in the amount
of pain perceived, during and after the procedure, between both
groups.
With respect to the amount of pain experienced during and
5 min after the test, there were no statistically significant
differences between the patients who had a previous painful
experience and those who had not, but pain was significantly
greater (p = 0.032) 30 min after the test in patients with no past
painful experience.
When comparing the amount of pain experienced between
nulliparous and multiparous patients, we observed that nulliparous women experienced significantly more pain during the test
(5.06  2.74 vs. 4.14  2.90, respectively; p = 0.023). No statistically
significant differences were observed 5 and 30 min after the test.
Medication did not significantly reduce pain in either nulliparous
or multiparous patients.
Pain during the performance of the test was also significantly
greater (p = 0.045) in menopausic (5.21 2.76) than in nonmenopausic (4.33  2.88) patients. There were no statistically
significant differences in pain 5 and 30 min after the test. The
administration of analgesia did not improve pain in either
menopausic or non-menopausic patients.
We did observe statistically significant differences (p = 0.013) in
the occurrence of non-pain side effects, with 6% of patients having
non-pain side effects in the non-medicated group compared to
none in the medicated group. The most frequent non-pain side
effects were nausea and hypotension in 5% of cases.
Comments
Our study confirms that hysteroscopy causes tolerable pain, of
less than 5 in a scale of 0–10, during the procedure, and very mild
or inexistent pain 5 and 30 min after completion of the procedure.
The utilization of vaginoscopy, without cervical hook and
speculum, was a great breakthrough in this regard [11,19].
The utilization of saline solution instead of carbon dioxide (CO2)
has also proven to be more effective and comfortable for the
patient, resulting in less pain and a shorter surgery time. Besides,
saline solution use is cost-effective and leads to a lower vasovagal
syndrome rate than CO2 [20–22]. The use of hysteroscopes with the
smallest caliber possible also reduces pain [12,23,24], as does the
utilization of flexible hysteroscopes vs. rigid ones. However, some
flexible hysteroscopes have a worse image quality, prolong the
procedure, and are more expensive [25].
In 2004, Bettocchi published that when the polyp was larger
than the size of the internal cervical os, 63.5% of patients
experienced mild to moderate pain [26]. Cicinelli also reported
that a polyp diameter greater than 2.2 mm was a limiting factor for
the test [12]. In our study, we did not observe any statistically
significant difference regarding polyp size, though all the polyps
resected in the doctor’s office were smaller than 25 mm. There was
not any statistically significant difference in pain depending on the
type of procedure performed either.
Nulliparity is another factor that has been associated with
greater difficulty and pain when undergoing this procedure. In our
study, we found significantly increased pain in nulliparous vs.
multiparous patients, which could not be significantly reduced
with medication. Our study also confirmed the increased pain that
menopausal patients may experience while undergoing a hysteroscopy.

We did not use any medication for cervical preparation prior to
the technique. According to recent studies, the use of misoprostol
does not provide any benefit in cervical dilation, or in possible
complications, but it does increase other side effects due to the
medication. Thus, misoprostol use is not routinely justified [27].
Many methods have been described to treat pain caused by
office hysteroscopy: paracetamol; non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen and diclofenac [28,29];
mefenamic acid [10,30,31]; opioids [32,33]; and local anesthesia
including intracervical blocks [28], paracervical blocks [34],
intrauterine anesthesia [35], and topical aerosols or gels [36].
There are also studies comparing the use of intravenous sedation
with oral analgesics and paracervical block, but their administration require medical and anesthetic supervision for maintenance of
the respiratory airway [31].
Faced with a multitude of publications on this topic, Cochrane
published a review in 2010 that included 24 randomized controlled
trials (RCTs), 3155 patients, and 15 studies in their meta-analysis
[37]. This review demonstrated that only local anesthesia was
effective in reducing pain during and 30 min after the test, but was
unable to establish the most effective method to administer local
anesthetics. The review did not find a significant reduction in pain
with the use of either NSAIDs or opioid analgesics. In addition,
there were no significant differences in the intervention groups
with respect to other side effects, but pain.
Since opioid analgesics may cause nausea or emesis, which may
be also induced by the test, opioids were not used. Provided that
pain may in part be due to excess in prostaglandin concentrations,
we thought about drugs that could inhibit their production.
NSAIDs inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes by preventing the
synthesis of prostaglandins and their action peaks between 20 and
60 min after their administration. Paracetamol has a different
mechanism of action; during the metabolism of arachidonic acid
by COX isoenzymes, hydroperoxidases that exert a positive
feedback on COX activity are originated. Paracetamol blocks this
feedback and has, in addition, some inhibitory effect over COX3 in
the central nervous system, but does not have any antiinflammatory effect. 1 g paracetamol reaches its analgesic peak 2 h after its
administration. Some studies propose that co-administration of
paracetamol and an NSAID might be beneficial for certain
procedures, such as hysteroscopy [6].
Regarding the choice of NSAIDs, ibuprofen was chosen because
it is cheap, readily available without a prescription, and produces
little gastric erosion. Besides, work by Merry shows that the
analgesic effect of paracetamol and ibuprofen together is
synergistic, and that the time to reach a peak plasma concentration
of paracetamol is reduced by its association with ibuprofen, and
that of ibuprofen is increased [38]. Accordingly, the best time for
their co-administration would be between 30 min and 11
/2 h before
the procedure. Patients included in this study were given the
medication one hour before the procedure, so we could get the
maximum effect both during and after the test.
So far several studies, including ours, have failed to demonstrate a significant effectiveness of oral analgesia. Itis hypothesized
that one of the causes for failure may be that analgesia was
administered too soon and the effect wore off before the test was
completed. Since we tried to maximize the effect of the medication
by carefully choosing the time of administration, we consider this
failure non-related to the time of administration in our study.
However, our study shows a significant reduction in non-pain side
effects in patients receiving oral analgesia. We believe this is an
important fact, since the visual analog scale is subjective and varies
from patient to patient, but the same is not true for clearly
objective non-pain side effects.
Regardless premedication use other authors consider the main
limits in terms of patient procedure compliance, the polyps size
and procedure time, which might be considered while performing
an office hysteroscopy [39].
In conclusion, we observed a statistically significant reduction
in the occurrence of non-pain side effects (nausea, emesis,
hypotension) in patients who received analgesia one hour before
hysteroscopy, but no differences in pain. Even though, the rate of
completion was higher in patients who were given medication,this
completion rate was not statistically significant.
