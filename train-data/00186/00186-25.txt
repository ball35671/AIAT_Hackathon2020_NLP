Objective: To assess the efficacy of lidocaine spray during
outpatient hysteroscopy for reducing procedure-related pain
and to identify risk factors for discomfort.
Methods: One hundred twenty-one women were assigned
randomly to have application of lidocaine spray or placebo
to the uterine cervix during outpatient hysteroscopy. The
main outcome measure was pain during hysteroscopy, assessed on a visual analog scale.
Results: There was no statistically significant difference
between study and control groups in mean age, rate of
nulliparity, postmenopausal state, need for cervical dilation,
or percentage of women who used hormone replacement
therapy. Indications for diagnostic hysteroscopy were similar between groups. Women in the lidocaine group had
statistically significantly less pain during the procedure than
women in the placebo group (2.2 6 1.9 and 3.7 6 2.5,
respectively; P < .001). Women with abnormal uterine
findings (submucous myoma, endometrial polyps, or intrauterine adhesions) had significantly higher pain scores than
women with normal cavities (2.2 6 1.9 and 3.2 6 2.4,
respectively; P < .002). Aerosol anesthesia and normal
uterine findings were independently associated with less
pain. No procedure had to be abandoned because of excessive pain or complications, and no women required hospitalization.
Conclusion: Women treated with lidocaine spray had significantly less pain. Uterine cavity abnormality might be
associated with a higher degree of pain during hysteroscopy.

Outpatient hysteroscopy, the investigation of choice for
uterine cavity abnormalities,1,2 allows direct inspection
and directed biopsy and can be done without general
anesthesia to reduce cost and time. Its main advantage
over the relatively blind procedure of dilation and
curettage is that it is more effective for identifying
intrauterine abnormalities.3,4
One limitation of widespread use of outpatient hysteroscopy is pain and discomfort in some women. More
than 30% of women who have outpatient hysteroscopies without local anesthesia have severe pain.5 In a
study that used flexible hysteroscopes without local
anesthesia, more than 15% of women had severe pain.6
Some authors reported that local anesthesia was not
necessary in most women.4,7 Others suggested administration of intracervical or paracervical nerve block,7–9
or topical anesthesia10,11 but did not establish the efficacy of those anesthetics. Local anesthesia applied with
a spray mechanism rather than intracervical or paracervical injection has advantages.12 It is painless, there is
no danger of bleeding, and there is potentially less risk
of infection and intravasation.7–9 The need, efficacy, and
method of application of local anesthesia are still controversial. We did a randomized, placebo-controlled
study to assess the efficacy of lidocaine spray during
outpatient hysteroscopy for reducing pain and to identify factors related to discomfort.
Materials and Methods
One hundred twenty-one consecutive women who had
diagnostic hysteroscopy for abnormal uterine bleeding
or infertility at the Service de Gyne´cologie, Hoˆpital
Hoˆtel-Dieu de Paris entered the study after giving
informed consent. Inclusion criteria were diagnostic
hysteroscopy and subject approval after a detailed
explanation. Exclusion criteria were menorrhagia at the
time of the procedure, known sensitivity to lidocaine,
epilepsy, significantly impaired respiratory or cardiac
conduction functions, and active liver disease.
Women were randomly assigned to receive lidocaine
aerosol spray (Xylocaine 5%, Astra France Production,
Monts, France) or placebo on the cervix and cervical
canal according to a computer-generated randomization code revealed only at the end of the study. Lidocaine and placebo were packaged in identical bottles From the Service de Gyne´cologie, Hoˆpital Hoˆtel-Dieu de Paris,
Universite´ Paris, Paris, France.

and could not be differentiated. This assured double
masking.
Subjects reported on a form their greatest pain during
the procedure and immediately after it before endometrial sampling. An independent nurse instructed subjects how to score their pain before the procedure, and
scores were masked from the operator. The form contained a visual analog scale for women to report their
responses (from no pain to excruciating pain). On the
other side of the scale, masked from the subject, there
was a 10-cm numeric scale seen only by the nurse.
The spray worked with a pump mechanism, and
delivery was through a thin plastic nozzle that could be
threaded through the cervical canal. During the study
period (December 1998 to September 1999), lidocaine or
placebo was sprayed onto the surface of the cervix and
the cervical canal through 360°. Three metered doses
were given, equivalent to a total dose of 30 mg of base
lidocaine. The tenaculum was used only in cases in
which cervical dilation was needed.
Hysteroscopy was done 5 minutes after application of
lidocaine or placebo, using a standard 2.7-mm flexible
hysteroscope (Olympus Optical Co, GmbH, Hamburg,
Germany). The uterine cavity was distended with normal saline. Illumination was by high-intensity coldlight source (250 W) through a fiber-optic lead. Images
were viewed on a high-resolution color monitor, facing
the operator and the patient, using a chip camera.
The power calculation used to estimate study size
assumed that the mean 6 standard deviation (SD) pain
score of women without local anesthesia was 4.5 6 2.013
and that would be reduced to 3.0 (33%) after lidocaine
spray, with a (type I error) of 0.005 and b (type II error)
of 0.2. Therefore, we planned to recruit 60 women to
each group. Statistical analysis was done with Student t
test and x2 test. P , .05 was considered statistically
significant. Analysis of variance was used to detect
two-way interaction effects (effect modifiers).
Results
One hundred twenty-one women were enrolled. In the
placebo group, two women did not fill out questionnaires properly and were excluded. In one case in the
anesthetic group, the diagnostic hysteroscopy was not
done because of cervical stenosis. Thus, the study
included 118 women (62 in the anesthetic group and 56
in the placebo group). Subject characteristics are given
in Table 1. The mean 6 SD ages of women in the study
and the control groups were 49.6 6 12.5 and 49.4 6 10.1
years, respectively. There was no statistically significant
difference between the study and the control groups in
rate of nulliparity, postmenopausal state, need for cervical dilation, and tenaculum use, or the percentage of
women taking hormone replacement therapy (HRT)
(Table 1). There was no difference in indications for
diagnostic hysteroscopies between groups (Table 2).
Women in the anesthetic group had statistically significantly less pain during the procedure than women
in the placebo group (2.2 6 1.9 and 3.7 6 2.5, respectively; P , .001). Women with abnormal uterine findings (endometrial cancer, submucous myoma, endometrial polyps, or intrauterine adhesions [Table 3]) and
normal endometriums had pain scores of 2.2 6 1.9 and
3.2 6 2.4, respectively (P , .002). Analysis of variance
on those two factors detected no interaction between
the lidocaine group and abnormal uterine findings.
When we adjusted for those factors, the relationship

between lidocaine spray and pain scores did not
change. Women who had cervical dilation and those
who did not had pain scores of 4.1 6 2.5 and 2.7 6 2.3,
respectively (P 5 .02).
No procedure was abandoned because of excessive
pain or other complications. One woman in the placebo
group had a severe vagal response. No women required
additional analgesia or hospitalization. All women left
our outpatient clinic within 1 hour of the end of the
procedure.
Discussion
Our study showed that aerosol spray lidocaine on the
cervix reduced pain and discomfort after diagnostic
hysteroscopy. Previous reports on diagnostic hysteroscopy with intracervical,7 paracervical,8,13 or topical
uterine anesthesia10,11,14 nerve blocks did not provide
adequate evidence that local anesthesia was efficacious
for reducing pain. Few randomized controlled trials
were done to evaluate efficacy of local anesthesia.
Broadbent et al7 found no advantage in using intracervical lidocaine nerve block for outpatient hysteroscopy.
Johanson et al8 reported that paracervical lidocaine had
no significant effect on reducing pain during laser
ablation of the cervical transformation zone. A study on
paracervical nerve block9 in outpatient diagnostic hysteroscopy confirmed that hysteroscopy is reliable for
assessing intrauterine disease and is acceptable by most
women, but it had no randomization or control groups.
In a randomized controlled trial on paracervical anesthesia, Vercellini et al13 did not find any decrease in
pain during hysteroscopy and endometrial biopsy. Topical anesthesia was reported to decrease pain during
outpatient hysteroscopy10,11 but not significantly.
There are advantages to local anesthetic spray over
intracervical or paracervical injection. It is a painless
application, and there is no danger of bleeding and
potentially less risk of infection and intravasation.7–9
Our findings are similar to these of Davis et al,12 who
reported that lidocaine spray had beneficial effects in
reducing discomfort. However, in their study nearly
15% of the women in both groups required additional
analgesia, and seven of 120 had to have procedures
using general anesthesia. They concluded that the aerosol was associated with a placebo effect rather than a
pharmacologic effect. Zullo et al15 reported that prilocaine spray plus lidocaine cream was more effective
than lidocaine spray for decreasing pain during placement of the tenaculum and for shoulder pain after the
procedure. However, they used the tenaculum in every
case and a rigid hysteroscope of 5 mm, and the uterine
cavity was distended with carbon dioxide.
Compared with those reports, our study was a prospective placebo-controlled trial using a flexible hysteroscope with no tenaculum, but in which dilation of
the cervix was needed. Therefore, women tolerated the
procedure better because none needed additional analgesia and none had shoulder pain resulting from the
use of normal saline. The interval between application
of lidocaine and insertion of the hysteroscope should be
more than 4 minutes.16 In a previous report,12 the
interval was not specified, and in another report,15 the
anesthesia was applied immediately before the procedure and might have caused bias.
Our study sought to identify factors that contribute to
pain and found correlation with uterine disease. That
finding needs further investigation. It could be explained by the longer duration of the procedure and the
use of more saline when the operator suspected abnormality, because those elements were not examined in
our study. It could also be attributed to pathophysiology of uterine contractions, or perhaps that women
with no uterine cavity abnormalities feel relief, especially when they can see the image on the screen, and
they might report lower degrees of pain.
