Keywords: Hysteroscopy; Topical anesthesia; Lidocaine; Prilocaine
Although office hysteroscopy is well tolerated
without any anesthesia 1 , in some instances this w x
exam can be perceived as very painful, thus requiring an anaesthetic approach to minimize
patient discomfort 2w x ]4 . The aim of this prospective randomized study was to compare the efficacy
of two modalities of local anesthesia on different
steps of diagnostic hysteroscopy.
From January 1995 to September 1996, 180
patients were included in the study and randomly
allocated in group A or B. All patients not included in the study and with the same outcome
measures recorded were considered as a control
group group C . Ž .

shots of Lidocaine spray, containing 10 mg of
xilocaine per dose, were directed on the esocervix
and two doses 3 cm inside the cervical canal,
immediately before the procedure. In the control
group group C no topical anesthesia was used. Ž .
A 5-mm hysteroscope Karl Storz Gmbh, Tuttlin- Ž
gen, Germany was used by an experienced gyne- .
cologist to perform the exam.
The subjective pain was recorded on the basis
of a four point scale. The pain experienced at any
step of the procedure were significantly different
among the treated groups and the controls Table Ž

cant reduction of the pain at the placement of the

respectively . Furthermore, in the group receiving .
prilocaine cream the intensity of the shoulder
pain, recorded 10 min after the accomplishment
of the exam, was significantly lower than in the
other two groups Ž . P-0.05 . These data could be
related to the lubricating effect of the cream
reducing the operative time and consequently the
amount of CO insufflated into the peritoneal 2
cavity.
In conclusion, we can safely indicate from our
data a beneficial effect of using a local anesthetic
approach, at least in those hysteroscopies presumed to be for whatever reasons more cumbersome to perform, keeping in mind that these
situations are anyway infrequent 2 . w x
