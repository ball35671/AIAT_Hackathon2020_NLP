 Introduction
 Several diagnostic modalities are currently used to explore abnormal uterine bleeding, including transvaginal
ultrasound with or without contrast infusion, (office)
hysteroscopy and endometrial sampling. Although those
techniques are well accepted, patients may still experience moderate to severe pain during some of the procedures [1] . Recently the instillation of gel instead of saline
has been proposed for sonohysterography [2] . In an earlier prospective observational cohort study, we observed
that the procedure-related pain during contrast sonohysterography, as well as during subsequent hysteroscopy
and endometrial sampling was less in the gel infusion sonohysterography (GIS) group as compared to the saline
contrast sonohysterography group [3] .
 The aim of the present randomized study was to evaluate if the addition of lidocaine to the gel used for GIS
would further reduce the pain as experienced during GIS.

 Abstract
Background: To evaluate if the addition of lidocaine to the
gel used for gel infusion sonohysterography (GIS) reduces
pain experienced during GIS or subsequent hysteroscopy.
Methods: A total of 142 consecutive patients were randomized using computer-generated random integers. In 79 patients, GIS was performed with a gel containing lidocaine
(Instillagel  ) and in 63 patients the gel did not contain lidocaine (Endosgel  ). Immediately after GIS, 132 patients (94%)
underwent office hysteroscopy. The women were asked to
fill in a questionnaire including a 100-mm visual analogue
scale (VAS) score after each examination. Results: The mean
age (SD) was 50.8 (12.1) years; 58.5% were premenopausal
and 15.6% were nulliparous. The median (interquartile range
(IR)) VAS score during GIS for all women was 6 (19.5): 8 (21) for
the lidocaine group versus 5 (18.2) for those who received
gel without lidocaine. The median (IR) VAS scores during hysteroscopy in the total group, the Instillagel group and the
Endosgel group were 15.5 (43.2), 24 (35) and 9 (52), respectively. None of the differences were statistically significant.

Secondly, we evaluated if the addition of lidocaine to gel
instillated prior to office hysteroscopy reduces the procedure-related pain. The effect of gel with and without lidocaine was compared.
 Materials and Methods
 This study was a randomized clinical trial conducted between
December 2006 and October 2007 at the Department of Gynaecology of the University Hospitals Leuven, Belgium. The study
was approved by the hospital’s Medical Ethics Committee, and
written informed consent was provided by all patients.
 A total of 142 consecutive patients presenting at the department’s One-Stop Bleeding Clinic were randomized into one of the
two groups using numbers generated randomly by a computer
[http://www.random.org/intergers/]. The numbers were picked
independently of each other and may therefore contain duplicates. Because the randomness comes from atmospheric noise,
meaning that the numbers are picked independently of each other like rolls of a die, the distribution is not necessarily 50/50. The
allocations were placed in opaque-sealed numbered envelopes.
The ultrasound was performed using a GE Voluson E8 ultrasound
machine with a 3D transvaginal probe. Gels with and without lidocaine were used. Both gels are commercially available and have
an identical content (sodium lactate, chlorhexidine digluconate,
methyl p -hydroxybenzoate and propyl p -hydroxybenzoate) besides that Endosgel  (Farco-Pharma GmbH, Cologne, Germany)
does not contain lidocaine, while Instillagel  (Farco-Pharma
GmbH) does contain 2% lidocaine. The gel was warmed to 37 ° C
to increase viscosity and to facilitate the instillation and was infused through a 2.0-mm neonatal suction catheter. All GIS were
performed by the same examiner (T.V.). GIS failed in 3 patients
due to cervical stenosis. Within 30 min after GIS, 132 patients
(94%) underwent office hysteroscopy according to the department’s bleeding clinic’s protocol. Hysteroscopy was performed
without local anesthesia using a 3-mm rigid Storz  hysteroscope
with a single inflow channel: a speculum was inserted and the
cervix was cleaned with a water solution of cetrimonium bromide
0.5% and chlorhexidine 0.05%. The hysteroscopy was performed
mostly without the use of a tenaculum and without dilatation of
the cervix. Distention of the cavity was achieved by normal saline
and the pressure for distending the cavity was supplied by a pressure cuff pumped up to 0.1 bar. The speculum was removed once
the scope had been inserted through the cervical canal.
 The patients as well as the medical staff performing the hysteroscopy were unaware which gel had been used. The examiner
performing the GIS however was aware of the random allocation.
The women were asked to fill in a questionnaire including a 100-
mm visual analogue scale (VAS) score about their pain perception
during the different procedures: 0 indicating the procedure was
not painful at all, and 100 indicating it was the most painful experience one could imagine. The patients had time to fill it in
after the ultrasound/GIS procedure and after the hysteroscopy.
They completed the questionnaire without the help of any staff
member, and were asked to return it at the desk before leaving the
clinic.
 Statistical analysis used the Mann-Whitney U test to determine the statistical significance of differences in the continuous
non-parametric variables between two groups, namely age, endometrial thickness and VAS score. The 2
 or Fisher’s exact test were

 Results
 Of the 142 randomized patients, 79 were allocated to
gel with lidocaine (Instillagel), whereas 63 patients received a gel without lidocaine (Endosgel). The mean age
(SD) was 50.8 (12.1) years; 58.5% were premenopausal
and 15.6% were nulliparous ( table 1 ). The results of the
final diagnosis are given in table 2 . Altogehther 99 patients (70%) returned the questionnaire including the
VAS score.
 The median (interquartile range (IR) VAS) score during GIS was 6 (19.5) for the total group; 8 (21) for the lidocaine group versus 5 (18.2) for those who received gel
without lidocaine. The median (IR) VAS scores during
hysteroscopy in the total group, the Instillagel group and
the Endosgel group were 15.5 (43.2), 24 (35) and 9 (52),
respectively ( table 3 ). None of the differences were statistically significant.
 No major adverse effects were observed during the
study, and all patients were able to leave the clinic within
1 h after the last examination.
 Discussion
 In the present randomized trial we showed that the addition of lidocaine to the gel – used either for GIS or prior to office hysteroscopy – does not reduce procedurerelated pain. In a previous study we reported lower pain
scores during contrast sonography of the uterine cavity
as well as during subsequent hysteroscopy and endometrium biopsy when gel was used instead of saline for contrast sonohysterography [3] . Gel may facilitate transcervical instrumentation due to its lubrification qualities,
causing less discomfort for the patient. Although procedure-related pain is considered tolerable during saline
contrast sonohysterography or hysteroscopy [4] , some patients might benefit from some pain relief. Different studTable 2. F inal diagnosis

ies showed that anesthesia of the cervix, either by paracervical block [5] (randomized open label trial, using 1%
mepivacaine) or using topical lidocaine gel [6] (randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled) does not reduce
the pain experienced during hysteroscopy or endometrial sampling. Studies on the use of topical anesthesia into
the uterine cavity give conflicting results. Two relatively
small randomized double-blind studies using mepivacaine injected through the cervix prior to hysteroscopy
or endometrial sampling found a beneficial effect [7, 8] .
Using lidocaine 2% prior to endometrial biopsy, Hui et al.
[9] also reported lower pain scores in the treated group,
whereas both Lau et al. [10] (90 patients) and Wong et al.
[6] (500 women) did not find any improvement in the
pain experienced during hysteroscopy or endometrial
sampling after lidocaine instillation (all three studies [6,
9, 10] were randomized and double-blind). The only randomized study using intrauterine lidocaine 2% gel [11]
prior to Vabra endometrial sampling in 308 patients did
not show any pain reduction in the lidocaine group.
 The limitation of the study is the dropout rate of 30%,
caused by the number of patients who failed to return the
questionnaire. This may preclude definitive conclusions.
However, since the comparison between gel with and
without lidocaine was performed for each procedure separately, and since, at randomization, the numbers generated randomly by a computer were picked independently
of each other, our data are still relevant. However, our
conclusions should be confirmed in a larger series.
 In conclusion, the present randomized trial demonstrates no beneficial effect on patients’ pain perception
when adding lidocaine to the gel used for GIS or applied
prior to other transcervical procedures. However, definitive conclusions should be confirmed by a larger series.
