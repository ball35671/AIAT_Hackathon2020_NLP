Objective: To assess the efficacy of lignocaine gel in reducing the overall pain and pain of individual steps
during outpatient hysteroscopy in comparison with placebo (no anesthesia).
Design: A prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
Setting: Outpatient hysteroscopy clinic in a regional hospital in Hong Kong.
Patient(s): A total of 500 Chinese patients undergoing outpatient hysteroscopy.
Intervention(s): Application of lignocaine gel to the cervix during outpatient hysteroscopy.
Main Outcome Measure(s): Mean pain score using present pain intensity, overall pain score measured by
total area under the curve, and the pain score of individual steps in the procedure in patients receiving
lignocaine gel were compared with those of patients having no anesthesia. The failure rate and poor-view rate
in both groups were also compared.
Result(s): There were no statistically significant differences in mean pain score, overall pain score, and pain
score of individual steps between the lignocaine group and controls. The failure rate and poor-view rate also
showed no statistically significant differences.
Conclusion(s): Outpatient hysteroscopy without anesthesia is acceptable to most Chinese women, and the
local application of lignocaine gel is not effective in reducing pain. (Fertil Sterilt 2000;73:1234–7. ©2000 by

Hysteroscopic examination with endometrial sampling is currently the most informative
investigation for patients with abnormal uterine
bleeding or for those suspected of having endometrial pathology. Previously, this procedure was frequently performed under general
or regional anesthesia. However, performing
hysteroscopy as a day procedure under local or
no anesthesia is gaining wider acceptance (1),
and this can reduce the risks of anesthesia and
disturbance in daily activities of the patient.
Nevertheless, before undergoing the hysteroscopic examination, many patients express
concern about the severity of pain they will
experience.
In our department, we have performed
.1,000 outpatient hysteroscopic examinations
under no anesthesia since 1995 (2). Most of our
patients find the procedure acceptable, and our
complication rate is minimal and comparable
to those of most other centers. Previously, some
investigators had commented that the use of
paracervical block in outpatient hysteroscopy
was more painful than the hysteroscopic procedure itself (3). In a double-blind, placebocontrolled trial, Lau et al. (4) studied 100 women undergoing outpatient hysteroscopy, with
half of them having paracervical anesthesia.
The results showed that paracervical anesthesia
not only failed to reduce pain during outpatient
hysteroscopy, but also carried a risk of introducing bradycardia and hypotension (4).
Davies et al. (5) assessed the efficacy of
lignocaine spray in a randomized, doubleblind, placebo-controlled trial involving 120
patients. It was found that women treated with

lignocaine spray experienced less pain on cervical grasping
only; there were no other statistically significant differences
in the outcomes between lignocaine and the control group
(5). In contrast, Wieser et al. (6) concluded that lignocaine
spray was able to alleviate pain during cervical passage and
was effective in reducing failed hysteroscopies. However,
historic controls were used in this trial: 150 patients in the
control group who underwent hysteroscopy followed by
another 150 patients who received lignocaine spray. Gaining
experience in the procedure might be an important factor in
pain reduction. On the whole, the sample sizes of most of the
previous studies were small and the results were inconsistent
(5–7).
The aim of the present study was to evaluate the severity
of pain experienced during each step of a hysteroscopic
examination and to determine whether local application of
lignocaine gel can reduce the overall pain or the pain of any
step of the procedure.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Ethical approval was obtained for the study from the
hospital ethics committee.
From April 1998 to April 1999, all Chinese women who
were referred to the Outpatient Hysteroscopy Clinic of
Kwong Wah Hospital for investigation of abnormal uterine
bleeding or suspected endometrial pathology were told about
the possible role of local application of lignocaine gel in
reducing pain during the procedure. Patients who spoke a
dialect or had other communication problems were excluded.
Informed consent was obtained from all patients who agreed
to participate in the study.
Patients who enrolled in the study were then randomized
into two groups, the lignocaine group and the placebo group,
with the use of a predetermined randomization chart. Five
hundred patients were recruited, with 250 patients in each
arm. Hysteroscopy was performed in turn by two gynecologists who had performed .400 outpatient hysteroscopic
examinations.
All patients were placed in the lithotomy position. Vaginal examination was performed to check the size and axis of
the uterus and any adnexal masses. A bivalve speculum was
then inserted, and the cervix was exposed. The cervix, fornix, and vagina were cleansed with 0.015% chlorhexidine
acetate and then swabbed dry. For patients in the lignocaine
group, approximately 4 mL of 2% lignocaine gel was applied
to the cervix by the research nurse. The gel was squeezed
onto a piece of gauze, and the gauze was then rubbed and
packed over the surface of the cervix for approximately 20
seconds. For patients in the placebo group, an equal amount
of KY Jelly (Johnson and Johnson Medical, UK) was applied
similarly. Neither the patient nor the gynecologist who performed the hysteroscopic examination knew whether it was
lignocaine gel or KY Jelly that was applied. Hysteroscopy
then proceeded in the usual way.
The bivalve speculum was changed to a Sims’ speculum.
The cervix was grasped by a single-tooth tenaculum and the
uterus was sounded. A standard 4-mm rigid hysteroscope
with a 30° fore-oblique lens in a 5-mm sheath was inserted.
If the os was too tight to insert the hysteroscope, the cervix
was dilated with Hegar dilators (up to size no. 5). Carbon
dioxide was used as the inflating medium. The hysteroscope
was connected to a color television set, and the image was
viewed by the doctor and the patient. A complete inspection
of the uterine cavity was made. After inspection, endometrial
sampling was done with a Vabra aspirator (Rocket Medical,
England).
Starting at insertion of the Sims’ speculum, the patient
graded the severity of pain at 1-minute intervals with use of
the Present Pain Intensity Scale (8). This is a six-category
descriptive scale used to assess the pain experienced during
medical procedures. The verbal descriptors are ranked by
increasing intensity and are scored on a 0 to 5 numeric scale:
0 5 no pain; 1 5 mild pain; 2 5 discomforting pain; 3 5
distressing pain; 4 5 horrible pain; and 5 5 intolerable pain,
with need to terminate the procedure. The descriptors were
translated into standard Cantonese (the mother tongue in
Hong Kong).
The pain score was charted against time, as shown in
Figure 1. The mean pain score, peak pain score, and overall
pain score (total area under the curve) were assessed for each
patient, and the results of the lignocaine group were compared with those of the placebo group. Statistical analysis
was performed with the Student’s t-test.

RESULTS
The demographic data of the two groups of patients are
presented in Table 1. There were no statistically significant
differences between the groups with regard to mean age,
parity, history of vaginal delivery, and menopausal status.
For the placebo group, whose results reflected the pain
pattern experienced by patients during a hysteroscopic examination without anesthesia, the most painful step was
cervical dilatation (with a mean score of 2.43), followed by
aspiration of tissue (mean score of 2.25).
There were no statistically significant differences between
the groups of patients with regard to the mean pain score,
peak pain score, overall accumulated pain (as expressed by
total area under the curve), duration of the procedure, or
overall pain per minute (as expressed by area under the curve
per minute) (Table 2). When individual steps in the procedure were assessed, the pain scores of each step also were
not significantly different between the groups (Table 3).
Among patients in the lignocaine group, 74 required
cervical dilatation, compared with 84 patients in the placebo
group. There were no statistically significant differences
between these two groups with regard to the mean pain
score, peak pain score, overall accumulated pain score, overall pain per minute, and duration of the procedure. In addition, there was no statistically significant difference with
regard to the pain scores of individual steps of hysteroscopy.
There was a good correlation between the hysteroscopic
diagnosis and histologic findings, with the same correlation
rate of 94.4% in both the lignocaine and placebo groups.
The failure rate was defined as failure to complete the
hysteroscopic examination because of either severe pain or
technical difficulty in negotiating the hysteroscope through
the cervical os. Failure occurred in 0.8% (2 of 250 patients)
in the lignocaine group and 0.4% (1 in 250 patients) in the
placebo group (P..05). The rate of poor hysteroscopic
view was 3.6% (9 in 250 patients) in both the lignocaine and
placebo groups.
One patient in the lignocaine group and two patients in
the placebo group had a vasovagal attack after the procedure
(P..05).
DISCUSSION
The experience of pain is composed of sensory, emotional, and cognitive components. The interaction of biologic, psychological, and social factors has long been considered an important determinant in the expression of pain,
and it is also this complicated interaction that makes the
study of pain response difficult.
Pain can be measured in two aspects, namely, pain threshold and pain tolerance. Pain threshold is that level of stimulus at which pain is first recognized; pain tolerance is that
greater level of stimulus at which the subject requests cessation of stimulus (9). Pain threshold is mostly dependent on
physiological factors, whereas pain tolerance is more related
to psychological factors (9). There is no evidence to suggest
that the neurophysiologic detection of pain (threshold) varies
across cultural boundaries, but pain tolerance does reflect the

behavioral aspect of pain, which is profoundly influenced by
culture (10).
Woodrow et al. (9) studied the nature and extent of group
differences in pain tolerance in response to mechanical pressure on the Achilles tendon in 41,119 subjects (including
34,077 whites, 1,649 Asians, and 5,393 blacks). The results
revealed that whites showed the highest average pain tolerance (males 29.2 and females 16.1 lb/in2
); blacks were
second (males 26.5 and females 15.2 lb/in2
) and Asians were
lowest (males 24.3 and females 14.4 lb/in2
). All differences
between racial groups were statistically significant (9).
Knox compared pain threshold and pain tolerance toward
cold pressor stimuli in 24 Asians (Chinese and Malaysians)
and 24 Americans. Again, whites were found to have significantly higher tolerance than Asians (10). In contrast,
Clark et al. found higher pain tolerance in Nepalese Buddhists than in Occidental subjects of Jewish or Christian
descent. The difference occurred because the Nepalese were
more accustomed to harsh living and working conditions.
However, this study was of small size, involving only 11
subjects (11).
Because of the possible effect of cultural influences on the
expression of pain, the recruitment of patients undergoing
the present study of pain score in hysteroscopy was limited
to Chinese women. Moreover, the possibility of differences
in the verbal meaning of the various levels of pain intensity
in different languages and dialects was anticipated, so the
subjects were further limited to Cantonese-speaking Chinese
women.
The present study showed that local application of lignocaine gel is not effective in reducing overall pain during
diagnostic hysteroscopic examination. It is also not useful in
reducing pain in any individual step of hysteroscopy. It
cannot shorten the examination or improve the diagnostic
accuracy by promoting a more comfortable examination and
thereby facilitating inspection of the endometrial cavity.
However, even without any anesthesia, the mean pain
score was only 1.58 and the overall pain score per minute
was 1.69, and hysteroscopy was performed successfully in
99.6% of the patients. Satisfactory viewing was achieved in
96.4% of the patients. Therefore, outpatient hysteroscopy
under no anesthesia is acceptable to most Chinese women,
and the local application of lignocaine gel is not helpful in
reducing pain.
