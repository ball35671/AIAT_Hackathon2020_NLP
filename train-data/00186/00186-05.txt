Abstract
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficiency of paracervical anesthesia in reducing pain and the incidence of vasovagal reactions during diagnostic hysteroscopy with endometrial biopsy in postmenopausal women. STUDY DESIGN: A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study. Seventy-two postmenopausal women underwent diagnostic hysteroscopy and endometrial biopsy. Hysteroscopies were performed by using a lens-based endoscope with a diameter of < 4 mm and endometrial biopsies by using a 3-mm Novak's curette. Ten milliliters of 1.5 mepivacaine or saline solution was injected at the junction of the cervix and vagina (at the 4 and 8 o'clock positions) by means of an appropriate needle before performing the intrauterine procedures. Referred pain was evaluated by means of a visual analogue scale; continuous monitoring of heart rate and blood pressure was also performed. RESULTS: Paracervical anesthesia significantly reduced pain at hysteroscopy and biopsy. The incidence of vasovagal reactions was also significantly lower in the anesthetized group. CONCLUSION: Paracervical anesthesia is effective for hysteroscopy and endometrial biopsy in postmenopausal women and may be indicated particularly for patients with cervical stenosis, for very anxious subjects and in all situations where pain stimulation could trigger threatening side effects due to systemic pathologies.
