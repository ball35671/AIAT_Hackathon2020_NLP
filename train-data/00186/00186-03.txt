Outpatient hysteroscopy is now regarded as the investigation
of choice for abnormal uterine bleeding as there is no longer
any doubt that hysteroscopy is more effective than conventional curettage at identifying intrauterine pathology (Gimpelson, 1984; Goldrath & Sherman, 1985; Gimpelson &
Rappold, 1988; Loffer 1989) as it allows direct inspection of
the uterine cavity, directed biopsy and appropriate therapeutic
management. Another important advantage of hysteroscopy is
that it can be performed without general anaesthesia and, in our
experience, only 28.5% of patients required local anaesthesia;
this was significantly associated with the need to dilate the cervix (Hill et al. 1992). In order to assess the role and efficacy of
local anaesthesia before hysteroscopy, a randomized placebo
controlled double blind trial was performed comparing intracervical lignocaine with saline.
Subjects and methods
One hundred consecutive women undergoing outpatient hysteroscopy for abnormal uterine bleeding consented to be
included in the study; prior support for the study was obtained
from the local medical ethics committee. Each patient was
randomly allocated to receive either lignocaine 1 % or normal
saline intracervically. Randomization was performed using a
predetermined randomization code in a double blind fashion.
Before hysteroscopy, assessments of patient mood, anxiety,
presence and severity of lower abdominal and shoulder tip pain
were made using a 10 cm visual analogue scale.
The intracervical injection was performed using a 22 French

gauge needle through which 10 ml of either lignocaine 1%
with 1:200 000 adrenaline or normal saline was injected into
the cervix at 1, 5, 7, and 11 o’clock. Hysteroscopy was performed at least 5 min later using a 4 mm HAMOU 1 microcolpohysteroscope with a 30 degree fore-oblique lens and a 5.5
mm diagnostic sheath. The uterine cavity was distended with
carbon dioxide via a HAMOU microhysteroflator; illumination was provided by a high intensity cold light source (250 W)
via a fibre optic lead (all equipment manufactured by Karl
Storz GmbH, Germany). The images were viewed on a high
resolution colour monitor using a chip camera. Endometrial
biopsies were performed where indicated.
Assessments of both lower abdominal and shoulder tip pain
were made using visual analogue scales before, during,
immediately after and 30 min after hysteroscopy. The women
were also questioned as to whether the hysteroscopy or the
intracervical injection was the more painful. The results were
statistically analysed using the Mann-Whitney U-test and x2
test.
Results
The median age of the women was 43 (range 25-59) years; 2%
were post-menopausal; 16% had never been pregnant and 3 1 %
had been sterilized previously. There was no significant difference in any of these characteristics between the lignocaine and
saline groups. There was also no difference in the women’s
mood or anxiety, and occurrence of stomach or shoulder pain
prior to hysteroscopy between the two groups.
The indications for hysteroscopy are shown in Fig. 1. Hysteroscopy was unsuccessful in three women: two (one from

each group) found the procedure too painful, and one patient
fainted after the intracervical injection of saline. These women
were excluded from further analysis.
During hysteroscopy, 47 women experienced no, or mild,
abdominal pain, 3 1 moderate and 19 severe abdominal pain,
but only 12 had shoulder tip pain (Table 1). There was no significant difference between the incidence of stomach or shoulder tip pain between the women treated with lignocaine or
saline. Immediately after hysteroscopy, 53 women had mild
pain, but only two severe pain; 26 women had residual shoulder tip pain. There was no difference in these rates between the
two groups. Thirty minutes later, 51 women still had some
degree of stomach pain and 19 shoulder tip pain, but again
these rates were no different between the lignocaine and saline
groups. In total, 43% of women found the intracervical injection the most painful part of the procedure and a further 22%
found the injection at least as painful as the hysteroscopy.
Discussion
Approximately one-third of all gynaecological consultations
are as a result of abnormal uterine bleeding (Coulter et al.
1988) and this proportion rises to almost three-quarters for
pen- or post-menopausal patients (Mencaglia et al. 1987). Traditionally, over half these patients would have been investigated by dilatation and curettage (Coulter et al. 1991),
accounting for 26.7% of all gynaecological operative procedures (Mackenzie & Bibby 1978). Out-patient hysteroscopy
is now the preferred method of investigation for these patients
and more and more hysteroscopies are now being performed
without general anaesthesia.
The use of intracervical lignocaine has been shown to be
effective as a local anaesthetic when performing procedures on
the uterus, such as dilatation and curettage and suction termination of pregnancy. It is surprising, then, to find the results of
this study show that there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups with regard to discomfort associated with hysteroscopy. Those women receiving intracervical
lignocaine experienced no less discomfort than those receiving
saline. This may be a reflection of the type of analgesia used.
The sensory nerve supply of the uterus is derived from Frankenhauer’s plexus (parasympathetic S2-4) which supplies the
cervix and the lower portion of the uterus; however, the fundal
region derives its sensory innervation from the ovarian nerve
plexus. Therefore, intracervical lignocaine will be effective in
reducing the sensitivity of the cervix but will be ineffective at
blocking fundal innervation of the uterus. It is possible that
paracervical block, either alone or in conjunction with intracervical block, will be a more effective anaesthetic for hysteroscopy, although this was found not to be the case with laser
ablation of the cervical transformation zone (Johnson et al.
1989).
Another aspect highlighted by this study is the fact that the
majority of patients (65%) found the intracervical injection
either more, or as painful, as the hysteroscopy. This in itself
raises the question of ‘who are we treating?’, the patient or the
physician. It soon became apparent to those conducting the
study that the administration of the intracervical injection,
whether lignocaine or saline, was itself a painful procedure. In
fact, with one patient the procedure had to be abandoned as she
fainted following injection of saline. It may well be that administration of anaesthetic solution through a narrower bore
needle, such as with dental syringe, may be better tolerated but
this needs to be assessed. It would, therefore, appear that the
routine administration of intracervical lignocaine is not only
ineffective as pain relief during hysteroscopy but can also be
counter-productive. We would advocate the use of this form of
local anaesthesia in cases where cervical dilatation is required
and not as a routine.

Histological sampling of the endometrium-A comparison between
formal curettage and the Pipelle sampler

Outpatient endometrial sampling using a Pipelle sampler (Cornier 1984) has been shown to be an acceptable technique, comparing favourably with the Vabra aspirator (Kaunitz et al.
1988; Eddowes et al. 1990). These studies have compared
alternative out-patient methods but they have not assessed the
accuracy of the diagnosis obtained by the sampler compared
with traditional dilatation and curettage (D & C), which was
the objective of our study.
Subjects and methods
One hundred eighty-seven patients (age range 35-84 years)
who had been admitted for dilatation and curettage under
general anaesthesia, and who had not previously had outpatient endometrial sampling, were included in the study. They
were prepared in the usual manner for D & C, but immediately
before the procedure, a Pipelle sampler (Prodimed, Neuillyen-Thelle, France) was used. The D & C was then performed in
the normal way. The Pipelle samples were not submitted with
the curettings but were labelled with a hospital number only

and examined in batches on a separate occasion to ensure
‘blind’ assessment. All the samples were examined by one histopathologist (ASH.). The amount of tissue obtained by each
method was not assessed quantitatively.
Samples were obtained with Pipelles from 171 women and
by curettage in 138 women. In two of the 171, the Pipelle provided some tissue but was insufficient to allow a diagnosis.
Results
In 138 cases, the reports on both sampling procedures were
identical, except that in 12 of them curettage identified benign
polyps which the Pipelle sampler would not have been
expected to detect. The four cases of carcinoma were detected
by both methods. In a further 26 cases, one of the procedures
yielded no tissue and the other yielded material reported as
blood, mucus, or atrophic or endocervical tissue. Thus, in 164
out of 187 women, the two techniques were regarded as providing the same results.
Table 1 compares the histological findings in the 23 discrepant cases. In 11 cases, simple hyperplasia or atypia was
reported in the Pipelle sample but either there were no curettings or they were normal. We think that the foci of abnormality were small and preferentially removed by the first sampling
procedure. They may, therefore, have been detected by curettage if that had been the first procedure. No cases of atypia or
carcinoma were missed by the Pipelle.
In six women, the Pipelle samples showed normal proliferative endometrium, but foci of hyperplasia were seen in the
curettings. Three penmenopausal women with irregular bleeding had fragments of proliferative endometrium on curettage,
but the Pipelle sample was inadequate for diagnosis in one and
no tissue was obtained in the other two. The discrepancy in the
histology was inconsequential in the management of these nine
