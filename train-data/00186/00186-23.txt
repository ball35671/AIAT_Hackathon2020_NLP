 Introduction
 Diagnostic hysteroscopy, which is the gold standard
modality in the visualization of the uterine cavity, is a
minimally invasive procedure, which then allows some
surgical procedures to be easily applied under office conditions [1, 2] .
 Although diagnostic hysteroscopy can be easily tolerated, it can sometimes be painful [3, 4] . Several patient or
technique-associated factors can cause pain. In addition
to the tenaculum, speculum, the diameter of the hysteroscope, the duration of the procedure, and additional procedures performed at the same time (e.g. endometrial biopsy) can affect pain [5] . These factors may prevent the
accurate evaluation of pain caused only because of the
hysteroscope passing into the uterine cavity. Lower levels
of pain have been reported from diagnostic hysteroscopy
applied with the vaginoscopy ‘no touch technique’ compared to conventional hysteroscopy using a speculum

 Abstract
Backgrounds/Aims: The aim of this study was to investigate
the effect of rectal and intrauterine anesthesia during vaginoscopic hysteroscopy. Methods: This was a randomized,
double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients were randomized to rectal indomethacin, intrauterine lidocaine and
placebo groups. Patients with conditions that could cause or
contribute to pelvic pain were excluded. Pain was evaluated
with Visual Analog Scale, when the cervical canal was passed,
while within the cavity and at 10 min after procedure. The
Analog Pain Scale scores of the 3 groups were compared
with the Kruskal–Wallis 1-way analysis of variance test. A value of p < 0.05 was accepted as statistically significant. Results: The study included a total of 206 patients. No difference was seen between the groups in respect of indication,
age, gravid and duration of procedure. While the anesthesia
was determined as superior to the placebo in reducing pain
at all 3 stages (p < 0.05), intrauterine lidocaine was determined to be more effective than rectal indomethacin in reducing pain within the cavity and 10 min after the procedure
(p < 0.05). Conclusion: Rectal or intrauterine anesthesia ap-

and tenaculum [6–9] . In the vaginoscopic technique, pain
and the effect of the anesthesia used can be more accurately evaluated. To the best of our knowledge, there have
been no prospective studies that have evaluated the benefit of anesthesia in hysteroscopy applied for diagnostic
purposes alone, by minimalising the factors that could
cause pain (e.g. use of tenaculum and speculum) independent of the procedure itself.
 In this prospective study, we compared intrauterine
lidocaine, rectal indomethacin and placebo in hysteroscopy applied with the vaginoscopic method.
 Material and Method
 This randomized, double-blind study was conducted at Bakirköy Dr. Sadi Konuk Training and Research Hospital, between
July 2014 and March 2015. Approval for the study was granted by
the Local Ethics Committee, decision no. 2014-09-21.
 The study included 206 patients with suspected endometrial
polyp, abnormal uterine bleeding or diagnosis of myoma and infertility. Patients with conditions that could cause or contribute to
pelvic pain were excluded. These factors were evaluated: dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, a history of uterine surgery, chronic pelvic
pain, previous caesarean section or cervical canal surgery [10, 11] .
In addition, pregnant and patients with gastro-oesophageal diseases, which could inhibit the use of rectal non-steroid and those
using medication for allergies were excluded from the study.
 Informed consent was obtained from all participants. Patients
were selected according to a random numbers table and were separated into 3 groups. The control group was administered with a
1,000 ml distention medium containing 18 ml serum physiologic
per 250 ml and a rectal placebo. The second group was administered
with a 1,000 ml distention medium containing 18 ml lidocaine per
250 ml (jetokain ampoule 20 mg 2% Adeka, Samsun, Turkey) [12]
and rectal placebo. The third group was administered with rectal
indomethacin suppository (Endol 100 mg supp. Deva, Istanbul,
Turkey) 45 min before the procedure [13] and with a 1,000 ml distention medium containing 18 ml serum physiologic per 250 ml.
The medications were administered to all the patients by a nurse.
The hysteroscopist and patient were blind. Diagnostic hysteroscopy
was applied with a rigid endoscope with a 3.5 mm single current
shaft with a 2.9 mm telescope (Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany).
Saline solution (0.09% sodium chloride) at room temperature was
used as the distention medium [14] . Intrauterine pressure of 70–80
mm Hg was provided with a pump (Wolf Illinois, USA).
 The procedure was applied by a single physician (MBS) experienced in hysteroscopy. All the patients were evaluated 1 or 2 days
after the end of menstrual bleeding. The procedure was applied
with the vaginoscopic technique without using tenaculum or speculum. The hysteroscope was inserted into the vagina without
touching the labia, and the posterior fornix was reached under observation without touching the vaginal walls. Then by pulling back
and sliding over the lower lip of the cervix, the external cervical os
was seen. The time of entry from the external os to passing into the
cavity and then from entering the cavity until the end of observation were recorded separately and the pain levels at those points.
Ten min after the end of the procedure, all the patients were evaluated again in respect of pain. A Visual Analog Scale (VAS) was
used in the evaluation of pain. In this scale of points from 0 to 10,
there are 5 different pictures of faces and the patients were asked
to indicate the pain they felt from these pictures and the appropriate points were scored [15] .
 Statistical evaluation of the data was made with SPSS for Windows version 11.5 software. The chi-square test was used in the
comparisons between the groups of indications, menopause status,
nulliparity and multiparity, duration was compared with the 1-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA) test, pain, age, parity, gravid, abortion, curettage and ectopic pregnancies were compared with the
Kruskal–Wallis and 1-way ANOVA tests. A value of p < 0.05 was
accepted as statistically significant.
 Results
 The total 206 patients comprised 68 (33%) in the placebo group, 76 (36.89%) in the lidocaine group and 62
(30.09%) in the indomethacin group.
 No statistically significant difference was determined
between the groups in terms of age, gravid, parity, abortion, curettage, menopause status or history of systemic
disease (p > 0.05). The most common indication for diagnostic hysteroscopy was suspected endometrial polyps
(78.64%) and no significant difference was determined between the groups in respect of indication types (p = 0.128;
 table 1 ). The time to passing the cervical canal and the observation period in the cavity were similar in the 3 groups
(p > 0.05). When the pain was evaluated, the pain scores of
the placebo group in the cervix, the cavity and 10 min after
the procedure were statistically and significantly higher
than those of the other 2 groups (p = 0.001). There were no
differences between rectal indomethacin and placebo with
regard to pain during cavity and 10 min after procedure
( table 2 ). While no difference was observed between the
lidocaine and indomethacin groups in the cervix pain
scores (p > 0.05), the scores in the cavity and at 10 min after the procedure were determined as statistically and significantly higher in the indomethacin group than the intrauterine lidocaine group (p = 0.001; table 2 ). There were
vasovagal side effects in 3 patients in placebo, in 4 patients
in lidocaine and in 4 patients in indomethacin groups.
 Discussion
 The results of this study showed that the use of intrauterine lidocaine or rectal indomethacin in hysteroscopy
applied with the vaginoscopic technique was more effective than a placebo in reducing pain during the procedure

(p < 0.05). In addition, the use of intrauterine lidocaine
was determined to be more effective than rectal indomethacin administered before the procedure in reducing
pain in the cavity and at 10 min after the procedure (p <
0.05).
 To be able to reduce and make a more accurate evaluation of the pain associated with the procedure itself, it is
necessary to minimize the factors except associated with
the cervix or uterine cavity. Experienced physician, using
small-diameter hysteroscope, reaching the cavity quickly
and comfortably with minimal trauma can reduce pain
[16–20] . A majority of studies related to pain control in
office hysteroscopy have been based on the application of
the conventional technique together with procedures such
as endometrial biopsy. However, there are relatively few
studies related to the necessity for anesthesia in diagnostic
hysteroscopy alone. Zupi et al. [21] reported that pain was
reduced with 5 ml 2% mepivacaine. Endometrial biopsy
was applied in that study but pain during the diagnostic
hysteroscopy was recorded before and after endometrial
biopsy. No information was given in respect of whether the
procedure was applied with conventional methods or with
the vaginoscope technique. Lau et al. [22] reported that 2%
lignocaine applied into the cavity had no superiority over

a placebo. In that study, pain was evaluated during hysteroscopy only, before biopsy was applied. After administering anesthesia, the mean VAS score of the placebo group
in hysteroscopy was determined as 3.6 and the anesthesia
group mean score was 3.1. The mean pain score was higher than our patients’ score. However, the procedure was
applied using speculum and tenaculum, which could have
contributed to the pain. In the current study, we were not
used instrument (speculum and tenaculum) to make more
accurate pain-related hysteroscope only and we have
shown that intrauterine lidocaine and rectal indomethacin
are more effective than placebo with respect to pain control. In a study by Hassa et al. [13] in which the vaginoscopic technique was used on 158 patients, it was reported
that rectal indomethacin and vaginal misoprostol were no
more effective in reducing pain than the placebo. In that
study, all the patients were infertile and a 4-mm hysteroscope was used. Conversely, in the current study, rectal
indomethacin was found to be more effective than the placebo. This disparity with the findings of the study by Hassa et al. [13] may be due to the low number of nulliparity
patients in the current study patient group.
 The uterus is a firmly innervated organ. Parasympathetic innervation of the corpus and cervix was provided
by the nerve fibers coming from the Frankhauser plexus
(S-2-4) and the sympathetic innervation was provided by
the nerve fibers coming from the ovarian plexus; these
nerve fibers terminated densely in the sub-endometrial
region. Pain is caused by the administration of a distention medium into the cavity or by the direct effects of manipulation of the nerve ends or by increased prostaglandin. By reaching these nerve fibers more quickly, intrauterine anesthesia provides effective pain control while
indomethacin reduces pain by inhibiting prostaglandin
[12, 23, 24] . But the most significant component of pain
felt during hysteroscopy probably originates from the
cervical canal. Factors arising from both the cervical canal
itself (e.g. detachment) and also from the diameter of the
hysteroscope can increase pain when passing through the
cervical canal [18, 25–27] . In this study, cases with cervical narrowness of a degree that would require dilatation
or cases with detachment were not included. In addition,
no premedication was administered for cervical preparation. Our study demonstrated that the pain during passing cervical canal was more in the placebo group than
other groups. But during cavity examination and 10 min
after, there was no significant difference between placebo
and rectal indomethacin groups, while lidocaine was
more effective. As explained earlier, lidocaine administered into the cavity directly reaches the nerve fibers in
the sub-endometrial region and more effective analgesia
may be provided by this route. This result can also support the need for anesthesia during office diagnostic hysteroscopy because of the cervical canal. Compared to previous reports in literature, the duration of the procedure
in the current study was seen to be short. However, the
procedure was considered to have started after visualization of the internal cervical os. Furthermore, as the procedures were short, that may have reduced the pain.
 This study can be considered significant, as it examined the hysteroscopy procedure alone by minimizing instrument- and patient-related factors, which could cause
pain. Therefore, the comparison of the benefit of anesthesia and the medications used can be considered to be
more objective. To the best of our knowledge, there is no
previous report in literature of a placebo-controlled study
of rectal indomethacin and intra cavitary lidocaine applied in hysteroscopy with the vaginoscopic technique.
However, the low number of cases in the 3 groups can be
evaluated as a limitation of the current study.
 In conclusion, anesthesia applied in diagnostic hysteroscopy made with the vaginoscopic technique under office conditions significantly reduces pain. In addition, intra cavitary anesthesia was seen to be superior to rectal
indomethacin. To be able to say whether or not anesthesia
is necessary in hysteroscopy applied with a vaginoscopic
approach, there is a need for randomized controlled studies and a review of those studies.
