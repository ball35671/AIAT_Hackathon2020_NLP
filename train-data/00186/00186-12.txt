Background: Several drugs have been used to reduce hysteroscopy-associated pain. Although the Royal College of
Obstetricians and Gynaecologists has recommended against the use of opiates in outpatient hysteroscopy, we wished to
investigate if opioids can be used if the appropriate opioid was given in the appropriate dose.
Aim: To study the effectiveness of tramadol 50 mg in reducing pain associated with outpatient hysteroscopy.
Materials and Methods: A prospective randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial conducted in the outpatient
hysteroscopy clinic at Cairo University Hospital. Main outcome measures were the severity of pain during the procedure,
immediately after the procedure and 30 minutes later assessed by a visual analogue scale (VAS). VAS of 0 indicates no
pain and VAS of 10 indicates the worst possible pain.
Results: A total of 140 women who had diagnostic outpatient hysteroscopy were randomised to receive oral tramadol
50 mg or placebo one h before performing outpatient hysteroscopy. There was no difference between the groups in the
age, parity, duration of the procedures or indications of hysteroscopy. The median pain score was significantly lower in
the tramadol group during the procedure (5 vs 6; P = 0.013), immediately after the procedure (3 vs 4; P < 0.036), and
30 minute later (1 vs 2; P = 0.034). Two women in the tramadol group reported nausea, but this was mild and did not
warrant cancelling the procedure.
Conclusions: Oral administration of tramadol 50 mg before hysteroscopy reduces the pain evoked by the procedure and
the drug was well tolerated by women.
Key words: hysteroscopy, pain, tramadol.
Introduction
Hysteroscopy is currently the most informative
investigation for women with abnormal uterine bleeding
and infertility.1 Office hysteroscopy is comparable with
surgical inpatient hysteroscopy but offers reduced
anaesthesia risks and decreased overall costs.2 Outpatient
hysteroscopy involves the use of miniaturised endoscopic
equipment to directly visualise the endometrial cavity,
without the need of formal theatre facilities or anaesthesia.3
However, the main limitation to the widespread use of
outpatient hysteroscopy is the occurrence of pain.4,5
In an attempt to reduce the outpatient hysteroscopyassociated pain, a lower uterine filling pressure was
recommended.6 Flexible hysteroscopy was also found to
reduce hysteroscopy-associated pain when compared with
rigid hysteroscopy.7
Several drugs have been used to reduce pain during the
procedure, including the use of topical anaesthetics,
opioids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(NSAIDs). Tramadol hydrochloride is an orally active
centrally acting synthetic opioid. It is an atypical analgesic
with a dual mechanism of action: serotonin and
norepinephrine reuptake inhibition and modest l-opioid
agonist. It has a lower incidence of respiratory depression,
cardiac depression, side effects on smooth muscle and
abuse potential as compared to typical opioid agents.8,9
Intravenous and intramuscular tramadol given before
hysteroscopy were shown to reduce pain associated with
hysteroscopy, but no data were available on the
effectiveness of oral tramadol.10,11
The study objective was to evaluate the effectiveness
and side effects of oral tramadol 50 mg in reducing pain
associated with outpatient hysteroscopy.
Materials and Methods
This was a single-centre, prospective, randomised, with
balanced randomisation (allocation ratio 1:1), double-blind
and placebo-controlled study. The study was approved by
the research ethics committee of Cairo University Hospital

and was registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov, registration
number NCT02068209. It was conducted in the
outpatient hysteroscopy clinic at Cairo University Hospital
from May 2014 to March 2015. The sample size was
calculated to detect a mean difference of one unit between
tramadol and placebo pain scores during the procedure
using VAS assuming that the within group standard
deviation would be 2. We would need to study 64 cases in
each group to be able to reject the null hypothesis that the
population means of the tramadol and placebo groups are
equal with probability (power) 0.8. We added six cases to
each arm accounting for any missing data ending in 70
cases in each group. The Type I error probability
associated with this test of the null hypothesis is 0.05.
Sample size calculation was performed using Stats Direct
statistical software version 2.7.2 for MS Windows, Stats
Direct Ltd., Cheshire, UK.
Recruited women were randomly divided into two equal
groups; Group 1 received an oral tramadol 50 mg
(Tramal, Memphis, Giza, Egypt) tablet and Group 2
received an oral placebo tablet similar in size, structure
and colour to tramadol. All women were of reproductive
age, and all procedures were scheduled to be done in the
postmenstrual period. Exclusion criteria included women
with known cardiac disease, known allergy to tramadol,
pelvic infections, pregnancy, suspected cervical cancer and
women with heavy bleeding. A registrar generated the
allocation sequence using computer-generated random
numbers and enclosed tramadol and placebo in
sequentially numbered sealed envelopes kept with the
attending nurse. The attending nurse allocated patients to
the groups. The nurse, the patient and the physician were
unaware of the drug used until the end of the study when
the codes were broken. All women received the enclosed
medication 1 h before the procedure.
The procedure was done in the lithotomy position. We
used a 30° angle 2.9 mm rigid hysteroscope with 3.8 mm
diagnostic sheath [Karl Storz, Germany]. Vaginoscopic
approach was used for insertion of the hysteroscope in all
cases (no use of speculum or tenaculum). The
hysteroscope was gently introduced into the uterine cavity
after visualisation of the cervix and identification of the
external os. We used saline as the distension medium and
the maximum pressure was set at 100 mm Hg. The
uterine cavity and tubal ostia were systematically
visualised. All the procedures were done by the same
operator using the same equipment.
The woman’s perception of pain was assessed for each
group in three occasions: During the procedure, after the
hysteroscope was introduced in the uterine cavity and a
panoramic view of the uterine was obtained, immediately
after the procedure when the hysteroscope was withdrawn
from the uterus, and 30 minutes after completing the
procedure. Pain was assessed with the use of a visual
analogue scale (VAS). VAS of 0 indicates no pain and
VAS of 10 indicates the worst possible pain. Women were
also asked to report any side effects. The primary outcome
was pain score during the procedure; secondary outcomes
included pain immediately after the procedure, 30 minutes
after the procedure and drug side effects.
Data were statistically described in terms of
mean  standard deviation (SD), frequencies (number
of cases) and percentages, medians and ranges when
appropriate. Comparison of numerical variables between
the study groups was done using Student t-test. For
comparing categorical data, Chi square (v2
) test was
performed. Exact test was used instead when the expected
frequency was <5. Median test was used to analyse the
pain scores data. P values <0.05 was considered
statistically significant. All statistical calculations were done
using computer program SPSS (Statistical Package for the
Social Science; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) release 15
for Microsoft Windows (2006).
Results
We approached 212 women referred to the outpatient
hysteroscopy clinic at Cairo University Hospital to
undergo diagnostic hysteroscopy. Women were invited to
participate in the study after providing clear explanation of
the study and its expected values. Forty six women
declined to participate and 26 women were excluded: 19
had pelvic infections, four had cardiac diseases, two had
an allergy to tramadol and one woman had a suspicious
cervical lesion. The remaining 140 women were enrolled
in the study after giving written consent (Fig. 1).
The baseline characteristics and indications of
hysteroscopy in the study groups are summarised in
Table 1. There was no significant difference between the
groups in the age, parity, body mass index and indications
for hysteroscopy. There was no difference in the duration
of the procedure between the study groups.
The median pain score was significantly lower in the
tramadol group during the procedure, immediately after
the procedure and 30 minutes after the procedure
(Table 2). Two women in the tramadol group reported
nausea but this was mild and did not warrant cancellation
of the procedure. No hysteroscopy complications were
encountered. The procedure could not be completed in
one woman in the placebo group because of intolerable
pain, intention to treat analysis was adopted and the
woman was considered to have pain score of 10 in the
three assessment occasions. No procedures were cancelled
because of uncooperative patients or failure of
hysteroscope introduction. All women were fully oriented
and conscious after the procedures.
Discussion
Our results showed that oral administration of tramadol
50 mg before outpatient hysteroscopy significantly
reduced pain scores during the procedure, immediately
after the procedure, and 30 minutes after the procedure
when compared with a placebo. The main strength of the
study is the investigation of the role of a small dose of a
weak opioid to reduce pain in outpatient hysteroscopy and

Oral tramadol in outpatient hysteroscopy
is tolerated by patients. This may result in changing the
practice of avoiding all opioids before outpatient
hysteroscopy. The main limitation of the study is that all
results were based on the subjective perception of pain.
This varies among individuals and is related to the
individuals’ previous pain experience and level of anxiety.
Several randomised controlled trials studied the use of
various analgesics to reduce hysteroscopy-associated pain.
Our results agreed with some of these studies that
demonstrated a beneficial effect of analgesics before
outpatient hysteroscopy. Bellati et al. randomised 120
women undergoing outpatient hysteroscopy to receive
intramuscular tramadol 100 mg (n = 40) 50 minutes
before the procedure, intracervical block (n = 40) or no
medications (n = 40). Women in the tramadol group had
significantly less pain at the end of the procedure when
compared with those in the intracervical block group and
those who received no medication. Side effects were not
reported in this study.10
In addition, Floris et al. randomised 50 women
undergoing outpatient hysteroscopy to receive tramadol
100 mg (n = 25) IV infusion 50 minutes before the
procedure or a placebo (n = 25). Women in the tramadol
group reported lower pain scores immediately after the
procedure and 15 minutes later. There was no significant

difference between the groups in the incidence of nausea,
vomiting or bradycardia.11 Our results concur with those
of Bellati et al. and Floris et al., but the oral route of
tramadol administration had the advantage of ease of
administration and convenience to the women.
On the other hand, some studies failed to show a
significant reduction in pain scores when using analgesics
before outpatient hysteroscopy. Lin et al. randomised 164
women undergoing outpatient hysteroscopy to receive
sublingual buprenorphine (0.2 mg) (n = 80), 40 minutes
before the procedure or a placebo (n = 84) and found no
significant reduction in pain with the use of
buprenorphine.12 However, a 3.1 mm flexible
hysteroscope was used in this nonblinded study. Flexible
hysteroscopy is associated with less pain than rigid
hysteroscopy7 which we believe may have contributed to
the lack of significant difference between buprenorphine
and placebo in this study. There was a high incidence of
side effects in the form of nausea, vomiting and
drowsiness in the intervention group (38.8%) compared to
none in the control group. Based on these data the Royal
College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists has
recommended against the use of opiates before outpatient
hysteroscopy.13 However, we found that tramadol 50 mg
was tolerated by women, two (4%) reported nausea but
this did not warrant cancellation of the procedure. Our
results have shown that opioids can be used before
outpatient hysteroscopy if the appropriate opioid was
given in the appropriate dose.
Some studies have investigated the role of NSAIDs in
reducing the outpatient hysteroscopy-associated pain. Issat
et al. randomised 150 women undergoing outpatient
hysteroscopy. Women were randomised to receive vaginal
misoprostol, 400 lg, with 100 mL of 5% intravenous
glucose (misoprostol arm); intravenous ketoprofen, 50 mg/
mL, in 100 mL 5% glucose with intravaginal placebo
(ketoprofen arm); or vaginal placebo tablets, 100 mL 5%
intravenous glucose (placebo arm) before
outpatient hysteroscopy. Pain scores were significantly
lower in the misoprostol group than in the ketoprofen
(P = 0.02) or placebo (P = 0.006) groups. There were no
statistical differences between the three arms in the pain
scores assessed at 15 minutes after the procedure
(P = 0.16).14
Caligiani et al.15 found that combined ketrolac 30 mg
IM and cervical block was superior to cervical block alone
in reducing pain associated with outpatient hysteroscopy.
This was not reproduced by Mercorio et al.16 who found
that oral dexketoprofen 25 mg was not superior to cervical
block in reducing pain in postmenopausal women
undergoing outpatient hysteroscopy. Oral diclofenac 50 mg
was not found to reduce hysteroscopy-associated pain17
and oral mefenamic acid 500 mg was not found to reduce
the pain during the procedure but significantly reduced
pain 30 minutes and 60 minutes after the procedure.18
Teran-Alonso et al. conducted a randomised study on
200 women undergoing outpatient hysteroscopy. One
hundred women received paracetamol 1 g and ibuprofen
600 mg one h before the procedure and 100 women did
not receive any medication. The pain scores were not
significantly different between the groups, but the
occurrence of nausea, vomiting and hypotension were
significantly lower in women who received paracetamol
and ibuprofen.19 In the absence of a placebo control, the
reduction in side effects in this study may be attributed to
the placebo effect rather than the pharmacological effect of
the paracetamol and ibuprofen.
Local anaesthetic sprays are also described. Esin et al.
studied 82 women undergoing outpatient hysteroscopy.
Women were randomised to receive either sublingual
misoprostol and placebo of lidocaine or lidocaine pump
spray applied to the cervix and placebo of misoprostol.
When compared with the lidocaine group, women in the
misoprostol group reported less pain scores immediately
after the procedure, whereas pain scores at 10 minutes
were similar between groups.20
It is to be noted that most of the studies that disagreed
with our results were studying NSAID rather than opioids.
Further research is needed to compare the roles of opioids
and NSAIDs before outpatient hysteroscopy. Pain during
hysteroscopy can be attributed to cervical manipulations,
uterine distension, touching the endometrium which
may cause contractions. Delayed pain is caused by
prostaglandins release secondary to uterine distension and
uterine manipulations.5 Whereas tramadol acts centrally as
a l-opioid agonist making it effective in reducing pain
during and after the procedure, NSAIDs act mainly
through reducing prostaglandins level, making them more
effective in reducing pain after the procedure.
We conclude that the use of oral tramadol 50 mg before
hysteroscopy reduces the pain evoked by the procedure
and is well tolerated by women.
