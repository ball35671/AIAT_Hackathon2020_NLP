ABSTRACT
Objective Diagnostic hysteroscopy today is a fast procedure carried out on
an outpatient basis but which still causes a certain degree of discomfort to
patients. This randomized, double-blind study in which lidocaine is compared
to a placebo was designed to evaluate the efficacy of intracervical anaesthesia
during this procedure.
Design Patients were allocated into two groups: group I consisting of 34
patients who were given lidocaine and group II consisting of 28 patients who
were given a saline solution. Both groups of patients were asked to quantify
their pain at four different times: T1, during hysteroscopy; T2, during the
biopsy; T3, at the end of the procedure, and T4, 30 min after the end of the
procedure.
Results During hysteroscopy (T1) there was a statistically significant difference between the two groups (a median of 2.5 cm vs. a median of 5.0 cm).
There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups at T2,
T3 or T4.
Conclusions These results suggest that intracervical anaesthesia can reduce
cervical sensitivity, as shown by the difference found between the two groups
at T1, but is insufficient to block the uterine stimuli resulting from distension
and manipulation of the uterine cavity.

INTRODUCTION
Abnormal uterine bleeding is responsible for one-third
of all patient visits to gynaecologists and this proportion increases to three-quarters when we consider only
peri- and postmenopausal patients. Until recently uterine
curettage was the only diagnostic method available for
the evaluation of this pathology. However, this procedure,
as well as requiring general anaesthesia, is ineffective in
diagnosing focal lesions.1
 Until a few years ago, hysteroscopy was used only in selected cases and at highly
specialized centers. Today, a hysteroscopic examination
must be considered whenever diagnostic and therapeutic exploration of the uterine cavity or cervical canal
is indicated. Correlation with histological findings
has revealed the considerable diagnostic accuracy of
hysteroscopy and its reliability is close to 100% in cases of
endometrial neoplasia.2
Diagnostic hysteroscopy is now considered the procedure of choice in the investigation of abnormal uterine
bleeding. It is carried out on an outpatient basis and
requires neither general anaesthesia nor hospitalization.
However, one of the disadvantages of this method is the
discomfort experienced by some patients, particularly
those who undergo an endometrial biopsy or those with
cervical stenosis.
The role of local anaesthesia in diagnostic hysteroscopy is still controversial.3,4 The present randomized,
double-blind, placebo-controlled study was carried out
in order to evaluate the efficacy of lidocaine 2%.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
This study was carried out in the north-east of Brazil,
in a day hospital specializing in human reproductive
medicine, with prior approval from the institute’s Ethical
Board. All patients voluntarily signed a consent form agreeing to participate in the study after receiving information
on the nature of the trial. Patients were randomly allocated
to two groups: group I with 34 patients and group II with
28 patients. Prior to the procedure, the patients were
given information by a doctor, regarding the procedure
itself and how to quantify any pain using a visual scale
described by Huskisson in 1974 (Fig. 1).5
 The examinations were all performed by the same doctor.
All patients received intracervical applications at the
1, 5, 7 and 11 o’clock positions with an odontological
syringe. Patients allocated to group I received four 2-mL
ampoules of lidocaine hydrochloride 2% without vasoconstrictor and patients in group II received previously
prepared ampoules of saline solution 0.9%. Neither the
patients nor the attendant physician were aware of the
content of the ampoules, which were identified only by
labels indicating group I or II.
The procedures were carried out using a 4-mm rigid
hysteroscope (Endoview, Bigen, Germany). Distension
was achieved using CO2 with the flow controlled by the
hysteroflator (Endoview). Illumination of the uterine
cavity was provided by a 250-watt halogen light bulb.
Endometrial biopsy was carried out immediately afterwards in all patients, using a Novak curette. Biopsy was
not performed under direct vision with guidance to the
site of the lesion. The technique used for diagnostic
hysteroscopy was standardized and all procedures were
carried out by the same surgeon. A portioclamp was used
in all cases. No failures occurred.
Patients were requested to quantify the pain they were
experiencing at four different moments: T1, during
hysteroscopy; T2, during the biopsy; T3, at the end of the
procedure, and T4, 30 min after the end of the procedure.
A second doctor was present in the room to assist the
patients in this evaluation and to clarify any uncertainties.
The Shapiro–Wilkes test was used to verify the normal
distribution of variables in the study, the Mann–Whitney
test to compare the distribution of variables between
independent groups (2 by 2), and the signal test was used
for the comparison of dependent samples (2 by 2).
RESULTS
Initially, 65 patients were enrolled in this study. However,
we were unable to carry out the procedure in two patients
in group I and one patient in group II due to stenosis of
the internal uterine cavity. The age range of the patients
was 20–71 years. The mean age of patients allocated to
group I was 44.9 years and for the patients allocated to
group II it was 44.7 years. There was no statistically
significant difference in age between the two groups. In
each group, 14 patients, i.e. 41.2% of group I and 50%
of group II, were referred for hysteroscopy because of
abnormal ultrasonographic findings. Seven patients from
group I (20.6%) and four patients from group II (14.3%)
were referred because of abnormal uterine bleeding at
menacme. Six patients in group I (17.6%) and five in
group II (17.8%) were referred because of infertility. Other
reasons for referral for hysteroscopy are listed in Table 1.
During the hysteroscopic procedure (T1), the reported
degree of pain was significantly higher in the placebo
group than in the lidocaine group (medians of 5.0 and
2.5 cm, respectively; P < 0.05). No statistically significant
differences were found at T2, T3 or T4 when the two
groups were compared (Table 2).
When the pain scores of the same group at different intervals were compared, no statistically significant
differences were found between the moment at which
hysteroscopy was being carried out (T1) and the endometrial biopsy (T2) in either group. Perception of pain
was significantly greater at T1 and T2 than at T3 and T4.
The intragroup comparisons of T3 and T4 with both T1
and T2 were statistically different (Table 3).
Hysteroscopy revealed a uterine cavity with no abnormalities in 15 patients (44.1%) in group I and in 13 patients

(46.4%) in group 2. Endometrial polyps were found in
nine patients in group I (26.5%) and in five patients in
group II (17.8%). Other hysteroscopic findings are listed
in Table4.
DISCUSSION
Diagnostic hysteroscopy under local anaesthesia is a procedure which has already been described in the medical
literature.6
 However, the use of a paracervical block, as
well as being a traumatic procedure which causes some
discomfort to the patient, involves the inherent risk of
anaesthesia. In this case, it is important to evaluate the
real role of local anaesthesia in diagnostic hysteroscopy.
Jong et al.7
 carried out hysteroscopy under paracervical block and observed that 90% of patients classified as
tolerable the pain they felt during the procedure. No
complications were reported and no patient required
hospitalization after the examination. However, there
was no control group in this study.
In order to demonstrate the efficacy of topical endometrial anaesthesia, Zupi et al.4
 reported a reduction in
pain during hysteroscopy and endometrial biopsy with

lidocaine 2% injected transcervically into the uterine
cavity with a 3-mm diameter catheter, compared with a
placebo group.
On the other hand, Vercellini et al.3
 found no reduction
in pain in patients who underwent diagnostic hysteroscopy using paracervical block compared with those in
whom no anaesthesia was used. Likewise, Broadbent et al.8
found no statistically significant difference between a group
who underwent diagnostic hysteroscopy with intracervical
anaesthesia and a placebo group.
Although a statistically significant difference was found
between the lidocaine group and the placebo group
during hysteroscopy (T1), this difference was not found
at T2, T3 and T4. Nevertheless, when the patients were
asked whether they would have the same procedure
carried out again with the same ‘anaesthesia’, 97% of
group I replied that they would, while only 64.3% of
group II agreed.
These results suggest that intracervical anaesthesia can
reduce the sensitivity of the cervix, as evidenced by the
difference found between the two groups during the first
moment of evaluation (T1), but that it is insufficient to
block the stimuli from the uterine cavity resulting from
the distension and manipulation of the cavity. However,
we believe that intracervical anaesthesia is a safe procedure which should be used in all patients, particularly in
those with cervical stenosis.
