Local Analgesia

EDITORIAL COMMENT: We accepted this paper for publication to inform readers
who perform hysteroscopy that the procedure can be done under local analgesia with
minimal patient discom fort. This is important now that we must increase the number
of patients managed as day cases and because in many major institutions hysteroscopies
are still done under general anaesthesia.
Summary: A prospective, randomized study was undertaken to objectively compare
pain tolerance of 2 methods of local analgesia for outpatient hysteroscopy. Patients
in group 1 received a paracervical block using 20 ml of 1% lignocaine. Patients in group
2 received a uterosacral block using 2 ml of 2% lignocaine. There was no statistical
difference between the 2 groups (p = <0.65) in efficacy of pain relief. The method
used for patients in group 2 reduces time and costs for outpatient hysteroscopy.
Outpatient hysteroscopy using paracervical analgesia
is tolerated well by patients (1). Some studies have
indicated similar acceptability without analgesia but
have not reported this on an objective basis (2-4). This
study was of a randomized, prospective trial comparing
pain tolerance of 2 methods of local analgesia.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Patients were referred to the authors from general
practitioners and other gynaecologists for the investigation of a variety of gynaecological complaints. The
patients were randomized according to even or odd unit
record numbers. The surgical procedure was similar for
both groups and those with odd unit numbers (group 1)
received 16-20 ml of 1% lignocaine using a paracervical
block after a small amount (< 0.5 ml) was injected into
the anterior lip of the cervix for placement of a tenaculum (1). In those patients with even unit numbers
(group 2), a dental syringe with an ampoule containing 2 ml of 2% lignocaine with 1:80,000 adrenaline
(Citantest, Astra) was used. A small amount (<OS ml)
was injected into the anterior lip of the cervix which
was then grasped with a tenaculum. This was followed
by an injection of approximately 1 ml into each uterosacral ligament. A visual Analogue Scale was presented
to all patients (1).

RESULTS
Sixty patients were enrolled in each group (table 1).
In group 1 (1% lignocaine), 32 (53.3%) scored between
0 cm and 3.3 cm, 21 (35 To) scored 3.4 cm - 6.6 cm and
7 (11.7%) scored 6.7 cm - 10 cm. In group 2 (2%
hgnocaine), 37 (62%) scored between 0 cm and 3.3 cm,
17 (28.3%) scored 3.4 cm - 6.6 cm and 6 (10%) scored
6.7 cm - 10 cm. Two patients in group 1 and 2 patients
in group 2 indicated they would prefer a general anaesthetic ‘next time’. There was no statistical difference
between the 2 groups (p = <0.65) in efficacy of pain
relief.

DISCUSSION
Direct visualization of the uterine cavity by hysteroscopy is superior to hysterosalpingography HSG for the
accurate delineation of intrauterine pathology (43.
Marked discomfort associated with HSG may be reduced from 81% to 55% utilizing local analgesia (6) but
this incidence is considerably higher than that associated with outpatient hysteroscopy. Hysteroscopy with
endometrial sampling is more accurate than dilatation
and curettage in the investigation of abnormal bleeding 
374 AUST. AND N.Z. JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNAECOLOGY
(2,7). Visual inspection alone is accurate in differentiating between normal and abnormal endometrium in selected cases (8). The addition of biopsy to the procedure
obviates concern about ‘missing’ abnormal histology
which may be associated with unusual intrauterine
pathology. The procedure may be performed without
analgesia (2,3,9,10) or under paracervical block (1,ll).
During the authors early preliminary assessment of
this procedure, placement of the tenaculum on the
unanaesthetized cervix caused considerable pain in
many patients. Initial attempts at reducing this pain
were made with preoperative 1% xylocaine jelly (12)
with little apparent effect. Since the incorporation of
an injection of lignocaine to the anterior lip, it has been
unusual to observe patients reacting unfavourably at this
point.
Other methods have been used to reduce the pain
associated with outpatient hysteroscopy. Preoperative
administration of prostaglandins may be used to soften
the cervix. These may be given intramuscularly (13) or
vaginally (14,15) but are associated with a high frequency
of side-effects. Alternatively, a thin laminaria tent may
be applied to the cervix 3 hours preoperatively (16).
Antiprostaglandins such as naproxen sodium have been
used to reduce uterine muscle cramping and tuba1
smooth muscle contraction.
The method used in patients in group 2 reduces time
and cost by the utilization of a dental syringe and a
prepacked ampoule of lignocaine. Manipulation of the
speculum and cervix is often required to gain access to
the uterosacral ligaments and lateral fornices. In many
cases, the help of a second operator using a lateral
vaginal wall retractor was required to gain access to the
lateral fornices for patients in group 1, but this was not
required for patients in group 2.
