Abstract
STUDY OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of sublingual buprenorphine in the relief of pain associated with office hysteroscopy.
DESIGN: Prospective, randomized study (Canadian Task Force classification I).
SETTING: Tertiary medical center.
PATIENTS: One hundred sixty-four women referred for office hysteroscopy from September 2003
through March 2004.
INTERVENTION: Before hysteroscopy, 80 women received a tablet of buprenorphine (group A), and
84 women received a placebo (group B). Their pain sensations were evaluated on a 10-cm visual analog
scale, and they were asked about the adverse reactions and level of satisfaction on the following day.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The pain score in group A was 3.3  1.1, which was
similar to 3.2  1.3 in group B. The pain scores in subgroups of women also were similar within the
same group and between the two groups. Thirty-one women (38.8%) in group A reported adverse
reactions, including nausea, vomiting, and drowsiness, while none in group B reported any adverse
reactions.
CONCLUSION: Office hysteroscopy with a 3.1-mm flexible hysteroscope is a well-tolerated procedure. Sublingual buprenorphine is not helpful in relieving the pain associated with hysteroscopy but is
associated with significant adverse reactions.

Buprenorphine;
Hysteroscope;
Analgesia
Hysteroscopy allows direct visualization of the uterine
cavity and directed biopsy, and it is regarded as the gold
standard for investigation of intrauterine abnormalities. Although it is generally well tolerated, it is associated with a
certain degree of pain and possible vasovagal reaction. Actually, pain is the most common reason for failure to complete the procedure.1 In 2500 outpatient hysteroscopies reported,1 29.8% required local anesthesia, and 3.6% failed, in
which 84% were due to excessive discomfort.
Various methods of analgesia have been proposed to
suppress the pain associated with hysteroscopy: general
anesthesia, paracervical block,2,3 intracervical injection,4 lidocaine spray,5,6 and intrauterine instillation of lignocaine.7
However, the results are controversial, and there are no
established guidelines for the use of analgesia in office
hysteroscopy.8

partial agonist and antagonist actions. As an analgesic, buprenorphine is used for the relief of moderate to severe pain.
Compared with morphine, buprenorphine provides adequate
postoperative analgesia of longer duration, and the analgesic potency of parenteral buprenorphine is 25 to 50 times
that of parenteral morphine.9 In a series of 7548 patients
receiving buprenorphine in the immediate postoperative period, 90% of patients had good or adequate pain relief.10
Buprenorphine also has been used to provide preoperative
sedation and analgesia and as an adjunct to surgical anesthesia.11 Its anxiolytic and sedative properties make it suitable as a preoperative medication. Buprenorphine can be
given sublingually as well as parenterally. It is readily
absorbed following sublingual administration. Although
maximal effect is reached later with sublingual administration, it provides longer duration of action and does not cause
discomfort when administered as in parenteral routes.12 In
order to assess the efficacy of sublingual buprenorphine in the
relief of pain during hysteroscopy, we conducted a prospective,
randomized study under double-blind conditions.
Materials and methods
From September 2003 through March 2004, 179 women
referred for office hysteroscopy were included in this study.
The study was approved by the medical ethics committee of
the hospital. The patients were randomized by computergenerated numbers to receive buprenorphine (Temgesic,
Reckitt & Colman, Hull, UK) (group A) or placebo (group
B). Every woman put a tablet of buprenorphine (0.2 mg) or
a placebo under her tongue 40 minutes before the procedure.
Indications for hysteroscopy included abnormal uterine
bleeding, suspected intracavitary lesion (such as uterine
synechiae, endometrial hyperplasia, endometrial polyp, or
submucosal myoma), and infertility.
All procedures were performed by the same physician
(YHL) using a flexible hysteroscope with a 3.1-mm outer
diameter and a bending section of 100 degrees both up and
down (Olympus HYF Type XP, Tokyo, Japan). The uterine
cavity was distended with 5% dextrose solution hung 60 cm
above the operating table. Illumination was provided by a
250 W high-intensity cold-light source. No tenaculum or
cervical dilatation was used in any procedures.
During the procedure, patients were observed and their
pain sensations evaluated by the same nurse using a 10-cm
visual analog scale (VAS). For each patient, the worst
expression during the whole procedure was recorded as her
pain score.
On the day after the procedure, the patients were asked to
evaluate their level of satisfaction, where 0  not satisfied,
1  a little satisfied, and 2  very satisfied.
All results were expressed as mean  SD unless otherwise stated. Statistical significance was assessed by independent t-test, Fisher’s exact test, and 2 test when appropriate. SPSS software (Statistical Package for Social
Science; Windows version 10.0, SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL)
was used for the statistical analysis. A p value of .05 was
considered as statistically significant.
Results
From September 2003 through March 2004, 179 women
underwent office hysteroscopy at our hospital. The procedure failed in 15 women because of cervical stenosis. These
women underwent repeat hysteroscopy under general anesthesia. None of the procedures were discontinued because of
intolerable pain. Therefore, we enrolled 164 women in the
study. Thirty-seven (22.6%) of them were postmenopausal.
The indications for hysteroscopy were abnormal uterine
bleeding (32.8%), infertility (30.3%), intracavitary tumor
lesion (myoma or polyp) (26.2%), and others (10.7%).
Among the 164 women, 80 women received buprenorphine
(group A), and 84 received placebo (group B). As shown in
Table 1, there were no significant differences in patients’
characteristics, including mean age and number of nulliparous, multiparous, and postmenopausal women.
The VAS pain scores are shown in Table 2. The mean
pain score in group A was 3.3, which was similar to 3.2 in
group B. The pain scores in various subgroups of women,
including postmenopausal, nulliparous, and multiparous
women, also were similar within the same group and between the two groups. For most patients, the worst discomfort was related to the insertion of the speculum, not the
hysteroscopy per se.
In group A, 31 women (38.8%) reported adverse reactions associated with the procedure. Among them, 4 (5.0%)
reported only nausea or vomiting, 2 (2.5%) reported only
drowsiness, and 25 (31.3%) reported both. None of the
women in group B reported any discomfort or adverse
effects. No woman experienced vagal reactions.
Table 3 shows the levels of satisfaction. Women in group
B were more satisfied with the procedure. Thirty women
(37.5%) in group A were not satisfied with the procedure
because of adverse effects.

Discussion
Pain associated with hysteroscopy occurs during insertion
of the speculum, dilatation of the cervix for insertion of the
hysteroscope, distention of the uterine cavity with distention
medium, and direct stimulation of the uterine wall by the
hysteroscope. Also, the use of tenaculum and biopsy may
also cause pain. Office hysteroscopy may be painful, even if
it is performed by an experienced surgeon with a nontraumatic technique.13 In fact, the single most common reason
for failure of hysteroscopy is pain.14
The effect of local analgesia in office hysteroscopy is
inconclusive.8 Although some studies demonstrated that
paracervical block reduced pain,2,3 others did not reveal
beneficial effect.15 In addition, paracervical block carries
potential complications such as infection, bleeding, toxicity
from intravasation or systemic absorption, and sacral plexus
trauma. One study4 showed that intracervical injection was
not helpful, and 43% of women found the injection to be the
most painful part of the procedure.
The afferent innervations of the upper and lower parts of
the uterus differ in the course and source. Afferent fibers
conducting pain impulses from the fundus and body follow
the sympathetic fibers to T11 and T12; while afferent fibers
from the cervix follow the parasympathetic fibers to S2 to
S4.16 Therefore, injection of local analgesic at or around the
cervix blocks only pain arising from the cervix, but does not
block pain originating from the uterine cavity.
We speculated that systemic administration of analgesics
might be more effective than local analgesics in relieving
the pain associated with hysteroscopy. Buprenorphine is a
narcotic analgesic and can be given by sublingual route,
which is easier for patients and physicians, and does not
cause the discomfort associated with local injection. In this
study, however, we found that buprenorphine had no benefit
in reducing the pain associated with hysteroscopy. The
mean VAS pain scores were similar between group A and
group B. The mean pain scores of the subgroups were also
similar within the same group or between groups A and B.
This indicates that flexible hysteroscopy is a well-tolerated
procedure even without analgesia, so taking buprenorphine
beforehand had no beneficial effect. In a study performed by
researchers using a 3.5-mm flexible hysteroscope without
anesthesia, 94.6% of women experienced little or no pain.17
A study using a 2.5-mm flexible hysteroscope also found the
procedure well tolerated.18 In that study, mean pain score
was higher in postmenopausal women. However, in our
study, mean pain scores were similar between premenopausal and postmenopausal women, either with or without
buprenorphine.
The adverse effects of buprenorphine are similar to those
of morphine and meperidine. In a large series of 7548
Caucasian patients receiving 0.3 to 0.6 mg buprenorphine
postoperatively, nausea developed in 8.5% and vomiting
developed in 7.3%.10 However, Chinese patients seem to be
very sensitive to buprenorphine. In our study, 29 (36.3%) of
80 women reported nausea or vomiting after taking buprenorphine.
Sedation (including drowsiness) is the most common
adverse effect of parenteral buprenorphine, occurring in
approximately two-thirds of patients.19 In our study, 27
(33.8%) of 80 women developed drowsiness. The high
incidence of adverse reactions associated with buprenorphine is reflected by the high level of dissatisfaction of
patients in group A.
Conclusion
Office hysteroscopy with a 3.1-mm flexible hysteroscope is
a well-tolerated procedure. Nearly all patients found this
procedure acceptable even without analgesia. Buprenorphine is not beneficial in relieving pain, but is associated
with high adverse effects and a lower level of satisfaction.
