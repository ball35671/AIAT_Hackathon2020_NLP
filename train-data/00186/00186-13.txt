ABSTRACT: Study Objective: To evaluate the amount of pain during office hysteroscopy and endometrial biopsy with and without
intrauterine anesthesia.
Design: Prospective randomized study (Canadian Task Force classification I).
Setting: Academic teaching center.
Patients: A total of 82 women underwent outpatient hysteroscopy for evaluation of their uterine cavity.
Interventions: Randomization to local cervical or combined cervical and intrauterine anesthesia.
Measurements and Main Results: Amount of pain experienced during the procedure; 10, 30, and 60 minutes after the
procedure; and during endometrial biopsy. We used a visual analog scale ranging from 0 to 10 (0: no pain, 10: excruciating
pain). Of 82 patients, 4 patients were excluded, 36 patients underwent hysteroscopy using local cervical anesthesia, and 42
others with combined cervical and intrauterine anesthesia. The mean age of the patients in the local group was 37.4  0.8
years and in the combined group was 38.3  0.7 years. In both groups, patients experienced significantly more pain during
and 10 minutes after the procedure than 30 and 60 minutes after. No significant differences occurred in the pain scores during
the hysteroscopy, and 10, 30, and 60 minutes after between the 2 anesthesia groups. The pain score in the local group during
endometrial biopsy was significantly higher than during (p .05), 10 minutes after (p .001), 30 minutes after (p .001),
and 60 minutes after (p .001) the procedure, respectively. In the combined group, compared with the pain score during
endometrial biopsy, the scores during the hysteroscopy (p .05), 10 minutes after (p .01), 30 minutes after (p .001), and
60 minutes after (p .001) the procedure were also less, respectively.
Conclusion: Intrauterine anesthesia with medicated saline as a distending medium is ineffective. Endometrial biopsy is
associated with more pain than hysteroscopy. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2008) 15, 308 –310 © 2008

Hysteroscopy for diagnostic purposes can be performed
in an office setting (outpatient or office hysteroscopy). Although the procedure is tolerated well, most patients experience pain. To alleviate the pain, various methods of systemic analgesia and local anesthesia were advocated [1–7].
However, the results were not consistent [2,4,6].
Recently, we found that hysteroscopy using paracervical
anesthesia was associated with decreased amount of pain
compared with local anesthesia only [8]. Although we have
not encountered any complications, 1 study reported that
paracervical injection was associated with bleeding from the
vaginal fornices in 38.8% of cases. Some women required
vaginal tamponade to stop the bleeding [5].
The purpose of our study was to evaluate the effects of
intrauterine anesthesia by instillation of lidocaine (Xylocaine;
Sanofi Canada Inc., Markham, Ontario, Canada) into the distending medium during hysteroscopy. The amount of endometrial biopsy–related pain with local cervical anesthesia and
combined cervical and intrauterine anesthesia is compared.

hysteroscopy using local cervical anesthesia or combined
cervical and intrauterine anesthesia. Randomization was
done using a computer-generated random table. The hospital research ethics board approved the study. Study participants were counseled, and informed consent was obtained
before randomization.
Following our standard practice, all patients were given
an anxiolytic (lorazepam 10 mg orally) 30 minutes before
the procedure. Women randomized into the local group
received an injection of 2 mL of 1% lidocaine into the
anterior wall of the cervix. Those randomized into the combined cervical and intrauterine group received a similar
local cervical anesthesia and intrauterine anesthesia. The
distending medium was either saline only (local group) or
medicated saline (18 mL of lidocaine in 250 mL of saline)
(intrauterine group). The patients were blinded, but the
operators were aware of the content of the solution. The
hysteroscopy was done between days 5 to 9 of the menstrual
or induced cycle.
It was performed by first placing a tenaculum on the
anterior wall of the cervix at the 12 o’clock position to
stabilize the cervix. A rigid 3.5-mm hysteroscope was used.
At the completion of hysteroscopy, an endometrial biopsy
was performed with Pipelle Endometrial Suction Curette
(CooperSurgical, Lake Forest, CA). All patients were observed for 60 minutes after the procedure, and they were
asked to complete a standardized pain evaluation form. A
visual analog scale ranging from 0 to 10 (0: no pain, 10:
excruciating pain) was used. Patients were asked to record
the degree of pain after the hysteroscopy, after endometrial
biopsy, and 10, 30, and 60 minutes after.
The inclusion criteria were all women who required
outpatient hysteroscopy for evaluation of their uterine cavity and had negative cervical culture results. The exclusion
criteria were women who required operative hysteroscopy
under general anesthesia, positive Chlamydia culture findings, pregnancy, or allergy to local anesthesia.
Sample Size and Statistical Analysis
The study was designed to have 80% power to detect a
difference of 30% for pain on visual analog scale, with
2-sided alpha levels of 0.05. Using sample size calculation
for independent proportions, we estimated a sample size of
36 participants in each group. Sample size calculation was
based on the incidence of pain in the local anesthesia group
of 40%.
The data were not normally distributed as shown by the
Shapiro-Wilks test. We used Fisher exact test for proportion, repeated measures analysis of variance Friedman test,
and pairwise comparisons. A p value of less than .05 was
required to reject the null hypothesis.
Results
Of 82 patients recruited, 4 were excluded from the analysis (2 from each group). Three patients withdrew their
consent and another could not tolerate speculum examination. As a result, 36 patients were in the local cervical group
and 42 patients in the combined cervical and intrauterine
group. In all cases, cervical dilatation was not required and
the hysteroscope was introduced only once.
Profiles of the patients in the 2 groups were comparable
(Table 1). Patients experienced significantly more pain during and 10 minutes after the procedure than 30 and 60
minutes after (Table 2). However, no significant differences
existed in the pain scores during hysteroscopy, and 10, 30,
and 60 minutes after between the local and the combined
anesthesia group.
The pain score during endometrial biopsy in the local
group (median 4, SD 1.9) was not significantly different
from that in the combined group (median 4, SD 1.8). The
pain score in the local group during endometrial biopsy was
significantly higher than during (p .05), 10 minutes after
(p .001), 30 minutes after (p .001), and 60 minutes after
(p .001) the procedure, respectively. In the combined
group, compared with the pain score during endometrial
biopsy, the scores during the hysteroscopy (p .05), 10
minutes after (p .01), 30 minutes (p .001), and 60
minutes after (p .001) the procedure were also less, respectively.

As expected, endometrial biopsy revealed proliferative
endometrium in most patients. However, the findings in the
local group also showed chronic endometritis in a patient
and endometrial polyp in 4 others. In the combined group,
chronic endometritis was found in 7 patients and endometrial polyp in 2 others.
Discussion
Hysteroscopy is an important tool to evaluate the uterine
cavity. In our infertile population, most patients had normal
uterine cavity. As patients with abnormal sonohysterography results had been excluded before hysteroscopy, our
findings are expected. In the past few years, we also performed endometrial biopsy immediately after the completion of hysteroscopy examination. Those with chronic endometritis on histopathology are treated with antibiotics
before undergoing treatment with in vitro fertilization.
Overall, 8 (10%) patients had chronic endometritis.
The uterus is a richly innervated organ. Accordingly,
examination of the uterine cavity is associated with pain.
The uterine corpus and cervix are innervated by parasympathetic nerves from Frankenhäuser plexus (S2– 4), and
sympathetic nerves from the ovarian plexus innervate the
uterine fundus and subendometrial nerve endings. In our
continuing effort to decrease the amount of pain associated
with the procedure, we added lidocaine into the distending
medium to block the nerve endings in the uterine wall.
lidocaine is a fast-acting anesthesia and effective as surface
anesthesia.
Similar to our previous findings [8], patients experienced
significantly more pain during the procedure than 30 and 60
minutes after. However, intrauterine anesthesia was ineffective in decreasing the pain. We used 18 mL of lidocaine in
250 mL of saline, or 0.67 mg/mL of saline. In general, we
used only 100 mL of distending medium. It is possible that
the dose of lidocaine in our study was too low for effective
relief of pain.
In a randomized trial, instillation of 5 mL of 2% mepivacaine reduced the amount of pain during hysteroscopy
[9]. It was also reported that intrauterine instillation of 5 mL
of 2% lignocaine into the uterine cavity was effective in
decreasing hysteroscopy-related pain [3]. In another randomized study, instillation of 5 mL of 2% lignocaine on
introduction of the hysteroscope decreased pain for both
hysteroscopy and endometrial biopsy [10]. These studies
suggest that the use of anesthetic agent without dilution is
effective.
The sample size estimation in this study was based on the
incidence of pain during hysteroscopy. Using pain score,
our study is underpowered. Whether the results would be
different with larger number of samples is unknown. In
addition, statistical significance is not the same as clinical
significance.
It is unlikely that our procedure time was too short to
evaluate the efficacy of the intrauterine anesthesia. Endometrial biopsy was performed at the completion of the
hysteroscopy that lasted approximately 5 minutes [8]. Yet,
we could not show that the intrauterine anesthesia decreased
endometrial biopsy-related pain score.
To our knowledge, this is the first randomized study
evaluating the effects of lidocaine in the distending medium
on hysteroscopy and endometrial biopsy-related pain. However, the results show that intrauterine anesthesia with medicated saline as a distending medium is ineffective. Endometrial biopsy is associated with more pain than
hysteroscopy.
