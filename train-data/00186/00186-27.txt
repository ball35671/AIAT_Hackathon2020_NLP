Use of diclofenac as an analgesic in outpatient
hysteroscopy: a randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled study
Outpatient hysteroscopy with endometrial biopsy is now the standard investigative procedure for abnormal
uterine bleeding and intrauterine abnormalities. Pain is the most common reason for failure to perform the
procedure (1). Various local anesthetic techniques have been evaluated, but none has been convincingly
proved effective (2–7).
Oral mefenamic acid was shown to significantly reduce pain after but not during the procedure hysteroscopy (8). It was suggested that more potent oral analgesic be evaluated. We therefore conducted a randomized,
double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to assess the efficacy and safety of oral diclofenac sodium in outpatient
hysteroscopy and endometrial biopsy. Approval was obtained from the Clinical Research Ethics Committee,
The Chinese University of Hong Kong.
All women scheduled for outpatient hysteroscopy in a university teaching hospital from June to December
2000 were invited to participate in the study. Those with known hypersensitivity to nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs were excluded.
Women were randomly assigned to receive a 50-mg oral diclofenac sodium tablet or a placebo tablet of
the same appearance. Randomization was performed by using computer-generated random numbers in blocks
of two. The tablets were individually placed into serially labeled plastic bags according to the random group
number and delivered to the woman by a research nurse 1 to 2 hours before the procedure.
Participants, attending medical staff, and research nurses were blinded to the medication used. Participants
were placed in a lithotomy position, and bimanual examination was performed to assess the size and position
of the uterus. The cervix was exposed by a Sim speculum, and the anterior lip was held by a single-tooth
tenaculum forceps. Hysteroscopy was performed by using a rigid 2.7-mm hysteroscope with a 25° fore–
oblique view lens and a 5-mm oval sheath (Wolf, Germany) inserted into the uterine cavity under direct vision
without previous cervical dilatation. The uterine cavity was distended by CO2 using a hystero-insufflator
(Wolf, Germany) at a flow rate of 70 mL/min and a pressure of 100–150 mm Hg. All procedures were
monitored using a video camera system. Endometrial biopsy was performed using a 3-mm Karman vacuum
aspirator curette (Rockets Medical, Watford, United Kingdom) at the end of the procedure, if necessary.
During the procedure, the woman was asked to record her pain by using a visual analogue scale.
Assessment was made before the procedure, when the cervix was grasped by a single-tooth tenaculum forceps,
during insertion of the hysteroscope, during hysteroscopic examination of the uterine cavity, immediately after
endometrial biopsy (if performed), and 30 minutes after the procedure. Blood pressure and pulse rate were
measured before, during, and 30 minutes after hysteroscopic examination.
Vasovagal reaction was defined as bradycardia (heart rate  60 beats/min) or hypotension (reduction in
blood pressure  20% compared with baseline values) in association with various symptoms, including
dizziness, faintness, sweating, nausea, or vomiting. On the basis of the pain score in the control group in our
previous studies (4, 5), we estimated that a sample 55 patients in each arm would be needed to detect a 50%
reduction in the pain score, with a power of 80% and type I error () of 0.05.
Two hundred women were recruited and underwent randomization. Procedures were cancelled in 8 women
in the diclofenac group and 11 in the placebo group, as hysteroscopy was considered not necessary by the
attending physicians. In both groups, hysteroscopy failed in 2 women because of failure in inserting the
hysteroscope in one case and intolerable pain during the procedure in the other. Hysteroscopy was successfully
performed in all other cases. Statistical analysis was performed by using the 2 test and repeated-measures
analysis of variance, where appropriate.
The groups did not differ significantly in mean age, parity, duration of procedure, blood pressure, and pulse
rate at the different stages of the procedure. Endometrial sampling was performed in 75 women (82%) in the
diclofenac group and 76 (85%) in the placebo group. Pain scores did not differ signficantly between the two
groups, regardless of whether endometrial sampling was performed (Table 1).

In both groups, the degree of pain experienced was not related
to menopausal status. Endometrial sampling was significantly more
painful than hysteroscopy, and insertion of the hysteroscope was
the most painful part of hysteroscopy. Vasovagal reaction occurred
in 4 women in the diclofenac group and 5 in the placebo group; all
recovered spontaneously. Two women in the diclofenac group
developed epigastric pain (n1) and skin rash (n1), but none did
so in the placebo group.
We found no beneficial effects of a more potent nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drug in relieving pain during and after hysteroscopy, with or without endometrial biopsy. Pain associated
with hysteroscopy and endometrial sampling is modest and well
tolerated by patients. No local anesthetic technique or oral
medications has been proved to be effective in reducing pain
during and after the procedure. It has been suggested that the use
of normal saline instead of CO2 as a distending medium requires
less cervical dilatation for insertion of the hysteroscope, reduces
procedure time, and may result in less abdominal discomfort and
shoulder tip pain (9). Furthermore, the availability of microhysteroscopes with a smaller caliber allows easy insertion through
the cervix and may reduce the pain associated with hysteroscopy.
