OBJECTIVE — This study compared diabetes Treatment As Usual (TAU) with Pathways To
Change (PTC), an intervention developed from the Transtheoretical Model of Change (TTM), to
determine whether the PTC intervention would result in greater readiness to change, greater
increases in self-care, and improved diabetes control.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — Participants were stratified by diabetes treatment and randomized to treatment with PTC or TAU as well as being randomized regarding
receipt of free blood testing strips. The PTC consisted of stage-matched personalized assessment
reports, self-help manuals, newsletters, and individual phone counseling designed to improve
readiness for self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG), healthy eating, and/or smoking cessation. A total of 1,029 individuals with type 1 and type 2 diabetes who were in one of three
pre-action stages for either SMBG, healthy eating, or smoking were recruited.
RESULTS — For the SMBG intervention, 43.4% of those receiving PTC plus strips moved to
an action stage, as well as 30.5% of those receiving PTC alone, 27.0% of those receiving TAU plus
strips, and 18.4% of those receiving TAU alone (P  0.001). For the healthy eating intervention,
more participants who received PTC than TAU (32.5 vs. 25.8%) moved to action or maintenance
(P  0.001). For the smoking intervention, more participants receiving PTC (24.3%) than TAU
(13.4%) moved to an action stage (P  0.03). In intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis of those
receiving the SMBG intervention, PTC resulted in a greater reduction of HbA1c than TAU, but
this did not reach statistical significance. However, in those who moved to an action stage for the
SMBG and healthy eating interventions, HbA1c was significantly reduced (P  0 0.001). Individuals who received the healthy eating intervention decreased their percentage of calories from
fat to a greater extent (35.2 vs. 36.1%, P
0.004), increased servings of fruit per day
(1.89 vs. 1.68, P  0.016), and increased vegetable servings (2.24 vs. 2.06, P  0.011) but
did not decrease weight. However, weight loss
for individuals who received the healthy eating
intervention and who increased SMBG frequency as recommended was significantly
greater, with a 0.26-kg loss in those who remained in a pre-action SMBG stage but a
1.78-kg loss in those performed SMBG as recommended (P  0. 01).
CONCLUSIONS — This study demonstrates that this intervention has the potential
of positively impacting the health of broad
populations of individuals with diabetes, not
just the minority who are ready for change.

Diabetes self-management, including
self-monitoring of blood glucose
(SMBG) and making healthy food
and lifestyle choices, is complex and demanding. The Diabetes Control and
Complications Trial (DCCT) and the U.K.
Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS)
demonstrated the beneficial impact of improved glycemic control on the long-term
complications of type 1 and type 2 diabetes (1,2). However, translating the glycemic reductions achieved in these pivotal
trials to clinical settings remains difficult.
Developing effective and efficient strategies to promote self-management is important to this process.
Although effective, most current diabetes education programs use approaches
that are suited to individuals who are
ready to change and, therefore, reach only
a minority of those in need (3). In Southern Ontario, Canada, despite a universal
health care system, only 25% of patients
with diabetes are estimated to have attended a Diabetes Education Program (4).
Recently, the Transtheoretical Model of
Change (TTM) has been applied to health
behavior change interventions using a
computerized system, Pathways to
Change (PTC), which provides self-care

interventions delivered by phone and
mail, with or without personal contact.
Such interventions have the potential to
reach large numbers of individuals who
do not participate in current health care
systems.
The TTM posits that people pass
through five specific stages when changing health behaviors. Pre-action stages include ‘precontemplation,’ in which the
individual is not intending to change in
the foreseeable future, usually measured
as the next 6 months; ‘contemplation,’ in
which the individual is not prepared to
change his/her behavior at present but is
intending to take action within the next 6
months; and ‘preparation,’ when the individual is actively considering changing
his/her behavior in the immediate future.
Action stages include ‘action,’ in which
the individual has actually made an overt
behavior change in the recent past but the
changes are not well established (i.e.,
within 6 months of change); and ‘maintenance,’ when the individual has changed
his/her behavior and is working to sustain
the overt change after the first 6 months
(5). TTM interventions have been developed and tested for a variety of populations and behaviors (6–8). Individualized interactive interventions based on
TTM constructs have been shown to be
more effective than more traditional approaches, which focus on the individual
who is ready to change (8).
Diabetes self-management is fundamentally different from many health behaviors studied, such as smoking or use of
sunscreen. The behavior changes required are more complex, numerous, expensive, and restrictive. We report on the
first randomized, prospective trial evaluating an intervention based on the principles of the TTM and targeted at three
diabetes self-care behaviors: frequency of
SMBG, healthy eating, and smoking cessation. The PTC intervention includes
stage-based personal feedback reports,
self-help manuals and newsletters delivered by mail, and personal counseling via
telephone. It does not require face-to-face
contact with the individual.
We hypothesized that, compared
with Treatment As Usual (TAU), patients
receiving the PTC intervention will demonstrate more forward movement in stage
of readiness for SMBG, healthy eating,
and smoking cessation, increased frequency of SMBG as assessed by memory
meters, decreased intake of dietary fat,
improved metabolic control as assessed
by HbA1c, and greater weight loss. We
also evaluated the impact of receiving free
glucose test strips on SMBG frequency.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND
METHODS
Study design
The complete methodology for this study
is described elsewhere (9). Briefly, a total
of 1,029 individuals with type 1 or type 2
diabetes were recruited for this 12-month
study, approved by the Research Ethics
Boards of the University of Toronto and
Dalhousie University. Two thirds of the
cohort were recruited from Southern Ontario, Canada and one third of the subjects were recruited from Nova Scotia.
The aim was to recruit individuals from
the general diabetes population who were
not engaging in optimal self-care practices. Participants were considered as being in a pre-action stage if they performed
SMBG fewer than four times per day if
treated with insulin or fewer than two
times per day if treated with oral antihyperglycemic agents alone, and/or if they
had a BMI 27 kg/m2
, and/or if they
smoked cigarettes. Patients were ineligible for participation in the study if they
were on diet therapy alone, if they could
not respond to the materials written in
English, if they required more than usual
care because of their health status (e.g.,
were pregnant or on dialysis), or if they
had no telephone. Participants were recruited from posters in local family practices, diabetes education centers, newspaper ads, and Canadian Diabetes Association chapter activities.
This study was a randomized splitplot design with two randomized between-subject factors: treatment (PTC
versus TAU) and strips (free strips versus
no strips) and one within-subject factor
(pre- versus post-study). Because treatment recommendations are different, participants were stratified according to
whether or not they took insulin or oral
agents alone and were then randomized
into treatment or strips conditions.
Participants received a PTC intervention for each of the behaviors appropriate
for them. The PTC intervention is fully
described elsewhere (9). In summary,
PTC is an integrated, multicomponent intervention program that provides monthly
mail or telephone contact for 12 months.
The components of the intervention are
based on the individual’s current stage of
change, as well as stage-matched processes and principles of change. A handbook providing general diabetes information and an introduction to the
TTM was mailed to PTC participants after
recruitment. Individual stage was assessed using quarterly assessment surveys. Survey responses were used to
generate a personal report from a computer-based “expert system” (10–16), which
provides personalized feedback for each
self-care behavior. This report is stagematched and individualized to provide
participants with the strategies most useful in moving toward action and maintenance. Counselors conducted telephone
calls 1 month after the personal report to
answer questions, provide tips on behavior change, and facilitate personal goalsetting. Seven newsletters were mailed
approximately every other month so that
monthly contact was made for 12 months.
TAU involved regular family physician or endocrinology visits and/or diabetes education sessions as prescribed.
Education and physician care is covered
by provincial health plans. No attempt
was made to influence medical management in either group.
All subjects with BMI 27 kg/m2 (a
measure of obesity) were enrolled in the
healthy eating intervention, but only
those reporting being in a pre-action stage
for healthy eating (diet 30% fat, n
445) were used for the analyses reported
herein.
Assessment measures
The protocol required participants to visit
the diabetes center twice during the
study, for baseline and end-of-study assessments. Participants were asked to use
a memory blood glucose meter (LifeScan
Profile; LifeScan, Milpitas, California) and
phone modem to send blood glucose results to a data center (Enact, Mountain
View, California) for the duration of the
study. These were distributed free of
charge to all participants. Patients’ blood
glucose data were used solely for outcome
assessment and not as an intervention.
Stage of change was assessed through
questions addressing intention to change
and current behavior, as described in Table 1. A specific action criterion was used
to drive the staging algorithms. Participants were informed of this criterion before intention was assessed. TTM
measures were developed using explorJones and Associates
DIABETES CARE, VOLUME 26, NUMBER 3, MARCH 2003 733
atory and confirmatory analyses, structural equation modeling, and split-half
cross-validation (15).
HbA1c was measured from a venous
blood sample using an immunoturbidometric method. Height and weight were
measured and BMI was calculated (kg/
m2
). Dietary intake was measured using a
validated food frequency instrument, the
NCI Block (17,18). For PTC participants,
the staging measures were obtained at
baseline and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months.
For TAU participants, there was no contact from the initial assessment until the
12-month end-of-study assessment, except for reminders to download the data
from the blood glucose meter, if required.
Health care utilization information (visits
with family physician, medications used,
diabetes education received) was also collected at baseline and at 12 months.
Data analysis
Participants who did not complete the
study were coded as remaining in preaction for the intention-to-treat (ITT)
analyses. The main comparisons were between the proportion of participants in
PTC versus TAU, and free strips versus no
free strips for the SMBG intervention,
across the stages (pre-action versus action
and maintenance stages) at end of study.
Differences in proportions were tested using 2 analyses. If main effects of both
treatment and strips were significant for
the self-testing risk, the interaction was
analyzed by comparing the outcome for
each of the four groups (TAU alone, TAU
plus strips, PTC alone, and PTC plus
strips) using 2 analysis.
Outcomes for glycemic control
(HbA1c), weight, meter memory data, and
eating behavior were analyzed using repeated-measures ANOVA. The SMBG frequency data per memory meter was
coded to obtain an average weekly blood
glucose level for weeks 5–8 and 49–52 of
the study. Data from weeks 1–4 were not
used to minimize any temporary increase
in SMBG frequency associated with starting the study.
RESULTS — Participants’ baseline
characteristics are shown in Table 2.
There were no significant differences between groups. The 1,029 participants received one or more interventions,
depending on their current stage for each
behavior. A total of 860 participants were
enrolled for SMBG; 77.7% completed the
entire year of the study. A total of 445
participants were in pre-action for
healthy eating, and 168 participants were
in pre-action for smoking; completion
rates were 81.2 and 80.4%, respectively.
Participants who did not complete the entire 12 months of the study did not have
different baseline demographic characteristics from those who did complete the
study (data not shown). A total of 58.2%
of participants were enrolled for two behaviors (89% of these for both SMBG and
healthy eating) and 8.2% of participants
were enrolled for three behaviors.

Effect of diabetes self-care behaviors on glycemic control

Stage of change
We hypothesized that significantly more
participants in the PTC intervention than
the TAU intervention would shift from
pre-action to an action stage (either action
or maintenance). In view of this directional hypothesis and the fact that all participants were in a pre-action stage at
baseline and could not regress further, a
one-tailed statistical test was used. ITT
analyses comparing treatment groups for
each self-care behavior are presented in
Table 3.
SMBG. There was a significant treatment
effect for PTC versus TAU (2  45.42,
P  0.001) and for whether or not free
testing strips were provided (2  13.13,
P  0.002). Table 3 shows the data examining the four treatment groups (TAU
alone, TAU plus strips, PTC alone, PTC
plus strips); 10.9% of the TAU group
moved to action and 7.5% moved to
maintenance, whereas of those receiving
testing strips alone, 17.3% moved to action and 9.7% moved to maintenance. Of
those receiving PTC alone, 12.1% moved
to action and 18.4% moved to maintenance. When PTC and strips were combined, 10.2% of participants moved to
action and 33.2% moved to maintenance
(P  0.001).
Healthy eating. The 2 analysis based on
the ITT sample (445 in pre-action at baseline) demonstrated that PTC was associated with more movement to action/
maintenance than TAU (P  0.001). The
superiority of PTC can be seen in the
larger proportion of participants who are
in maintenance at end of study (11.4%)
compared with TAU (0%) (2  26.52,
P  0.001).
Smoking. There were significantly more
PTC than TAU patients who quit smoking
(17.8% in action and 5.5% in maintenance vs. 11.6% in action and 0% in
maintenance, respectively) in the ITT
analysis for the 168 enrolled smokers (2
 7.01, P  0.02).
Changes in self-care outcomes
Differences in favor of PTC are seen for
SMBG frequency in those providing endof-study data (P  0.002). Only PTC participants significantly increased SMBG
frequency (from 1.4 to 1.6 tests per day)
as measured by downloaded meter memory data, compared with a slight decrease
in the TAU group (1.46 to 1.41 tests per
day, P  0.002). Likewise, the results for
the NCI Block Food Frequency Questionnaire indicated that PTC participants, relative to TAU participants, reported lower
percentage of calories from fat (35.24 vs.
36.1%, P  0.004) and higher daily vegetable (2.24 vs. 2.06, P  0.011) and fruit
servings (1.89 vs. 1.68, P  0.01).
Changes in health care utilization
indicators of self-care
Participants’ visits to family physicians remained consistent: 4.61 visits for the TAU
group and 4.75 visits for the PTC group
during the study year; 4.87 and 4.74 visits, respectively, for the prior year (NS).
Participants in both groups changed the
dose or frequency of oral agent therapy
equally during the study year (84.6% of
the PTC group versus 83.3% of the TAU
group). Although 22% of PTC insulinusing participants changed to an insulin
analog, as compared with 13% of the TAU
group, this did not reach significance
(P  0.082). Both PTC and TAU participants increased the frequency of injections (from 2.45 to 2.76 per day in the
PTC group, from 2.32 to 2.54 in the TAU
group; pre- versus post-F  32.36, P 
0.001; interaction F  0.96, NS). Finally,
more patients in the PTC group participated in diabetes education programs
than patients in the TAU group (47.7 and
37.7%, respectively; P  0.002).
Impact of self-care change
In an ITT analysis, a significant reduction
in HbA1c resulted only for those participants who reached action or maintenance
stages over the course of the study. Endof-study HbA1c for the SMBG intervention was 7.78% for those who reached an
action stage, compared with 8.30% in
those who stayed in pre-action (P 
0.003). In the healthy eating group,
HbA1c was 7.83% for those in action but
remained at 8.38% for those in pre-action
(P  0.001). Increased SMBG accounted
for 3% of the variance in end-of-study
HbA1c level in the non–insulin-treated
group (P  0.01) and 7% in the insulintreated group (P  0.01).
In the healthy eating group, weight
reduction was greater for the PTC participants who were in an action stage at endof-study as compared with those in preaction, but this did not reach significance.
Weight loss for those remaining in preaction was 0.65 kg, compared with 1.38
kg in patients moving to action (NS).
However, weight loss for those enrolled in
both SMBG and healthy eating interventions, and who increased SMBG frequency as recommended, was significantly greater than those who remained in
a pre-action stage (1.78- versus 0.26-kg
loss, P  0.01).
CONCLUSIONS
These data suggest that the PTC intervention is significantly better than TAU in
helping individuals move into action
stages of critical diabetes self-care behaviors. The PTC intervention was successful
at helping more people engage in SMBG,
make healthy low-fat food choices, and
stop smoking. Patients who changed
SMBG and healthy eating behavior had a

significant improvement in metabolic
control, whether they used insulin or oral
agents. Results for smoking cessation suggest that PTC is superior to TAU, but the
confidence in these findings is limited by
small sample size.
The importance of self-care behavior
change interventions for improved glycemic control is supported by recent studies.
For example, an intensive individualized behavioral change program for individuals with impaired glucose tolerance
was successful in reducing the incidence
of diabetes (19). However, individual interventions are labor-intensive and timeconsuming to deliver to the large
numbers of patients with diabetes. In contrast to face-to-face diabetes education efforts, the PTC interventions are efficient
and have a broad reach. Intervention was
accomplished by mailing individualized
written material, with follow-up telephone counseling but no clinic visits. This
program provides stage-matched as well
as individually tailored feedback to participants’ personal survey responses. The
system provides individualized normative and/or ipsative feedback, which allows even small positive steps to be
reinforced. As implemented, this intervention may positively impact the health
of broad populations of individuals, not
just those who attend diabetes clinics, and
augment the impact of diabetes care/
education services.
Although SMBG is accepted as critical
for patients using insulin, its role in patients with type 2 diabetes is less clear. In
a cross-sectional sample of patients with
type 2 diabetes from the National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES), the frequency of SMBG was
not found to be related to glycemic control as measured by HbA1c (20). In our
study, patients with type 2 diabetes taking
oral agents who performed SMBG more
frequently did demonstrate a significant
reduction in HbA1c, which supports other
recent findings (21). The DiSC study data
are unique because of the prospective nature of collection. Furthermore, the participants of this study were encouraged to
learn more about using blood glucose information. Those that tested more had a
significant reduction of HbA1c regardless
of treatment used.
This study also demonstrated the potentiating effects of access to free testing
strips on both PTC and TAU interventions. Access to supplies does impact frequency of SMBG, and testing frequency
improves HbA1c. These findings support
long-term benefit of financial coverage of
testing supplies by third-party payers.
Future research is required to isolate
the impact of each component of the PTC.
Because the comparison group in this
study was TAU, we are unable to state
definitely whether the theory-specific aspects of PTC, or general aspects of behavioral intervention, were responsible for
the outcomes. Future research should
compare the efficacy of a stage approach
with a nonstaged frequent contact approach in the context of complex multiple
and concurrent self-care behaviors of
chronic illness.
The PTC intervention has the capacity to deliver effective interventions to a
large number of people. By helping people through the precontemplation and
contemplation stages in a timely fashion,
we may be able to redirect our efforts to
diabetes care and education strategies that
will have a positive impact on the prevention of long-term complications of diabetes, reducing the subsequent human and
health care costs. Clearly, this study supports a new, innovative approach to this
major health problem.
