Abstract
Background. The increasing prevalence of overweight and obesity underscores the need for evidence-based, easily disseminable interventions
for weight management that can be delivered on a population basis. The Transtheoretical Model (TTM) offers a promising theoretical framework
for multiple behavior weight management interventions.
Methods. Overweight or obese adults (BMI 25–39.9; n= 1277) were randomized to no-treatment control or home-based, stage-matched multiple
behavior interventions for up to three behaviors related to weight management at 0, 3, 6, and 9 months. All participants were re-assessed at 6, 12, and
24 months.
Results. Significant treatment effects were found for healthy eating (47.5% versus 34.3%), exercise (44.90% versus 38.10%), managing
emotional distress (49.7% versus 30.30%), and untreated fruit and vegetable intake (48.5% versus 39.0%) progressing to Action/Maintenance at
24 months. The groups differed on weight lost at 24 months. Co-variation of behavior change occurred and was much more pronounced in the
treatment group, where individuals progressing to Action/Maintenance for a single behavior were 2.5–5 times more likely to make progress on
another behavior. The impact of the multiple behavior intervention was more than three times that of single behavior interventions.
Conclusions. This study demonstrates the ability of TTM-based tailored feedback to improve healthy eating, exercise, managing emotional
distress, and weight on a population basis. The treatment produced a high level of population impact that future multiple behavior interventions
can seek to surpass.

Introduction
The increasing prevalence of overweight and obesity is associated with significant public health consequences (Adams
et al., 2006; CDC, 2006; Flegal et al. 2002). A number of
intensive, clinic-based treatment options for the treatment of
obesity are available. Riebe et al. (2003), for example, examined
the efficacy of a multiple behavior group-based, 6-month program
based on the Transtheoretical Model of Behavior Change (TTM)
that intervened on physical activity, nutrition, and behavior
change. The participants (n= 144) demonstrated significant reductions in weight, percent of calories from fat, and caloric intake,
as well as increases in VO2max, at the end of treatment (Riebe
et al., 2003). While participants maintained reductions in weight
and caloric intake and increases in weekly exercise minutes at 24
months, there was evidence of gradual loss of those improvements during the follow-up period. Furthermore, there were no
differences on percent of calories from fat, and fruit and vegetable
intake had declined from baseline (Riebe et al., 2005).
Consumers have expressed a desire for alternatives to clinicbased weight management interventions (Sherwood et al., 1998).
Experts in the field (e.g., Perri, 1998) are calling for effectiveness

studies of innovative and cost-effective strategies to improve
long-term outcomes of clinic-based weight management programs. Easily disseminable interventions with sustained effectiveness delivered outside of clinic or group settings are needed.
Home-based interventions offer a promising alternative. Individualized interventions are important for those not prepared to
change multiple behaviors that are essential to managing weight
(USDHHS, 2005).
Randomized trials of Internet-based weight management
interventions (Tate et al., 2001, 2003) indicate that personalized
guidance from counselors for those prepared to change can
affect weight immediately post-treatment. Follow-up data, however, were unavailable to determine if the treatment effects were
sustained. Glasgow et al. (2004) and Prochaska and Prochaska
(in press) report that sustainable multiple behavior interventions
are patient-centered, tailored, proactive, population-based, and
ongoing.
Success of multiple behavior interventions based on the
Transtheoretical Model (TTM) that fulfill the guidelines set
forth by Glasgow et al. (2004) and Blue and Black (2005) (e.g.,
Prochaska et al., 2004; Prochaska et al., 2005) suggests that
TTM offers a promising framework for multiple risk weight
management interventions. The TTM is an integrative model of
behavior change that incorporates process oriented variables to
explain and predict how and when individuals change behaviors. In addition to the central organizing construct, stage of
change, the TTM integrates several other behavior change
constructs including decisional balance, processes of change,
and self-efficacy (Prochaska et al., 2002). A randomized trial of
TTM-based interventions for diabetes self-management indicated the intervention group was significantly more likely to
move to Action and Maintenance (A/M) stages for selfmonitoring of blood glucose and healthy eating (Jones et al.,
2003). Prochaska et al. (2004) reported that home-based, TTM
interventions outperformed usual care for smoking cessation,
sun exposure, and dietary fat reduction. A second study
demonstrated that TTM interventions had significant effects at
24 months on four behaviors: smoking, dietary fat, sun exposure,
and mammography (Prochaska et al., 2005).Johnson et al. (2006)
reported that, when paired with fully tailored interventions for
lipid-lowering medication adherence, stage-matched interventions had significant effects on physical activity and dietary fat
reduction.
The purpose of this study was to conduct the first randomized
effectiveness trial with a one-year extended follow-up to examine
the impact of fully tailored, home-based, TTM-based multiple
behavior interventions targeting behaviors essential to healthy
weight management in a population of overweight and obese
adults. This study is among the first to examine the co-variation
of multiple behavior changes involved in healthy weight

management and the potential population impact of multiple
behavior interventions for weight management.
Methods
Subjects
A sample of 1277 were recruited nationwide and randomized to treatment or
control, with n= 1101 from large employers; n= 126 from Centerwatch.com, a
website with clinical trial listings; and n= 46 who were ineligible for another
study. Of the sample, 58.5% were recruited using proactive calls, and 41.5%
were recruited reactively by emails or ads. Recruitment among those eligible
was 79.6% (see Fig. 1 and Table 1).
Procedure
Participants completed baseline assessments by phone. At 3, 6, 9, 12, and 24
months, mail assessments were sent, followed by telephone for non-responders.
This standard mixed-mode assessment has been used in a number of previous
effectiveness studies of population-based interventions (e.g., Prochaska et al.,
2005; Prochaska et al., 2004; Velicer and Prochaska, 1999). The 3 and 9 month
assessments were for intervention purposes. A subsample (n= 202) completed
objective measures of weight, physical activity, and food intake at baseline, 12,
and 24 months. Fig. 2 presents the retention rates. All procedures were approved
by the Institutional Review Board at Pro-Change Behavior Systems, Inc.
Treatment group
The treatment group (n= 628) received four series of individualized reports
(3–6 pages) tailored on TTM constructs (stage of change, decisional balance,
self-efficacy, and processes of change) based on assessments at baseline, 3, 6,
and 9 months. Participants received computer-generated tailored reports for up
to three behaviors at each timepoint: healthy eating (reducing dietary fat to
30% of calories and calorie reduction of 500 calories per day); moderate
exercise (working toward at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise on at least
5 days per week); and managing emotional distress without eating (using
healthy strategies rather than eating to cope). Individuals did not receive
reports for behaviors for which they were in Maintenance. Baseline reports
provided normative feedback (compared to peers in same stage who were
successful). Follow-up reports provided normative and ipsative (compared to
self) feedback. Intervention mailings were staggered based on readiness such
that the reports for which individuals were more prepared to change were
mailed first. In the event that a participant was in the same stage of change for
two or more behaviors, the reports were mailed in the following order: healthy
eating, exercise, managing emotional distress. The first report was mailed
within a week of the assessment and was accompanied by a multiple-behavior,
stage-based manual.

Control group
The no-treatment control group completed measures at baseline, 6, 12, and
24 months.
Measures
Height and weight
Height and weight (shoeless, in light street clothing) were self-reported.
Self-reported weight correlated 0.99 with calibrated balance beam scale weight
in the 202 participants with objective measures (collected separately by different
research assistants). The mean difference between self-reported and measured
weight at baseline was −1.64 (2.32) kg. This suggests highly accurate selfreport, as the difference represents only 1.8% of baseline weight. A two-way
repeated measures ANOVA using treatment group as the independent variable
demonstrated that there is no treatment group difference on under-reporting of
weight, F(1,177) =.02, pN.05.
Stage of change for exercise
This reliable and valid measure (Sarkin et al., 2001) assessed readiness to
engage in moderate exercise at least 30 minutes per day 5–7 days per week. The
Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire (GLTEQ; Godin and Shepard,
1985) varied significantly by stage F(3,846) = 79.43, pb.001. All three items
(strenuous, r(101)=.223, pb.05; moderate, r(101) =.222, pb.05; and mild,
r(101)=.211, pb.05) correlated significantly to moderate/vigorous activity
measured on the subsample using uni-axial Actigraph accelerometers.
Stage of change for healthy eating
Stage of change for healthy eating assessed readiness to reduce calories by
500 a day and dietary fat to less than 30%. Subscale scores on a behavioral measure
of eating (Johnson et al., 1999) varied significantly by stage (F(4,1254)= 43.29,
pb.001), as did estimates of dietary fat consumption as measured by the Fred
Hutchinson Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) in the subsample completing
objective measures. Those in Action and Maintenance had significantly lower fat
intake (mean= 29%) than those in pre-action stages (i.e., Precontemplation,
Contemplation, and Preparation) (mean= 35%), F(1,152)= 5.59, pb.05, η2
=.04.
Stage of change for managing emotional distress
Stage of change for managing emotional distress assessed readiness to not
rely on eating to cope with emotional distress. The 9-item Distress Eating Scale
(α=.90; Johnson et al., 1999), varied significantly across the stages, F(4,693) =
97.73, pb.001.
Stage of change for fruit and vegetable intake
Although an indirect intervention target, readiness to eat at least five servings
per day of fruits and vegetables was assessed (LaForge et al., 1994; Cummins
et al., 2006). Number of servings measured by the summation method in the FFQ
varied significantly across stages at baseline, F(4,148)= 9.20, pb.001, η2
=.20.
Statistical analyses
A 2× 4 factorial repeated measures design compared treatment and control
groups at 0, 6, 12, and 24 months. Efficacy was assessed for primary (healthy eating
and exercise) and secondary outcomes (managing emotional distress and weight).
Multiple imputation (MI) (Rubin, 1987; Harel and Zhou, 2007) was used to
estimate missing data for the 6, 12, and 24 month assessments. MI, which
Schafer and Graham (2002) describe as the state of the art for missing value
replacement, uses a simulation technique to replace each missing value with a
set of plausible values, resulting in multiple complete data sets that differ only in
the imputed values. For the current study, 10 datasets were imputed using
Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations (Van Buuren and Oudshoorn,
2004), which is implemented by R package ‘mice’ version 1.16. The imputation
model included baseline variables related to outcomes being imputed and to
missingness. The complete data sets were analyzed using complete data
methodology – in this case, Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) examining
repeated measures effects – and the results pooled by using SAS v9.1 PROC
GENMOD and PROC MI, respectively. Statistical significance of the pooled
results was evaluated using a t-test and degrees of freedom that take into account
the uncertainty in the data and the uncertainty due to missing values. GEE allows
analysis of longitudinal data for both continuous and categorical outcomes
(Zeger and Liang, 1986). All GEEs, which were run with an unstructured
variance matrix, used the control group as reference.

Analyses included individuals in pre-action stages at baseline for each
behavior with progressing to A/M defining treatment success. Individuals in
Action or Maintenance at baseline were necessarily excluded as they were
already at criteria for the behavioral outcomes. Since participants in the analyses
were in pre-action at baseline, that time point was excluded from the GEE as the
group effect is of most interest.
Results
Table 2 presents the demographics and baseline stage distributions for the two groups.
Healthy eating outcomes (n= 1121)
The treatment group had greater percentages than the control
group progressing to A/M at 6 (43.9% versus 31.3%); 12
(43.10% versus 35.2%); and 24 months (47.5% versus 34.3%)
(Fig. 3). GEE revealed an overall group effect for all timepoints
t(1,1119) = 5.02, pb.001, OR = 1.61 (95% CI: 1.33, 1.94).
Exercise outcomes (n= 713)
Among those in pre-action stages for exercise at baseline,
there was a significant group effect t(1,711) = 2.25, pb.05,
OR = 1.27 (95% CI: 1.03, 1.57) beginning at 6 months that was
maintained over time. Among the treatment group, 43%, 37.7%,
and 44.9% progressed to A/M at 6, 12, and 24 months, respectively, compared to 34.6%, 35.9%, and 38.1% of the control
group (Fig. 4).
Managing emotional distress outcomes (n= 458)
The overall GEE showed a significant group effect that was
maintained at all timepoints among those in pre-action stages at
baseline, t(1,456) = 5.1, pb.001, OR = 1.89 (95% CI: 1.48,
2.42). Significantly greater percentages of the treatment group
achieved treatment success at 6 (44% versus 25.3%), 12 (45%
versus 38.3%), and 24 months (49.7% versus 30.3%) (Fig. 5).

Fruit and vegetable outcomes (n= 858)
Fig. 6 shows significantly greater percentages of the treatment group progressed to A/M for fruit and vegetable consumption at 6 (44.0% versus 31.4%), 12 (45.3% versus 39.6%),
and 24 months (48.5% versus 39.0%). The overall group effect
was significant at all timepoints, t(1,856) = 5.01, pb.0001,
OR = 1.63 (95% CI: 1.34, 1.97).
Weight outcomes
Self-reported weight loss was evaluated separately for samples in pre-action for each primary outcome behavior (healthy
eating or exercise) and for those in pre-action for both behaviors. Although not presented, the results for percent of
weight loss are very similar (Johnson et al., 2007). The GEE
analyses indicated that the differences between treatment
groups among those in pre-action for healthy eating (n= 1121)
or exercise (n= 713) were not significant when evaluated
separately. Among individuals who were in a pre-action stage
for both healthy eating and exercise (n= 617), however, the
treatment group lost significantly more weight at final follow-up
than the control group t(1,615) =−2.12, pb.05, d=.17 (Fig. 7).
Among those in pre-action for healthy eating at baseline,
27.4% of the treatment group versus 20.3% lost at least 5% of
their weight at 24 months, a significant overall effect in the GEE
analyses that increases over time t(1,1119) = 2.07, pb.05,
OR = 1.22 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.48) Among those in pre-action at
baseline for exercise, more participants from the treatment
group (28.8%) lost 5% or more of initial weight than among
those in the control group (19.4%), with increasing differences
over time, t(1,711) = 1.96, p=.05, OR = 1.32 (95% CI: 0.99,
1.75). There was also an overall group effect for those in preaction for both behaviors at baseline who received treatment t
(1,615) = 2.05, pb.05, OR = 1.35 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.81) that
increased over time (30% versus 18.6% losing 5% or more at
24 months, Fig. 8).
Co-variation of behavior change
To determine if co-variation of behavior change occurred
differentially in treatment and control groups, the likelihood of
progressing to A/M for the target behaviors was evaluated by
logistic regression analyses that provided odds ratios with 95%
confidence intervals for each group. In all analyses, failing to
progress was the referent category. While results are reported in
one direction, the converse of each odds ratio is also true. The
results in Table 3 indicate that among the treatment group, those
progressing to A/M were 2.52–5.18 times more likely to progress on another behavior, as compared to 1.24–2.63 times
more likely among those in the control group.
Impact on multiple behaviors
In multiple behavior interventions, measures for assessing
impact must take into account the number of behaviors treated
effectively and the participation rates in each of those
behavioral interventions (Prochaska and Prochaska, in press).

press) was employed: I=Σ# of behaviors(n) (En×Pn), where E is
the efficacy for each behavior and P is the proportion of at risk
individuals participating in the intervention for each behavior.
With participation rates on a population basis approaching 80%,
the P is 70.72% for healthy eating, 46.56% for exercise, and
28.72% for managing emotional distress. The efficacy rates are
47.5%, 44.9%, and 49.7%, respectively. Therefore, the population impact is 68.8%, which equals approximately 0.7 behaviors
changed per person. Thus, this multiple behavior intervention
had three times the behavior change impact of treating just
smoking, where previous population-based single behavior
interventions had impacts of approximately 20% (Prochaska
et al., 2004). The population impact of 70% may, however,
underestimate the true impact. This estimate fails to take into
account “untreated” behaviors on which the intervention had an
effect, such as fruit and vegetable consumption. Including that
behavior increases the total impact to 95.1%.
Discussion
Individualized stage-matched, multiple behavior interventions
had significant effects on progression to Action/Maintenance for
healthy eating, exercise, managing emotional distress, and weight
among those most at risk (i.e., those in pre-action) one year postintervention. This is the first study to demonstrate the effectiveness of multiple behavior change home-based interventions
targeting all of the behaviors involved in weight management in
an overweight and obese sample. An unexpected and previously
undocumented finding was that the intervention also impacted
untreated fruit and vegetable consumption, a key health behavior.
Significant and increasingly large differences occurred in the
percent losing at least 5% of body weight, a change associated
with clinical improvement in health indicators (Van Gaal et al.,
2005; Wing et al., 1987). These findings are unique in that this
was not primarily a reactively recruited clinic-based sample who
had to be ready to change in order to participate, as is often seen in
other trials (DPP Group, 1999; Look AHEAD Research Group,
2007a,b), and participants received a relatively minimal intervention in their homes.While weight loss achieved here is slightly
lower than in some previous studies (e.g., Tate et al., 2001, 2003;
Heshka et al., 2003), the present project recruited individuals in all
pre-action stages and not only those prepared to change. More
importantly, the weight loss curves, like the behavior change
curves, were diverging a year post-intervention, which is atypical
in the weight literature (Ware, 2003). This type of sustained
behavior change or weight loss is rarely measured (e.g., Tate et al.,
2003).
The target behaviors demonstrated significant treatment
effects in the first six months and beyond. Unlike many clinicbased, intensive programs that have immediate treatment effects
that taper over time when the intervention is removed, the
significant treatment effects of this intervention for weight did
not occur until 24 months. These results reflect that weight loss
is not a behavior but rather an outcome of multiple behavior
changes and that those in earlier stages may take longer to
progress to Action on those behaviors. From a health perspective, the goal should be to first produce significant changes
in multiple behaviors, with weight loss following over time.
This treatment strategy maximizes health benefits, since healthy
eating and exercise produce many health benefits in addition to
those related to weight loss (Van Gaal et al., 2005).
The intervention evaluated in the present study produced
high level impacts of 68.8% on multiple behavior changes. To
interpret impact estimates, it is useful to think of percent impact
as an estimate of the total number of behaviors changed per
person. In population-based smoking interventions, for example, the average number of changes per person is 1/5 of a
behavior (Velicer and Prochaska, 1999). In this study, the
average number of behaviors changed per person is nearly 3/4.
Thus, multiple behavior interventions have the potential to have
more than three times the impact of similar single behavior
interventions.
Finally, this research has important implications for understanding co-variation of behavior change in multiple-behavior
interventions. Few, if any, previous studies have documented
the effect changing one behavior can have on the potential to
change another. Receiving treatment produced odds ratios from
2.52 to 5.18 that taking action on one behavior would lead to
taking action on a second behavior. Notably, simply changing a
behavior does not have the same effect as evidenced by smaller
odds ratios (1.24 to 2.63) among those in the control group.
Multiple behavior interventions tailored to TTM constructs may
have a unique potential to create synergistic effects on behavior
change.
Limitations of the study
Questions may be raised about why the control group did as
well as they did, a finding that has emerged in other populationbased intervention studies (e.g., Johnson et al., 2006; Evers
et al., 2006). A leading hypothesis is that individuals assigned to
the control group received much more than “usual care.” They
receive three of the 5 A's (ask, assess, and arrange follow-up)
(Fiore et al., 2000) that are viewed as constituting essential
components of effective counseling. This combination of A's is
likely to include active change ingredients, which is supported
by the fact that proactive comparison groups consistently
show more change than would be expected by secular trends.
Prochaska et al. (2005) found that comparison groups that
received minimal (only stage or outcome assessments) and
masked surveys (stage assessment on behaviors to mask the
focus of the study) showed significantly less change than a
proactive assessment group that received the full battery of
TTM assessments.
Lack of objective measures on the entire population may be
considered a limitation, but the collection of objective measures
on a subsample demonstrates that self-reported data were highly
correlated with objectively measured values. The correlation of
self-reported and objectively measured weight in this case was
0.99. The accelerometer data were significantly related to the
Godin, the behavioral indicator of physical activity used for the
entire sample and fat intake as measured by the FFQ decreased
significantly in those in Action and Maintenance for healthy
eating (Johnson et al., 2007).
244 S.S. Johnson et al. / Preventive Medicine 46 (2008) 238–246
There is differential dropout by treatment group at followup. This is likely due to the additional intervention contacts for
the treatment group at 3 and 9 months. Additional contacts
typically result in 5% fewer retained participants per time
points. If dropout rates at the 6 and 12 month time points are
compared, excluding the 3 and 9 month dropouts, there are no
significant differences between the treatment and control
groups. Additionally, there is no significant difference on
dropout at 24 months. MI allows missing data to be modeled in
a sophisticated manner referred to by Schafer and Graham
(2002) as state of the art. More traditional analyses (e.g.,
Random Effects Modeling employing ITT where missing
weight values were set equal to baseline weight) as
recommended by Ware (2003) resulted in remarkably similar
outcomes with regard to weight (a significant effect on weight
loss at 24 months, F(2,615) = 4.06, pb.05, with a significant
difference at 24 months, t(615) = 2.03, pb.05, d=.16, and
differences on percent losing 5% or more that approached
significance (e.g., among those in a pre-action stage for both
healthy eating and exercise, F(2,615) = 2.78, p= .06, d=.14).
In summary, this study demonstrates the ability of theoretically driven, TTM-based tailored expert system feedback for
multiple behaviors to improve healthy eating, exercise, managing emotional distress, and weight on a population basis and
underscores the potential synergistic effects of multiple behavior
interventions. In the interest of cost-effectiveness and ease of
dissemination, future research on home-based, multiple behavior
interventions should include an examination of whether similar
effects can be obtained using alternative delivery options (e.g., the
Internet, hand-held devices) and whether optimally tailoring
interventions to leverage possible co-variation of behavior change
(i.e., providing complete expert system feedback for a single
behavior and more minimal feedback for additional behaviors)
can have similar effects. Finally, the limits on multiple behavior
interventions need to be pushed: How many behaviors can we
effectively intervene upon simultaneously?
