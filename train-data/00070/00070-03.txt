Transtheoretical model-chronic disease care for obesity in
primary care: a randomized trial. Obes Res. 2005;13:
917–927.
Objective: To compare health benefits achieved in a transtheoretical model-chronic disease (TM-CD) minimal intervention for obesity vs. augmented usual care (AUC).
Research Method and Procedures: This was a 2-year,
randomized clinical trial with overweight or obese men and
women from 15 primary care sites. AUC (n  336) included
dietary and exercise advice, prescriptions, and three 24-hour
dietary recalls every 6 months. TM-CD care (n  329)
included AUC elements plus “stage of change” (SOC) assessments for five target behaviors every other month,
mailed SOC and target behavior–matched workbooks, and
monthly telephone calls from a weight-loss advisor. Weight
change was the primary outcome.
Results: Repeated measures models under the missing at
random assumption yielded nonsignificant adjusted differences between the AUC and TM-CD groups for weight
change, waist circumference, energy intake or expenditure,
blood pressure, and blood lipids. The pattern of change over
time suggested that TM-CD participants were trying harder
to impact target behaviors during the first 6 to 12 months of
the trial but relapsed afterward. Sixty percent of trial participants maintained their baseline weights for 18 to 24
months.
Discussion: A combination of mailed patient materials and
monthly telephone calls based on the transtheoretical model
and some elements of chronic disease care is not powerful
enough, relative to AUC, to alter target behaviors among
overweight primary care patients in an obesogenic environment. AUC may be sufficient to maintain weights among
at-risk primary care patients.
Key words: weight management, chronic disease, cognitive-behavioral therapy, treatment, randomized controlled trial
Introduction
Obesity is epidemic in the general population because of
a widespread polygenetic susceptibility interacting with an
obesogenic environment that encourages excess energy intake and discourages energy expenditure (1–3). Thus, almost all middle-aged primary care patients, particularly
among disadvantaged groups, have excess adipose tissue
and have one or more obesity-related chronic diseases such
as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, osteoarthritis,
asthma, lower back pain, or heart disease (4,5). Cognitive
behavioral obesity interventions that are linked to primary
care should reinforce public health efforts against the epidemic; however, an area of controversy is the minimum
length and intensity of a primary care intervention that will
maintain healthier patient behaviors in an obesogenic environment that will persist for many years (6,7). An openended series of weekly face-to-face contacts between a
patient and a provider may be an expensive treatment modality for payers with other priorities. Thus, some research
has focused on very brief physician counseling (8). Group
visits, telephone calls, mail contacts, e-mail or Internet

contacts, or referrals to the best commercial programs are
feasible alternatives to multiple face-to-face visits with a
clinician, but it is not clear which mix of treatment modalities is best for which patients (9).
We were interested in an intervention that would be
compatible with traditional primary care practice, which is
still more focused on “acute problems” than optimal chronic
disease care (7). We did not want to perturb the physician,
the office staff, the flow of patients (four or five per hour),
or the flow of revenue, but we felt it was important to
maintain some linkage between primary care and the intervention because of comorbidity issues, because primary
care is where most patients enter the health system, and
because of our belief that better management of obesity in
primary care settings could prevent more serious sequelae
and reduce aggregate health care costs (10). Because counseling resources are limited, and triage was a familiar concept, we wanted to match patients and treatments. We also
wanted to be patient-centered in the sense of providing
appropriate types of information and counseling to a heterogeneous population of patients with a wide distribution of
“readiness” for changing key dietary and exercise behaviors. Finally, we wanted the intervention to have a strong
cognitive and behavioral grounding and to be “organized
and proactive,” because occasional advice to “eat less and
exercise more” did not seem to be particularly effective. A
primary care linked mail and telephone intervention based
on the transtheoretical model (TM)1 and some elements of
chronic disease (CD) care seemed to meet most of our a
priori criteria (7,11).
In this paper, we report the results from the Reasonable
Eating and Activity to Change Health (REACH) trial—a
randomized clinical trial of an obesity intervention derived
from the TM and a chronic disease care paradigm (TM-CD)
(12). The focus of the REACH trial was small changes in
multiple target behaviors that should lead to small weight
changes that are sustainable over time. The primary hypothesis driving the REACH trial was that, after 100 weeks of
treatment, the TM-CD intervention patients would experience a greater decrease in body weight compared with
augmented usual care (AUC) patients. Similar secondary
hypotheses addressed changes in low-density lipoprotein
(LDL)-cholesterol, energy consumption, and energy expenditure. Anxiety and depression were expected to retard stage
progression, behavior change, and weight loss. A companion observational study suggested that the elapsed time in
the action or maintenance stages of change is a strong
predictor of weight loss in primary care patients and documented that the majority of REACH trial participants started
the trial in a preaction stage for one or more behaviors,
which is a prerequisite for applying the TM (13).
Research Methods and Procedures
Study Design
The study was a 24-month randomized, parallel-group
trial conducted at 15 primary care practices in northeastern
Ohio between July 1998 and December 2002. Assessments
were scheduled at 0 (baseline), 6, 12, 18, and 24 months.
The initial sample size (540) was chosen to provide a power
of 0.90 to detect a difference of 4.5 kg (about a 5% weight
loss difference) between the TM-CD and AUC groups with
a two-tailed type I error probability of 0.05 and a 20%
dropout rate (14 –17). The impact of alternative values for
the SD and correlation of weight measurements was considered in the sample size calculations (15). The trial also
had 0.90 power to detect small to moderate TM-CD vs.
AUC differences in blood lipids (5%), energy intake (85
kcal/d), and energy expenditure (200 kcal/wk). The original
design called for equal numbers of male and female patients
and African-American patients to be in proportion to their
representation in Summit County and the nation (12%).
Supplemental grant funds secured in the second year of the
trial allowed African-American enrollment to double
(27%).
General recruitment stalled at 500 patients in the latter
half of 1999 while we were waiting for the approval of
additional “single project assurances” that would allow us to
enroll participants at sites with larger proportions of African-American patients. After the approvals were granted,
recruitment continued until the end of 2000. Recruiting
eligible men and African Americans was more difficult than
recruiting eligible white women. Enrollment was closed
when 665 patients were enrolled.
Study Participants
Participants were recruited when they inquired about the
study after either talking to their physician or reading study
brochures, posters, or letters that were mailed to potential
participants identified by primary care physicians. Waiting
room brochures and posters, general newspaper articles, and
announcements at churches with African-American congregations were used to raise community awareness of the
study. All participants were required to be patients in one of
the primary care practices that were affiliated with the
study. All participants provided written informed consent
according to a procedure approved by three institutional
review boards. Representatives of the private practices
signed single project assurances. Men and women, 40 to 69
years of age, with elevated BMI (27 kg/m2
) or elevated
waist-to-hip ratios (WHR; 0.950 for men or 0.800 for
women) were eligible for the study. Exclusion criteria were
no access to a telephone, difficulty understanding eighth1 Nonstandard abbreviations: TM, transtheoretical model; CD, chronic disease; REACH,

grade level spoken or written English, pregnancy, lactation,
6 months postpartum, or use of a wheel chair for mobility.
Primary care physicians excluded high-risk patients with
severe heart or lung disease.
Randomization
After the informed consent process was completed, and
baseline data were collected, participants were randomized
by opening an envelope with a set of ordered tickets indicating “TM-CD” or “Traditional” care. The (NEOUCOM)
Office of Biostatistics prepared the ordered randomization
tickets using permuted blocks of 10. A separate randomization sequence was used for each primary care practice site.
Participants and research staff at each practice were blind to
the assignment of patients while obtaining baseline measures, because assignment envelopes were not opened until
the end of the visit. “Stage of change” (SOC) scores and
Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders (PRIME-MD)
scores were obtained for the intervention group after randomization (see below).
AUC Group
Participants assigned to the AUC group were asked to
provide anthropometric, dietary, and exercise data every 6
months, which is consistent with behavioral self-monitoring
principles. After each semiannual dietary and exercise assessment, a registered dietitian also provided 10 minutes of
counseling based on either the USDA Food Guide Pyramid
(Dietary Guidelines for Americans) or a Soul Food Guide
Pyramid. The dietitian prepared written dietary and exercise
prescriptions based on the information from the dietary and
exercise recalls. Patients were advised to discuss their lipid
and blood pressure values with their primary care physician.
Patients in both the AUC and TM-CD groups were paid $25
for completing each postbaseline assessment.
TM-CD Group
Participants assigned to the TM-CD group had the same
basic care as the AUC group. Patients randomized to both
the AUC and TM-CD groups had anthrometric, dietary, and
physical activity assessments every 6 months and brief (10
minutes) advice based on general dietetic practice (Dietary
Guidelines for Americans) and a standard prescription (reduce calories, increase fruit and vegetables, reduce fat,
increase activity and exercise).
In addition, the TM-CD group was formally evaluated for
anxiety, depression, and binge eating disorder every 6
months, and they completed an SOC assessment for five
target behaviors every 2 months (18,19). The target behaviors were increased exercise, increased usual activity, increased dietary portion control, decreased dietary fat, and
increased fruits and vegetables. Patients in an action stage at
baseline were not excluded.
Mood disorder case-finding is consistent with good
chronic disease care. These disorders are prevalent in primary care populations, and they can complicate the selfmanagement of other chronic diseases such as diabetes or
obesity. We selected the short PRIME-MD instrument because it facilitated valid case-finding for depression, anxiety, and (binge) eating disorder, which seem to affect a
subset of patients who volunteer for weight management
programs (18). We felt that it was unethical to conduct
mood disorder case-finding in the AUC group without informing the primary care physicians of the results; therefore, we restricted the case-finding to the TM-CD group.
Patients were mailed stage- and behavior-matched workbooks that corresponded to their most recent SOC profile.
TM-CD patients also received brief monthly telephone calls
from a weight loss advisor (WLA) who was trained to apply
the processes of change that corresponded to the patient’s
SOC profile. The WLAs had access to a set of public
domain patient handouts and other materials (menu suggestions, mall walking maps, descriptions of local walking
trails) that could be mailed to TM-CD patients when they
requested additional information. Primary care physicians
had the option of receiving a report indicating when a
TM-CD patient was “positive” for depression or anxiety.
Physicians received periodic reports summarizing
TM-CD patient progress with respect to the five target
behaviors. A part-time pharmaceutical representative was
trained to provide academic detailing to physicians on the
use of the SOC profiles, the processes of change, and how
to use a small double-sided SOC flip chart when counseling
patients in the examination room. We expected that primary
care physicians would address obesity issues only after all
“acute” concerns had been dealt with, when the patient
brought up the issue, or at infrequent (one, two, or three
times per year) chronic disease visits (diabetes check-up).
Chart reviews at baseline and 12 and 24 months suggested
a low level of physician attention to dietary, exercise, or
weight issues before (15% of charts) and during (6% of
charts) the trial.
Monthly WLA telephone calls averaged 15 minutes per
call. TM-CD participants were taught behavioral techniques
consistent with Prochaska’s description of the relationship
between the “processes of change” and the “stages of
change” for the target behaviors. Self-monitoring of the
target behaviors was recommended for patients in action or
maintenance, but self-monitoring records were not reviewed
by the physician or the WLA. Daily self-weighing was not
recommended because daily weight changes were expected
to be small. We assumed that small daily weight changes
could be either motivating or discouraging depending on
expectations and the behavioral context.
Implementation of the WLA telephone protocol was
monitored by the project psychologist (KS), who periodically debriefed the WLAs and advised them how to interact

with problematic patients. Patients were assigned to one of
three WLAs, but personnel issues (vacation, illness, maternity leave) necessitated WLA cross-coverage for the telephone calls. However, the WLAs documented key aspects
of each patient encounter in an Access database, which
provided some continuity of care. The database was consulted before and during each WLA telephone call to help
the WLA remember each patient’s current SOC profile and
other issues. Use of the WLA database to support a counseling encounter, relying on periodic proactive patient contacts, allowing the patients some latitude in selecting the
target behaviors to focus on, and accommodating the entire
SOC distribution are consistent with Wagner’s chronic disease care model (7).
Outcome Measures
The main outcome measure was weight, which was measured every 6 months for 24 months at primary care physician offices using a standardized calibrated scale. Other
biological risk measurements included waist girths, blood
lipids (from a central laboratory), and blood pressures.
Measurements with an important behavioral and cognitive
component were estimates of daily energy intake from three
(NDS-R) software-driven dietary recalls and total energy
expenditure per kilogram per day from a metabolic equivalent-coded 7-day physical activity recall (20,21). Psychosocial measurements included scales for self-efficacy, social
support, and decisional balance for healthy eating and exercise, the SF-12 subscales for general physical and mental
health, and a social desirability scale (22–28). The primary
outcome measure was TM-CD vs. AUC body weight
change from baseline at or near the end of the 24-month
follow-up.
Primary care records were abstracted once a year. Chart
weights were substituted for measured weights when the
latter were missing. Seventy percent of the participants had
a measured weight from the 18- or 24-month follow-up
visit. Eighty-eight percent of participants had either a measured or chart weight at or close to the 18- or 24-month
measurement period. Pearson correlations between measured and chart weights averaged 0.99 (over repeated measures). Weight data (measured or chart) were equally available from both treatment groups at follow-up months 6, 12,
and 24. At month 18, there were significantly more weight
values available for the TM-CD group (85% vs. 78%; 2 
5.6).
Statistical Analysis
Differences between the treatment groups at baseline
were analyzed using 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The
primary hypothesis test focused on the final weight change
from baseline to month 24 (or month 18 if the month 24
value was missing). An intention-to-treat analysis including
all randomized participants was performed using linear
models and linear mixed (repeated-measures) models (Proc
GLM and Proc Mixed, SAS version 8.2; SAS Institute,
Cary, NC) using baseline variables, unstructured covariance
matrices, and a missing at random (MAR) assumption. The
MAR assumption is that the dropout pattern for missing
repeated measures is random conditional on all known
(observed) values of the repeated measures and baseline
variables (29,30). Use of the MAR assumption is more
likely to yield unbiased parameter estimates than “analysis
of complete data” (31). In a sensitivity analysis considering
the 12% of patients with missing weights for month 18 or
24, we used baseline weight as a substitute (32). Subgroup
analyses allowed for the possibility of synergistic or antagonistic effects.
Results
Participant Follow-up
Figure 1 shows the proportion of participants in each
study group (AUC or TM-CD) with a measured weight
(53.9% to 79.6%) and other information at the four folFigure 1: Participant follow-up by study group.

low-up assessments. Figure 1 also shows the proportion
with a measured weight or a chart weight (78.0% to 92.1%)
when the latter was substituted for a missing measured
weight. The majority of missing values occurred because
participants declined further participation when an effort
was made to schedule a follow-up appointment. Three patients died (two probable heart attacks and one automobile
accident) during follow-up. After reviewing the circumstances of death, the local Institutional Review Board
judged that these deaths were unrelated to trial participation.
Participant Characteristics
Characteristics of participants at baseline are shown in
Table 1. All 95% CIs on differences between the AUC and
TM-CD groups at baseline included zero. According to their
BMIs, 20% of participants were overweight, 34% had Class
I obesity, 23% had Class II obesity, and 23% had Class III
obesity. Ninety-five percent of the participants reported
prior weight loss attempts, 81% reported that their physician
had previously advised them to lose weight, and 47% had
prior experience with a commercial weight loss program.
Since their early twenties, 28% reported that they had
gained an average of 36.3 lb (16.5 kg), 50% reported that
they had gained an average of 71.1 lb (32.3 kg), and 15%
reported that they had gained an average of 118.7 lb (54.0
kg).
Final Weight Change
The mean weight change from baseline for the TM-CD
group to the end of follow-up was 0.39 kg (SE  0.38;
95% CI  1.1, 0.4). The mean weight change for the
AUC group was 0.16 kg (SE  0.42; 95% CI  1.0,
0.7). The difference of 0.23 kg greater weight loss in the
TM-CD group was not significant (p  0.50) and had a 95%

CI of 1.4, 0.9. The difference after adjusting for baseline
weight and other covariates was highly similar at 0.22 kg
greater weight loss in the TM-CD group. For the final
weight analysis, 70% of patients made their final visits; for
another 18% of patients, medical chart weights were obtained for the same period (within 1 month of the 18- to
24-month range). The chart weights correlated 0.99 with
measured weights when both were available. A sensitivity
analysis of these results substituted baseline weights for the
12% with missing final weights data, i.e., no change was
substituted for these 12%. This gave highly similar results,
with a 0.21 kg greater weight loss in the TM-CD group. The
mean change from baseline for both groups combined was
0.29 kg (95% CI  0.9, 0.3).
Repeated Measures on Weight
From Figure 2, a familiar pattern of early weight loss and
regain appeared. In comparing early change (6 and 12
months) with late change (18 and 24 months) in the two
groups, no significant difference was found (p  0.17), even
though the TM-CD group appeared to lose 0.5 kg (SE 
0.4) more weight in the early period than the AUC group.
Combining the two groups, this early loss and regain pattern
(within-group change) was highly significant (p  0.0001).
Figure 2 shows estimates of mean weight change by intervention group and data wave from the mixed repeatedmeasures model.
Figure 3 shows estimates of mean waist girth change by
intervention group and data wave. The overall waist girth
comparison of AUC and -CD groups was not significant
(p  0.57). A significant (p  0.0001) decrease of 1.7  0.4
cm was found (for both groups combined) at 24 months.
Change in Energy Intake and Expenditure
An analysis of mean change in energy intake and energy
expenditure by intervention group and data wave was completed. The overall AUC vs. TM-CD comparison of energy
intake was not significant (p  0.69). As in the waist girth
analysis with both groups combined, the energy intake
analysis revealed a significant (p  0.0001) mean decrease
at month 24 (250 kcal/d). This decrease was consistent
throughout the 6- to 24-month measurements. The overall
AUC vs. TM-CD comparison of energy expenditure was not
Figure 2: Mean weight change by intervention group.

922 OBESITY RESEARCH Vol. 13 No. 5 May 2005
significant (p  0.31). At month 24, the increase in energy
expenditure was significant (2 kcal/kg per day) for both
groups combined (p  0.04).
Exercise Minutes
Figure 4 shows estimates of the mean change in selfreported exercise minutes per week. The overall AUC vs.
TM-CD comparison was significant (p  0.008). The estimate of the mean difference between the AUC and TM-CD
groups was 31.5  12 additional minutes per week in the
TM-CD group across all measurements. The difference was
consistent from 6 to 24 months.
Lipids, Blood Pressure, and Interactions
Similar analyses of repeated blood lipid and blood pressure data yielded similar results. There were no significant
lipid or blood pressure differences between the AUC and
TM-CD groups during follow-up. Mixed repeated measures
models of weight, waist girth, energy intake, energy expenditure, exercise minutes, lipids, or blood pressure with additional cross-product terms for intervention group  sex,
group  BMI, group  ethnicity, and group  data wave
provided no support for the existence of statistical interactions. Thus, it seems that our general results are not modified by the patient’s sex, ethnicity, baseline BMI group, or
follow-up period.
Discussion
The estimate of the 18- to 24-month weight change
difference between the TM-CD and AUC groups was not
statistically different from zero, and the 95% CI had a
narrow range of 1.1 kg on either side of a 0.23 difference in
favor of TM-CD. Thus, the data do not support our a priori
hypothesis that overweight and obese primary care patients
would lose more weight if they were exposed to the TM-CD
intervention (plus AUC) vs. AUC alone. In other words, the
data suggest that the combination of elements in the AUC
was largely equivalent to the combination of elements of
AUC plus TM-CD care. Analysis of other outcomes such as
waist girth, energy intake, energy expenditure, blood lipids,
and blood pressure was generally consistent with the weight
change analysis. The one exception was the results for the
weekly exercise minutes variable, which were more consistent with the hypothesized superiority of the TM-CD intervention. It is not clear whether misreporting biased the
positive result for exercise minutes, but such an explanation
suggests that we should have found similar biases for other
self-reported behaviors such as energy intake. Moreover,
social desirability scores were not associated with exercise
minutes or other trial outcomes. WLAs were instructed to
periodically bring up the subject of exercise, even when the
patient did not choose to do so, because we believed that

OBESITY RESEARCH Vol. 13 No. 5 May 2005 923
many patients in our obesogenic environment focus exclusively on their diets, avoid the exercise issue, and thereby
sabotage their longer-term weight loss effort.
Calibrated scales and chart weights that correlated 0.99
suggest adequate protection against measurement bias.
Through random assignment, the two groups were highly
similar at baseline. Relatively complete follow-up (88%)
and the statistical methods used to deal with missing data
suggest that biased follow-up does not explain the results.
The statistical analysis also allowed for the possibility of
interactions between the intervention and sex, ethnicity, and
BMI group, but no evidence of these interactions was found.
Finally, the sample size produced very precise estimates of
effect size with narrow CIs.
One explanation of the results includes poor WLA adherence to the SOC protocol; i.e., WLA adherence to the
SOC protocol remained an issue despite their extensive
training through role-playing and periodic debriefings with
the trial psychologist. According to the WLA database, the
WLAs used stage appropriate processes of change during
47% of the telephone encounters. This reflects the fact that
WLAs did not document their use of a process of change
when “no barrier to change” was reported. Given that 60%
of the participants had stable weights between months 6 and
24, a significant proportion of patients may have been
underreporting “barriers” to additional weight loss. Thus,
the WLAs had fewer opportunities than anticipated to apply
stage-appropriate processes of change, because many patients may have denied that there was an issue.
Taking the broadest view, we note that the participants in
the REACH trial were at high risk for additional weight
gain, yet they maintained their weight for 24 months, while
significantly (p  0.0001) decreasing their waist girths by 2
cm and significantly decreasing (p  0.0001) energy intake
by 250 kcal/d. Thus, weight maintenance in 60% of overweight or obese primary care patients may be accomplished
by reviewing and/or renewing a standard dietary and exercise prescription that is informed by a brief anthropometric
examination, sets of three dietary recalls, and a physical
activity questionnaire every 6 months. The relative stability
of REACH patient weights may be particularly important
because weight regain, even after a major weight loss
(10% of baseline), is a recognized problem limiting the
effectiveness of most behavioral interventions (33).
There have been no prior attempts to apply the TM and a
CD paradigm to multiple target behaviors conducive of
weight loss through periodic telephone calls from a weight
loss advisor (34). Reliance on a telephone WLA is appealing because of the limited patient-clinician encounter time
available in traditional acute problem– oriented primary
care. Also, patients do not have to take the time to travel to
the physician’s office and wait for a clinician or a group
visit. However, our data suggest that once-a-month telephone weight loss advice with a strong theoretical basis may

not be effective, given the strength of the obesogenic environment. Other telephone counseling trials have had positive results, but those trials also had weekly or biweekly
contact with participants (35). It is not clear that simply
increasing the frequency of telephone calls is the best strategy, given the available treatment alternatives (36).
At least 18 randomized trials have reported interventions
targeting one or more weight loss–related behaviors; however, the evidence supporting the value of TM theory for
weight management from these trials is mixed (8,37–53).
Over one-half of the trials reported no additional effect from
the intervention on a least one weight-related outcome at the
end of follow-up (8,37,39,41,42,44,46 – 48,50,53). Two trials reported nonsignificant findings for 12-month weight
change (44,50).
Four recent non-TM trials suggest that modest interventions are likely to produce modest weight losses (5% to
10%) in an obesogenic environment (54 –57). Womble et al.
(57) compared a commercial Internet intervention to an
intervention with the Lifestyle, Exercise, Attitudes, Relationships, Nutrition (LEARN) weight control manual, 11
brief blood pressure and weight assessment visits, and 4
visits with a psychologist. Jeffery et al. (55) compared a
proactive 10-lesson telephone and mail-based intervention,
a similar proactive mail-based intervention, and a usual
managed care intervention. Ashley et al. (54) compared 26
group visits with a dietitian using the Lifestyle, Exercise,
Attitudes, Relationships, Nutrition (LEARN) manual, 26
group visits with a dietitian plus meal replacement (Slimfast), and 26 visits to a primary care physician or a nurse
plus meal replacement. Finally, Wadden et al. (56) compared counseling by a nutritionist or psychiatrist plus DLfenfluramine and phentermine.
Heshka et al. (58) described their recent 24-month randomized trial comparing self-help to a commercial weight
loss program. They reported small significant weight loss
differences (2.9 vs. 0.2 kg) that favored the commercial
program. However, an important feature of this commercial
program was weekly weigh-ins, an element of care that was
specifically excluded from the REACH trial protocol. The
U.S. Preventive Services Task Force defines the intensity of
obesity counseling in terms of the frequency of provider–
patient contacts in the first 3 months of treatment (59).
Monthly contact was described as “moderate” intensity, and
those trials with more than monthly contact were more
likely to be successful (59). Thus, given the evidence assembled by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force since
the REACH trial was designed, it now seems disingenuous
to argue that minimal behavioral counseling directed at
portion control (dietary energy restriction) can be an effective long-term treatment for obesity (33). The argument
turns on the operational difference between intensive (once
or twice a week) and minimal (once a month to once a year).
Standard behavior therapy, which is recommended by the
NIH obesity treatment guidelines, involves the application
of the principles of self-monitoring, contracting, modeling,
reinforcement, and environmental control to weight loss–
related behaviors— often in weekly meetings that continue
for 6 months or longer. Weight loss in these intensive
programs can approach 10% of initial body weight. However, when the meeting frequency is reduced to save costs,
the lost weight tends to return. Thus, research has focused
on alternatives to weekly group meetings, such as periodic
telephone calls or Internet encounters. The design for the
REACH trial was motivated by the apparent need for an
alternative to 26 to 52 weekly group meetings in a medical
specialty center setting.
Therefore, our interest was in telephone weight loss advising based on the TM and a CD paradigm. Our longitudinal data on the elapsed time in the action stages and
weight loss support the concept of SOC (13). However, the
comparisons of the weight change data between the AUC
and TM-CD groups also suggest that some fundamental
behavioral elements such as weekly telephone weigh-ins or
weekly review of pedometer and portion control logs may
have been missing from the TM-CD intervention (60). Finally, the link between the clinical intervention and public
health programs could be strengthened. Primary care patients with different levels of obesity and clinical or social
issues should be able to choose from a variety of clinical
programs and formats—all of which are supported by compatible public health programs and initiatives.
