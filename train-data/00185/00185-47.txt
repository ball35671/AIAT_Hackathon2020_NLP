Abstract
Controlled epidemiological surveillance covering the total number of 13,355 schoolchildren aged 11-14 years and adolescents was carried out with a view to compare the efficacies of inactivated influenza vaccines. The children were immunized intradermally in a single injection with inactivated influenza vaccines containing A (H3N2) and A (H1N1) hemagglutinins, 3.5 micrograms per 0.2 ml of the preparation each. The studies demonstrated the safety and low reactogenicity of these vaccines, as well as their high antigenic potency. In 1984 during mixed influenza B + A (H1N1) epidemic the preparations produced a pronounced prophylactic effect: the efficacy indices were 1.6-1.9 (p less than 0.001). The results obtained in these studies made it possible to recommend two inactivated influenza vaccines (chromatographic and centrifugal) for practical medicine with the aim of protecting children aged 11 years and over from influenza.
