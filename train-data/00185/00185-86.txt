Background: Influenza outbreaks in the childcare setting are a significant cause of excess winter morbidity. This study explored methods of
follow up and sample collection for a proposed randomised controlled trial of influenza vaccination in children attending childcare.
Methods: The study was conducted in four Sydney childcare centres during 2007. Healthy children aged 6–59 months eligible for vaccination
were recruited in two centres, with another two acting as controls. Data on influenza-like illness (ILI: 37.8°C plus at least one respiratory
symptom) occurrence were collected weekly. In those children with an ILI, parents were asked to collect nasal swabs and send via surface mail
for viral polymerase chain reaction. Vaccine efficacy (VE) for ILI was estimated overall and for subgroups aged 6–23 and 24–59 months using the
formula VE = 1 - relative risk (RR).
Results: Sixty-three per cent (151/238) of eligible children had parents give consent. Sixty-three children received influenza vaccine and 88
participated as controls. Of 26 specimens returned, a virus was detected in 18 (69%); none with influenza. Two symptomatic children had positive
near-patient influenza tests in general practice (one a vaccine failure). The RR with 95% confidence interval in all children and those aged
6–23 months were less than one, 0.56 (0.32–1.02) and 0.46 (0.15–1.45), respectively.
Conclusions: This study demonstrated the feasibility and utility of parent-collected and mailed respiratory specimens for VE research in the
childcare setting. Two-thirds of parent-collected swabs proved positive for at least one virus. Finding ways to reduce reluctance of parents to
submit samples could improve the representativeness of samples collected and the power of the study. No evidence was found for influenza VE,
but point estimates were in the direction of protection.

Introduction
Influenza is a seasonal, vaccine-preventable disease which
causes excess morbidity and mortality during winter in temperate climates. The health and economic costs associated with
childhood influenza are substantial.1 For example, in Australia
during 2002–2005, there were reports of 25 433 hospitalisations
and four deaths for influenza and pneumonia among children
aged under 5 years.2 The annual cost due to influenza-related
diseases in Australia is estimated to exceed $115 million.3
The World Health Organization recommends annual influenza vaccination as the cornerstone for prevention and control.
Efficacious influenza vaccines have been available for over
50 years, and yet, routine use in childhood remains the

What is already known on this topic
1 Children in childcare are more likely to contract influenza and
transmit infection to their siblings, parents, extended families
and child-care workers.
2 USA, Canada and Western Australia currently have a routine
influenza vaccine policy in place that includes children 6 months
of age and older.
3 Evidence for the effectiveness of influenza vaccine in children
aged less than 24 months is limited and high quality, appropriately powered, randomised controlled trials are needed.
What this study adds
1 It is feasible to follow children weekly for 3 months to obtain
swabs for influenza-like illness.
2 Two-thirds of parent-collected swabs were positive for at least
one virus demonstrating the utility of this approach for future
studies. Reluctance of parents to submit swabs for analysis may
be a limitation of this approach.

exception in most countries. The effectiveness of influenza
vaccine for children in childcare has been demonstrated for
children aged 24 months.4–8 Although the US Advisory Committee on Immunisation Practices has recommended children
aged 6–23 months to be vaccinated with influenza vaccine since
2004,9 there is ongoing debate about vaccine effectiveness in
this age group. Three recent systematic reviews10–12 concluded
that either influenza vaccine was not effective in children
24 months of age or that there were insufficient data to form
a conclusion.
Influenza is transmitted from person to person through
contact and respiratory droplets; however, the droplets do not
remain suspended in the air for long nor do they travel far.13
Transmission of influenza generally requires close contact with
an infected person or contact with a contaminated surface or
object.14,15 The childcare setting provides enhanced opportunities for transmission of infections including influenza as there is
prolonged close interaction between young children and the
sharing of toys and other objects. Further to this, young children
are particularly susceptible to infection as they are immunologically naïve to many viruses.
Commercial childcare in Australia is available in two broad
categories: daycare centres (DCC) for children aged 6 weeks
until 6 years and pre-school centres (PSC) for children aged 3 to
6 years. Commercial childcare usage in Australia is increasing.
The median attendance time for Australian children who use
childcare is 10 h per week, but 13% attend 35 h a week or
more.16 Children in childcare are known to be more likely to
contract respiratory illnesses, including influenza,17–21 and are
considered to be major transmitters of influenza to their siblings,
parents, extended families and care workers.6,8,22,23
The 2007 influenza season in Australia ran from late May
until October and notifications peaked during August.24 Australia witnessed antigenically drifted influenza virus (A/Brisbane/
59/2007 (H1N1)-like and A/Brisbane/10/2007 (H3N2)-like),
and it was the most severe influenza season since a national
influenza reporting system was established in 2001.25
With this study, the primary process issues of conducting
influenza vaccine research in the childcare environment were
evaluated, including recruitment, retention, vaccination and
specimen handling. While this pilot study was not powered to
assess an efficacy end point, preliminary vaccine efficacy (VE)
data were also examined.
Methods
Subjects
From July to August 2007, children aged 6–59 months attending
four childcare centres in New South Wales were recruited for this
study: two DCC caring for children aged 0–59 months and two
PSC caring for children aged 36–59 months. The four DCC were
chosen by convenience (proximity to The Children’s Hospital at
Westmead) with equal number of children between DCC and
PSC. One DCC and one PSC were allocated to influenza vaccination, and one DCC and one PSC were allocated to be controls.
This study was approved by The Royal Alexandra Hospital for
Children Ethics Committee, and informed parental consent for
participation was obtained prior to study procedures. The participating children were evaluated in two age groups based on
age at enrolment: 6–23 months and 24–59 months.
Vaccine and schedule
The influenza vaccine administered was a 2007 Southern Hemisphere preparation, purified, inactivated, split vaccine (VAXIGRIP JUNIOR, provided by Sanofi Pasteur, Lyon, France),
incorporating:
• A/New Caledonia/20/99 (H1N1)-like strain (A/New Caledonia /20/99 IVR-116);
• A/Wisconsin/67/2005 (H3N2)-like strain (A/Wisconsin/67/
2005 NYMCX-161B);
• B/Malaysia/2506/2004-like strain.
Children were administrated the vaccine according to the
standard recommended dose and schedule for age.26 As all children at the centres randomised to receive vaccine were influenza vaccine naïve, each received two doses of vaccine 1 month
apart – 0.25 mL intramuscular dose for those less than
36 months of age and 0.5 mL intramuscular dose for those aged
36–59 months at the time of their first dose. Vaccines were
administered between 11 July 2007 and 19 September 2007.
Influenza-like illness surveillance and
specimen collection
We defined influenza-like illness (ILI) as an illness with fever
>37.8°C and with one or more respiratory symptoms (cough,
blocked nose or runny nose) to maximise sensitivity. As a protective level of antibody is usually detectable within 2 weeks of
the second dose of vaccine,13,27 ILI surveillance was commenced
in vaccinated children at this time point. In control children, ILI
surveillance was arbitrarily commenced from the week ending
26 August 2007: at this time, just over half (32/62) of the
children eventually fully vaccinated had received vaccine, and
from that week, the ratio of child-weeks of follow up in vaccinated and unvaccinated children was similar (Fig. 2). Parent
education for ILI surveillance was provided at study entry.
Households received a weekly email or telephone call from 30
July until 21 October 2007 (12 weeks) to monitor the study
children for ILI symptoms.
Parent training for the collection of nasal swabs was conducted by study nurses after the second immunisation. Nasal
swabs were collected using the Virocult collection system
(MW950) consisting of a rayon swab on a plastic shaft, with
viral transport medium-soaked foam pad in the base of the
transport tube (COPAN Italia, Brescia, Italy), and were returned
to the Queensland Paediatric Infectious Diseases Laboratory
using a pre-addressed, postage-paid envelope.
Laboratory methods
Returned specimens were tested using previously reported,
real-time polymerase chain reaction assays with reverse transcription for RNA viruses. A total of 16 viruses were investigated: human rhinoviruses (HRV),28 influenza A, influenza B,
RSV, adenoviruses, HMPV, parainfluenza viruses I, II and III,29
bocavirus30 hPyV-WU, hPyV-KI,31 and human coronaviruses:

study protocol, some children had near-patient influenza tests
performed by their general practitioners and these were
reported by parents to study staff.
Statistical analyses and VE
ILI incidence rates were calculated using child-weeks in the
denominator. Rate ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals
were calculated comparing vaccinated and unvaccinated
groups. These values were used to estimate VE using the
formula VE = (1 - RR) ¥ 100%. Comparisons were performed in
three age groups, 6–59 months (all children), 6–23 months and
24–59 months.
Results
Subjects and influenza vaccination
The average ages of the children in the vaccine and control
centre were 43.4 (7.7–65.4) and 44.1 (7.9–66.0) months,
respectively, while the proportions who were males were 50.8
and 58.0%. Data on non-enrolled children were not recorded.
There were 239 children in total attending the four childcare
centres, and 151 children were enrolled giving a recruitment
rate of 63%. Complete information was available for analysis in
150 children, with one vaccinated child lost to follow up during
the study period (Fig. 1).
ILI surveillance
There were 481 (62 children) and 792 (88 children) child-weeks
of follow up in vaccine and control centres, respectively. A total
of 59 ILIs were identified in all study children, and weekly ILI
incidence rates are provided (Fig. 2).
Laboratory results
Of the 26 swabs received during the study period, 18 (69%) had
at least one virus identified, with bocavirus being the most
common virus found in six swabs (Table 1), followed by HRV in
five swabs. One swab contained three viruses (HRV, adenovirus
and bocavirus). Thirteen of these swabs were from 12 vaccinated children, with the other half from 13 controls.
Two positive near-patient influenza tests (one a vaccine
failure) were reported by parents to the study staff: one was
from an unvaccinated child in a control centre; the other child
was vaccinated with the test done 14 days post-second vaccination (Table 1).
Estimate of VE against ILI
There were a total of 59 ILIs identified with efficacy point
estimates in the direction of protection for all age-groups but not
significant (Table 2).
Discussion
The key findings of this pilot study were that a high recruitment
rate could be achieved, that recruited families were tolerant of
regular weekly follow up over an extended period (3 months)
and that there was no evidence of protective efficacy, but point
estimates of VE for the less-specific end point of ILI were in the
direction of protection.
It is inevitable that ILI would include non-influenza infections
which cause respiratory signs and symptoms, especially as we
used a sensitive definition (at the expense of specificity), so it
is not surprising that a range of other viral pathogens were
identified in our study. A population-based surveillance
study showed that less than 10% of hospitalised children aged
59 months with ILI had confirmed influenza infection.34
Our study has some limitations. The childcare centres were
not randomised. The commencement midway through an influenza season limited the number of influenza cases identified.
Less than half the episodes in children of ILI (26 out of 59, 44%)
had a respiratory sample sent. This reduced sampling is probably
due to the added burden on parents of sample collection (and
posting) while a child is ill. In addition, as the childcare centres

were in the suburbs with relatively lower Socio-Economic
Indexes for Areas35 (and also involved larger families), this, too,
may have limited parental cooperation. The participants were
only followed from the 2nd half of August when the 2007
season was peaking, so some may have thought that sample
collection in September or October was too late. Given the
limited data that were collected on symptomatology and the
relatively small number of specimens, it was not possible to do
an extensive analysis comparing symptoms by virus type to
address if there are differences in symptoms among various
viruses. Furthermore, the demographic data (e.g. sex, age
range) of those who did not participate in the study were not
collected; therefore, it was not possible to identify if there was
any recruitment bias. Greater efforts are required for future
studies in (i) improving the proportion of swabs collected and
sent by initiating ILI follow up before the influenza season starts
and findings better ways to overcome parents’ reluctance in
submitting swabs; (ii) obtaining more detailed data on symptomatology of respiratory infection; and (iii) collecting
de-identified demographic data on those who are not enrolled
in the study.
This study showed no evidence for influenza VE. There was
only a suggestion of protection in that all the point estimates
were in that direction. Trivalent, live, cold-adapted influenza
vaccine (CAIV-T) may be a better option for young children and
has been demonstrated to have significantly higher efficacy than
inactivated vaccine among young children during moderate36,37
and high attack-rate influenza seasons.38 CAIV-T was also able
to provide protection even when the circulating influenza virus
was an antigenically distinct strain.37
There were two children with positive results for influenza A
from the near-patient test. This type of test is known to have
only moderate sensitivity but high specificity, so a positive test is
unlikely to be false.39

Older children (24–59 months) are more likely to have developed natural immunity through previous infection and are
more likely to have developed better personal hygiene. For
these reasons, older children are less susceptible to influenza as
well as other non-influenza infections that may cause ILI.
Conclusions
This pilot study has shown the feasibility and value of parentcollected (and mailed) nasal sample for influenza VE research in
childcare. Two-third of parent-collected swabs proved positive
for at least one virus. Means of lessening reluctance of parents to
submit respiratory samples from their children need to be found
to improve the representativeness of samples collected and the
power of the study. No evidence was found for influenza VE, but
point estimates were all in the direction of protection.
