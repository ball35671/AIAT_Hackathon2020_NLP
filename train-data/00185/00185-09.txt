Children (n = 192) aged 3-19 years from 98 families completed this double-blind, placebocontrolled study comparing the efficacy of a bivalent attenuated (CR) vaccine with trivalent inactivated (TI) vaccine. Both vaccinescontained A/Chile/83 (HIN1)-like antigens. After vaccination
the geometric mean titer to A/Taiwan/86 (HIN1) was 1:36 in the CR group, 1:92 in the TI group,
and 1:5 in the placebo group. During the influenza A/Taiwan/86 (H1N1)epidemic, 21.4% of CR
recipients, 16.7% of TI recipients, and 43.9% of placebo recipients were infected with influenza
A/Taiwan. TI vaccine provided better heterotypic protection than did CR vaccine for children
aged 10-18 years (infection rate, 0 vs. 24%, respectively; P < .025); in contrast, in the younger
children (3-9 years), CR vaccine tended to be more protective (19% vs. 26% for TI).
Influenza virus infection continues to cause serious morbidity and mortality in the United States [1-5]. Children regularly experience serious morbidity resulting from this
infection [6, 7] and are important vectors for viral spread in
the community [8-12]. Effective means for preventing infection in children would decrease morbidity [13] and reduce
the risk ofinfection for their contacts. Community-wide prophylaxis of children could dampen epidemics and reduce serious morbidity and mortality in high-risk adults.
The attenuated cold recombinant (CR) influenza vaccine
developed by Maassab and DeBorde [14] has theoretical advantages over available inactivated vaccines administered by
injection. The CR vaccines, administered by nose drops, are
well tolerated [15-18] and produce an inapparent infection
that stimulates both local and systemic immune responses
[19-21]. CR vaccines may produce a broader immune response
that could persist for a longer time, reducing the need for frequent immunization [22].
Most investigations ofthe CR vaccine have been experimental challenge studies done with monovalent vaccines. Studies
with bivalent CR vaccines (HINI and H3N2) have shown adequate immunogenicity of each component, although there was
a suggestion of a diminished response to H3N2 component
[23-25]. Few studies with bivalent CR vaccines have been

reported during naturally occurring epidemics [26]. An outbreak of influenza A/Taiwan (HINl) in 1986-1987 provided
the first opportunity to study heterotypic protection of children given bivalent CR vaccine and trivalent inactivated (TI)
vaccine, both ofwhich contained antigen to the earlier HINI
variant A/Chile/83.
Subjects and Methods
Vaccines. Bivalent CR influenzaA vaccine and TI vaccine were
evaluated. The bivalent CR vaccine contained 107 TCIDso of CR90 (A/Bethesda/lI85 [H3N2]) and 107 TCIDso of CR98 (A/Texas/l/
85 [HINI]) in 0.5 mI. The A/Texas/lI85 (HINI) was antigenically
similar to A/Chile/lI83 (HINI) (Maurice W. Hannon, Centers for
Disease Control [CDC], personal communication). The TI wasthe

which contained 15 p,g each of A1Chile/83 (HINI), A/Mississippi/85
(H3N2), and B/Ann Arbor/86 hemagglutininantigensin 0.5ml [27].
Clinical design. Participants were enrolled by family from the
Houston Family Study, the Baylor Family Practice Clinic in Houston, and the Family Medicine Clinic at the University of Oklahoma
Health Science Center in OklahomaCity. Of enrolled families, 30%
were assigned to each vaccine and 40% to placebo. About 70% of
the families were enrolled and randomized the previous year; children in these families received the same preparation each year [25].
On enrollment, medical history and physicalexaminationweredone
for each child to ensure that the subject was healthy and eligible
for the study. Serum specimens for influenza antibody tests were
obtained from all family members in Houston and all persons ~3
years of age in Oklahoma City.All children 3-18 years who attended
school or day care centers received the vaccine or placebo to which
their family was assigned. The subjects received 0.5 ml of CR intranasally or TI intramuscularly as a single dose. Placebo recipients
were randomly assigned to receive nose drops (buffered saline) or
intramuscular injection (sterile saline). Children receiving vaccine
or placebo were brought in 3-4 weeks after vaccination to obtain
a second blood specimen to determine antibody responses to vaccine antigens.

When ongoing community surveillance at the Influenza Research
Center indicated that influenza virus was spreading in the community, weekly telephone contacts to families were made to evaluate
respiratory illnesses.Home or clinicvisitswere scheduled for physical
examination and collection of nasal washes and throat swab specimens for viral isolation. Two weeks after community surveillance
indicated that the influenza epidemic had ended, all family members ~3 years had their final blood specimen drawn. An illness was
attributed to influenza A infection if influenza virus was isolated
during the illness or, for persons with a postseason antibody rise
only, if no other virus was detected in the illness specimen and if
the illness occurred within 10 days of an isolate in household contact or during the period of most intense influenza activity in the
community. Illnesses were characterized by review of illness records,
which included date of onset, symptoms, physical signs, and diagnosis of each contact. Illnesses were classified as afebrile or febrile
(temperature >38°C). Febrile illnesses included upper or lower respiratory tract illness, otitis media, or influenza-like illness.
Viral identification. Nasal wash and throat swab specimens were
inoculated onto MDCK, LLC-MK2, WI-38, and HEp-2 tissue culture cell lines [28]. Viruses were initiallydetected by cytopathic effect
or hemadsorption; influenza identities were confirmed by ELISA
or fluorescent antibody staining of infected cells [29]. A sample of
isolates from community surveillance was submitted to CDC for
antigenic characterization; all isolates were shown to be like A/Tai~
wan/1/86 (HINI)or the closely related A/Singapore/6/86 (HINI) virus.
Serology. Serum specimens were tested by a standard hemagglutination inhibition test and by microtiter neutralization [30] with
each HINI virus (A/Chile/lI83 and A/Taiwan/lI86). Infection was
defined by viral isolation with or without an accompanying antibody
rise. In the absence of viral isolation, a single eightfold or greater
rise or two or more fourfold or greater rises in titer were accepted
as evidence of infection.
Data analysis. Statistical comparisons of infection and illness
rates between groups were analyzed by X2• Comparison of geometric mean antibody titers (GMT) between groups was made by analysis of variances and Newman-Keuls multiple comparison tests.

Results
We enrolled 103 families, consisting of 166 adults and 225
children, in the study; 98 families with 157 adults, 192 children ~3 years old, and 20 children <3 years old or who did
not receive the vaccine completed the study. Individuals who
did not complete the study had either moved from study sites
or refused to provide subsequent blood specimens. Differences
in socioeconomic status, average size of family, and age distribution are summarized in table 1.
Serum antibody responses. Table 2 presents antibody responses to the two vaccines by age and preexisting titers.
Significant antibody rise occurred with about equal frequency
for both vaccine groups (CR, 55%; TI, 59%). Younger children and children with preexisting titers <1:4 responded to
CR vaccines with a slightly greater frequency. The postvaccine GMTs were 1:36 for CR vaccine, 1:92 for TI vaccine,
and 1:5 for placebo. Of the children who received placebo,

Table 5. Relationship of postvaccination titers (logj) in children
who received cold recombinant (CR) or trivalent inactivated (TI)
vaccine or placebo to infection with influenza A/Taiwan/86 (HINI).
Only 12 (21%) of 56 who received CR vaccine were infected,
for a protection rate of 51% (P <.05). The infection rate for
TI recipients was 17/100, for a protection rate of 62 % (P <
.01). For children 10-18 years of age, infection rates differed
significantly by vaccine received, although both groups had
significant protection compared with placebo recipients. No
infections were detected among older TI vaccine recipients,
compared with an infection rate of 24/100 for 10- to 18-yearold CR vaccinees. For younger children (3-9 years) the vaccine efficacy was reversed, particularly for children who had
received their second annual immunization (table 4). Two
doses of CR vaccine gave 74% protection against infection
and 81%protection against illness associated with the A/Taiwan/86 infection.
The GMTs in the CR and TI groups were similar in those
who became infected with influenza A/Taiwan/86, although
the CR vaccine had a lower GMT in the noninfected group
(table 5). There were no significant differences in GMT in
the placebo group between those who did and did not become
infected.
Table 6 illustrates the infection rates related to postvaccination antibody level. The infection rate was high in all three
groups for children with antibody titers ~1:16. Of9 infections
ofTI recipients, 6 were detected by viral isolation, while only
4 of 12 infections of CR vaccinees and 12 of 36 infections
of placebo recipients were detected thus. Two TI recipients
with postvaccination GMTs >1:128 developed febrile respiratory illnesses; influenza A/Taiwan/86 virus was isolated
from each but neither had an antibody rise. The high serum
antibody responses to the TI vaccine may have masked additional infections that would otherwise have been detected by
antibody rise.

virus for children in each vaccine group are shown in table

dren. The attack rate for febrile respiratory illnesses with or
without complications was 17% for placebo recipients compared with 9 % for TI and 7 % for CR vaccinees.
No difference was observed in the infection rates of contacts of children who received vaccine or placebo (table 8).
Contacts of placebo recipients had an infection rate of 25 %
compared with rates of 22 % and 18% for contacts of CR and
TI vaccinees, respectively.

dren 3-9 years old who had received two annual doses of CR
vaccine had 74% protection against the heterotypic challenge;
the rate of protection was 81%against illness caused by A/Taiwan/86 (HINl) virus. Young children are readily infected by
the CR vaccines and have only minor or no reactions to the
vaccine. The immunity generated by two annual doses
provided good protection against a heterotypic challenge. Annual nose-drop immunization for preschool children aged 1-4
years should be tested for the development of lasting immunity to influenza that might require boosting only at 3- to 4-
year intervals thereafter.
Older children (~10 years) were not regularly infected with
CR vaccine strains, probably because of partial immunity acquired by prior natural infection with previous HINt variants.
Inactivated vaccine appears to provide a better booster for
immunity in this age group and should probably remain the
vaccine of choice for older high-risk patients.
Finally, there was no statistically significant difference in
infection rates for family contacts of children who received
TI or CR vaccines or placebo. This lack of difference may
be explained by community exposure to influenza of nonvaccinated family members. To address the question of controlling epidemics and reducing spread to high-risk contacts by
vaccinating children would require a community-widepediatric immunization program.

The influenza A/Taiwan/86 (HINI) epidemic allowed us to
study the heterotypic protection provided by the CR and TI
vaccines containing A/Chile/83-like HINI viruses. This report is the first simultaneous comparison of the efficacy of
bivalent CR vaccine and TI vaccine in children exposed to
natural heterotypic challenge.
The frequency of antibody responses elicited by A/Chile/83-
like components of the bivalent CR vaccine was similar to
that ofTI (55% and 59%, respectively) in children 3-18 years
of age. However, postvaccination serum neutralizing antibody
titers to A/Taiwan/86 were higher in children who received
TI vaccine; 81% of TI recipients had titers >1:20 compared
with 67 % of children who received CR vaccine.
TI vaccine gave better protection against detectable infection in older children (10-18 years) than did CR vaccine. We
are concerned, however, about the ability to detect infection
in individuals who have received TI vaccine and have high
postvaccination titers. This situation may be analogous to the
British boarding school experience described by Davies and
Grilli [31]. They followed 556 children in eight schools, three
of which provided inactivated influenza vaccine. They reported
a general correlation between the presence of antibody to the
epidemic strain and protection; however, at a given level of
serum antibody, the protection was significantly better for antibody generated by natural infection than that generated by
the inactivated vaccines. We propose that antibody produced
by CR vaccine would approximate that caused by natural infection.
CR vaccine gave better protection in younger children. ChilReferences
