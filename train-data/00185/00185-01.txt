Live cold-adapted recombinant bivalent vaccine of influenza type A was studied in a controlled field
trial in 1982-1983 among nearly 30 000 children 3-15 years old. The bivalent vaccine consisted of
recombinants 4712511 (H1N1) and 471712 (H3N2) of wild-type viruses AIBrazillli178 (H1N1) and
AIBangkoldl179 (H3N2) with cold-adapted donor AILeningradl134147157 (H2N2). The recombinants which received mutant nonglycoprotein genes from cold-adapted donor did not suppress each
other after simultaneous inoculation of children and stimulated antibody response to both strains.
The bivalent vaccine was completely attenuated for children. It caused <1% transient febrile
reactions during five days after the first vaccination, including double seronegative individuals with
low antibody titres to both vaccinal strains. The cold-adapted bivalent vaccine tested proved to be
safe for children according to the analysis of morbidity studies among vaccinees and a control
group performed during the five days and the following six months after the first immunization.
There is a similar distribution of non-influenza illnesses and a statistically significant decrease in
influenza-like diseases among vaccinees compared to the control group. In the four months after
the immunization programme was completed, epidemics of influenza A H1N1 and H3N2 occurred.
The incidence of influenza-like diseases was approximately 50% less in the vaccinated than in the
control groups. This is the first evidence of safety and protective efficacy of recomb'tnant live
influenza vaccine for children 3-15 years of age.

Introduction
A recent method for the preparation of vaccine strains
of influenza virus is based on the recombination of
contemporary wild-type viruses with an attenuated
donor strain and further selection of the reassortant
which inherited the genes coding nonglycosylated proteins from the donor and the genes of hemagglutinin
and neuraminidase from the virulent strain 2'3. Optimal
donors of attenuation are the cold-adapted viruses,
which have multiple ts-mutations, associated with attenuation and genetic stability of donor and recombinants ~7. Donor A/Leningrad/134/17/57 (H2N2) is used
in the USSR for the preparation of vaccine strains for
live influenza vaccine for adults s. In the present study
the additionally passaged cold-adapted donor A/Leningrad/134/47/57 (H2N2) with ts-mutations in genes 1,
2, 5, 7, 8 was prepared for development of more
attenuated recombinants for immunization of children 9"1°. Recombinants 47/25/1 (H1N1) and 47/7/2

This paper presents data on evaluation of reactogenicity, antigenic activity and epidemiological effectiveness of bivalent vaccine containing the recombinants 47/
25/1 (H1N1) and 47/7/2 (H3N2) in an epidemiological
field trial carried out in 1982-1983.
Materials and methods
Vaccine
Experimental vaccines were prepared and controlled
with cold-adapted recombinants 47/25/1 (H1N1) and
47/7/2 (H3N2) and in accordance with requirements
currently existing in the USSR vaccines contained 10 7.o
median egg infectious doses (EIDs0) of recombinant
virus per ml. Freeze-dried monovaccines were diluted
1:1 before administration. Bivalent vaccine (divaccine)
was prepared by mixing two diluted monovaccines in
equal volume. The placebo consisted of allantoic fluid
of uninfected chicken embryos. All the vaccine and
placebo batches were coded.

Vaccination method
Divaccine or placebo were administered in 0.25 ml
volumes into each nostril with a sprayer. Revaccination
was carried out 28-30 days later by the same technique.
Organization of data
A plan of the epidemiological trial included immunization of school children (7-15 years of age) and children of preschool age (3-6 years of age). The study was
double-blind. The units sampled were schools and kindergartens. The samples were performed using random
sampling numbers and stratified sampling in schools
with different numbers of children. For each child a
special form (Diary of Observation) was completed in
which data about immunization and diseases (infectious
and somatic) during the period of observation were
registered. For the immunization special teams (pediatrist and two nurses) were organized. In nursery schools
the immunization was conducted by medical staff of the
institutions.
Evaluation of reactogenicity of divaccine
Reactogenicity of divaccine was evaluated on limited
groups of children in schools and kindergartens.
Healthy individuals were divided into two groups. Children of the first group received divaccine, whereas
those in the other received a placebo. For 21 days
following immunization they were kept under medical
supervision, their temperatures were taken for five days
after the first and second immunization. Fever reactions were graded as mild (temperature ~<37.5°C),
moderate (temperature 37.6-38.5°C) and severe (temperature ~>38.6°C).
Evaluation of antigenic activity of divaccine
Paired sera were taken from children from
the aforementioned limited groups before vaccination and 21 days after the second vaccination to
determine antibody (anti-HA) titres in the haemagglutination inhibition test (HI). The sera were inactivated
at 58°C for 30 rain. Human erythrocytes of group O
(1% suspension in saline buffer) were added to the
mixture of serum dilutions with 4 haemagglutination
units (HU) after contact with the mixture for 1 h at
room temperature. Strain A/Brazil/11/78 (H1N1) and
variant of A/Bangkok/i/79 (H3N2) resistant to nonspecific inhibitors of blood serum were used as the test
viruses.
Statistical methods
The calculation of confidence limits and significance
levels were made with using hypergeometric probability
distribution. Confidence limits of the coefficient of
effectiveness and index of effectiveness were calculated
by a computer according to Ref. 13.
Results
Reactogenicity of bivalent vaccine for children
Initially reactogenicity of divaccine containing coldadapted recombinants H1N1 and H3N2 was studied in
limited groups of school children (110 pupils) and 184
children 3-6 years of age in kindergartens, who were
vaccinated in October 1982. It should be noted that no
influenza was registered during that period in the city
where the vaccinations were carried out. Only 1 out of
100 (1.0%) school children (including 53 persons with
anti-HA titres of ~<16) developed fever (37.6°C),
which was transient (Table 1). Administration of bivalent
vaccine to preschool children (including 100 with antiHA titres of ~<16) caused no postvaccination fever.
The frequency of mild febrile reactions (~<37.5°C)
was 1.1% among preschool children and 0% for school
children. None of vaccinees developed severe postvaccination fever reactions (~>38.5°C), or any changes in
their general condition or symptoms characteristic of
acute respiratory diseases. The revaccination caused no
temperature and other reactions.
The data on low reactogenicity of divaccine from
recombinants 47/25/1 (H1N1) + 47/7/2 (H3N2), confirmed our earlier results of limited trials 1°'11. Thus
vaccination of large groups of children was undertaken.
The trials were extended to 45 schools (the children in
26 schools received the bivalent vaccine, those in 19
received the placebo) and to 142 preschools communities (the children in 76 communities received bivalent
vaccine, those in the others the placebo). The data on
morbidity from influenza, acute respiratory diseases
and tonsillitis for five days after first immunization of
15 727 vaccinated children and 14 228 children receiving placebo (according to registration of visits to the
doctor's office) were analysed (Table 2). Respiratory
morbidity among vaccinees were as low (0.29%) as in
the control group (0.30%). There were no statistically
significant differences between influenza and acute respiratory disease morbidity observed in the groups of
children 3-6 and 7-15 years of age who received divacTable 1 Frequency of the febrile reactions in children for five days after administration of divaccine or placebo

Coded preparations of bivalent vaccine or placebo were administered to healthy children twice at an interval of three weeks. The immunization was carried
out in organized communities (school and pre-school) which were distributed into two groups, one for divaccine and the other for placebo. Each community
received the code number for the preparation administered. The data on morbidity from influenza-like illnesses and tonsillitis during five days after first
immunization were collected. Code numbers were deciphered after statistical analysis of the results
cine or placebo. This observation confirmed the low
reactogenicity of bivalent HIN1 and H3N2 vaccine for
children of 3-15 years.
Convincing evidence of safety of cold-adapted divaccine for the more susceptible age group of 3-6 years
was obtained in the morbidity study of different diseases during six months after the first immunization
with the exception of the 6-week period of an influenza
epidemic (Table 3).
The morbidity with different diseases such as
influenza-like illnesses, acute respiratory diseases, illnesses of the upper respiratory tract, pneumonia and
some others was 1.8-times less among vaccinees compared to children who received the placebo. The incidence of some other non-respiratory illnesses (allergy,
rheumatism, hepatitis, acute intestinal and contagious
infections of children) showed a very similar distribution among vaccinees and in the control group. These
data confirmed the safety of bivalent vaccine, which did
not increase the susceptibility to various infections and
somatic diseases.
Immunological and prophylactic effectiveness
Earlier we have shown in small-scale trials that the
bivalent vaccine from recombinants 47/25/1 (H 1N 1 ) and
47/7/2 (H3N2) is just as potent as each of the recombinants applied separately with respect to the number of
vaccinees with a fourfold and higher antibody rise and
geometric mean antibody titres after vaccination 1~12.
High antigenic activity of divaccine was confirmed in
the epidemiological field trial. Among vaccinees with
low initial antibody levels (~<1:8) 90.5 and 79.7% developed a seroconversion to recombinants 47/25/1 (H 1N 1 )
and 47/7/2 (H3N2) respectively. Among children with
prevaccination antibody titres of anti-HA antibody of
1:16, a fourfold and greater rise of antibody was
observed in 92.7-21.9% of vaccinees (Table 4).
The prophylactic effectiveness of divaccine was estimated during an influenza epidemic caused by viruses
A HIN1 and H3N2 similar to A/Brazil/11/78 and A/
Bangkok/l/79. The epidemic started in the middle of
March 1983 and lasted for six weeks.
The effectiveness of vaccination was calculated by

A control trial was carried out in a population of children belonging to 45 schools and 142 kindergartens. The children of 26 schools and 76 kindergartens
received the coded preparation of divaccine from cold-adapted recombinants 47/25/1 (H1N1) and 47/7/2 (H3N2). The children of the rest of the
communities received the coded preparation of placebo. The two-dose immunization of children was carried out in October 1982. The epidemic of
influenza began on 15 March 1983 and finished at the end of April 1983. The influenza epidemic was caused by viruses A/Brazil/11/78 (H1N1) and A/
Bangkok/I/79 (H3N2) similar in antigenic properties to cold-adapted vaccinal strains. The data on morbidity from influenza were collected during the sixweeks period of epidemic according to visit of children to the doctor's office.

comparison of the influenza morbidity rates among
vaccinees and the control group of children based on
clinical diagnosis during the epidemic period (Table 5).
The mean morbidity was 26.0% in the control group of
children 3 to 6 years of age and 12.6% in the vaccinees.
The corresponding data for schoolchildren were 8.0
and 3.9%, respectively. The general index of epidemiological effectiveness for preschool and school children
was 2.09 (coefficient of protection, 52.1%). The data
on effectiveness was statistically reliable because the
lower limit for the index of effectiveness was >1.8.
The data obtained in the first epidemiological trial on
the groups which included nearly 30 000 children confirmed the previously established safety for children
and high rate of seroconversion for bivalent vaccine
type A from recombinants 47/25/1 (H1N1) and 47/7/2
(H3N2) prepared with the same donor of attenuation
A/Leningrad/134/47/57 (H2N2) and containing the 5-6
genes coding the internal proteins.
The results obtained confirmed the evidence of significant effectiveness of influenza prophylaxis in children
by cold recombinant influenza divaccine.
Discussion
At present, the most appropriate attenuated donor
for preparation of live influenza recombinant vaccine
strains are the cold-adapted variants, whose recombinants are stable, areactogenic and highly immunogenic
for humans 2J'.
This paper presents data on evaluation of reactogenicity, safety, antigenicity and epidemiological effectiveness of bivalent vaccine from cold-adapted recombinants type A 47/25/1 (H1N1) and 47/7/2 (H3N2). The
epidemiological field trial was carried out in a population of nearly 30 000 children of school and preschool
communities in October 1982, which were distributed at
random into two groups, where coded preparation of
divaccine and placebo were administered twice at an
interval of three weeks. The morbidity data of children
for five days and during six months after the first
immunization and during the influenza epidemic in
March-April 1983 were collected. The reactogenicity
and antigenic activity of divaccine was tested on a
limited group before immunization of general groups.
Previously obtained data on low reactogenicity of the
bivalent vaccine from cold-adapted recombinants H1N1
and H3N2 were confirmed in the epidemiological field
trial. Evaluation of reactogenicity of the divaccine on a
limited group of children 3-15 years of age showed that
it caused transient fever reaction in less than 1% of
vaccinees including the seronegative individuals with
anti-HA of antibody titres of ~<16 to H1N1 and H3N2.
No alteration in the general condition of the children or
any symptoms characteristic of acute respiratory disease were observed. The cold-adapted bivalent vaccine
tested proved to be safe for school and preschool
children according to the analysis of morbidity studies
in vaccinees and the control group registered during the
five days after first immunization. The prolonged observation during the next six-month period, established for
children of 3-6 years of age to study the incidence of
various non-influenza diseases, showed a very similar
distribution of some of them and a statistically significant decrease in influenza and acute respiratory diseases among vaccinees compared to the control group.
The efficacy of the vaccine in decreasing acute respiratory disease morbidity in the pre-epidemic period may
be explained by the specific action of live bivalent
vaccine and probably by endogenous interferon stimulation in response to vaccine in five days after the first
and the second vaccine administration.
Divaccine was characterized by high antigenic activity to children of 3-15 years of age. It stimulated the
production of anti-HA antibodies to both recombinants
H1N1 and H3N2.
The prophylactic efficacy of using the bivalent coldadapted vaccine was evaluated during an influenza
epidemic in 1983, caused by viruses A/Brazil/l 1/78
(H1N1) and A/Bangkok/I/79 (H3N2), which were very
similar to vaccinal cold-adapted recombinants 47/25/1
(H1N1) and 47/7/2 (H3N2). Vaccination provided significant protection against natural infection and decreased the morbidity in vaccinated children compared
to the placebo group. The mean of effectiveness was
equal to a factor of 2, the coefficient of effectiveness
was 50%.
The results obtained supply evidence of areactogenicity, safety and high immunological and prophylactic
effectiveness of bivalent cold-adapted live recombinant
influenza vaccine for use in children 3-15 years of age.
