What’s Known on This Subject
Because of recent changes in vaccination recommendations, many more young children are now receiving vaccinations to protect against influenza. However, influenza
vaccine effectiveness has not been well characterized in young children and can vary
from season to season.
What This Study Adds
We estimated the effectiveness of vaccination against laboratory-confirmed influenza
disease in 2 influenza seasons. Our results suggested that, even in an influenza season
with a suboptimal vaccine match, one half of influenza-related visits could be prevented
with recommended vaccination.
ABSTRACT
OBJECTIVE. The goal was to estimate the effectiveness of influenza vaccination against
laboratory-confirmed influenza during the 2003–2004 and 2004 –2005 influenza
seasons in children 6 to 59 months of age.
METHODS. We conducted a case-control study with children with medically attended,
acute respiratory infections who received care in an inpatient, emergency department, or outpatient clinic setting during 2 consecutive influenza seasons. All children
residing in Monroe County, New York, Davidson County, Tennessee, or Hamilton
County, Ohio, were enrolled prospectively at the time of acute illness and had
nasal/throat swabs tested for influenza with cultures and/or polymerase chain reaction assays. Children with laboratory-confirmed influenza were case subjects and
children who tested negative for influenza were control subjects. Child vaccination
records from the parent and the child’s physician were used to determine and to
validate influenza vaccination status. Influenza vaccine effectiveness was calculated
as (1  adjusted odds ratio)  100.
RESULTS. We enrolled 288 case subjects and 744 control subjects during the 2003–2004
season and 197 case subjects and 1305 control subjects during the 2004 –2005
season. Six percent and 19% of all study children were fully vaccinated according to
immunization guidelines in the respective seasons. Full vaccination was associated
with significantly fewer influenza-related inpatient, emergency department, or outpatient clinic visits in 2004 –2005 (vaccine effectiveness: 57%) but not in 2003–2004
(vaccine effectiveness: 44%). Partial vaccination was not effective in either season.
CONCLUSIONS. Receipt of all recommended doses of influenza vaccine was associated with
halving of laboratory-confirmed influenza-related medical visits among children 6 to 59
months of age in 1 of 2 study years, despite suboptimal matches between the vaccine
and circulating influenza strains in both years. Pediatrics 2008;122:911–919

NFLUENZA INFECTIONS CAUSE a substantial, often unrecognized, burden of disease
in young children.1 This annual burden includes an estimated 0.7 to 0.9 hospitalizations, 50 to 95 outpatient visits, 6 to 27 emergency department (ED) visits, and 30 to 90 courses of antibiotics per
1000 children 5 years of age.1–3 Rates of influenza-related hospitalizations, acute otitis media, and pneumonia are
particularly high in children 2 years of age.1,3–6

Recommendations for seasonal influenza vaccination
by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices
(ACIP) were recently expanded for young children. Vaccination of all 6- to 23-month-old children was encouraged for the 2002–2003 and 2003–2004 influenza seasons,7 and vaccination was formally recommended for
this age group beginning with the 2004 –2005 season.8
This influenza vaccine recommendation was expanded to
include all children 6 to 59 months of age beginning with
the 2006 –2007 season.9 However, few studies have estimated vaccine effectiveness (VE) in young children.10–13
Because influenza vaccination rates may vary according to
age and geographic location14 and because the vaccine
match varies according to season, it is important to assess
influenza VE across settings and seasons.
Some previous studies were limited in that they used
non–laboratory-confirmed outcomes such as influenzalike illness or school attendance, which would result in
lower estimates of VE, or were conducted during only 1
influenza season.10–12,15 In this study, we report on VE
over 2 influenza seasons among children 6 to 59 months
of age by using data from an ongoing population-based
surveillance system, the New Vaccine Surveillance Network (NVSN), to identify laboratory-confirmed influenza cases in 3 different geographic regions.1 This geographic diversity allows for a more-robust estimate of VE
than would be possible with data from a single location.
The primary objective of our study was to determine the
effectiveness of trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine
(no live attenuated vaccine was used because of age)
against laboratory-confirmed influenza disease in each
of 2 consecutive influenza seasons.
METHODS
Inpatient Population
A prospective, population-based study of hospitalizations attributable to laboratory-confirmed influenza was
performed in counties that encompass Nashville, Tennessee, Rochester, New York, and Cincinnati, Ohio, during the 2003–2004 and 2004 –2005 influenza seasons.
Each site conducted surveillance at sufficient hospitals to
capture 95% of hospitalizations attributable to acute
respiratory illness (ARI) or fever among children residing in the respective county. More-detailed information
on site selection, visit rates, and other characteristics of
the NVSN were described previously.1
Study nurses enrolled children within 48 hours after
admission to surveillance hospitals Sunday through Thursday in the 2003–2004 influenza season and 7 days per
week during the 2004 –2005 season. Eligible children were
county residents, 5 years of age, with an admission diagnosis of ARI or fever. Study nurses prescreened admitted
children according to presenting complaints. If ARI or fever
was present, then the child’s medical record was reviewed
to determine age and county of residence. An attempt was
made to enroll every child determined to be eligible. All
eligible children were recruited before laboratory determination of their influenza status.
ARI was defined on the basis of a presenting complaint of cough, earache, fever (identified through medical documentation or parental report), nasal congestion/runny nose, shortness of breath/rapid or shallow
breathing, sore throat, vomiting after cough, or wheezing. Children with fever and neutropenia associated
with chemotherapy, children hospitalized in the previous 4 days or transferred from another surveillance hospital, newborns who had never been discharged from
the hospital, and children with symptom duration of
14 days (2003–2004 influenza season only) were excluded. The symptom duration requirement was initially
included because the likelihood of viral detection decreases with time.16 It was later removed because it had
minimal impact on enrollment.
Outpatient Population
Prospective surveillance for laboratory-confirmed influenza among county residents 5 years of age who presented to selected EDs and outpatient primary care practices with symptoms of ARI or fever was conducted
during the 2003–2004 influenza season in Nashville,
Tennessee (3 primary care practices and 1 pediatric ED,
with 30% of county pediatric ED visits), Rochester, New
York (4 practices and 1 pediatric ED, with 60% of visits),
and Cincinnati, Ohio (1 practice and the single pediatric
ED, with 95% of visits). During the 2004 –2005 influenza season, ED surveillance was conducted in both
pediatrics EDs in Rochester (95% of visits) and the
pediatric ED in Cincinnati, and clinic surveillance was
performed in Nashville (3 practices) and Rochester (6
practices). Children were enrolled 1 or 2 days per week
in primary care practices and 3 or 4 days per week in
EDs, with days and shifts being rotated systematically
(across all 7 days in EDs and 5– 6 days in clinics), to
obtain a representative sample. If multiple eligible
children were available concurrently in an outpatient
practice or ED, then study nurses approached eligible
children in the order in which they checked in.
In both influenza seasons, ED and outpatient surveillance began the first week after 2 positive tests for respiratory syncytial virus or influenza virus were identified in local clinical or research laboratories in 2
consecutive weeks. Surveillance ended after 1 or no
positive tests were detected in those laboratories in 2
consecutive weeks. Study nurses systematically enrolled
approximately 6 to 8 children per setting per surveillance day at each study site in clinics and EDs, using the
same inclusion and exclusion criteria and enrollment
procedure as used for inpatient surveillance. The study
was approved by the institutional review boards at the 3
study sites, the participating surveillance hospitals, and
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Study Period
For this study, we defined each influenza season on the
basis of the dates on which surveillance started and
ended. The dates and duration of each season varied
according to site. The 2003–2004 influenza season
started in November at all 3 geographic locations and
lasted 2 months in Nashville, 3 months in Rochester, and
5 months in Cincinnati. In Nashville, the 2004 –2005

influenza season started in November and lasted 5
months; in Rochester and Cincinnati, the 2004 –2005
season started in December and lasted 4 months.
Demographic and Clinical Information
A standardized interview was administered to each patient’s parent or guardian, to obtain demographic information and medical and social history. Demographic information included age, gender, and insurance type (private,
public, or none). Underlying medical conditions for which
influenza vaccination was routinely recommended during
the 2 influenza seasons7 were ascertained through parental
report and chart review. These underlying medical conditions included asthma, cancer, diabetes mellitus, heart disease, immunodeficiency, kidney disease, sickle cell disease,
cystic fibrosis, and chronic lung disease. Neurologic conditions were not included in the list of conditions for which
influenza vaccination was recommended until the 2005–
2006 influenza season.17
Virological Testing
Nasal and throat swabs were obtained from each enrolled child and specimens were tested for influenza at
each site’s local research laboratory, using viral culture
and reverse transcription (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays, as described previously, with the exception that each site tested its subject samples locally
under a common protocol, rather than batch-shipping
samples to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.6,18,19 Interlaboratory quality assurance testing was
performed through annual analysis of prepared panels of
serial dilutions of live influenza A and B viruses, as well
as serial dilutions of prepared influenza A and B RNA
extracts. The identity of all quality assurance panel specimens was masked, such that the analyses were performed blindly. All 3 sites accurately identified live influenza A and B viruses in culture and in RT-PCR assays
after RNA extraction, and they also identified prepared
viral RNA extracts (G.A.W., unpublished data, February
1, 2008). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention served as an external validation source for influenza
identification.
Case and Control Subject Identification
Inpatient case subjects were identified on the basis of 1
positive viral culture or 2 positive RT-PCR assays and
outpatient case subjects on the basis of 2 positive RTPCR assays, because PCR was more sensitive than culture19 and resources were limited for viral cultures with
outpatient samples. Children whose specimens tested
positive for influenza constituted the case subjects as of
the date of their first symptoms, as determined through
parental report. Children whose specimens tested negative for influenza viruses served as control subjects.
Influenza Vaccination Status
A child’s influenza vaccination status at the time of the
ARI visit was determined through an initial telephone
call or fax to the child’s primary care practice and subsequent extraction from the child’s primary care medical
record. Influenza vaccinations recorded on vaccination
cards were counted if the cards were provided by the
parent or guardian at the time of the ARI visit. Children
were classified as being fully vaccinated if they were
vaccinated according to the ACIP guidelines for each
season and received (1) 2 vaccine doses in the current
influenza season that were administered 24 days apart,
with the second dose given 14 days before ARI onset,
or (2) 1 vaccine dose in a previous influenza season
and 1 dose in the current season, administered 14 days
before ARI onset. Children were classified as being partially vaccinated if they received (1) only 1 of 2 recommended vaccine doses during the current season, 14
days before ARI onset, or (2) 2 vaccine doses during the
current season, with the second dose administered
within 14 days before ARI onset or 24 days after the
first dose. The 24-day window was based on the recommended 4-week interval between the first and second
influenza vaccine doses.20 Doses given 5 days earlier
than 4 weeks apart are to be repeated, which gives an
effective interval between doses of 24 days. Children
were classified as being unvaccinated for a given season
if they were not vaccinated in the study season or if they
received the first of 2 recommended influenza vaccine
doses within 14 days before ARI onset during the study
season. It should be noted that, beginning in the 2007–
2008 season, children who received only 1 of 2 recommended vaccine doses during a previous season and 1
dose during the current season would not be considered
fully vaccinated under ACIP guidelines.21
Statistical Analyses
All analyses were conducted separately for the 2 influenza seasons. Conditional logistic regression was used to
model the association between influenza vaccination
and laboratory-confirmed influenza-related medical visits, after adjustment for possible confounders. Control
subjects were matched to case subjects with respect to
geographic location (Nashville, Rochester, or Cincinnati), visit setting (ED/inpatient or clinic), and 2-week
period (based on the date of enrollment for control
subjects and the date of influenza symptom onset for
case subjects). Enrolled children who had multiple visits
captured by NVSN surveillance in a given season were
included in the analysis at the visit at which they received a laboratory-confirmed influenza diagnosis or at
their last visit of the season, if they had negative test
results for influenza at all visits. We assumed that enrolled children had not had a medical visit attributable to
influenza before enrollment in a given season.
VE values and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were
estimated on the basis of adjusted odds ratios (aORs) by
using the formula VE  (1  aOR)  100. Fully vaccinated children and partially vaccinated children were
compared with unvaccinated children. Vaccination status was included as complete, partial, or no vaccination.
Other covariates included in the models were age (in
months), insurance status (public/none versus private),
and underlying medical condition (1 versus none). The
simple, conditional, logistic model had 80% power to
detect a minimal VE for complete vaccination (compared
PEDIATRICS Volume 122, Number 5, November 2008 913
Downloaded from pediatrics.aappublications.org at Purdue University Libraries on April 13, 2015
with no vaccination) of 45% in the first season and 35%
in the second seasons, based on the numbers of case
subjects and control subjects, the rate of complete vaccination among control subjects, and the degree of concordance in vaccination status within matched groups.22
Stratified VE estimates were calculated according to
age at visit (6 –23 months or 24 –59 months), high-risk
status (presence of an underlying medical condition for
which vaccination was recommended), and visit setting
(inpatient/ED or outpatient). VE estimates were also
calculated with the analysis being limited to subjects
who were not vaccinated and those who received 2
influenza doses in the current season with the appropriate intervals between doses and before ARI onset. We
compared nonenrolled eligible children with enrolled
children with respect to age (6 –23 months or 24 –59
months), gender, and ARI visit setting by using Fisher’s
exact tests. Analyses were performed by using Intercooled Stata 8.2 (Stata, College Station, TX) and SAS
9.1.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
RESULTS
Study Population
2003–2004 Influenza Season
In the 2003–2004 influenza season, the NVSN enrolled
1033 (83.5%) of 1237 eligible children 6 to 59 months of
age through hospital admissions, EDs, and outpatient
clinics. Sixty-one children (6%; 5 case subjects and 56
control subjects) were excluded because of missing data
on influenza vaccination status, leaving a study population of 972 children. Thirteen of the 972 children included in the analysis had multiple visits, for a total of
986 captured visits. Enrolled children did not differ from
nonenrolled children with respect to gender (P  .163)
or age (P  .644), but a larger proportion of nonenrolled
(52.5%) than enrolled (35.9%) children were screened
during an outpatient visit (P  .001).
2004–2005 Influenza Season
In the 2004 –2005 influenza season, 1581 (90.0%) of 1757
eligible children were enrolled in the NVSN from all 3
patient care settings. Seventy-nine children (5%; 7 case
subjects and 72 control subjects) were excluded because of
missing data on influenza vaccination status, leaving a
study population of 1502 children. Thirty-three children
had multiple visits, for a total of 1535 captured visits.
Enrolled children did not differ from nonenrolled children with respect to gender (P  .523), but they did differ
with respect to age and visit setting. Nonenrolled children
were older (55.7% in the older age group) than were
enrolled children (42.4%; P  .001), and a larger proportion of nonenrolled (86.4%) than enrolled (48.5%) children were screened during an outpatient visit (P  .001).
Characteristics of Case and Control Patients
Table 1 describes the demographic characteristics and
vaccination status for case subjects and control subjects
in each season. In both age groups, the proportion of
fully vaccinated children was higher in 2004 –2005 than
in 2003–2004 (P  .001). In the 2003–2004 season,
control subjects tended to be younger than case subjects,

with 46.5% of case subjects in the 6- to 23-month age
group, compared with 58.1% of control subjects (P 
.002). The median ages for case subjects were 25 months
and 21 months in the 2003–2004 and 2004 –2005 seasons, respectively, whereas the median ages for control
subjects were 20 months in both seasons.
In the 2004 –2005 season only, a larger proportion of
case subjects than control subjects were male. The distribution of case subjects and control subjects across the
3 surveillance counties varied substantially, reflecting
the geographic variability of influenza outbreaks. Children with influenza-associated illness accounted for a
low of 8% of all ARI visits (38 of 475 visits) during the
2004 –2005 season in Cincinnati, compared with a high
of 45% of all study participants (92 of 204 visits) during
the 2003–2004 season in Nashville. Children in both
seasons were more likely than their counterparts to have
been fully vaccinated if they were in the younger age
group, had private insurance, or had an underlying medical condition (Table 2).
Vaccine Effectiveness
2003–2004 Influenza Season
Among children 6 to 59 months of age, neither full nor
partial vaccination was associated with a significant reduction in influenza-related visits, compared with those
who were unvaccinated at the time of the visit (Table 3).
One eligible control subject was not included in the
regression models because of lack of an appropriate
matched case subject. VE estimates varied between age
subgroups, but neither age group experienced a significant reduction in influenza visits, compared with unvaccinated children. When children missing vaccination information were included in the analysis as unvaccinated,
the VE estimate for 6- to 59-month-old children
changed from 28% to 27% (95% CI: 82% to 71%).
When the analysis was limited to children who received
2 doses in the current season, compared with children who
were unvaccinated, the VE estimate changed to 59% (95%
CI: 165% to 90%) among 6- to 59-month-old children
and 21% (95% CI: 225% to 81%) among 6- to 23-
month-old children. There were insufficient numbers of
children 24 to 59 months of age who were fully vaccinated
according to this definition for this analysis.
Figures 1 and 2 show VE estimates for fully vaccinated children, compared with unvaccinated children,
stratified according to high-risk status and visit setting
(inpatient/ED or outpatient), respectively. Only the
high-risk stratum demonstrated a significant reduction
in influenza-related medical visits, compared with unvaccinated children, for full vaccination (VE: 89%; 95%
CI: 2%–99%). None of the strata had significant VE for
partial vaccination (data not shown). Figures 1 and 2
also demonstrate the wide CIs for the VE estimates.
2004–2005 Influenza Season
VE estimates for fully vaccinated versus unvaccinated
children 6 to 59 months of age and for each age subgroup were 60%, with statistically significant results
for both age groups and all ages combined. Partial vacTABLE 2 Influenza Vaccination Status of Influenza-Positive Case Subjects and Influenza-Negative Control Subjects According to Child

cination was not associated with significant reduction in
influenza rates for all ages or for either age group (Table
3). One eligible case subject and 8 control subjects were
not included in the regression models because of lack of
an appropriate matched group. When children with
missing vaccination information were included in the
analysis as unvaccinated, the VE estimate for 6- to 59-
month-old children changed from 57% to 53% (95%
CI: 23%– 82%). When the analysis was limited to children who received 2 doses in the current season, compared with children who were unvaccinated, the VE
estimates were virtually unchanged for the 6- to 59-
month and 6- to 23-month age groups (data not shown).
There were insufficient numbers of children 24 to 59
months of age who were fully vaccinated according to
this definition for this analysis.
Among fully vaccinated children with and without
underlying medical conditions, full immunization, compared with no immunization, was associated with an
65% reduction in influenza visits; results were statistically significant for children who were (VE: 67%; 95%
CI: 13%– 88%) and were not (VE: 65%; 95% CI: 16%–
76%) at high risk (Fig 1). VE estimates for fully vaccinated children stratified according to visit setting were
close to 60% (and statistically significant) for both inpatient/ED and outpatient settings (Fig 2). Partial vaccinaFIGURE 1

DISCUSSION
Overall Findings
We used prospective, laboratory-confirmed, surveillance
data from 3 geographically distinct, urban counties in
the United States to estimate the effectiveness of the
trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine for children during the 2003–2004 and 2004 –2005 influenza seasons.
We found that fully vaccinated children 6 to 59 months
of age had 44% and 57% fewer influenza-related medical visits, compared with unvaccinated children in the
respective seasons, although only the estimate from the
2004 –2005 influenza season was statistically significant.
During the 2004 –2005 season, the VE for fully vaccinated children was 55% among 6- to 23-month-old
children, the age group recommended for routine vaccination that season. Partially vaccinated children did
not experience a decrease in influenza rate, compared
with unvaccinated children. Our data provide support
for the current influenza vaccine recommendations for
all children 6 to 59 months of age and underscore the
importance of the 2 doses of influenza vaccine in the first
year in which a young child is vaccinated.
There were too few fully vaccinated children in the
2003–2004 season (only 62 children) to allow conclusions about VE, but VE estimates for full vaccination in
the 2004 –2005 season were consistent across strata. This
similarity in the VE estimates across strata is of note
because of the implication that, in the 2004 –2005 influenza season, full influenza vaccination seemed equally
effective in preventing influenza morbidity across this
age group, with a large range in terms of risk of severe
influenza and host vulnerability.1
Our study contributes to the existing VE literature by
estimating VE across influenza seasons and patient care
settings, using case subjects with laboratory-confirmed
influenza. An additional advantage of our study design is
the ability to determine VE rapidly and efficiently by
using influenza-negative children, identified during ongoing surveillance by the NVSN for influenza disease
burden, as control subjects.
VE According to Age Group
Although our VE estimates for the 2003–2004 influenza
season seemed to differ substantially according to age,
these results were not statistically significant and we
cannot conclude that there was a true difference between age groups. The 44% VE estimate for children 6 to
59 months of age reflects a combination of the relatively
high VE estimate (66%) for the older age group and the
lack of effectiveness in the younger group. Our VE estimates for the 2004 –2005 influenza season do not suggest any difference in VE according to age group.
Match Between Circulating and Vaccine Influenza Strains
The match between circulating influenza strains and
strains included in the vaccine was considered suboptimal for both of these influenza seasons. In the 2003–
2004 season, only 11% of influenza A virus specimens,
which accounted for 99% of circulating strains, were
similar to a strain included in the vaccine, based on US
virological surveillance, and the season began earlier and
was associated with more pediatric deaths than usual.23
The 2004 –2005 influenza season was less severe and the
vaccine was a better match to circulating strains than in
2003–2004, but still only 36% of virus isolates were
antigenically well matched to vaccine strains.24 This difference in the match between circulating and vaccine
strains between seasons may account for the higher VE
estimates in 2004 –2005, although differences in age distributions and proportions vaccinated also might have
played a role. Characterization of a limited number of
isolates from the 3 study counties agreed with the US
data. The seasonal and geographic variations in the proportions of children with influenza in our data reflect the
variable nature of influenza epidemics. These variations
demonstrate the importance of considering multiple
sites and seasons in influenza VE analyses.
Other VE Estimates in Young Children
Our finding of no influenza VE in young children differs
from 3 previous studies of trivalent inactivated influenza
vaccine during the 2003–2004 influenza season, although all of the studies, including ours, found no VE for
partially vaccinated children. For fully vaccinated children 6 to 23 months of age, Ritzwoller et al11 found 49%
VE in preventing outpatient office and ED visits (92% of
visits were office visits) for pneumonia and influenza,
and Shuler et al10 found 52% VE in preventing office
visits for laboratory-confirmed influenza. Allison et al12
found higher VE among fully vaccinated, 6- to 21-
month-old children, that is, 69% in preventing influenza-like illness office visits and 87% in preventing pneumonia/influenza office visits; these higher VE estimates
may be related to the exclusion of children with chronic
medical conditions. However, another study found VE
for live attenuated vaccine, but not for trivalent inactivated vaccine, among older children during the 2003–
2004 season.25
There are a number of possible explanations for the
differences between the studies that found VE and our
results, including power limitations, geographic differences, the choice of comparison populations, and the
proportions of fully vaccinated children in the study
populations who received 2 vaccine doses in the current
season. The small numbers of case subjects overall and
low vaccination rates in the 2003–2004 season (before
the recommendation for routine vaccination of 6-23-
month-old children) limited our power to detect VE
during that season. In particular, our study did not have
sufficient power to estimate influenza VE among 6- to
23-month-old children with office visits, the group most
comparable to the other study populations. Despite limited power, when we restricted our analysis to children
who received 2 vaccine doses in the current season and
children who were unvaccinated, our VE estimates for
children 6 to 59 months of age increased from 44% to
59%. This finding is consistent with data that suggest
PEDIATRICS Volume 122, Number 5, November 2008 917
Downloaded from pediatrics.aappublications.org at Purdue University Libraries on April 13, 2015
that young children who receive 1 dose in the previous
season and 1 in the current season may not be as well
protected as those who receive 2 doses in the current
season.26
We studied different geographic regions, compared
with the other studies of young children, 2 of which
were conducted in Colorado11,12 and 1 in Georgia,10 and
influenza attack rates might have differed according to
location. If a larger proportion of cases in the regions we
studied were caused by the influenza A drift variant,
then we would expect to see lower VE than in the other
studies.
Our comparison population, that is, influenza-negative children with ARIs, also might account for our finding of lack of VE, if there were differences in the likelihood of being included in NVSN surveillance activities
according to vaccination status. For example, it is possible that parents who know their children have been
vaccinated against influenza are less likely to seek care.
However, it is even more likely that the propensity to
seek vaccination is related to the propensity to seek
medical care in general, and children who are vaccinated
may be more likely to be seen in outpatient, ED, or even
inpatient settings because of unmeasured propensity to
seek medical care. We were not able to assess factors that
would make children more likely to be exposed to influenza virus, such as day care attendance or number of
siblings, or the family threshold to seek medical care. By
using influenza-negative children who were receiving
medical care and were enrolled in the same study as a
comparison group, however, we controlled in large part
for the propensity to seek care that can cause confounding in observational VE studies. All of the studies that
estimated VE in young children during the 2003–2004
influenza season accounted for the propensity to seek
medical care to some degree, but inclusion of only children with ARIs may be a more stringent control than
those used in the other studies.
A disadvantage of using influenza-negative children
with ARIs as control subjects is that the comparison
population can change from season to season, depending on the viruses that are cocirculating during the influenza season. However, we do not think that fluctuations in the comparison population would compromise
the accuracy of VE estimates calculated by using influenza-negative children with ARIs as a comparison
group, because influenza vaccine uptake levels should
be similar for children with different types of non–influenza-associated ARIs.
We found 55% VE among children 6 to 23 months of
age, 63% VE among children 24 to 59 months of age,
and 57% VE among children 6 to 59 months of age
during the 2004 –2005 influenza season. We know of no
other published reports of VE in these age groups for the
2004 –2005 season, but the VE of trivalent inactivated
influenza vaccine in healthy adults was estimated at
66%, despite the dissimilarity between circulating and
vaccine influenza strains.27 Lewis et al28 conservatively
estimated that, if one half of US children 6 to 59 months
of age were fully vaccinated in a year with 50% VE, then
the direct benefit would be the prevention of 2250
hospitalizations and 270 000 to 650 000 outpatient visits
for influenza-attributable illnesses.
Limitations
Because of the relatively small number of cases in both
seasons, we combined inpatient and ED visits to reflect
more-severe influenza disease; however, it is possible
that VE differs for these settings, and larger studies with
many more cases of influenza would be needed to evaluate this issue. Missing vaccination data were unlikely to
have affected the results. The participation rate was
lower for outpatients than for inpatients in both years
but, given the similarity of VE estimates across patient
care settings, this disparity was unlikely to have affected
our results. Similarly, although children in the older age
group were less likely to be enrolled in the 2004 –2005
season, VE estimates were similar across age groups for
that season.
Children were not selected at random to receive
vaccination; therefore, there were differences in the
populations of children who did and did not receive
vaccination. Most significantly, children with underlying medical conditions were more likely to be vaccinated. This was not likely to be a significant source of
confounding in VE estimates in our study, because adjustment for the presence of an underlying medical condition in multivariate modeling or inclusion of any other
covariate did not change the estimates substantially.
There were differences in the age distributions between
case subjects and control subjects, which we addressed
by adjusting for age (in months) and conducting analyses stratified according to age. However, the possibility of
residual confounding remains.
CONCLUSIONS
US children 6 to 59 months of age experience a substantial number of hospitalizations, ED visits, and outpatient
visits for influenza each year. Our results suggest that,
even in an influenza season (2004 –2005) with a suboptimal vaccine match, more than one half of these visits
could be prevented with recommended influenza vaccination. Partial vaccination did not seem to be effective.
These results offer additional evidence in support of
recommendations for vaccinating children against influenza, and they highlight the importance of children
receiving the recommended number of influenza vaccinations.
