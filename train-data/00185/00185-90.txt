Abstract
Schoolchildren of 30 to 34 schools of Novgorod were vaccinated over a three-year period with Russian live cold-adapted attenuated vaccine for children and whole-virus inactivated vaccines and placebo for comparative field study of the vaccines properties and efficacy. In control trials both bi- and trivalent live attenuated vaccines were well tolerated and areactogenic. A whole-virus inactivated trivalent vaccine induced mild and moderate fever and local reactions in 2-4% of the vaccinees. Special observations are necessary to establish the possibility of use and to determine a dose of this inactivated vaccine for immunization of children, especially those of 7-10 years of age. All the vaccines induced HI antibody production in 50-80% and antineuraminidase in 50-70% of seronegative children. The pattern of the results was similar to that in revaccinated children with preexisting antibody at a level of 1:20, but much lower in children with the initial titre above 1:20. After the 3rd year of vaccination the immune response of the vaccinees was similar, most of the results depending on the initial antibody titre and also on the change of vaccine strains. This raises a question of the expediency of annual influenza revaccination of the same person after 2 years of successful immunization and of the necessity of vaccine strains replacement after 2-3 years of use.
