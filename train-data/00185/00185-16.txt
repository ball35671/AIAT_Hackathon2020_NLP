In a blinded, placebo-controlled study, the reactogenicity, immunogenicity, and clinical efficacy
of single doses of US inactivated split-virus and Russian live attenuated, cold-adapted influenza
vaccines were compared in 555 schoolchildren in Vologda, Russia. Serial serum samples were
collected and school absenteeism was assessed. Systemic reactions were rare, but local reactions
(primarily erythema at the injection site) were observed in 27% of the inactivated vaccine group,
and coryza (12%) and sore throat (8%) were observed in the attenuated vaccine group. At 4 weeks
after vaccination, a ~4-fold rise in titer of hemagglutination inhibition antibody to A (HIN1), A
(H3N2), and B was noted, respectively, among 78%, 88%, and 53% of children who received
inactivated vaccine and among 55%, 79%, and 30% of children who received attenuated vaccine.
The vaccine efficacy for preventing school absenteeism due to acute respiratory illness during the
period of peak influenza activity was 56% for inactivated vaccine and 47% for attenuated vaccine.
Since 1977, a live attenuated, cold-adapted influenza vaccine made from recombinants of a master donor strain, AI
Lehingrad/134/17/57 (H2N2), has been widely used in mass
vaccination campaigns for Russian adults [I, 2]. The donor

strain had been attenuated by 17 laboratory passages in hens'
eggs at 25°C. In 1988, recombinants of this donor strain
that had been further attenuated by 30 additional laboratory
passages were licensed for mass vaccination ofRussian children 3-14 years of age. Recently, the l7-passage donor
recombinants were also approved for vaccination of Russian
children. These recombinants, like those of the 47-passage
donor, have few adverse reactions but are more immunogenic, generally requiring a single dose instead of the two
doses required with the 47-passage viruses. In the United
States, studies have shown that recombinants of master donor A/Ann Arbor/6/60 (H2N2) are safe and effective for
vaccination of children [3-5]. We report a study of Russian
children that compares single doses oftrivalent, intramuscular, US inactivated split-virus influenza vaccine with anti-

genically comparable, trivalent, intranasal Russian coldadapted vaccine made from the 17-passage donor.
Materials and Methods
Vaccine preparations. The following preparations were used:
commercial trivalent, inactivated split-virus influenza vaccine
(Wyeth-Ayerst, Philadelphia), 1990-1991 formulation, containing
15 J.Lg each of hemagglutinin ofA/Taiwan/1/86 (HINl), A/Shanghai/16/89 (H3N2), and BlYamagata/16/88 antigens (normal saline
was used as the intramuscular placebo) and trivalent live attenuated, cold-adapted influenza vaccine (Odessa Production Company
for Biological Products, Odessa, Ukraine), which was made by
using the donor strains A/Leningrad!134/17/57 (H2N2) and B/
Leningrad!14/55. The wild type viruses used were A/Leningrad!
92/89 (HINl), A/Zakarpatje/354/89 (H3N2), and B/Yamagata/16/
88, which were antigenically similar to those in the inactivated
vaccine. Live vaccine contained 7.0-7.5 logloEIDsoof each virus
per 0.5-mL dose. The intranasal placebo consisted of allantoic
fluid of embryonated hens' eggs.
Study population. Between 21 October and 1 November 1991,
the Research Institute of Influenza (RII), St. Petersburg, Russia,
recruited 9- to l2-year-old volunteers (grades 3-7) from two
schools in Vologda, Russia. Parents or guardians chose the route
of administration. After a brief history and physical examination
were done, subjects were randomly assigned to receive the vaccine
or placebo (within the chosen route of administration) by using a
blocked randomization scheme with a vaccine-to-placebo ratio of
2:1. Persons were excluded if they had an acute illness, oral herpetic lesions, or temperature >37.0°C on the day of inoculation or
a history of egg allergy or ofsevere reaction to previous influenza
vaccination.
Interventions. A single 0.5-mL dose of inactivated vaccine or
placebo was injected into the deltoid muscle with disposable, unitdose syringes and needles. A single 0.5-mL dose of live vaccine
or placebo was administered intranasally by sprayer [6]. Children
enrolled during the first week (n = 180) were monitored daily for
4 days after inoculation. During this week, an undetermined number of children inadvertently received their intramuscular vaccine
or placebo subcutaneously. The children enrolled during the second week were monitored on the day after inoculation. Children
with reactions after inoculation were monitored by pediatricians
who were unaware of the child's vaccine group until reactions and
symptoms resolved. Blood specimens were collected by fingerstick
on the day of inoculation and again 28 days and 5 months after
inoculation. Serum samples were separated into two aliquots and
stored at - 20°C until tested under code.
Surveillance. Vologda schoolchildren who are absent from
school for medical reasons are routinely assessed by community
physicians who were not affiliated with this study. III children are
reexamined before they return to school and are issued a letter
stating the medical condition that caused their absence. This diagnosis and the dates the child was absent are recorded onto the
child's school medical card. These data covering the period 10
November 1991 through 17 March 1992 were transcribed from
the medical cards at the time of serum collection 5 months after
vaccination. For the purpose of this study, absenteeism due to
influenza-like illness was defined as the first school absence with
a physician's diagnosis of either acute respiratory disease or influenza. The specific diagnosis of influenza refers to an acute respiratory illness that occurred during the official influenza season and
is a clinical, not a virologic, diagnosis. Moreover, the clinical
criteria for diagnoses were not uniform. The influenza season was
defined by using morbidity and virologic surveillance data independently collected from local health clinics, schools, and work
sites by the Vologda Medical Council.
Serologic testing. Aliquots of serum from each subject were
tested for hemagglutination inhibition (HAl) antibody titers at the
RII. Sera from about half of the children from whom 3 serial
serum samples had been obtained were shipped to the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention and tested independently. Similar
viruses were used in both laboratories for HAl testing [7]: A/St.
Petersburg/325/88 (HIN I) and A/Vilnius/26/90(H3N2), which are
antigenically similar to A/Leningrad!92/89(HINl) and A/Zakarpatje/354/89 (H3N2) but less sensitive to nonspecific serum inhibitors, and BlYamagata/16/88.
Statistical analysis. Ordered data were analyzed using the Wilcoxon rank sum and sign tests. Binomial data were tested with a
X2 or Fisher's exact test. Data on the placebo groups were pooled
for final analysis when no statistically significant differences between the placebo groups were noted. Seroconversion was defined
as a ;,A-fold measured increase in a specific antibody titer 28 days
after vaccination.
Results
Study population. A total of 555 children was enrolled
and inoculated: 168 received inactivated vaccine, 87 received
intramuscular placebo, 200 received live vaccine, and 100 received intranasal placebo; 245 were recruited from school 1
and 310 were recruited from school 2. The vaccine groups did
not differ significantly by age, sex, school, grade attended, or
proportion of children who were initially seronegative (i.e.,
prevaccination HAl titers of :;;; 10) for the 3 vaccine viruses.
Reactogenicity. The frequency of low-grade axillary fever
(37.0-37.4°C) was higher for the inactivated vaccine group
(9%) than for the other groups (:;;;3%), but this association was
statistically significant only during the week of the trial when
some subjects received vaccine or placebo subcutaneously. Fever (37.0-37.4°C) occurred in 5 (2.5%) of200 children inoculated with live vaccine, 1 of 87 inoculated with intramuscular
placebo, and 1 of 100 inoculated with intranasal placebo. One
child inoculated with live vaccine had a documented fever
between 37SC and 37.9°C. No other systemic reactions were
significantly associated with either the inactivated or live vaccines or differed by week of trial. Local reactions were observed in 27% of the inactivated vaccine group and occurred
more often during the first week (50% ofvaccinees) than during
the second week (11% of vaccinees). However, 93% of these
reactions were limited to erythema at the site ofinjection. Local
reaction to live vaccine consisted of coryza (12%) and sore
throat (8%).

differed between laboratories because of technical differences,
the major trends were similar (data not shown). A slightly
higher median titer to A (H3N2) was observed in the placebo
group after vaccination, but this difference was not statistically
significant (P = .9, Wilcoxon signed rank test). All 3 serum
specimens were obtained from 466 children (84%), and 2 specimens were obtained from 64 children (12%). Among vaccinees
who initially demonstrated a ?4-fold serologic response to A
(HINI), 93% of recipients of inactivated vaccine maintained
a titer of ?40 (a conservative estimate of a protective HAl
titer) compared with 82% of recipients of live vaccine. Among
vaccinees who initially demonstrated a ?4-fold serologic response to B, 81% of recipients of inactivated vaccine maintained a titer ?40 compared with 65% of those who received
live vaccine. Similar analysis for the serologic response to A
(H3N2) was complicated by the effects of a concurrent A
{H3N2) epidemic.
Vaccine efficacy. Medical cards were reviewed for 550
(99%) of the 555 children; 94 had influenza-like illness. The
Vologda Medical Council reported that an influenza A (H3N2)
epidemic occurred in that city from I January to 2 February
1992. Estimates of vaccine efficacy against school absence
due to influenza-like illness during this period were 56% for
inactivated vaccine and 47% for live vaccine (table 2). Children
in the placebo group were absent with influenza-like illness for
a mean of0.79 days, whereas children in the inactivated vaccine
group were absent for a mean of 0.31 days during the epidemic
period (P "S .05, Wilcoxon rank sum test). Those who received
the live vaccine were absent for a mean of 0.45 days (P = .09,
Wilcoxon rank sum test). Vaccine efficacy was also estimated
by using ?4-fold serum antibody increases to A (H3N2), the
circulating virus, as tested at RII I month and 5 months after
vaccination to confirm influenza virus infection. The vaccine
efficacy against serologically confirmed influenza virus infection was 94% for inactivated vaccine and 72% for live vaccine.
The vaccine efficacy against serologically confirmed absenteeism due to influenza-like illness was 100% for both vaccine
preparations.
Discussion
This study represents not only the first time US inactivated
influenza vaccines have been studied in Russia but also the first
comparison of trivalent US inactivated split-virus and trivalent
Russian live attenuated cold-adapted vaccines. Adverse reactions to the vaccines were minimal: erythema and edema at
the site of inoculation for inactivated vaccine, particularly during the period when some vaccine was administered subcutaneously, coryza and sore throats for live vaccine, and low-grade
febrile reactions for both vaccines. A high frequency of local
reactions after subcutaneous administration of inactivated vaccine has been reported [8]. Both vaccine preparations were

immunogenic as assessed by HAl titers; however, median titers
against the 3 vaccine antigens were 2- to 4-fold higher in
the inactivated vaccine group, who were also more likely to
seroconvert, than in the live vaccine group. Among children
who received the live vaccine and seroconverted to any of the
3 antigens, those who were initially seronegative were more
likely to seroconvert. The inactivated vaccine was also more
likely to produce a seroconversion to all 3 antigens (38%) than
was the live vaccine (5%; data not shown).
This study is among the first to document influenza vaccine
efficacy among schoolchildren on the basis of school absenteeism due to physician-diagnosed influenza-like illness. Most
previous studies have calculated vaccine efficacy on the basis
ofpostseason ~4-fold antibody rises to the influenza antigen(s)
that predominated during the previous influenza season. This
approach may overestimate efficacy for inactivated vaccine
because recipients ofthese preparations have higher postvaccination antibody titers than those who receive live vaccines. In
contrast, estimates based on absenteeism due to clinical disease
may underestimate the true efficacy of both vaccines because
influenza virus infection cannot be readily differentiated from
other viral respiratory infections by using clinical criteria.
This study and others showing the efficacy oflive attenuated
and inactivated influenza vaccines in preventing influenza-like
illness among unvaccinated staff and children in a Russian
school where children were vaccinated [9] and otitis media
among children attending day care [10, 11] provide further
evidence that may support a policy of more widespread influenza vaccination of children. Moreover, studies have shown
that influenza virus infection causes high levels of morbidity
among the very young and that school-age children often disseminate influenza in the community [12, 13]. If influenza
vaccine is to be used more widely among healthy children, the
annual administration of single-dose trivalent, intranasal live
attenuated influenza virus vaccines, which are highly immunogenic but easy to administer and well-tolerated, may be more
acceptable than an annual intramuscular injection of the currently licensed US influenza vaccine.
