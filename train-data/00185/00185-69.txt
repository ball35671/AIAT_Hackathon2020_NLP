Abstract
Vaccine "Grippol"--has been developed at the State Research Center--Institute of Immunology. The preparation belongs to new generation vaccines and is a trivalent polymer-subunit vaccine containing the sterile conjugate of influenza virus surface proteins, types A and B, bound with copolymer polyoxidonium. The administration of "Grippol" to children of school age (6-18 years) demonstrated low reactogenicity of the vaccine, its safety and sufficient prophylactic effectiveness. During observations on total morbidity (with the exception of influenza and acute respiratory diseases) no side effects produced by "Grippol" were registered. At the same time the fact that the morbidity rate of upper respiratory tract disease in the group of children immunized with the vaccine decreased in comparison with the control group (by 2.4 times) cannot be disregarded.
