Abstract
To evaluate the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of inactivated chromatographic influenza vaccine A(H3N2) produced by the Pasteur Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology in Leningrad, children aged 7-15 years received the vaccine intradermally in doses of 114-228 IU, and 152 children received placebo. In this study inactivated influenza vaccine introduced parenterally to children aged 11-15 years in a dose of 228 IU proved to be nonreactogenic. The reactogenicity index of the preparation injected in a dose of 114 IU to children aged 7-10 years was 0.6%. Immunization in a single injection was accompanied by significant seroconversions in 87.5%-96.0% of children with the highly pronounced growth of antibody titers (21.1-34.6 times). The complex of clinico-laboratory tests showed the safety of this preparation for both age groups.
