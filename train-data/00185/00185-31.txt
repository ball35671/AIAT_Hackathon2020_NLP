Live attenuated, cold-adapted (ca) monovalent and bivalent influenza A vaccines were evaluated
in seronegative infants (ages 6-18 months) in a double-blind placebo-controlled trial to assess safety
and immunogenicity. A total of 182 seronegative subjects received a single intranasal dose (106

TCIDso) of ca AlKawasaki/9/86 (HINl) or ca AILosAngeles/2/87(H3N2), both as a bivalent vaccine,
or placebo. Respiratory and systemic symptoms did not differ between groups after vaccination.
Hemagglutination antibody seroconversions (::>-: 1:8)to H3N2 exceeded 90%. In contrast, seroconversions to AlKawasaki/9/86 (HINl) were significantly less frequent in bivalent ca vaccine recipients
(31%) than in monovalent ca HINI recipients (83%) (P < .002). During a subsequent H3N2
epidemic, nasal washes were cultured for viruses from any subject with respiratory illness. H3N2
infections documented by virus isolation were reduced by 65% in ca H3N2 recipients compared
with placebo or ca HINI recipients (P = .01).
Influenza A virus is a major cause of respiratory disease in
children and adults [1, 2]. Immunization with trivalent inactivated vaccine against influenza A HINl, influenza A H3N2,
and influenza B is currently recommended to ensure protection
against influenza illness in designated high-risk pediatric and
adult populations [3]. Live attenuated intranasal influenza vaccines offer the possibility of providing young children better
protection against influenza than that provided by current inactivated vaccines [4-6]. In the United States, live attenuated
influenza A vaccines have been made by reassortment of a
master cold-adapted (ca) donor A with current wild type
strains. The donor strain, which was attenuated by serial passage at low temperature (25°C), has multiple genomic mutaReceived 27 June 1995; revised 29 December 1995.

tions that make reversion to a virulent phenotype unlikely [7-
11].
Monovalent live influenza A ca vaccines administered intranasally are safe and immunogenic in adults and children [4,
12-17]. In small trials, multivalent vaccines have had variable
frequencies of viral shedding and serologic responses in seronegative children for HINI and H3N2 subtypes contained in
the vaccine [14, 16- 18]. In addition, there have been few
opportunities to evaluate efficacy of ca influenza A vaccine
[4-6]. The present study precisely compared the safety and
immunogenicity of HINI and H3N2 strains administered as
bivalent or monovalent vaccines and evaluated protection given
by ca H3N2 against subsequent natural influenza H3N2 exposure.
Materials and Methods
Vaccines. The study used the following live attenuated ca influenza strains: A1Kawasaki/9/86 (HINl) CR-125, lot BDS911501; AILos Angelesl2/87 CR-149 (H3N2), lot BDS915301;
and bivalent A1Kawasaki/9/86 (HINl) and A1Los Angeles/2/87
(H3N2), lot BDS915501. Live attenuated ca vaccines stocks were
prepared in eggs by Wyeth-Ayerst (Philadelphia). Monovalent vaccines contained either 106
.2 TCIDso of A1Kawasaki/9/86 virus or
106
.2 TCIDso of A1Los Angelesl2/87 virus per 0.5 mL. Bivalent
vaccine contained 106
.
2 TCIDso of A1Kawasaki/9/86 virus and 106
.
2
TCIDso ofA1LosAngeles/2/87 virus per 0.5 mL. Placebo contained
egg allantoic fluid.
Subjects. One hundred eighty-two healthy children, 6-18
months of age, were recruited in the fall of 1991 for study at
vaccine evaluation units at Baylor College of Medicine, S1. Louis
University, University of Rochester, Vanderbilt University, and
University of Maryland. All subjects were born after the last influ-

enza A HINI epidemic and, in addition, had little opportunity
for H3N2 exposure. Subjects were randomized in a double-blind
fashion to receive a single dose of ca monovalent influenza vaccine, ca bivalent influenza vaccine, or placebo. Vaccine or placebo
was given by nose drops as a 0.5-mL dose.
Safety evaluation. Subjects were monitored for adverse events
during the study. Parents and guardians were given thermometers
and instructed to record the subject's temperature twice a day
(morning and evening) and to record symptoms once each day
(evening) on a diary card during the week after vaccination. The
following symptoms were recorded: fever (any temperature
~37.8°C), cough, increase in rhinorrhea, and diarrhea (~3 stools
in a 24-h period judged to be looser than normal). The parent or
guardian was instructed to contact the study site if the subject
experienced> I symptom on a given day or fever ~37.8°C. Such
children were evaluated clinically.
Surveillance. Subjects were monitored during the winter of
1991-1992 to evaluate protection afforded by ca influenza vaccine
against naturally circulating influenza A. Once influenza was detected by community surveillance, all subjects and their family
members were followed closely by weekly phone calls. A home
visit or office evaluation was done if a subject had symptoms
of respiratory illness or any household contact had fever (oral
temperature ~37.8°C) and upper respiratory symptoms. A nasal
wash for viral culture was obtained. Individuals doing evaluations
remained blinded to treatment group. Respiratory illnesses (characterized by the presence of cough or rhinorrhea) were classified as
febrile (oral temperature 37.8°C) or afebrile. A clinical diagnosis
of otitis media was coded separately.
Virus isolation and identification. Nasal wash specimens were
collected on study days 6 and II from each subject for virus
isolation and phenotypic characterization to look for reversion to
wild type influenza virus. Specimens were freshly inoculated onto
RMK cells at permissive temperatures (34-37°C) for isolation of
influenza virus. We reasoned that virus shed for a more prolonged
period after vaccination would be more likely to demonstrate any
reversion to wild type phenotype [19]. Virus isolates were evaluated by H. Maassab (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor) for
confirmation of ca and temperature sensitive (ts) phenotypes [II].
For surveillance, RMK and additional cell lines (human neonatal
kidney, HEp-2, HeLa) were used to detect influenza and other
respiratory viruses.
Serology. Serum specimens for antibody determinations were
obtained from all enrolled subjects by fingerstick or venipuncture
before vaccination, 4 weeks after vaccination, and in the spring
of 1992 after the influenza epidemic. Hemagglutination antibody
inhibition (HAl) tests were done at Vanderbilt University to evaluate immunogenicity of vaccine and frequency of natural infection.
All sera from each patient were tested simultaneously. Subjects
were considered to be seronegative iftheir specimen before vaccination had an HAl titer I:4. Seroconversion to HINI or H3N2
vaccine antigens or serologic evidence of infection was defined as
a rise in antibody titer ~4-fold between appropriate paired specimens to respective antigens or a rise from 1:4 to 1:8.
The HAl assay was done with egg-grown influenza from two
sources. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),
Atlanta, supplied formalin-inactivated AlTaiwan/I/86 (HINI), AI
Sichuan/2/87 (H3N2), AlBeijing/353/89 (H3N2), and receptor-destroying enzyme. These strains were contemporary to viruses in
the vaccines. We also used AlKawasaki/9/86 and AlBeijing/353/
89 ca influenza vaccines (Wyeth-Ayerst). The initial serum dilution
for HAl was 1:4.
IgG ELISAs were done at St. Louis University on paired serum
specimens obtained before and 4 weeks after immunization to
assess immunogenicity of vaccine. Formalin-inactivated monovalent AlSichuan/2/87 and AlTaiwan/1/86 whole-virus vaccines were
used to derive purified hemagglutinin-neuraminidase preparations
for each antigen (provided by Connaught, Swiftwater, PA) by a
modified method of Phelan and colleagues [20, 21]. Serial 4-fold
serum dilutions were made in flat-bottom 96-well plates (Dynatech,
Chantilly, VA), beginning at an initial dilution of 1:20. After incubation for 2 h and wash steps, alkaline phosphatase-conjugated
anti-human IgG (Tago, Burlingame, CA) was added, and plates
were incubated overnight at 4°C. Diethanolamine buffer containing
p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma, St. Louis) was added. Optical
density was measured at 410 om after incubation for I h at 25°C.
End points were defined as the highest dilution giving a positive-tonegative ratio ~2 times background and an optical density ;;::.0.15.
Tissue culture studies ofmixed infection. Replication of vaccine viruses in tissue culture was evaluated by an immunoperoxidase assay (IPA) [16]. In brief, alone or in combination, A/Kawasaki/9/86 and AlLos Angeles/2/87 ca vaccines were inoculated at
104 and 106 TCIDsolmLin duplicate into RMK tube cultures. After
I h of adsorption at 25°C, cell sheets were thoroughly rinsed with
PBS. Cell and supernatant harvests were done at 12, 24, and 48
h and plaque-assayed in MDCK cells for the titer of each virus
strain by IPA using monoclonal antibodies specific for HINI and
H3N2. The monoclonal antibodies (A/Baylor/11515/82 [HI AB/
28], A/Memphis/2/85 [H3 M2-7]) were provided as ascites fluid
by R. Webster (St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis).
Statistical methods. We compared symptom, seroconversion,
virus isolation, and illness rates using Fisher's exact test (StatXact
Software, version 2; CYTEL, Cambridge, MA). Matched HAl
responses to different antigens were compared by McNemar's test.
We compared mean log, titers using analysis of variance and determined P values. We also did nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis tests;
these gave consistent results with the same determinations of significance. Multiple paired comparisons (post-hoc comparisons)
were done using Newman-Keuls' and Tukey's tests; both gave
consistent results at the .05 level (SAS Statistical Software, version
6.08; SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Comparison of influenza isolation
rates and influenza isolation associated with febrile illness or otitis
were used to evaluate efficacy of vaccine (Fisher's exact test);
confidence intervals were determined.
Results
Safety. We administered monovalent ca HINI, monovalent ca H3N2, or bivalent HINI/H3N2 ca influenza vaccine
or placebo allantoic fluid to 182 children 6-18 months of age.
Vaccines were well tolerated by all subjects (table 1). Mild
respiratory symptoms and low-grade fever were common in all
participants and did not differ significantly in frequency between vaccine recipients and control subjects. Diarrhea (not
shown) and otitis media were infrequent in all groups.
Virus recovery. Nasal washes were obtained on days 6 and
II to evaluate evidence of reversion to wild type influenza
virus. Influenza isolates were obtained from 7 (16%) of 44

HINl, 16 (36%) of 45 H3N2, and 26 (55%) of 47 bivalent
influenza vaccine recipients on day 6 (P < .001). Recovery of
HINI was less common than recovery ofH3N2 on day 6 after
administration of monovalent vaccines containing these strains
(P = .05). All isolates retained the ca and ts phenotype of the
vaccine strains. On day 11, influenza isolates from 1 of 45
H3N2 and 4 of47 bivalent influenza vaccine recipients, respectively, retained the ca and ts phenotype.
Serologic responses. Paired sera were available for 178 of
182 vaccinated subjects. Serologic responses are shown in table
2. There was no correlation between subject age and likelihood
ofserologic response to vaccine antigens. Some placebo recipients had rises in the ELISA, suggesting that the ~2-fold criteria
for a rise, while improving sensitivity, reduces specificity. The
H3N2 ca strain was uniformly immunogenic in both monovalent and bivalent recipients: Serologic responses to the CDC
NSichuan/2/87 antigen were >90% after a single dose in this
influenza-naive population. Sera were also tested against ca
vaccine NBeijing/352/89 (H3N2) antigen to determine immunogenicity of the vaccine for the subsequent epidemic virus:
100% of subjects had ~4-fold serologic response, and the
geometric mean titers (GMTs) of antibody were significantly
higher than those observed to the CDC antigen.
The immunogenicity of ca HINI vaccine was reduced compared with that of ca H3N2 vaccine in both monovalent and
bivalent preparations (table 2). HAl and ELISA seroconversions to HINI antigens were significantly less frequent in bivalent than in monovalent HINI recipients (P < .002). Responses
to CDC NTaiwan/1/86 (HINl) antigen were observed in
<20% of bivalent recipients. To determine whether the poor
seroresponse was due to an incomplete match between test and
vaccine antigens, all available sera were retested against ca N
Kawasaki/9/86 (HINl) vaccine antigen. Serologic responses
~4-fold were higher to the ca HINI antigen than to the HINI
CDC antigen in 37 monovalent (P = .06) and 32 bivalent (P
= .02) vaccine recipients. GMTs of HAl antibody to ca HINI
were higher than to CDC antigen in both monovalent and
bivalent vaccine recipients (P < .002). However, serologic
responses to ca HINI antigen after bivalent vaccine remained
strikingly lower than those observed after monovalent HINI
vaccine. Only 31% of bivalent vaccine recipients showed evidence of seroconversion to ca vaccine antigen compared with
83% of monovalent HINI recipients (P < .002), and GMTs
of HAl antibody to HI N1 after bivalent vaccine were lower
than those observed after monovalent vaccine (P < .002).
HI N1 infection was infrequent during the 1991-1992 influenza epidemic: HINI was rarely isolated during surveillance
(1/181 subjects), and there was rare seroconversion to HINI
in ca H3N2 and placebo recipients (1/57). Therefore, we could
evaluate HAl antibody responses to A/Kawasaki/9/86 in sera
obtained the following spring to determine whether delayed
seroconversions to HINI occurred in bivalent vaccine recipiTable 2. Hemagglutination inhibition (HAl) and ELISA serologic responses after monovalent or bivalent live attenuated, cold-adapted

ents. These sera were tested simultaneously with sera obtained
before and 4 weeks after vaccination. By the spring, 45% (14/
31) of bivalent vaccine recipients demonstrated seroconversion,
whereas 31% (10/32) had seroconverted 4 weeks after vaccination. These findings are consistent with some late seroconversion to the HI N I component ofthe vaccine but fall short of the
83% response to ca A/Kawasaki/9/86 (HINI) after vaccination
with monovalent HINI vaccine.
Virologic studies. To assure potency of the HINI component, the monovalent and bivalent vaccines were titered by IPA
as described [16]. Influenza virus ca A/Kawasaki/9/86 (HINI)
and ca AlLos Angeles/2/87 (H3N2) titers were 6.7 X io' and
I X 106 pfu/mL, respectively. The bivalent vaccine showed
equivalent titers of ca HINI and H3N2: 1.8 X 106 and 8.3 X
lOs pfu/mL, respectively. Hence, the poor performance of the
HINI component ofbivalent vaccine was not due to inadequate
amounts of virus in the preparation.
The potential for competition in replication between ca
HINI and H3N2 strains was next investigated in tissue culture.
ca influenza NKawasaki(HINI) and AzLos Angeles (H3N2)
stock vaccine strains, individually or together, were inoculated
onto RMK cells at permissive (34-36°C) temperature. Tissue
was harvested at 12, 24, and 48 h and tested for virus titer by
IPA (figure I). Viral replication was apparent for each virus
strain after inoculation of monovalent influenza ca HI N I and
ca H3N2 at both 106 and 104 TCIDso, an MOl of -10 or 0.1,
respectively (figure IA). Reductions in virus titers by 48 h
were judged to be due to virus inactivation and cell toxicity.
With bivalent infection, if the inoculum titer of ca HINI (106
TCIDso) equaled or exceeded that of coinfecting ca H3N2,
HINI virus recovery of>104 TCIDso was comparable to that
of H3N2 virus or monovalent HINI (figure IB, C). However,
with a 104 TCIDso inoculum of ca HINI and 106 TCIDso of
ca H3N2, HINI virus recovery was reduced to 103
.
s TCIDso
at all time points (figure ID).
Vaccine efficacy. An epidemic of NBeijing/89-like virus
in the winter of 1991-1992 provided an opportunity to evaluate
whether ca H3N2 vaccines protected against influenza infection
and illness. Intensive surveillance of enrolled subjects started
with identification of influenza at each vaccination site. We
identified 128 respiratory illnesses in 181 children under surveillance. Overall rates offebrile respiratory illness in ca H3N2
recipients (37%) were not significantly different from those
who received only HINI vaccine or placebo (38%). More than
50% of children with respiratory illness had viruses other than
influenza recovered at the time of the illness (adenovirus, 31;
cytomegalovirus, 12; parainfluenza, 2; respiratory syncytial virus, II; enterovirus, 3; and herpes simplex virus type I, I). No
differences were observed between vaccine groups in recovery
of viruses other than influenza.
Influenza A/Beijing/89 H3N2-like virus was isolated from
23 children with respiratory illness. Ofthe respiratory illnesses
due to influenza, 74% were associated with fever > 38.6°C.
There were no significant differences (P > .75) between monovalent and bivalent H3N2 recipients or between HINI recipients and control groups in influenza virus isolation, febrile
respiratory illness, or otitis media with effusion. Thus, these 2
groups were pooled for analysis based on whether subjects
received H3N2-containing vaccine (table 3). Culture-positive
influenza H3N2 infection was reduced by >65% in ca H3N2
vaccine recipients; H3N2-associated febrile respiratory illness
and otitis were both reduced by >67%. Influenza infection in
the spring, documented by an antibody titer rise ~4-fold, occurred in 6 (11%) of 57 NLos Angeles/2/87 (H3N2) recipients
compared with 21 (38%) of 28 monovalent HINI or placebo
recipients (P = .003).
Discussion
In the largest comparative trial in this age group to date,
monovalent and bivalent influenza vaccines containing HINI
and H3N2 viruses were safely administered to children ages
6-18 months. Surprisingly, the immunogenicity of ca influenza
HINI was reduced when combined with ca influenza H3N2.
However, ca H3N2-containing vaccines protected infants
against culture-proven H3N2 infection, offering promise for
use of ca influenza vaccines to prevent influenza illness in
infants.
As in previous trials, no excess of fever or respiratory
symptoms were observed in vaccine recipients [4, 12- 17]. In
earlier trials, peak shedding of ca influenza virus strains occurred 2 or 3 days after vaccine and persisted 10 days [14,
16, 18]. Viruses shed for prolonged periods after vaccination
might be expected to more likely show evidence of reversion
and loss ofattenuation. None of 54 samples from HINI, H3N2,
or bivalent ca vaccine recipients who shed virus at 6 or II
days showed evidence of loss of ca or ts markers that would
indicate phenotypic reversion. These observations confirm the
minimal reactogenicity and maintenance of attenuated phenotype for ca influenza vaccines delivered as monovalent or
multivalent vaccines to children.
Seroconversions to H3N2 antigens exceeded 90% in both
bivalent and monovalent H3N2 recipients. Infrequent seroconversions to H3N2 after vaccination in HINI and placebo
recipients might reflect responses to wild type influenza infection that could have occurred between vaccination and the 4-
week serum specimen. Surprisingly, the immunogenicity of ca
influenza HINI was reduced when combined with ca influenza
H3N2. Seroconversions to A/Kawasaki/9/86 antigens in bivalent vaccine recipients were about half as frequent as those
observed in monovalent HI N I recipients. This was unexpected,
as multivalent vaccines containing the same NLos Angeles/2/
87 and A/Kawasaki/9/86 combination have consistently produced seroconversions by HAl and ELISA exceeding 60% to
the HI N I component in trials in older subjects and children
[16, 18, 22]. In addition, in a subsequent trial, the same N
Kawasaki/9/86 ca component produced seroconversions in
75% of 106 seronegative children ages 6-18 months when
administered as the same 106 TCIDso dose in a bivalent vaccine
containing a different H3N2 component, ca NBeijing/352/89

[23]. Interaction among ca bivalent vaccines have also showed
inhibition of HI N I by H3N2 in infants [17].
We evaluated possible explanations for a decreased serologic
response to HI N I in bivalent vaccine recipients, such as the
possibility of better HAl response to homologous vaccine antigen or a delayed serologic response of the HINI component
ofthe bivalent vaccine. Evidence supported these explanations
as a minor component of the phenomena. HINI and H3N2
HAl seroconversions were more frequently observed to vaccine
antigens other than CDC antigens, and HI NI responses were

modestly increased by the spring, suggesting a delayed primary
immune response. However, HINI seroresponses of bivalent
vaccine recipients remained far below those of monovalent
HINI recipients. By IPA, we confirmed that the monovalent
and bivalent vaccines had expected titers of '" 106 pfufmL for
both ca HINI and H3N2 strains. Therefore, poor serologic
response to HINI in bivalent vaccine recipients could not be
explained by decreased potency of the HINI component.
We perceived that ca AlKawasaki/9/86 might be at a replicative disadvantage when coadministered with ca A/Los Angeles/
2/87 and that reduced ability to replicate might be made manifest by decreased serologic response. This possibility is supported by less frequent day 6 recovery of vaccine virus in
monovalent ca HI N I recipients than in monovalent ca H3N2
recipients. Unfortunately, day 6 samples were not available to
determine by IPA the relative shedding of HINI and H3N2
in bivalent recipients. In vivo observations on the apparent
competitive interactions of ca influenza A and B strains have
been successfully modeled in tissue culture by exploiting the
ability of the IPA to discriminate influenza virus strains from
multivalent tissue culture harvests [16]. Competition between
influenza A and B strain replication in eggs and mice was
recently reported [24]. We examined growth of coinfecting AI
Kawasaki/9/86 and AlLos Angeles/2/87 strains in tissue culture
for evidence of competition during replication.
In our experiments, higher input titers of ca H3N2 virus
reduced ca HINI replication in tissue culture. The converse
was not true, suggesting a relative competitive advantage for
the H3N2 virus. We believe that similar competition between
replication of ca A strains may be associated with diminished
effectiveness of one or the other component in human subjects.
Further, correlation of the behavior in tissue culture of novel
ca vaccine strains with clinical performance in seronegative
children would have value in the formulation ofvaccines incorporating new drift strains.
In recent experiments, two doses of high-titer (107
.
5 TCID5o )
monovalent HI NI vaccine were immunogenic in infants <6
months of age [25]. Increasing the number of doses [17], titer,
or both of each component of multivalent influenza vaccines
may overcome competitive disadvantages and assure adequate
serologic response to all antigens.
Intensive surveillance of 181 enrolled children allowed us
to determine that ca A/Los Angeles/2/87 (H3N2) in monovalent
or bivalent vaccine protected infants against culture-proven AI
Beijing/352/89-like (H3N2) infection and respiratory illness.
Despite close surveillance, H3N2 isolation (19% in HINI and
placebo recipients) may underestimate the frequency of H3N2
infection compared with serology (38%); however, it allows
linkage of a specific illness with influenza infection. The protection occurred despite antigenic differences between vaccine
and epidemic virus. Serologic results mirrored culture-defined
efficacy of ca H3N2 vaccine. Efficacy studies in older subjects
have generally relied heavily on serology or larger populations
to demonstrate evidence of influenza vaccine protection [6].
High influenza attack rates and prolonged viral shedding are
common in young seronegative children [1, 2]; our findings
indicate that these features of influenza illness can be exploited
to evaluate efficacy of influenza vaccine in relatively small
cohorts of young children.
