Effectiveness of Pandemic H1N1 Vaccine Against
Influenza-Related Hospitalization in Children
WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: In Canada, children 6
months to 9 years old were recommended to receive 2 half-adult
(0.25 mL) doses of AS03-adjuvanted pandemic influenza A/H1N1
vaccine. A single dose was highly immunogenic and protective
against infection in children, but protection against
hospitalization is unknown.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Results indicate that a single half-adult
dose of AS03-adjuvanted pandemic influenza A/H1N1 vaccine is
highly protective against hospitalization in children aged 6
months to 9 years. Protection was substantial 10 days after a
single dose (additional marginal increase at 14 days).

OBJECTIVE: Young children are generally considered immunologically
naive with respect to influenza exposure opportunities; thus, a 2-dose
schedule is recommended when a child is first immunized with conventional influenza vaccine lacking adjuvant.We estimatedthe effectiveness of
a single pediatric dose of AS03-adjuvanted vaccine against hospitalization
for confirmed pandemic influenza A/H1N1 (pH1N1) infection in children
aged 6 months to 9 years during the fall 2009 vaccination campaign.
METHODS: In a matched case-control design, case subjects were children
hospitalized for pH1N1 infection in the Fall of 2009, in Quebec, Canada.
Controls were nonhospitalized children, matched by age and region of
residence. Vaccination status in case subjects and controls was ascertained in relation to the case subject’s date of illness onset. Vaccine effectiveness was estimated through conditional logistic regression.
RESULTS: The overall effectiveness of a single pediatric dose of vaccine administered 14 days before illness onset was 85% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 61% to 94%), varying according to age category but
with wide and overlapping CIs: 92% (95% CI: 51% to 99%) in 6 –23
month-old children, 89% (95% CI: 34% to 98%) in 2– 4 year-olds, and
79% (95% CI: 31% to 96%) in 5–9 year-olds. Overall vaccine effectiveness for immunization 10 days before illness onset was slightly
lower at 80% (95% CI: 60% to 90%), with similar variation according to
age.
CONCLUSION: In children aged 6 months to 9 years, a single pediatric
dose of the AS03-adjuvanted pH1N1 vaccine was highly protective
against hospitalization beginning at 10 and 14 days after vaccination.

As with previous influenza pandemics,
the 2009 –2010 pandemic of influenza
A/H1N1 (pH1N1) showed a more youthful epidemiologic profile compared
with seasonal strains. Children experienced higher attack rates than adults;
those younger than 10 years, especially the very young, were more frequently admitted to hospital.
In the province of Quebec (population
7.8 million), the second wave of the
2009 pandemic began the week of October 4 (Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention [CDC] week 40),
peaked the week of November 12
(week 45), and was essentially ended
by December 19 (week 50) (Fig 1). Vaccination of children aged 6 months to 4
years started November 2 (week 44)
along with that of patients aged 6
months to 64 years with chronic medical conditions, and the families of infants younger than 6 months or with
immunodeficiency. Children 5 to 19
years old without chronic medical conditions were vaccinated beginning November 12 (week 45); vaccination then
proceeded to all persons aged 65
years and older and to the rest of the
population. By the end of CDC weeks 44,
46, and 50, the vaccine coverage in
children younger than 10 years increased from 27% to 60% and 77%,
respectively.
In contrast to the United States, where
adjuvanted vaccine was not available
during the pandemic, in Canada, a
monovalent AS03-adjuvanted pH1N1
vaccine was selected as the primary
formulation and constituted 95% of
all pandemic vaccine doses administered.1 Arepanrix (GlaxoSmithKline,
Sainte-Foy, Quebec, Canada) is an inactivated, split-virion vaccine consisting
of a pH1N1 immunizing antigen (as a
suspension) and an AS03 adjuvant (as
an oil in water emulsion comprising
DL--tocopherol, squalene, and polysorbate 80).2 Pediatric trials with the
AS03-adjuvanted vaccine produced in
Quebec (n  60)3 and in Dresden, Germany (n  101)4 demonstrated substantial vaccine-induced antibody response 21 days after single-dose
immunization (0.25 mL containing 1.9
g of hemagglutinin) and half the
adult dose of adjuvant, with seroprotection and seroconversion rates
each exceeding 90% among immunized participants younger than 10
years.
On the basis of these immunogenicity
findings, and balancing also the higher
rate of adverse reactions observed after the second dose of vaccine as well
as the limited availability of even a single dose for all target groups in the
initial stages of the immunization campaign, a single pediatric dose of the
adjuvanted pH1N1 vaccine was recommended for children aged 6 months to
9 years in Quebec.5 To evaluate this policy recommendation, provincial authorities mandated an epidemiologic
investigation of the effectiveness of a
single dose of adjuvanted pH1N1 vaccine in preventing hospitalization in
children.
METHODS
Participants
Laboratory-confirmed pH1N1 hospitalization (24 hours’ duration) was a
notifiable condition during the pandemic in Quebec. All hospitalized patients with suspected pH1N1 infection
were tested for influenza by reversetranscription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and results were recorded in the provincial registry. In
this case-control study, Quebec residents aged 6 months to 9 years hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed
pH1N1 infection between November 12

(week 45, 10 days after the start of vaccination in children) and December 19
(week 50, end of the second wave in
Quebec) were eligible as case subjects. Those living in the 2 northernmost regions were excluded for practical considerations. Identified case
subjects had been hospitalized in 42
facilities (33% in 4 pediatric hospitals).
Controls were selected from the provincial health insurance registry,
which includes all citizens and immigrants residing in Quebec. Controls
were matched to their case subject by
date of birth (3 months for children
6 –23 months and 6 months for older
children) and by 1 of the 16 administrative areas of residence. For each case,
15 potential controls were selected at
random from the health insurance
registry. Children who had a
laboratory-confirmed pH1N1 infection
before the start of the vaccination
campaign, or before the date of vaccination of their matched case, were excluded as potential controls.
Trained interviewers administered a
standardized telephone questionnaire
to parents of case subjects and controls, after receiving their verbal consent, between March 25 and June 3,
2010. Up to 5 attempts were made to
reach potential study participants, at
different times of the day and week,
including weekends, until 3 matched
controls for each case were reached.
Data collected included demographic
characteristics, pH1N1 and seasonal
2008 –2009 influenza vaccination status,
any influenza-like illness (ILI) whether
medically attended or not and defined as
fever and cough or sore throat during
the first and the second pandemic wave
(for case subjects defined as ILI before
onset of the pH1N1 infection for which
they were admitted), presence of
chronic underlying medical conditions
as defined by the National Advisory Committee on Immunization,6 and other covariates as listed in Table 1. The type of
pandemic vaccine and date of vaccination were validated through linkage to
the provincial electronic pandemic
vaccination registry. The absence of
confirmed pH1N1 infection in controls
was verified using the provincial registry of all confirmed pH1N1 case subjects. Among the 4680 potential controls provided by the health insurance
board, 31 (0.66%) had laboratoryconfirmed pH1N1 infection.
This study was conducted as a legally
mandated emergency public health investigation and research ethics board
approval was therefore not required.
Vaccination Status
Vaccination status was defined for each
hospitalized case subject and corresponding 3 matched controls in relation
to the date of illness onset of the case
(reference date). For the primary analysis, a child was considered immunized if
the pH1N1 vaccine had been given 14

days before the reference date; for the
secondary analysis, the interval was set
at 10 days. Children were classified as
unvaccinated if they had received no
pH1N1 vaccination before the reference
date. Category indicator variables were
created inclusive of children who receivedthe vaccine 0to 13 days (0 –9 days
inthe secondary analysis) beforethe reference date.
Statistical Analysis
Analyses were based on conditional logistic regression. Vaccine effectiveness (VE) was defined as 1-odds ratio
for hospitalization with laboratoryconfirmed pH1N1 illness among vaccinated compared with unvaccinated
subjects. A model containing factors
that were associated with hospitalization risk with a P  .05 in univariate
conditional logistic regression and potential confounders that modified the
point estimate for VE by at least 5%
was developed by excluding variables
in a stepwise process. Analysis was
performed for all age groups and
stratified for children aged 6 to 23
months, 2 to 4 years, and 5 to 9 years.
Analyses were performed with SAS 9.1
(SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, NC). A P value
of .05 was considered significant.
RESULTS
Participation
Between November 12 and December
19, 2009, a total of 284 pH1N1 hospitalized case subjects 6 months to 9 years
old were identified. Telephone numbers were available for 278 (99%) but
244 (88%) of them were reached. Of
these, 23 were excluded: 8 were living
in the 2 northernmost regions; 4 were
youngerthan 6 months atthe start ofthe
vaccination campaign; 1 received 2 vaccine doses; 1 refused participation; 1
was not able to speak English or French;
4 were hospitalized for other reasons
with coincident pH1N1 detection; and 4
had symptom onset 14 days before
hospitalization. The final sample included 221 hospitalized case subjects.
Telephone numbers were available for
78% (n  798) of the potential controls, but 34 telephone numbers were
incorrect and 61 never responded.
Among the 704 (88%) potential controls reached, 41 were excluded: 26
(4%) refused to participate; 1 had been
hospitalized for pH1N1; 1 had a confirmed pH1N1 infection before the date
of vaccination of the matched case
subject, 1 had received 2 doses of vaccine; 12 were excluded because of exclusion of the matched case subject.
The final sample included 663 age- and
region-matched controls.
Baseline Characteristics and
Covariates
The characteristics of the hospitalized
case subjects and their community
controls are shown in Table 1 (Supplemental Table 4 for data according to
age group). For nearly 60% of the case
subjects, symptom onset occurred before CDC week 46; that is, 2 weeks
after the start of the vaccination campaign (52% in CDC week 45 alone).
pH1N1 Vaccination Status
When no reference was made to the
date of onset of illness, 62% of case
subjects and 82% of controls had received the pandemic vaccine. In accordance with the prioritization schedule,
for both case subjects and controls,
vaccination was received earlier in
children with underlying conditions
rather than without underlying conditions and in younger (aged 6 –23
months and 2– 4 years) rather than
older children (aged 5–9 years) (Supplemental Fig 3). The vaccine was received before the reference date, by
59.3% of case subjects and 56.0% of
controls. Vaccination within 10 days of
the reference date was more frequent
for case subjects than controls (51.1%
and 34.4%), whereas the reverse was
seen for intervals of 10 days (8.1%
and 21.6%) or 14 days (4.1% and
9.5%) (Table 2). A protective effect of

vaccination was observed starting at
day 9 after vaccination (Fig 2).
pH1N1 VE Estimation
Because 60% of the cases occurred
2 weeks after the beginning of the
immunization campaign targeting children, a large number of the 221 sets
were concordant (almost exclusively
because children were all unvaccinated: among the 175 concordant sets,
99% were unvaccinated, 1% were vaccinated). In conditional analysis, only
case-control sets discordant for the
exposure of interest (vaccination) contribute to computations.7 For vaccination 14 days before the date of reference, 46 of the 221 sets were
discordant; for an interval 10 days,
91 sets were discordant (Supplemental Table 5).
Unadjusted overall pH1N1 VE in preventing hospitalization when given at
least 14 days before illness onset was
77% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 40%
to 91%) (Table 3). Adjusting for underlying medical conditions, seasonal
2008 –2009 trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) receipt, and presence of 2 siblings aged 5 years and
younger in the family increased the VE
to 85% (95% CI: 61% to 94%). Point estimates for VE according to age strata
were similar, with widely overlapping
CIs (Table 3).
Fully adjusted pH1N1 VE in preventing
hospitalization when given at least 10
days before illness onset was 81%
(95% CI: 60% to 91%).
In different sensitivity analyses (restricted to children who did not report
ILI; to children without underlying medical conditions; excluding children who
received the vaccine within 14 [or 10]
days of illness onset in the case, or
considering them as unvaccinated)
(Supplemental Table 6), overall VE
estimates remained essentially the
same.
There was an association between previous 2008 –2009 TIV receipt and pH1N1
risk. The odds ratio for 2008 –2009 TIV
effect on risk of confirmed pH1N1 hospitalization in the fully adjusted model
was 2.18 (95% CI: 1.45 to 3.27). When
restricted to participants who did not
receive pH1N1 vaccine and adjusted
for the presence of at least 1 underlying medical condition and presence of
2 siblings aged 5 years or younger in
the family, the odds ratio was 3.88
(95% CI: 1.57 to 9.60). This pattern was
maintained when restricted to children without an underlying medical
condition (72 case subjects/283 controls): odds ratio  6.0 (95% CI: 2.00 to
18.2).

gle pediatric dose of adjuvanted pH1N1
vaccine in protecting children aged 6
months to 9 years from confirmed
pH1N1 hospitalization. As early as 10
days after immunization, we observed
that a single dose conferred an effectiveness of 81%, increasing to 85% 14
days after vaccination. These estimates of excellent vaccine protection
with a single dose of adjuvanted vaccine in children are consistent with immunogenicity findings showing seroprotection and seroconversion rates
exceeding 90% in children belonging to
the same age span.4,8 Others have also
consistently demonstrated that the adjuvanted vaccine, although more reactogenic, was more immunogenic than
nonadjuvanted pH1N1 vaccine in children and adults.9,10 Our VE estimates
are slightly lower than the 95.7% and
100% VE against medically attended,
laboratory-confirmed pH1N1 estimated for a single pediatric dose of the
AS03-adjuvanted pH1N1 vaccine at 10
and 14 days, respectively, after immunization from a small casecontrol study (n  28) in Canada of
28 laboratory-confirmed pediatric
cases of pH1N1 (5 hospitalized),11
and 100% VE of an AS03-adjuvanted
pH1N1 vaccine against medically attended, laboratory-confirmed pH1N1
at 14 days after immunization in children younger than 15 years (n
2182) found in the United Kingdom.12
Our results slightly exceed the 77%
VE measured against laboratoryconfirmed pH1N1 beginning at 14
days in children younger than 10
years (n  502) with underlying
conditions who received AS03-
adjuvanted pH1N1 vaccine found in a
case-control study in the United Kingdom.13 All these studies used a testnegative case-control design. In
other studies not restricted to children, vaccine protection conferred
by adjuvanted vaccine was also very
high: published estimates of VE for
the AS03-adjuvanted pH1N1 vaccine
in adults or all age patients range
from 72% to 97%,13,14 and is lower in
those with underlying conditions
(62%).13
We also observed an increased risk of
pH1N1 associated with previous 2008 –
2009 TIV receipt that was more evident
when we restricted the analysis to participants who did not receive the
pH1N1 vaccine and to those without
chronic conditions. This finding is similar to what was reported in Canada
during the first wave.15,16 A study conducted by the national influenza sentinel network during the second wave in
ambulatory patients did not see this
effect in overall analysis, although it
was observed in the pediatric population.17 A case-control study in England
during the second wave also found an
increased risk of medically attended
pH1N1 illness in patients with underlying conditions who received the 2009 –
2010 TIV.13 A randomized placebocontrolled trial (using a vaccine
different from that primarily used in
Canada) in school-aged children in
Hong Kong during their first wave also
showed a doubling of the risk of pH1N1
infection in vaccinated children compared with unvaccinated children.18,19
Decreased immunogenicity after an
alum-adjuvanted H5N1 vaccine and after a split-virus nonadjuvanted pH1N1
vaccine has been reported in children
who previously received TIV.20,21 The immunologic mechanism underlying this
unexpected finding is unknown; an extensive discussion of hypotheses may
be found elsewhere.15,19 Although the
confirmation of this phenomenon may
not have short-term public health implications, it could profoundly affect
our understanding of the immunopathology of influenza and is thus worthy
of additional investigation. Similarly,
the unexpected but provocative finding
of increased pH1N1 risk in the early
period after immunization observed in
this study also warrants additional
evaluation.
This study has several limitations. Although the participation rate among
reached case subjects and potential
controls was high, we cannot rule out
intrinsic differences from those we
were unable to reach. It is also possible that the source population of
hospitalized case subjects differed
on important but unrecognized characteristics and as such we cannot rule
out residual confounding. More case
subjects (especially among younger
children) reported having had an ILI
during the first wave but more controls had an ILI during the second
wave. In the analysis restricted to children without ILI, the VE was unchanged
suggesting this was unlikely to have
been a major influence on our findings.
The statistical power of the study, especially in children aged 5 to 9 years,
was limited because most cases occurred before the vaccination was offered to this group. Small sample size
may have also introduced instability and
spurious findings in exploratory subanalyses. As such, exploratory subanalyses cannot be considered conclusive but
merit additional evaluation.
This study also had several strengths.
It included all pH1N1-hospitalized children from a substantial population,
and all cases were laboratory confirmed by using RT-PCR. Matching according to age and area of residence
as well as adjustment for young siblings in the family, indicative of increased influenza exposure opportunities, helped to limit confounding. We
also adjusted for the presence of at
least 1 chronic condition; however,
some conditions may be greater drivers than others for vaccination or hospitalization. Small sample size by
strata precluded control for specific
conditions or analysis restricted to
children with chronic medical conditions. However, in the analysis reARTICLES

stricted to children without chronic
medical conditions, the VE was similar
to the overall VE, which is reassuring.
Finally, vaccination status and dates of
vaccination were confirmed by the
provincial registry.
In the context of vaccination given during the course of an epidemic, rapid
onset of protection with a single dose
of vaccine is desirable. For children
never immunized against influenza, 2
doses of vaccine, seasonal or pandemic, are generally recommended.
However, the rapid unfolding of the fall
pH1N1 wave would not have permitted
a second dose to exert its effect in
time, suggesting that this recommendation may not always be practical and
the incremental benefit of a second
dose may be doubtful when immunization coincides with an epidemic. The
estimated VE of a single dose of adjuvanted vaccine in our study approximates the efficacy of 2 doses of seasonal
influenza vaccine measured through
randomized clinical trials during seasons with good match to circulating influenza strains. Rather than, or in addition to, a direct effect of adjuvant, our
results may also reflect well-matched
pH1N1 antigen to circulating virus during the pandemic wave in Quebec (99.6%
characterized as matched to the vaccine
component). However, our VE exceeds
that estimated through case-control and
cohort designs for seasonal influenza in
children.22,23 Immunogenicity data in children 6 months to 9 years old administered a single dose of nonadjuvanted
pH1N1 vaccine also showed seroprotection rates exceeding 90%,22 but
the clinical implications of that have
yet to be confirmed through effectiveness studies.
CONCLUSIONS
Our results indicate that a single pediatric dose of the AS03-adjuvanted
pH1N1 vaccine given to children aged
6 months to 9 years is highly protective against hospitalization, beginning as early as 10 days after immunization. These findings suggest that
the decision to administer 2 doses of
influenza vaccine to children is context dependent: during a pandemic
this should take into account the
stage of the evolving epidemic, available immunogenicity data, and practical considerations around vaccine
supply in relation to need across atrisk groups.
