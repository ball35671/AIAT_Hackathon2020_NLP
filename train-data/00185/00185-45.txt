Safety of influenza
vaccines in children
Since publishing our systematic review of
the effects of influenza vaccines in healthy
children (Feb 26, p 773),1 we have
completed our review of the published
and unpublished safety evidence for these
vaccines.2
We found only one safety study of
inactivated vaccine in 35 children aged
12–28 months done nearly 30 years ago
with an influenza B vaccine;3 all other
safety studies of inactivated vaccine we
found were in children aged 3years or
more. Three studies reported safety data
of live vaccine in children aged 22 months
or younger (combined denominator
827).4–6 Seven further studies included
children younger than 2 years.7–13 Only one
trial of live vaccine had serious adverse
events as an outcome (measured up to
3months after vaccine administration).8
The lack of reported trial safety data for
inactivated vaccines in younger children is
particularly surprising given that this vaccine is now recommended for healthy children aged 6 months and older in USA and
Canada.1
We wrote to 15 first or corresponding
authors or research group leaders of the
31 studies (30 randomised controlled
trials [RCTs] and one cohort study)
included in our review to enquire about
any unpublished data. Some authors had
published more than one study, and email
addresses for two authors of four studies
(one RCT and three cohort studies) could
not be found. We received 12 replies (80%
response rate), accounting for 27 (87%) of
the studies included in our review.
One retrieved paper, by Bergen and colleagues,1,4 reported that more than
2500 medical adverse events had
occurred in vaccine recipients and more
than 1300 in placebo recipients, but fewer
than half—ie, only those that were significantly associated with increased or
decreased risk in vaccine recipients—were
specified by diagnosis (table). We wrote to
the corresponding author, Steven Black,
asking for the data on the non-significant
events to include in our meta-analysis.
Black responded saying that he had the
data we requested but would require
clearance from the vaccine manufacturer,
MedImmune, to send it. He later
responded that MedImmune did not want
to share the data.
We requested a contact at MedImmune
and wrote to Robert Walker explaining the
need to include non-significant outcomes
in the meta-analysis of a systematic
review. Walker declined to let us have the
data. Walker was contacted once again at
a later date after two authors of other
studies on live vaccine safety (Belshe and
Gruber) informed us that all safety data
from their studies2,4–7,15,16 was controlled by
MedImmune. Walker responded in the
same manner to this new request, stating
that “MedImmune does not provide study
data to outside parties”.
Although so far we have found no evidence to suggest a serious harmful effect
of any of the vaccines in our review, we are
concerned by our findings of limited clinical trial evidence for inactivated vaccines.
In addition, the withholding of safety data
for live attenuated vaccines makes it
impossible to present a complete evidence base of their safety. Although a frequent practice, lack of reporting of
non-significant outcomes raises the real
possibility that our review may present a
biased picture.17,18 Heterogeneity of outcome definition and reporting are additional problems in vaccine trials.19
An incomplete or fragmented evidence
base could hinder identification of rare
and serious adverse events. Given their
rarity, these may not be identifiable from
single studies but may require a complete
data set, as was the case for intussusception and rotavirus vaccines.20
We believe all unpublished trial safety
data should be readily accessible to both
the regulatory bodies and the scientific
community on request. Our evidence
gives rise to a concern that lack of access
to unreported data prevents published
data being put into context and hinders
full and independent review. This cannot
be good for public confidence in these
vaccines.

1-year trial or the 800 patients who have
so far taken ICL670.1 Similarly, no information is provided on the toxic effects of
the metabolites of ICL670.
Pending further studies on efficacy
and toxicity, ICL670 could have a significant role in the treatment of transfusional iron overload, perhaps not as a
monotherapy but in combination with
other chelating drugs. It is hoped that
the low dose of ICL670 will increase the
prospects of compliance and reduced
treatment costs for thalassaemia patients
in developing countries who cannot use
deferoxamine or deferiprone.
I declare that I have no conflict of interest.

Effects of ICL670
(deferasirox) on cardiac
iron concentrations
On the basis of 1-year clinical trial
results,1 the pharmaceutical company
Novartis announced that submission
for global registration of ICL670 is anticipated in the first half of 2005.
ICL670 has an orphan drug status in the
USA and European Union, and fasttrack status by the US Food and Drug
Administration. However, although
deferoxamine was used for comparison
in the trial, the efficacy and safety profile
of ICL670 is not yet clear because no
information is given on the effects of
ICL670 on cardiac iron concentrations
and cardiac function. Such information
is crucial for the safety of patients, since
cardiomyopathy from excess cardiac
iron is the major cause of death in
thalassaemia patients.2,3 Progressive
improvement of heart function associated with a reduction in cardiac iron, as
monitored by MRI T2*, was seen in thalassaemia patients treated with intravenous deferoxamine during a 1-year
study.2
Despite the fact that a reduction in
liver iron and serum ferritin concentrations was reported in many patients
treated with the higher doses of 20 and
30 mg/kg per day of ICL670 used in the
1-year trial, such a finding does not
mean that cardiac iron concentrations
are similarly reduced.1,3 These doses are
ineffective in achieving negative iron
balance in most patients, suggesting
that only some of the iron mobilised by
ICL670 from the liver is excreted in the
faeces, while the remainder could be
redistributed to the heart and other
organs.4,5
The transfer of iron to the liver and
erythrocytes by ICL670 has been shown
in normal animals.5 Iron loading of the
heart by ICL670 is also suspected
because of its lipophilicity, long half-life
in plasma (12-16 h), and the transfer of
iron from its iron complex to transferrin.4,5
Although in the 1-year trial, the
overall inferiority of ICL670 to deferoxamine was admitted by Novartis, the
extent of inferiority cannot be validated
unless information is provided on the
compliance of the group of patients
treated with subcutaneous deferoxamine 5 days per week.
The most common toxic side-effects
reported in the 1-year trial and previous
studies were gastrointestinal symptoms
(nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain), transaminitis, skin rash, and
increase in creatinine concentrations.1,4
The latter was reported to be dosedependent, but rarely progressed to
renal insufficiency or required the discontinuation of ICL670.1 No statistics
on this and other toxic effects involving
the 300 patients were available for the
