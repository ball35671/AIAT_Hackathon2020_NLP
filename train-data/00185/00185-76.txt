Abstract Background: The efficacy of inactivated influenza vaccine in healthy infants and children younger than
24 months has not been confirmed. The aim of the present study was to determine the prophylactic effect of
inactivated influenza vaccine against influenza A in healthy children aged 6–24 months.
Methods: Healthy infants and young children (6–24 months old) were immunized by subcutaneous injection
of inactivated influenza vaccine before influenza seasons. Age matched children were randomly assigned as
the control. These children were followed up from January to April in each year (2000, 2001 and 2002). The
attack rates of influenza A infection was compared and statistically assessed.
Results: The attack rate of influenza A virus infection in the vaccine group and the control group were 14.8%
(n = 27) vs 12.5% (n = 32) in 2000 (P = 0.526); 2.8% (n = 72) vs 7.2% (n = 69) in 2001 (P = 0.203); and 3.4%
(n = 52) vs 8.9% (n = 56) in 2002 (P = 0.205). The attack rates of influenza A between the two groups were
not significantly different.
Conclusion: Inactivated influenza vaccine did not reduce the attack rate of influenza A infection in
6–24 month old children.

Different countries have selected a range of different
programs for influenza vaccine recommendations. In the
United States, inactivated influenza vaccine is recommended
for any person aged >6 months old who is at increased risk
for complications.1
 In Japan, the inactivated influenza vaccine
had been administrated to schoolchildren, but because of the
lack of supporting studies for this approach at the time the
government discontinued the program in 1994.2,3 Many cases
of influenza-associated encephalitis-encephalopathy have
been reported in Japan since the discontinuation of the
program, and the major target of the complication is children
<5 years old.4,5 Two recent studies have shown increased
rates of influenza-related hospitalizations among children
<2 years old.6,7 Subsequently, it is now being debated
whether inactivated influenza vaccine should be given to
young children and infants.
We have previously reported that inactivated influenza
vaccine is effective in preventing influenza A infection in
preschool children in the 2–7-year-old age group, as well as
in adults.8 However, in the same article we also suggested
that vaccination of children <2 years old is not effective for
prevention of influenza.8
Our current objective was to estimate the clinical prophylactic effect of inactivated influenza vaccine in healthy
infants and children <24 months old.
Methods
Study population
Healthy infants and young children who were 6–24 months
old at the time of recruitment were enrolled in the study.
Informed consent was obtained from parents. A total of 175
children were given inactivated influenza vaccine between
November and December in 1999, 2000 and 2001 at Public
Shisou General Hospital (Shisou-Gun, Japan) or Rokko
Island Hospital (Kobe City, Japan). As the control group, 171
age matched infants and children in good health, who did not

receive influenza vaccine within 1 year of enrolment, were
randomly assigned from medical records of the hospitals.
Children with any congenital disorders or chronic
illnesses were excluded from the study. Patients who were
taking medications that might interfere with the study were
also excluded.
Immunization
The immunization protocol was begun early in November
and ended in December in 1999, 2000 and 2001. The vaccine
group received commercial inactivated influenza vaccines
provided by the Research Foundation for Microbial Disease
of Osaka University. The vaccine for the 1999/2000 influenza
season contained 200 chick cell agglutination units per mL
(CCA/mL) of A/Beijing/262/95 (H1N1), 350 CCA/mL of
A/Sydney/5/97 (H3N2) and B/Shandong/7/97. The vaccine
for the 2000/2001 influenza season included >15 µg
hemaglutinin per 0.5 mL of A/New Caledonia/20/99 (H1N1),
A/Panama/2007/99 (H3N2) and B/Yamanashi/166/98. The
vaccine for the 2001/20002 influenza season contained
>15 µg hemagiutinin per mL of A/New Caledonia/20/99
(H1N1), A/Panama/2007/99 (H3N2) and B/Johannesburg/5/99.
Each dose of subcutaneous injection were administered as
follows. Infants younger than 12 months old were given
0.1 mL of the vaccine, and young children from 12–24 months
old were given 0.2 mL of the vaccine. They received two
doses of the vaccine 14 days apart.
For ethical reasons, we did not use placebo injections as a
substitute for the vaccine in the control group.
Diagnosis of influenza A virus infection
Influenza A virus infection was defined by a positive result
of the enzyme immunoassay membrane test (Directigen
FLU-A antigen test, Becton Dickenson Microbiology
Systems, Cockeysville, MD, USA) of specimens from
patients’ pharynges. The test was performed according to the
direction of the manufacture. The Directigen FLU-A utilizes
enzyme-conjugated monoclonal antibodies that are specific
for conserved regions of influenza A nucleoprotein. The test
detects influenza A virus but not influenza B.
Follow-up
The follow-up period was from January to April in each year
(2000, 2001 and 2002). The participating children were asked
to come to the hospitals within 48 h if they ever developed a
febrile illness. When the children were seen for a febrile
illness (>38.0°C), in addition to the physical examination,
throat swabs from the children were examined by the enzyme
immunoassay membrane test to detect influenza A virus
antigen. The results of the examinations were recorded.
Whether febrile episodes of all children were recorded
was confirmed by questionnaires during the follow-up period
sent to all participants, or direct interviews at the end of the
study period.
Statistical analysis
The outcome was compared by Fisher’s exact test. Differences
were considered significant if P < 0.05.
Results
Study participants
The number of infants and young children aged 6–24 months
who received inactivated influenza vaccine in each time
period were as follows: 30 in 1999–2000; 79 in 2000–01; and
66 in 2001–02. The numbers of children enrolled in the
control groups for each year were: 36 in 1999–2000; 74 in
2000–01; and 65 in 2001–02. Among the vaccine group, 27
participants in 1999–2000, 72 in 2000–01 and 58 in 2001–02
completed the trial. Thirty-two infants and children in the
control group in 1999–2000, 69 in 2000–01 and 56 in
2001–02 completed the trial. The characteristics of the
vaccine group and the control group were not statistically
different (Table 1).
Prophylactic efficacy
The numbers of influenza A infection patients were: four of
27 children (14.8%) in the vaccine group and four of 32
(12.5%) in the control group in the 1999/2000 influenza
season (P = 0.526) (Table 2); two of 72 (2.8%) in the vaccine

group and five of 69 (7.2%) in the control group in the 2000/
2001 influenza season; and two of 58 (3.4%) in the vaccine
group and five of 56 (7.2%) in the control group in the 2001/
2002 influenza season. The results in the latter two influenza
seasons were not statistically significant (P = 0.203, P = 0.205,
respectively) (Table 2). Attack rates of influenza A over the
three influenza seasons in the vaccine group and the control
group were, respectively, 5.1% (8 of 157) and 8.9% (14 of
157), which was statistically not significant (P = 0.117)
(Table 2).
Influenza patients
A total of 24 children were infected with influenza A (eight
in the vaccine group, 14 in the control group). The mean
(±SD) age of the patients infected with influenza A were
14.3 ± 5.7 months in the vaccine group and 15.7 ± 4.9 months
in the control group (P = 0.608). None of these patients
required hospitalization or developed serious influenza
complications.
Discussion
The attack rate of influenza A virus infection in 6–24 months
old healthy infants and children was not significantly
different between the vaccine group and the non-vaccine
group. That is to say, the inactivated influenza vaccine was of
little or no benefit in the prevention of influenza A virus
infection among these young children.
It is difficult to distinguish influenza virus infection from
other respiratory viruses infections, particularly respiratory
syncytial virus, which has clinical manifestations resembling
those of influenza, is prevalent in the winter, and is often
coincident with influenza.9,10 In the present study, to separate
the effects of cocirculating viruses from influenza virus A, an
enzyme immunoassay membrane test (Directigen FLU-A
test) was used for making a diagnosis of influenza infection.
The negative predictive value and the false-negative rate of
the test were 100% and 0%, respectively, and there was no
evidence of cross-reactivity with non-influenza A antigen.11
Hence, the reliability of the results of the test were
comparable to the other diagnostic methods such as virus
isolation.
Although sero responses of infants and young children
to the influenza vaccines were identified, the responses
vary with the vaccine immmunogen in this population.12 The
study of Innocent et al. showed that vaccination with
inactivated influenza A virus vaccine dose not invariably
induce detectable cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity in infants
6–24 months old.13 For these reasons or others, the prophylactic effect of the vaccine in 6–24 month old children may
be limited.
Recent studies have shown increased rates of influenzarelated hospitalizations among <24 months old children and
suggest that routine influenza vaccination should be considered
in these children.6,7 For this reason, influenza vaccination of
all children in this age group is encouraged when feasible in
the United States.1 The utility of the vaccine should be
considered from many perspectives. The prophylaxis effect
of the vaccine against influenza is one of the important
factors to consider in making a decision about recommending
the vaccine. The vaccine efficacy of reducing the risk for
influenza-related complications and hospitalization is also
important. However, it is uncertain whether influenza
vaccination is effective in preventing secondary complications or reducing the risk for influenza-related hospitalization
among 6–24 months old children, although the vaccination
among older persons can reduce the risk for hospitalization
and death.14,15
To justify influenza vaccination of healthy infants and
young children, a high benefit-risk ratio is required. Taking
these factors into consideration, together with the results
of the present study, additional studies to confirm the
vaccine benefit among infants and children <24 months of
age are needed before implementation of the proposed
recommendations.
Conclusion
We conclude that inactivated influenza vaccine did not
reduce the attack rate of influenza A virus infection in
6–24 months old children. This negative vaccine result
suggests that the strategy for controlling influenza viruses
infection in this age group may need to be different from that
in older children and adults.
