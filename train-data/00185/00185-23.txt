Background: This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and
safety of cold-adapted influenza vaccine, trivalent (CAIV-T) against
culture-confirmed influenza in children 12 to 36 months of age
during 2 consecutive influenza seasons at multiple sites in Asia.
Methods: In year 1, 3174 children 12 to 36 months of age were
randomized to receive 2 doses of CAIV-T (n  1900) or placebo
(n  1274) intranasally 28 days apart. In year 2, 2947 subjects
were rerandomized to receive 1 dose of CAIV-T or placebo.
Results: Mean age at enrollment was 23.5  7.4 months. In year 1,
efficacy of CAIV-T compared with placebo was 72.9% 95% confidence interval (CI): 62.8 – 80.5% against antigenically similar
influenza subtypes, and 70.1% (95% CI: 60.9 –77.3%) against any
strain. In year 2, revaccination with CAIV-T demonstrated significant efficacy against antigenically similar (84.3%; 95% CI: 70.1–
92.4%) and any (64.2%; 95% CI: 44.2–77.3%) influenza strains. In
year 1, fever, runny nose/nasal congestion, decreased activity and
appetite, and use of fever medication were more frequent with
CAIV-T after dose 1. Runny nose/nasal congestion after dose 2
(year 1) and dose 3 (year 2) and use of fever medication after dose
3 (year 2) were the only other events reported significantly more
frequently in CAIV-T recipients.
Conclusions: CAIV-T was well tolerated and effective in preventing culture-confirmed influenza illness over multiple and complex
influenza seasons in young children in Asia.

Young children are a very high-risk group for influenza
infection and related complications as well as being a
viral reservoir during an influenza season.1– 6 Despite the
variable efficacy of trivalent, inactivated influenza vaccine
(TIV) observed in children,7–9 especially younger, immunologically naive children,10 the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the United States Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention has recommended that children 6
months to 5 years of age be routinely vaccinated against
influenza.11
Although the burden of influenza among children in
tropical Asia appears similar to that elsewhere,12–14 a recent
report on influenza-related hospitalization rates in children in
Hong Kong demonstrated higher disease rates, exceeding
those for temperate regions.15 Other unique characteristics in
the region present considerable challenges to the development and effective implementation of an influenza vaccination policy in children.16 These include significant annual
variability in both influenza seasonality and circulating influenza viruses. In addition, influenza appears to be endemic in
some Asian areas with year-round infections when compared
with temperate regions where the disease occurs as distinct
seasonal outbreaks.17,18 With 2 of the past 3 pandemics
originating in the region, the need to reduce the burden of
circulating influenza is of major global public health significance.19 However, even among adults, TIV has not demonstrated significant protection against antigenically drifted influenza viruses.20 This represents a significant challenge to

the use of TIV in an environment of diverse circulating
strains and potentially limits its effectiveness as a public
health intervention among children in this region. Currently,
the World Health Organization (WHO) makes no specific
recommendations for strain composition of TIV for use in
tropical Asia.21
Live attenuated intranasal influenza vaccines have been
shown to elicit broad protective immune responses to influenza virus strains, including both systemic and specific mucosal antibodies.22 A frozen formulation of live attenuated
influenza virus vaccine (LAIV; FluMist, MedImmune, Gaithersburg, MD) has demonstrated protection against antigenically-drifted influenza in young children,23,24 and may offer
in this region a more appropriate alternative for this age
group. Therefore, the purpose of the trial reported here was to
evaluate the efficacy of the refrigerated formulation of LAIV
(cold-adapted influenza vaccine, trivalent; CAIV-T) against
culture-confirmed influenza in young children residing in
South, Southeast, and East Asia during multiple influenza
seasons over 2 years and to determine the durability and
breadth of that protection.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Design. This prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled, multicenter, crossover trial was conducted during
2 consecutive years at 16 sites in 8 regions (China, Hong
Kong, India, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan,
and Thailand) between September 30, 2000, and May 31,
2003. The study was conducted in accordance with the
principles of Good Clinical Practice and the Declaration of
Helsinki. Approvals for the original study protocol and all
subsequent amendments were obtained from all Human Ethics Committees, Institutional Review Boards, and any regional or national Ethics Committees at participating centers
as applicable, before the commencement of any protocolrelated activities. Written informed consent was obtained
from the parents or legal guardians of all infants before
enrollment into the study.
Participants. Children aged 12 to 36 months at enrollment
who were in good health as determined by medical history,
physical examination, and clinical judgment were eligible.
Subjects with serious chronic disease, including progressive
neurologic disease, Down’s syndrome or other cytogenetic
disorder, or known or suspected disease of the immune
system, and those with documented history of hypersensitivity to egg or egg protein were excluded. All subjects who
completed the primary series of CAIV-T or placebo in year 1
and who continued to be free of exclusion criteria were
eligible for rerandomization in year 2.
Vaccine and Placebo. CAIV-T reassortant vaccine strains
were supplied by MedImmune (Mountain View, CA), which
consisted of the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA)
antigens of the A/New Caledonia/20/99 (H1N1), A/Sydney/
05/97 (H3N2), and B/Yamanashi/166/98 influenza strains for
year one and A/New Caledonia/20/99 (H1N1), A/Panama/
2007/99 (H3N2), and B/Yamanashi/166/98 influenza strains
for year two. The refrigerated formulation of CAIV-T vaccine was manufactured and released by Wyeth (Marietta,
PA). Each 0.2-mL dose contained approximately 107 median
tissue culture infectious doses or equivalent fluorescent focus
units of each 6:2 reassortant virus strain. The vaccine viruses
were grown in specific pathogen-free eggs, purified, and
formulated with sucrose-phosphate-glutamate, acid-hydrolyzed porcine gelatin, and arginine as stabilizers. The vaccine
contained no preservatives. Placebo consisted of sterile physiological saline manufactured by Wyeth (Marietta, PA). Vaccine and placebo were frozen and shipped to the study sites,
where they were stored at 2°C to 8°C until just before
intranasal administration using a spray applicator (approximately 0.1 mL in each nostril). Both CAIV-T and placebo
were supplied in identically packaged sprayers; neither the
study subjects, their parent(s)/guardian(s), or the clinical
personnel were aware of the treatment being administered.
Vaccine composition was planned to be antigenically
representative of the WHO recommendations for the Northern Hemisphere for each year. However, in year 1, because of
industry-wide technical problems in the production of the
A/H3N2/Moscow/10/99-like virus, A/H3N2/Panama/2007/99
vaccine virus, the recommended strain was replaced with
A/H3N2/Sydney/05/97.25 This decision was based on the
antigenic similarity of the hemagglutinin (HA) antigens, a
WHO report indicating that A/H3N2/Sydney/05/97-like viruses were circulating before the 2000 –2001 season,26 and
previous clinical trials with the frozen formulation of LAIV
that had demonstrated efficacy against mismatched influenza
A/H3N2 virus.23
In year 2, because of delays in manufacture, the recommended B vaccine component, B/Victoria/504/2000 (B/
Sichuan/379/99-like), was replaced with B/Yamanashi/166/
98. Therefore, the B component of the second-year vaccine
formulation was not antigenically representative of the
B/Victoria/504/2000 (B/Sichuan/379/99-like) virus recommended by the WHO for the upcoming influenza season.
In year 1, subjects were randomized 3:2 (CAIV-T:
placebo) to receive 2 doses of CAIV-T or 2 doses of placebo
at least 28 days apart using a randomization schedule generated by Wyeth. In year 2, subjects were rerandomized in a 1:1
ratio to receive a single dose of CAIV-T or placebo without
consideration of their group assignment in the first year. A
schematic representation of the study design is presented in
the online only supplementary materials available at the
journal’s web site. Fig. S1: Subjects were randomized 3:2
(CAIV-T:placebo) to receive 2 doses of CAIV-T or 2 doses
of placebo in year 1. In year 2, subjects were re-randomized
in a 1:1 ratio to receive a single dose of CAIV-T or placebo
without consideration of their group assignment in the first
year.
Surveillance for Influenza Illness. Surveillance for influenzalike illness was based on weekly telephone contacts, clinic
visits, or home visits, beginning on the 11th day after receipt
of the first dose of study treatment and continued for 2 years
until the end of the study. A nasal swab sample was obtained
if subjects exhibited any predefined symptoms considered
associated with an influenza-like illness.27 Influenza seasons
were defined by: (1) the first and last positive cultures of the
influenza season if there were sufficient number of cases of
culture-confirmed influenza in a given country to identify a
Tam et al The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal • Volume 26, Number 7, July 2007
620 © 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins
seasonal pattern, with random isolates occurring outside of
this window being excluded, or (2) if no pattern was evident
using influenza cultures, country-specific data from government sources or WHO surveillance data were used.
Influenza-positive specimens obtained by culture were
identified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(Atlanta, GA). Additional strain and serotype identification was
performed by Wyeth (Pearl River, NY) using virus genotype
(years 1 and 2) and virus sequence (year 2) methods.28,29
Efficacy estimates were based on illness episodes occurring during the influenza seasons as defined for each
country during blind review and based on the weekly number
of episodes of culture-confirmed influenza.
Immunogenicity. A subset of 111 subjects at 5 sites participated in an immunogenicity evaluation. The same subjects
did not necessarily participate in the cohort in both years.
Blood samples were obtained before and after the second
vaccination in year 1, and before and after vaccination in year
2. Samples were assayed for antibodies to influenza A/H1N1,
A/H3N2, and B strains by hemagglutination inhibition assay
(HAI). Reference viruses used for year 1 samples were
A/New Caledonia/20/99 (H1), A/Sydney/5/97 (H3), and
B/Yamanashi/166/98 and for year 2 samples were A/New
Caledonia/20/99 (H1), A/Sydney/5/97 (H3), and B/Victoria/
2/87. Seroconversion was defined as a 4-fold increase in
antibody titer.30,31
Safety Assessment. After administration of CAIV-T or placebo, parent(s)/legal guardian(s) recorded prompted postvaccination daily symptom information for 11 consecutive days
including the day of administration. Other adverse events
(AEs) occurring within 11 days after any study dose administration were also collected.
An AE was defined as any clinically significant event,
including but not limited to (1) events requiring prescription
or nonprescription medication within 11 days of vaccination,
(2) any event requiring an unscheduled healthcare provider
visit and/or consultation within 11 days of vaccination, (3)
events resulting in study termination, and (4) any other
clinically significant event occurring at any time during the
course of the study. Serious adverse events (SAEs), including
hospitalizations, were monitored from enrollment until the
end of the study.
Statistical Analysis. The sample size calculation assumed
rates of culture-confirmed influenza in the placebo and
CAIV-T groups (12% and 3%, respectively) as previously
reported,23 and a subject discontinuation rate of 60% or less
over 2 years. A sample size of 3000 subjects (1800 in the
CAIV-T group and 1200 in the placebo group) permitted at
least 90% power to demonstrate 45% efficacy at the 0.05
significance level.
The randomization schedule for each year was generated by Wyeth Vaccines Research. In year 1, vaccine and
placebo were labeled with 1 of 5 treatment codes, 3 of which
corresponded to CAIV-T treatment and 2 to placebo, to
ensure blinding with a 3:2 ratio. At enrollment, each subject
was assigned the next sequential subject number and received
study product of the treatment code assigned to that subject
number according to a preprinted randomization allocation
list. In year 2, randomization at each site was accomplished
using an interactive voice response system. Trial personnel
telephoned the interactive voice response system to obtain a
6-digit vaccine identification number corresponding to nasal
sprays mailed to that site and numbered according to a
predetermined randomization list.
The per-protocol (PP) population in year 1 included all
randomized subjects who received all doses of assigned
treatment and who remained in the study for at least 15 days
after receiving the second dose of CAIV-T or placebo. The
PP population in year 2 included all rerandomized subjects
who received their assigned treatment and remained in the
study for at least 15 days after vaccination in year 2. The
intent-to-treat population in year 1 included all subjects who
were enrolled in the study and received at least 1 dose of
study treatment. The year 2 intent-to-treat population included all subjects rerandomized in year 2.
The primary efficacy end point was the first episode
of culture-confirmed influenza illness caused by a subtype
antigenically similar to that in the vaccine after receipt of
the second dose of study vaccine or placebo during year 1
in the PP population. Secondary efficacy end points included the first episode of culture-confirmed influenza illness
caused by any influenza virus subtype after receipt of the
second dose of study vaccine or placebo during year 1 and the
first episode of culture-confirmed influenza caused by subtypes antigenically similar to vaccine components after completion of a primary series in year 1 and a single dose in year
2. An additional proposed secondary end point was to evaluate all episodes of clinically defined AOM, febrile AOM,
and influenza-associated AOM. However, there were too few
cases to provide adequate analysis. Immunologic seroconversion as measured by serum HAI was also evaluated. Geometric mean fold rise is defined as the relative increase in
geometric antibody titers after vaccination over corresponding prevaccination titers.
Vaccine efficacy against culture-confirmed influenza
was defined as 1  IV/IC, where IV is the case incidence for
the CAIV-T group, and IC is similarly defined for the placebo
group. For each estimate of vaccine efficacy, 95% confidence
intervals (CI) were determined using the binomial distribution conditional on the total number of cases observed.
All subjects who received 1 dose of study vaccine
were evaluated for safety. Reactogenicity events were summarized for each dose and compared using a 2-sided Fisher’s
exact test without adjustment for multiple comparisons. AEs
within 11 days after dose administration were summarized.
RESULTS
Study Participants
Enrollment occurred during a 10-week period beginning September 30, 2000; 3174 subjects (CAIV-T, n  1900;
placebo, n  1274) were randomized. Participant flow is
summarized in Figure 1. The year 1 PP efficacy population
consisted of 2764 subjects (1653 CAIV-T, 1111 placebo).
Demographic characteristics of this population are presented
in Table 1.
In year 2, 2947 subjects were rerandomized to receive
either a single dose of CAIV-T or placebo (Fig. 1), adminThe Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal • Volume 26, Number 7, July 2007 CAIV-T in Children
© 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins 621
istered during a 4- to 6-week period beginning November 9,
2001. The year 2 PP efficacy population consisted of 2527
subjects. An additional 69 subjects from year 1 were not
randomized in year 2 but were followed-up for safety and
influenza surveillance throughout year 2. A more detailed
summary of participant flow, including reasons for exclusion
from the PP analysis in years 1 and 2 is presented in the
web-only supplementary materials (Fig. S2: available online
only: Participant flow, including reasons for exclusion from
the per protocol analysis).
Culture-Confirmed Influenza
The pattern of influenza seasons in participating regions
during the 2-year period from October 2000 through October
2002 is summarized in Figure 2.
Circulating Strain Variants. A high percentage (29.2%) of
year 1 influenza B viruses were considered antigenically
distinct from the vaccine, whereas 99.2% of circulating influenza A/H1N1 viruses were antigenically similar to those in
the vaccine. All B cultures in year 1 that were classified as
antigenically similar were identified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as being similar to B/Sichuan/
379/99, a strain that is related but antigenically distinguishable from the year 1 vaccine strain, B/Yamanashi. Over 77%
of year 2 influenza B viruses were antigenically distinct from
those of the vaccine. Circulating strains isolated from participating subjects at all sites by month are summarized in the
lower panel of Figure 2.
Vaccine Efficacy: Year 1. Per-protocol vaccine efficacy
against culture-confirmed influenza in year 1 is summarized
in Table 2. The incidence of influenza caused by strains
antigenically similar to vaccine was 3.4% and 12.5% in the
CAIV-T and placebo groups, respectively. Overall efficacy of
CAIV-T against influenza viruses antigenically similar to
those in the vaccine was 72.9% (95% CI: 62.8 – 80.5%).
Statistically significant vaccine efficacy was observed against
all 3 circulating viruses antigenically similar to the vaccine,
influenza A/H1N1 (80.9%) and AH3N2 (90.0%), and B
(44.3%). Overall, vaccine efficacy against any influenza
strain was 70.1% (95% CI: 60.9 –77.3%), with vaccine efficacy against any A/H1N1, A/H3N2, or B strain being similar
to that against viruses antigenically similar to the vaccine
(81.1%, 84.3% and 43.1%, respectively). Only 0.8% of
CAIV-T recipients had confirmed cases of influenza caused
by drifted strains (n  14 cases, all influenza B) and 1.6% of
placebo recipients (n  18 cases, 17 B and 1 A/H1). Although it did not achieve statistical significance, vaccine
efficacy against all influenza strains that were confirmed to be
antigenically dissimilar to the vaccine was 47.7% (95% CI:
11.2–75.9%).
Durability of Protection. Malaysia and the Philippines experienced late influenza outbreaks in year 1. Malaysia experienced an initial influenza outbreak of primarily A/H3N2 and
B strains between October 26, 2000 and March 1, 2001; this
outbreak was then followed by an outbreak of A/H1N1
between August 7, 2001 and November 16, 2001. This
second outbreak occurred 7.5 to 12.5 months after the second
vaccine dose in year 1 and vaccine efficacy was 85.1% (95%
CI: 28.2–98.4%) against antigenically similar strains. In the
Philippines, there was 1 week between November 13, 2000
and November 20, 2000 in which there were no cases of

influenza in the PP population. Subsequently, an A/H1N1,
A/H3N2, and B outbreak occurred between June 7, 2001 and
November 26, 2001. This outbreak occurred 5.5 to 13 months
after the second dose and vaccine efficacy was 69.4% (95%
CI: 42.4 – 84.5%) against antigenically similar strains. A
combined analysis of these 2 seasons in Malaysia and the
Philippines yielded a vaccine efficacy of 72.9% (95% CI:
51.5– 85.5%).
Vaccine Efficacy: Year 2. Pairwise comparisons of the 4
study groups were performed to highlight the effects of
different vaccination regimens on vaccine efficacy against
antigenically similar and any influenza viruses in year 2
(Table 3).
Efficacy of 2 Doses. In the United States, a 2-dose regimen of
the frozen formulation of CAIV-T (FluMist, MedImmune) is
indicated for previously-unvaccinated children 5 through 8
years of age, and a single dose is indicated in subsequent
years. In the current study of Asian children 12 to 36
months of age at enrollment, annual vaccination during 2
successive years (2 doses of CAIV-T in year 1 and 1 dose of
CAIV-T in year 2) provided significant efficacy against both
antigenically similar (84.3%; 95% CI: 70.1–92.4%) and any
(64.2%; 95% CI: 44.2–77.3%) influenza strain compared
with no vaccination (2 doses of placebo in year 1 and 1 dose
of placebo in year 2). Efficacy against antigenically similar
A/H3N2 influenza strains was 86.3% (95% CI: 71.4 –94.1%).
There were insufficient cases to accurately assess and draw
conclusions for efficacy against antigenically similar or any
A/H1 and B subtypes.
Revaccination in the second year (CAIV-T/CAIV-T)
yielded greater efficacy against antigenically similar influenza strains than vaccination in the first year only (CAIV-T/
placebo). The estimated efficacy benefit of a second-year
revaccination against antigenically similar strains compared
with vaccination in the first year only was 64.2% (95% CI:
28.9 – 83.2%).
Durability of Protection. The persistence of protection afforded by 2 doses of CAIV-T was demonstrated comparing
the CAIV-T/placebo and placebo/placebo groups. The overall
efficacy of 56.2% (95% CI: 30.5–72.7%) against antigenically similar strains indicates that a primary series of 2 doses
of CAIV-T elicits an immune response capable of protecting
against influenza for 2 years in many but not all children.
Efficacy of a Single Dose. A full series of vaccinations over
2 years (CAIV-T/CAIV-T) was more protective than a single
dose of CAIV-T in year 2 (placebo/CAIV-T). Relative efficacy against culture-confirmed influenza subtypes antigenically similar to the vaccine was 60.9% (95% CI: 15.9 –
82.6%). However, a single dose of CAIV-T in year 2
(placebo/CAIV-T) was superior to no vaccination at all (placebo/placebo) with an efficacy of 59.9% (95% CI: 31.3–
77.4%) against antigenically similar strains.
Immunogenicity Assessment
The immunogenicity results are presented in Table 4.
After 2 doses in year 1, CAIV-T elicited significant antiinfluenza antibody responses compared with placebo. Seroconversion rates were higher among seronegative subjects for
all influenza strains.
For year 2, the seroconversion rates and fold-increases
in geometric mean titers were statistically significant only for
treatment groups that received CAIV-T in year 2 (Table 5),
irrespective of serologic status before vaccination or the
vaccination received in year 1. Seronegative subjects receiving CAIV-T and tested for antibody in year 2 had statistically
significant fold-increases in geometric mean titers for all
virus subtypes.
Safety Evaluation
Reactogenicity events are summarized in Table 6.
There was a significantly higher frequency of fever 37.5°C
(22.0% versus 17.6%; P  0.004), runny nose/nasal congestion (62.0% versus 52.0%; P  0.001), decreased activity
(13.4% versus 10.7%; P  0.026), decreased appetite (24.2%
versus 19.7%; P  0.003), and use of fever medication
(21.3% versus 18.4%; P  0.044) after the first dose of
CAIV-T in year 1, when compared with placebo. There was
no significant difference between treatment groups for fever
38.6%. After dose 2 in year 1, runny nose/nasal congestion
was the only event that was reported by a significantly higher
(P  0.030) proportion of CAIV-T (49.8%) than placebo
recipients (45.6%).
Similar results were observed after vaccination in year
2, with a higher incidence of runny nose/nasal congestion
(62.0% versus 55.4%, P  0.001) and use of fever medication (P  0.019) in CAIV-T recipients.

ported year 1 SAEs were bronchospasm (7 CAIV-T, 3 placebo), bronchitis (3 CAIV-T, 2 placebo), and rhinitis (3
CAIV-T, 0 placebo). There was only 1 reported SAE in year
2 in a child who was hospitalized with pneumonia 6 days
after receiving CAIV-T. Only one subject discontinued because of a safety-related event: a 20-month-old female developed fever that persisted for 3 days and was judged to be
possibly related to study medication, 2 days after receiving
the first dose of CAIV-T in year 1. There were 2 deaths in the
study, both in year 1. One child died of an unknown cause
after a brief illness approximately 4 months after receiving
the second dose of placebo. The second child died of an
accidental drowning 15 days after receipt of the first dose of
CAIV-T. Neither death was considered related to study vaccine.
DISCUSSION
This clinical trial is a comprehensive evaluation of the
efficacy of live attenuated influenza vaccine in young children. The trial has established that the rates of cultureconfirmed influenza in young children across the region are
similar to those reported in the United States using the same
illness criteria,23,27 and is the first demonstration for any
influenza vaccine of efficacy against all 3 influenza virus
subtypes (A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and B) circulating during the
same influenza season. Further, in 2 regions, 2 doses of
CAIV-T administered in year 1 conferred protection against
antigenically similar A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and B strains that
was comparable to the efficacy seen in the overall study,
despite the fact that the outbreaks occurred 5.5 to 13 months
after the second vaccine dose. Additionally, significant protection was demonstrated against antigenically similar influenza A/H3N2 virus over a second year of the trial (up to 23
months after the second dose). However, the decline in the
level of protection over time, and the beneficial effect of
another dose in the second year, clearly supports the value of
annual vaccination.
Although CAIV-T demonstrated efficacy against all
community-acquired influenza strains, this study was not
designed to specifically evaluate efficacy against antigenically drifted strains. Indeed, statistical significance was not
achieved for efficacy against influenza caused by viral strains
that were confirmed to be dissimilar to the vaccine perhaps
because of the small number of cases in this study. However,
other studies have shown efficacy against mismatched influenza strains.23,32
As observed with the frozen formulation of CAIV-T in
older children, the refrigerated formulation of CAIV-T was
highly effective in eliciting serum antibody responses as
measured by HAI, with the strongest responses detected in
children considered seronegative for influenza. After vaccination in year 2, increased seroconversion and HA titers to
A/H1N1 and B strains were observed only in CAIV-T recipients. Increases observed in subjects who were seropositive in
year 2 before vaccination, illustrate the ability of CAIV-T to
provide an immune boost on subsequent immunization and
confirm that the ability to develop an immune response is not
adversely affected by prior vaccination with that strain.
Administration of multiple doses of CAIV-T to chilTABLE 6.

After the first dose in year 1, the incidence of reactogenicity
events such as runny nose/nasal congestion, decreased appetite, decreased activity, and the use of fever medications
were statistically greater in CAIV-T recipients than the
background rates reported by placebo recipients. However,
the relative differences in incidence were low, ranging
from 10% for nasal congestion to 2.7% for decreased
activity. SAEs were infrequent and similar between
CAIV-T and placebo recipients.
Our findings are consistent with other reports of the
efficacy and safety of CAIV-T in young children.33–35 In a
placebo-controlled trial of healthy children 6 to 36 months
of age attending day care at sites throughout Europe and
Israel, CAIV-T reduced the incidence of influenza caused by
antigenically similar influenza strains by 85% after 2 doses of
vaccine in year 1 and by 89% after a single dose of vaccine
in year 2.33 In a comparative study with TIV in children 6 to
71 months of age with a history of recurrent respiratory tract
infections, CAIV-T resulted in 52.7% fewer cases of influenza caused by strains antigenically similar to the vaccine
than did TIV.35 CAIV-T was well tolerated in both of these
studies and runny nose/nasal discharge was the only reactogenicity event that occurred significantly more frequently
with CAIV-T than placebo. In large studies in young children, CAIV-T was associated with statistically increased
rates of wheezing and, in certain subsets, with increased rates
of all-cause hospitalization.36,37 In the present study the
incidence of wheezing and of SAEs including hospitalization
was rare and similar among recipients of CAIV-T or placebo.
In other studies specifically conducted in children with
asthma or a history of respiratory tract infections, no significant increase in wheezing or other serious adverse outcomes
was observed.34,35
The diversity of seasonality and circulating strains in
Asia, the absence of clear guidance on vaccine composition
for the region, and the variable efficacy of TIV in this age
group suggests the need for an influenza vaccine that can be
easily administered and provide broad protection against
circulating influenza viruses over more than 1 year. CAIV-T
was demonstrated to be a versatile, durable, and highly
efficacious intervention in the control of influenza among
young children in tropical and temperate regions in Asia.
