Abstract
To evaluate the effectiveness of a virosomal subunit influenza vaccine in preventing influenza-related illnesses and its social and economic
consequences in children aged 3–14 years, a prospective cohort study was carried out during the 2004–2005 influenza season in 11 private
pediatric clinics in the Barcelona metropolitan area. One dose of a virosomal subunit inactivated influenza vaccine (Inflexal V® Berna)
was given during September and October 2004 to healthy children aged 3–14 years attended in 5 of the 11 clinics. Who comprised the
vaccinated cohort (n = 966). The non-vaccinated cohort (n = 985) was comprised of children attended in the other six clinics. Informed consent
was obtained from all parents. The follow up was performed between 1 November 2004 and 31 March 2005. Using a self-administered
questionnaire, information was collected from parents or guardians on any type of acute, febrile respiratory illness suffered by their children
during the study period, including antibiotic use, and absence from school or work-loss of parents as a result of the illness. RT-PCR (influenza
A + B + C) was carried out on pharyngeal and nasal samples obtained from children attended by pediatricians during this period in these
clinics with the following symptoms: fever ≥ 38.5◦ lasting at least 72 h, cough or sore throat (influenza-like illness). Adjusted vaccination
effectiveness was 58.6% (95% CI 49.2–66.3) in preventing acute febrile respiratory illnesses, 75.1% (95% CI 61.0–84.1) in preventing cases
of influenza-like illnesses and 88.4% (95% CI 49.2–97.3) in preventing laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza A. The adjusted vaccination
effectiveness in reducing antibiotic use (18.6%, 95% CI −4.2 to 3.64), absence from school (57.8%, 95% CI 47.9–65.9) and work-loss of
parents (33.3%, 95% CI 8.9–51.2) in children affected by an acute febrile respiratory illness was somewhat lower. Vaccination of children
aged 3–14 years in pediatric practices with one dose of virosomal subunit inactivated influenza vaccine has the potential to considerably
reduce the health and social burdens caused by influenza-related illnesses.

tions if they contract the disease and to groups who could
transmit the infection to these high risk groups [1].
Recent research has shown that the health burden of
influenza in children, in terms of incidence and hospitalizations, is high, even greater than in the elderly [2–4]. In
addition, it has been shown that schoolchildren are the most
important element of influenza transmission in the community, especially at the beginning of epidemic outbreaks. Chil0264-410X/$ – see front matter © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

dren shed the virus for approximately twice as long and at
higher concentrations than adults. In fact, during the preliminary stage of influenza epidemics, cases in schoolchildren
predominate and in all epidemics school absenteeism precedes occupational absenteeism [4,5].
For these reasons, support, hesitant at first, began for the
recommendation of annual routine vaccination of infants and
young children in order to protect them from the complications of influenza, limit the circulation of the virus, and, indirectly, protect the rest of the population [6,7]. In the United
States, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of
the CDC recommended annual vaccination of children aged
6–24 months beginning in fall 2004 [8].
The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the inactivated virosomal subunit influenza vaccine
in preventing influenza-related illnesses and its social and
economic consequences in healthy children aged 3–14 years
without risk factors.
2. Methods
A prospective cohort study was carried out during the
2004–2005 influenza season in 11 private pediatric clinics
in the Barcelona metropolitan area.
The study was approved by the Ethics and Research Committees of the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona.
The influenza vaccine was administered to healthy children aged 3–14 years attended in 5 of the 11 clinics and whose
parents gave informed consent and agreed to participate in the
study. These children were included in the vaccinated cohort.
The non-vaccinated cohort was comprised of healthy children attended in the other six clinics whose parents agreed to
participate after informed consent.
The selection of children for the vaccinated and nonvaccinated cohort was made according to the following
criteria—(A) Inclusion criteria: healthy boy or girl without
risk factors, age between 3 and 14 years, informed consent
from parents or guardians. (B) Exclusion criteria: influenza
vaccination during the previous 6 months, specific contraindication for the influenza vaccine, acute disease, a history of
allergy to eggs or severe atopia, fever of >38◦, sensitivity
to any component of the vaccine, a history of any adverse
reaction to the influenza vaccine, treatment with immunosuppressive drugs (including systemic corticosteroids), immunodeficiency (including leukemia, cancer, seropositive HIV),
being a recipient of blood transfusions or immunoglobulins
during the previous 3 months.
One dose of a virosomal subunit inactivated influenza vaccine (Inflexal® V Berna) [9–11] was given during September
and October 2004 to the children included in the vaccinated
cohort. The follow up of vaccinated and non-vaccinated children was performed between 1 November 2004 and 31 March
2005.
Using a self-administered questionnaire, information was
collected from parents or guardians on any type of acute,
febrile respiratory illness suffered by their children during the study period, including antibiotic use, and absence
from school or work-loss of parents as a result of the
illness.
RT-PCR[12](influenza A + B + C) was carried out on pharyngeal and nasal samples obtained from children attended
by pediatricians during this period in these clinics with the
following symptoms: fever ≥ 38.5◦ lasting at least 72 h and
cough or sore throat (influenza-like illness). Nasal and pharyngeal swabs were obtained during the first 4 days of the clinical symptoms. They were sent (in viral transport medium)
and processed in the virology laboratory in less than 24 h. A
RT-PCR for influenza virus A, B and C was carried out as
previously described [12].
Data from the questionnaires were computerized and analyzed by Chiltern International (Madrid).
The effectiveness of the vaccination (VE) was calculated
using the formula: VE = 1 − RR, where RR is the relative
risk resulting from the division of the incidence rate in the
vaccinated cohort by the incidence rate in the non-vaccinated
cohort [13]. The 95% confidence intervals (CI) of the VE
were calculated using the Taylor series [14]. To correct the
effects on the end points of the differences in age and sex
distribution and in number of the members of the family unit

3. Results
A total of 966 children were included in the vaccinated
cohort and 985 in the non-vaccinated cohort. Table 1 shows
the demographic characteristics of both groups.
The incidence of acute febrile respiratory illnesses
reported by parents was significantly higher in the nonvaccinated cohort (429.4 per 1000 children) than in the vaccinated cohort (233 per 1000 children). The same occurred
for the incidence of cases of influenza-like illness (102 per
1000 in non-vaccinated and 26 per 1000 in vaccinated children) and laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza A (rates of
18.3 per 1000 in non-vaccinated and 2.1 per 1000 in vaccinated children) attended by pediatricians (Table 2). Adjusted
vaccination effectiveness was 58.6% (95% CI 49.2–66.3) in
preventing acute febrile respiratory illnesses, 75.1% (95%
CI 61.0–84.1) in preventing cases of influenza-like illnesses
and 88.4% (95% CI 49.2–97.3) in preventing laboratoryconfirmed cases of influenza A (Table 2).
The adjusted vaccination effectiveness in reducing antibiotic use (18.6%, 95% CI −4.2 to 3.64), absence from school
(57.8%, 95% CI 47.9–65.9) and work-loss of parents (33.3%,
95% CI 8.9–51.2) in children affected by an acute febrile respiratory illness was somewhat lower (Table 3).
4. Discussion
This prospective cohort study is the first to evaluate
the protective effectiveness of the inactivated virosomal
influenza vaccination (one dose) administered routinely by
pediatricians in children aged 3–14 years. It is also the
first study to evaluate the protection of this vaccine against
laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza. The effectiveness
for this end point was very high (88.4%).
Principi et al. [15] evaluated the protective efficacy of two
doses of the vaccine in children aged 2–5 years in a controlled
clinical trial and found a protection against febrile respiratory
illnesses of 26.4%, lower than the 58.6% found in the present
study.
The degree of protective efficacy of the inactivated
influenza vaccine (protection under ideal conditions in a
L. Salleras et al. / Vaccine 24 (2006) 6638–6642 6641
controlled clinical trial) or that of the effectiveness of the vaccination (protection conferred in real clinical practice in an
observational study) in children may vary for various reasons.
These include: the degree of matching between the influenza
virus strains circulating and those included in the vaccine;
the size of the influenza epidemic during the study season;
the specificity of the end point evaluated and the number of
doses administered [1,16,17]. Studies have shown that the
administration of two doses improves the immunogenicity of
the inactivated influenza vaccine, above all in the first season
that the vaccine is administered and in the youngest children
[1,16,17]. In fact, in the United States, two doses are recommended for the primary vaccination of children aged under 9
years [1]. In Europe, this recommendation is only made for
children under 3 years of age [11].
In Catalonia (Spain) during the 2004–2005 influenza
season, matching between the circulating and vaccine
strains was not very high [18]. The influenza epidemiological surveillance system recorded the circulation of
influenza virus strains antigenically similar to the reference virus A/Finland/486/04 (H3N2), which is similar
to the vaccine strain A/California/7/04 recently recommended for inclusion in the vaccine for the influenza season 2005–2006, but differed from the recommended vaccine
strain A/Fujian/411/2002 (H3N2) for the season 2004–2005.
Our results show that, even when matching between circulating and vaccine strains is not optimal, influenza vaccination
provides high levels of effectiveness, at least when vaccines
with enhanced immunogenicity, such as virosomal vaccines,
are used [10,19].
We evaluated both very specific endpoints (PCRconfirmed influenza) and other less specific ones (influenzalike illness and acute febrile respiratory illnesses). The effectiveness of the vaccine was greater for the most specific
endpoint, but all endpoints evaluated showed the protective
effectiveness of the vaccination.
The results show that a single dose of the virosomal vaccine is sufficient to achieve good levels of vaccination effectiveness in children aged 3–14 years.
We found, our results are substantially better than those
found in other studies evaluating the efficacy (controlled
clinical trials) or effectiveness (prospective cohort studies),
carried out using traditional inactivated vaccines.
Zangwill and Belshe [20] made a pooled analysis of five
controlled clinical trials carried out in the United States in
which the endpoint was laboratory-confirmed influenza and
in which two doses of vaccine were administered to children
in the vaccinated group. They found a vaccine efficacy of
63% (95% CI 45–70), with efficacy in the individual studies
varying between 12 and 83%.
Meta-analyses of clinical trials published in English language journals have been carried out by Jefferson et al. [21]
and Negri et al. [22]. When the end point was laboratoryconfirmed influenza and two doses of vaccine were administered (eight studies in the Jefferson meta-analysis and six
in that of Negri fulfilled these criteria), vaccine efficacy was
65% in both meta-analyses. When the end point was the less
specific influenza-like illness, vaccine efficacy fell to 33% in
the Negri analysis (eight studies included), but remained at
62% in the Jefferson analysis (only four studies included).
Jefferson et al. [21] also performed a meta-analysis of
the results of observational studies published in English and
Russian that evaluated the effectiveness of the inactivated
influenza vaccination administered to children in real conditions of pediatric primary health care practice. When the
endpoint was laboratory-confirmed influenza (six studies) the
effectiveness was 58%. When the endpoint was influenza-like
illness (nine studies) the effectiveness was 57%.
Ritzwoller et al. [23] have recently published a prospective cohort study in children attended by the Kaiser Permanente of Colorado. Two endpoints (influenza-like illness
and influenza–pneumonia) and two vaccination schedules
(one or two doses) were evaluated. The effectiveness against
influenza-like illness was 23% in children aged 6 months
to 8 years vaccinated with two doses. In children vaccinated with one dose the results were not statistically significant. The effectiveness of the two-dose schedule against
influenza–pneumonia was 51% in children aged 6 months to
8 years, but only 23% in children receiving one dose.
Our study also evaluated the effect of the inactivated virosomal influenza vaccine in reducing the economic and social
consequences of influenza. The results obtained showed that
vaccination of children aged 3–14 years in pediatric practices
with one dose of virosomal subunit inactivated influenza vaccine has the potential to considerably reduce the economic
and social burdens (antibiotic consumption, school absenteeism and work absenteeism) caused by influenza-related
illnesses. Notably, the reduction in antibiotic consumption
was not statistically significant after the adjustment of the
results by logistic regression analysis.
The economic and social benefits of the inactivated
influenza vaccination in children found in the present study
are similar to those obtained by Principi et al. in Italy, who
found a reduction of 32% in the number of antibiotic prescriptions, 48% in school absenteeism and 33% of work
absenteeism due to mothers caring for sick children [15,24],
and are also similar to the results of another European controlled clinical trial [25].
Like all observational epidemiological studies, the present
study may have been susceptible to bias [26]. For example, unlike a blinded study, where the pediatrician does not
know the vaccination status of the children included, there
may have been an erroneous evaluation of the end point
“influenza-like illness”, with pediatricians tending to make
more diagnoses of this end point in non-vaccinated children.
However, this could not have occurred with the end point
“laboratory-confirmed influenza”, as the laboratory staff performing the PCR analysis did not know the vaccination status
of the children.
The availability of inactivated influenza vaccines with
high levels of effectiveness provided by a single dose is a fundamental requirement for possible future strategies of routine
6642 L. Salleras et al. / Vaccine 24 (2006) 6638–6642
pediatric vaccination. Although high levels of vaccination
coverage in children at high risk is extremely important, a
recent study by Peltola et al. in Finland has shown that most
of the children admitted to the hospital due to influenza or
its complications during the period 1980–1999 were previously healthy children who would not have been vaccinated
with the strategy of vaccination of only high-risk children
[27]. As for other vaccinations, such as hepatitis B and hepatitis A, only routine vaccination will provide the maximum
benefit.
