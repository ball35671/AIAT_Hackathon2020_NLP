Summary: An outbreak of influenza occurred at the end of the 2001-2 winter season in
a highly-vaccinated, semi-enclosed, religious community. On the basis of retrospective
self reporting, 43% met the case definition (151/350) and 81% (25/31) of throat swabs
from cases were polymerase chain reaction (PCR) -positive for influenza A (H3N2). The
risk of developing influenza in people aged 65 or more was lower than that of children
aged 2 years and under (odds ratio 0.1, 95% confidence interval 0.02 to 0.38). The risk of
developing symptoms of influenza was not significantly different between people who
had been vaccinated in the United Kingdom and those who had not been vaccinated (OR
1.14, CI 0.41 to 3.14). Chronic disease was an independent risk factor for developing
symptoms of influenza (OR 1.9, CI 1 to 3.63). Timing of the outbreak, the age structure
and mode of communal living may have influenced the efficacy of the influenza vaccine,
which was well matched to circulating strains at the time of the outbreak. It is important
to consider the diagnosis of influenza even in a highly-vaccinated community.

Introduction
The explosive spread of influenza within closed
communities is well documented1. An average
attack rate of 43% was reported for nursing home
outbreaks2
 and attack rates in schools of 23-63%,
in a navy ship of 42%, and in cruise ships of 2-6%
have been reported3-7. There are also reports of
outbreaks in closed communities that have been
vaccinated against influenza, including military,
nursing home, and school populations4,8-11.
Influenza A (H3N2) infections generally
produce more severe illness than influenza B or
influenza A (HIN1)12. In adults, fever is the most
prominent sign of infection and the commonest
symptoms are cough, malaise, chills, and
headache 12 . In children, the commonest
manifestations are sudden onset of fever,
headache, cough, and sore throat 12 . The
complications of influenza are principally
respiratory, but deaths may be associated with a
wide range of underlying conditions 13. Attack
rates are highest among children and teenagers,
who are the most important group for the
transmission of influenza in communities 1 .
Mortality increases with age and is associated with
chronic disease, which is the principal risk factor
for severe influenza1.

This paper describes an influenza A (H3N2)
outbreak in a highly-vaccinated, semi-enclosed
religious community in rural England. There were
no reports of an increase in influenza-like illness in
the local population outside the community, although
there was mixing with visitors from sister
communities in the United States (USA) and Australia
and elsewhere. The outbreak occurred at the end of
a quiet influenza season, in which weekly
consultation rates with sentinel general practioners
remained below baseline (less than 50 new episodes
per 100,000 population)14. The influenza A (H3N2)
viruses circulating in England during this season
were well matched antigenically to the 2001-2 vaccine
strain A/Panama/2007/9914.
Background
The outbreak of influenza-like illness occurred in a
religious community in March 2002. The community
had no records of a major outbreak of influenza-like
illness and had a policy of vaccinating all members
each year for the past 12 years. Over 90% of the
community (from the age of six months and upwards)
had been vaccinated against influenza during October
2001. The total population of 380 included visitors
from branch communities in the USA, Australia and
elsewhere. The community was situated in an isolated
rural location. People lived in large family units and
attended communal mealtimes and prayer meetings.
With the exception of teenagers, who attended the
local college, most people worked or studied within
the community. Most residents (77%; 269/350) spent
less than one day per week outside the community. A
total of 31 individuals had travelled outside the UK
in the previous two months; the most common
destination was the USA (84%; 26/31).
The community members were generally healthy.
Eighteen per cent (64/350) had a history of chronic
disease, placing them in the at risk group for serious
illness or death should they develop influenza, and
for which vaccination is strongly recommended15.
Only one smoker was noted.
Methods
Data collection
A self-completion questionnaire was circulated to all
residents of the community on 2 April 2002. Parents
were asked to complete a form for each child. The
questionnaire requested the following information:
age, sex, travel outside the UK, place and time of flu
vaccination, history of chronic illness, cigarette
smoking, days spent outside the community, number
of people sharing apartment, symptoms, and onset of
illness. Information about the clinical complications,
hospital admissions and mortality were obtained
retrospectively from the community’s doctor.
Case definition
A case was defined as a person with a self-reported
fever or chills with at least one of the following
symptoms: cough, sore throat, or headache.
Statistical analysis
The software packages Epi Info 2000 and GLIM16 were
used for all statistical analyses. The hypothesis that attack
rates were inversely related to increasing age was
analysed by the chi-squared test for linear trend. Logistic
regression analysis was used to identify risk/protective
factors for developing clinical symptoms of influenza. The
best model was determined by backwards step wise
elimination of non-significant variables.
Vaccine efficacy was calculated using the formula:
The 95% confidence interval for efficacy was calculated
using Miettinen’s test based method17.
Clinical virology
Throat swabs and blood samples were collected from 39
adult volunteers who had developed case defining
symptoms during the four days before the outbreak team
visit, 10 persons who were non-cases and five in whom it
was unknown whether they had been cases or non-cases.
Throat swabs were investigated by direct
immunofluorescence (Light Diagnostics, Respiratory
Panel 1 DFA) and by tissue culture. A selection of throat
swabs was then referred for reverse transcriptase
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)18 testing for
influenza. Paired sera from nine individuals and single
sera from two individuals were tested by
haemagglutination inhibition (HI). Sera were considered
to show evidence of recent influenza infection if there
was a four fold or greater rise in HI titre.
Results
Epidemiology
The response rate for the questionnaire was 92% (350/
380). Non-respondents were not followed up. Between
10 March and 5 April 2002 there were 151 cases of illness
conforming to the case definition (figure 1). The outbreak
peaked on 20 March,five days before it was reported to
the local public health authority. The first clinical
specimens were taken on 26 March. The overall attack
rate was 43% (151/351). Male and female patients had
similar attack rates, 42% (66/157), and 44% (85/193)
respectively. Among the cases that met the case definition
the commonest symptoms reported (in addition to fever
or chills) were cough, coryza, and headache (table 1).
Attack rates were highest in the group aged less than 5
years (61.5%) and decreased with age (chi-squared test
for linear trend: p = 0.04) (table 2). No cases required
admission to hospital. Five cases required antibiotics for
lower respiratory tract complications.
Risk/protective factors
Most residents (94%; 329/350) had been vaccinated
against influenza in the autumn of 2001. Of those
vaccinated, 94% (309/329) had been vaccinated in the
UK community’s own medical centre, with the same
vaccine batch. The 20 individuals vaccinated outside
the UK included 19 Americans, 17 of whom had been
x 100 (AR in unvaccinated – AR in vaccinated)

vaccinated in three different US community medical
centres. Out of the four vaccine batches used in the
USA, three were the same product/manufacturer as
the vaccine used in the UK for community members.
The age structure of those vaccinated outside the UK
was similar to the age structure of the patients
vaccinated in the UK. All UK and US community
members were vaccinated between 17 October and 7
November. The attack rate was 43% (9/21) in
individuals who had not been vaccinated, 45% (140/
309) in those vaccinated in the UK and 10% (2/20) in
those vaccinated elsewhere.
Vaccine efficacy
When the epidemiological case definition was used,
vaccine efficacy in those vaccinated in the UK was –5.4%
and 77% (95% confidence interval 53.2 to 88.4) in
individuals vaccinated elsewhere, mostly the USA (table
5). Small numbers prohibited the calculation of vaccine
efficacy by age group.
Logistic regression model
The attack rate in patients aged 65 years and over was
significantly lower than in those aged 5 years and under
(odds ratio 0.1; 95% confidence interval 0.02 to 0.38) (table
3). Vaccination in the UK was not protective against being
a case. Based on the case definition, influenza vaccination
outside the UK showed protection from being a case, and
just reached significance (odds ratio, 0.17; 95% confidence
interval 0.03 to 1.0; p = 0.016) in comparison with
those not vaccinated. Cases with a history of chronic
disease had a tendency towards a greater risk of being a
case, which just reached significance (1.86, 1.0 to 3.63;
p = 0.05). None of the other risk/protective factors were
found to be independently associated with becoming a
case.
Clinical virology
Thirty-six specimens tested by direct immunofluorescence were all negative. Four out of 17 specimens
were culture positive for influenza A virus and one
specimen that was culture negative for influenza virus
yielded a rhinovirus. Influenza A viruses recovered from
swabs were all A H3N2 Panama/2007/99-like viruses
antigenically. Of the 36 throat swabs, 75% (27/36) were
PCR positive for influenza A. All four patients with
positive cultures for influenza and the one patient with
positive culture for rhinovirus were also PCR positive
for influenza virus.
Serology
Rising (HI) titres to influenza A (H3N2 Panama) were
found in six out of nine paired sera available. All six
patients were also PCR positive for influenza. For the
three patients not showing rising titres, two were PCR
positive. The first sera in the nine paired sera all had an
HI titre to H3N2 Panama of less than eight, indicating a
lack of protective immunity (an HI titre of 40 or higher).

Laboratory confirmation of clinical cases
Clinical specimens were obtained from 54 individuals (39
cases, ten non-cases by the case definition, and five
unknown). From this number, 25 (81%) out of 31 cases
tested, were positive by PCR for influenza A H3N2. One
non-case and one ‘unknown case’ also tested positive by
PCR (table 4).
The sensitivity and specificity of the case definition
were calculated by using a positive laboratory result as
the gold standard for confirming influenza infection.
Sensitivity of case definition was 25/26 (96%). Specificity
of case definition was 3/9 (33%).
Discussion
An outbreak of influenza with a high attack rate occurred
in a semi-enclosed community despite high rates of prior
immunisation with vaccines containing components
closely related to the circulating influenza viruses.
Vaccination seemed to have conferred little protection
against clinical disease symptoms, although it may have
protected against severe illness. In this outbreak, the
highest attack rates were in children aged less than five
years of age. An independent association with chronic
disease was found, although this only just reached
statistical significance.
Influenza vaccination in the UK was not effective in
preventing influenza as defined by the study’s case
definition. The outbreak virus was antigenically related
to the vaccine. This was a community of normal, healthy
people. The age structure, however was younger than that
of the surrounding area population: 40% compared to
16% aged 15 years or under19. The outcome of the
outbreak of influenza in this highly vaccinated
community indicates the possibility of increased
susceptibility. There are a number of possible
interpretations of this. One is that factors specific to this
community might have made this population more
vulnerable to infection despite vaccination. It is likely that
a semi-closed society would have limited exposure to wild
type circulating influenza strains and therefore
have lower levels of naturally acquired immunity
(especially in young children). Subunit vaccine is
not so immunogenic in young children/or those
experiencing primary infection, which could account for
the high attack rates seen in young children and in the
community as a whole, which had a young age structure.
In addition to having an increased susceptibility to
infection, a semi-closed community such as this would
also create conditions for increased exposure to infection
once influenza had been introduced because of the
community’s communal way of life. Although general
advice was given about hand washing, disposal of tissues,
and disinfection of communal areas, it was impracticable
to exclude cases from communal mealtimes and prayer
meetings.
Finally, it is also possible that immunity may have
waned after vaccination. This is supported to some degree
by the fact that the first sera in the nine paired sera
indicated a lack of protective immunity to H3N2 (an HI
titre of less than 40). This may reflect the fact that
vaccination was carried out six months previously with
subunit vaccine. The phenomenon of waning immunity

after vaccination has been noted in outbreaks on cruise
ships in North America20 also at the end of the winter
season.
Although vaccination did not seem to confer protection
from clinical illness of influenza, it is possible that the
outbreak would have been much more severe if the
community had not been vaccinated. It is notable that
in an outbreak of this size no one was admitted to hospital
and the complication rate was only 3%. As few
individuals who were not cases of influenza were
sampled for virological confirmation, the attack rate of
subclinical illness cannot be estimated. For every case of
symptomatic influenza there may be as many as five
asymptomatic cases21.
The findings imply the possibility that vaccination
in the UK had not been as effective compared with
vaccination elsewhere. On inquiry, there had not been
problems with the handling or storage of vaccine at the
GP surgery or community’s medical centre, and the effect
cannot be explained by differential timing of vaccination
in the UK or USA or a difference in the vaccine product
used in the two countries. There was also no difference
in the age structure of the two vaccination groups. There
were no known potency problems with UK vaccine
during the 2001-2 winter season. It may be a chance
finding owing to the small number of people vaccinated
in the USA, or some other bias related to the
characteristics of this group compared with the UK
vaccinated group.
The apparent failure of vaccination to prevent this
outbreak is of concern. This community had high
coverage with an appropriate vaccine, given at the start
of the 2001-2 flu season. This raises the question about
when is the most appropriate time to administer flu
vaccination in the general population. Vaccination
programmes normally take place from September to
November and are planned to be carried out before the
expected onset of influenza virus activity. However, the
timing of influenza outbreaks is often unpredictable, in
some years they occur very early in the autumn/winter
when immunity levels in the vaccinated population may
not have yet developed or very late in the winter, when
immunity levels may have waned.
Despite the large size of the study population and high
response rate to the questionnaire (92%), symptoms were
self reported, without objective confirmation of signs such
as fever. Clinical specimens were taken from a sample of
symptomatic volunteers to establish community
diagnosis. The study could have been improved by
systematically collecting information about other
outcomes to assess vaccine efficacy, such as antibiotic
prescribing or radiography for secondary complications.
It is possible that by including fever in the case definition
there is bias towards lower ascertainment in older age
groups, which could partially contribute to our finding
of a decreased attack rate in elderly people. A
standardised case definition cannot take account of the
fact that some signs, such as fever, are not evident in all
cases.
The results show some weakness in routine laboratory
investigations for influenza. Direct immunofluorescence
and cell culture performed poorly as diagnostic tests
compared with PCR, which was not available at the local
laboratory. The poor performance of the local laboratory
diagnostics may have been due to suboptimal sampling
with throat swabs alone compared with the more invasive
but more productive method (in terms of viral yield) of
taking nasopharyngeal aspirates. Comparison of PCR,
serology, and culture results yielded no evidence of
falsely negative PCR results.
Diagnostic delay was an important feature of this
outbreak since PCR results were only available three
weeks after the peak of the outbreak. Effective therapy
for influenza should be started within 48 hours22.
Nevertheless 20 individuals were treated on the basis of
clinical diagnosis with zanamivir, in line with

recommendations from the National Institute of Clinical
Excellence (NICE) at the time.
The outbreak attracted significant media attention and
was investigated thoroughly despite initial negative DIF
results and the vaccination status of the community. It is
possible that a more general and diffuse epidemic was
occurring in the local general population but was not
recognised.
In the UK, the current policy is to offer influenza
vaccination to people over the age of 65 and those aged
over six months in the at-risk groups for severe morbidity
or mortality23. In the context of an influenza epidemic,
neuraminidase inhibitor treatment is indicated for people
over the age of 65 years and those over the age of 12 who
belong to the at-risk groups for severe morbidity or
mortality, who present within 48 hours of developing
symptoms22. Oseltamivir is now licensed for the treatment
of influenza A and B in people aged one year or over in
the specified risk categories. Since September 2003,
oseltamivir has also been recommended for the postexposure prophylaxis in at-risk individuals unprotected
by vaccination, and also in at-risk individuals in
residential care establishments regardless of vaccination
status24. In this study, the highest attack rate was in the
youngest age group and decreased with increasing age.
With the new guidelines, oseltamivir would have been
available to treat anyone in the risk categories in the
younger age groups and also for post-exposure
prophylaxis in similar risk categories for those over 13
years old. If one of the rationales, however, of offering
full treatment is to reduce transmission rates, this
outbreak shows that, in some circumstances, it may be
reasonable to consider prophylactic use of neuraminidase
inhibitors for all residents in a closed institution,
regardless of age, vaccination, or risk factor status.
In conclusion, even in a community in which a very
high proportion of people have been immunised against
influenza, it remains important to consider the diagnosis
of influenza infection in an outbreak of acute respiratory
illness, including influenza-like illness.
