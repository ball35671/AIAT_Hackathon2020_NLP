Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of inactivated influenza vaccine in preventing acute otitis
media (AOM) and otitis media with effusion (OME) in children
aged 6 to 60 months who attend day care.
Study Design: This prospective, single-blind study was conducted
in 8 day care centers in Ankara, Turkey. One hundred nineteen (61
vaccinated and 58 unvaccinated against influenza) healthy children
were examined at study entry and at 6-week intervals for 6 months
by the same 2 otorhinolaryngologists who were blinded about the
vaccination status of the children. The frequency of AOM and OME
is compared between the 2 groups and the effect of influenza season
on frequency of episodes was evaluated. Based on national influenza
laboratory data, the influenza season was determined to be the period
between December 15, 2003, and January 31, 2004.
Result: The frequencies of AOM, OME and total otitis media
episodes in vaccinated children were 2.3%, 22.8% and 25.2%,
respectively, and these frequencies were 5.2%, 31.1% and 36.3% in
the unvaccinated group. The difference was statistically significant
(P  0.01). This difference was especially prominent in the influenza season (P  0.05).
Conclusion: Influenza vaccine is effective in reducing AOM and
OME episodes in 6- to 60-month-old day care children, especially
during influenza season.

Otitis media (OM) is a common problem in children less
than 5 years of age.1 Although the microorganisms most
frequently responsible for the otitis media are Streptococcus
pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis, some respiratory viruses like respiratory syncytial
virus (RSV), rhinovirus and influenza A virus are known to
predispose to OM.2,3 In many cases, OM is preceded by a
viral respiratory infection.4,5 Viral infections predispose to
development of acute otitis media (AOM) by inducing some
ciliary and mucinous changes that affect middle ear pressure
and cause eustachian tube dysfunction.6 They also suppress
the immune system of the host by altering the peripheral
blood polymorphonuclear cell functions.7
It is reasonable to expect that administration of influenza
vaccine might help in reducing the morbidity from OM. This
hypothesis was first tested in 1991,8 and 2 additional studies
performed by inactive influenza vaccine9,10 and one study that
tested live vaccine11 demonstrated that the vaccine significantly
reduced AOM episodes during influenza season. A recent, welldesigned randomized, controlled trial by Hoberman et al12 failed
to demonstrate the efficacy of inactivated influenza vaccine in
children younger than 2 years of age. Among these studies, only
one of them9 studied the prevalence of otitis media with effusion
(OME) in addition to AOM in vaccinated children.
We aimed to evaluate the effect of the vaccine in our
population, which may be different from the European or
American populations of previous studies. We recruited children aged 6 to 60 months. Day care is an important risk factor
so we performed our study on day care children. We considered both AOM and OME and effects of influenza season in
evaluating the efficacy of the inactivated influenza vaccine.
METHODS
Study Population and Design. This prospective, single-blind
study was conducted between November 1, 2003, and April
30, 2004, in 8 day care centers that were in the region served
by Gazi University in Ankara, Turkey. One hundred thirtyfive healthy children aged 6 to 60 months attended these day
care centers. Children who were immunized for the first time
and did not complete the second dose, those who not have at
least 3 examinations because they were not present in the day
care center on the examination days and those with tympanostomy tubes were excluded from the study.
Written informed consent was obtained from the parents and the study was approved by the Gazi University ethics
committee.
The day care centers were first visited during the last week
of October 2003 and the parents were asked to complete a
questionnaire about the known risk factors for OM and about
their children’s influenza vaccination status. We confirmed the
influenza immunization history by vaccination records and the
children were divided into 2 groups as “vaccinated” and “unvaccinated” against influenza. The vaccinated group had received 2 doses or one dose (if immunized in the previous years)
of standard trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (Fluarix, GlaxoAccepted for publication January 24, 2006.

season. The vaccine dosage was 0.25 mL for children less
than 3 years of age and 0.5 mL for the older ones; 2 doses of
vaccine were given 4 weeks apart.
Otoscopic Findings and Tympanometry. Children were examined at study entry and every 6 weeks for 6 months by the
same 2 otorhinolaryngologists who were blinded about the
vaccination status of children. They performed visual otoscopic examination and tympanometry on each visit. For
tympanometric evaluation, handheld portable impedance
MT10 (Interacoustics A/S, Assens, Denmark, SN 121543
2002) was used. The results of those examinations were
interpreted together with otoscopic findings and definitions
were as follows:
Normal ear: Normal otoscopic findings and type A and C1
curve on tympanometry;
AOM: Hyperemia, opacity, bulging or immobility of the
tympanic membrane in addition to any combination of
the following clinical findings: fever, earache, irritability and vomiting. Tympanometry was not performed on
these patients because of the risk of perforation;
OME: Immobility, bulging, opacification or retraction of the
tympanic membrane without clinical signs and symptoms of acute infection and C2 or B curve on tympanometry; and
OM: Any episodes of either AOM or OME.
Influenza Season. The influenza season was determined according to the Istanbul University Medical Faculty Influenza
Laboratory data.13 Figure 1 demonstrated isolation of influenza A and RSV per weeks in the 2003 to 2004 season. The
first influenza isolate of the season was detected on the 48th
week of 2003 and the last isolate was seen on the 4th week of
2004 with the peak incidence between the second week of
December 2003 and the end of January 2004. According to
these data, influenza season was defined as the period between December 15, 2003, and January 31, 2004 (Fig. 1). The
study was divided into the following 4 periods: the period
between November 1, 2003, and December 15, 2004, was the
“before influenza” season and the period between December
15, 2003, and January 31, 2004, was the “influenza” season.
The period after influenza season was divided into 2 as
“early” (February 1, 2004 –March 15, 2004) and “late”
(March 15–April 30, 2004).
Statistical Analysis. We used the Statistical Package for Social
Sciences (SPSS/PC 13.0) software. Differences between
groups were assessed by the 2 test for categorical variables
(Fisher exact test if necessary) and Student t test for 2 group
comparisons. Statistical significance was defined as P  0.05.
The vaccinated and unvaccinated groups were compared with each other both according to the total number of
OM episodes and percentage of children with a diagnosis of
AOM or OME in the groups.
RESULTS
Study Population. In the 8 day care centers, there were 135
children between 6 and 60 months of age. The 16 children
who either had tympanostomy tubes (3 children) or had been
immunized for the first time and did not complete the second
dose (2 children) or were not present in the day care center for
follow-up examinations (11 children) and therefore could not
complete at least 3 required examinations were excluded
from the study. Most (87.5%) children had 4 examinations.
The remaining 119 evaluable children (61 vaccinated and 58
unvaccinated) comprised the study group. There were 57 girls
(47.9%) and 62 boys (52.1%). The mean age of children was
43.7  11.4 months, with 42.1  14.6 months in the vaccinated and 45.1  6.2 months in the unvaccinated groups (P
0.05). The children less than 2 years of age, between 2 and 4
years and greater than 4 years in the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups were 20 (33%), 22 (36%), 19 (31%), 2 (3%),
47 (81%), and 9 (16%), respectively. The groups did not
differ from each other according to known risk factors OM
infection: the gender of the child, bottle feeding, pacifier use,
history of frequent upper respiratory tract (URT) infection,
asthma or allergy, antibiotic use, previous AOM and passive
smoking (P  0.05) (Table 1).

Effusion Episodes. Thirty-eight (62%) of 61 vaccinated children and 44 (76%) of 58 unvaccinated children had at least
one episode of OME, whereas 8 vaccinated children (13%)
and 16 unvaccinated children (28%) had at least one episode
of AOM. Efficacies of influenza vaccine for protection
against OME, AOM and OM were 18%, 51% and 18%,
respectively.
During the study period, total numbers of examined
ears in the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups were 464 and
440, respectively. Fifty percent of all ears in the vaccinated
group were normal at these examinations and 28% were
normal in the unvaccinated group (P  0.001). The frequencies of AOM and OME episodes were significantly higher in
the unvaccinated group (Table 2).
Otitis Media Episodes of Vaccinated and Unvaccinated
Children According to Season. Comparisons of the 2 groups
for OME, AOM and total OM episodes in preinfluenza,
influenza and postinfluenza seasons are demonstrated in Table 2. The frequency of all episodes was significantly lower in
the vaccinated children during the influenza season and during the late phase of the postinfluenza season.
When each group was individually evaluated according to
the season, although OM in the unvaccinated ears was significantly increased in influenza season compared with preinfluenza
season (P  0.05), there was no significant difference in the
vaccinated group (P  0.05). Frequency of OM was not different between the groups in the preinfluenza season (P  0.05)
and it was significantly lower in the vaccinated group than
unvaccinated group in the influenza season.
In the early postinfluenza season, no decrease in frequencies of OM was found in both groups and there was no
difference in OM frequencies between the groups. OM frequencies in both groups showed a significant decrease in the
late postinfluenza season compared with the influenza season
(P  0.05). In the late postinfluenza season, OM frequency in
the vaccinated group was significantly lower than in the
unvaccinated group (P  0.026).
DISCUSSION
Our results indicate that inactivated influenza vaccine is
effective in reducing OM episodes (either AOM or OME) in
healthy day care children aged 6 to 60 months. We chose a
group of children who attend day care centers because day care
is a known risk factor for OM.14 –16 Other known risk factors for
development of OM are anatomic factors (eustachian tube dysfunction) and host characteristics (young age, genetic predisposition, respiratory allergy, defective immunologic status).17 In
our study, age and sex of the children, history of otitis media,
bottle feeding or pacifier use, allergy and exposure to tobacco
smoke were not different in the vaccinated and unvaccinated
groups. Therefore, the main variable between the groups was
vaccination status against influenza.
During our study period, both the total number of AOM
episodes and the proportion of children who had at least one
episode of AOM were significantly lower in the vaccinated
group. The protection from the vaccine for AOM was calculated as 50.9%. Similar findings were observed in other
studies performed by using both inactivated and live influenza vaccines.8 –11 The overall decrease in the incidence of
AOM in the groups who received influenza vaccine in the
study of Heikennen et al8 was 36% and in the study of
Clement et al9 32% in the unadjusted analyses. Marchisio et
al10 calculated the overall efficacy of vaccination in preventing AOM as 43.7% using intranasal, inactivated, virosomal
subunit influenza vaccine. Belshe et al11 demonstrated a

significant reduction in all febrile illnesses, including AOM
in children vaccinated with live attenuated intranasal influenza vaccine. There is only one study reporting that influenza
vaccine is not effective in preventing OM for children
younger than 2 years of age.12
The studies about the efficacy of influenza vaccine for
OM are all related to frequency of AOM, except the study of
Clement et al,9 who studied the frequency of OME in addition
to AOM. To our knowledge, our study is the second study
that evaluated the frequency of both OME and AOM. Our
results are in accordance with their data, demonstrating that
efficacy of the vaccine is more prominent in reducing AOM
episodes rather than OME episodes.
As clearly seen in Table 2, we observed that OM frequency did not show a significant increase in influenza season in
the vaccinated children. However, unvaccinated children had
significantly higher OM episodes in the influenza season. The
protective effect of the vaccine in different seasons was studied
by Clements9 and Marchisio.10 In both of these studies, the
frequency of AOM was not different in vaccinated and unvaccinated children after the influenza season. Our data was in
accordance with these data. As is well known, resolution of OM
in a given child is associated with eustachian tube function and
middle ear ventilation. Because it is defective in younger children, resolution of OM takes time. It was shown that 40% of
children having AOM still had OME 1 month after an AOM
episode.17,18 However, our data also showed that vaccinated
children presented lower OM frequency in the late postinfluenza
season, although there was no decrease in OM frequency in the
unvaccinated group. Hence, vaccination does not only decrease
numbers of OM episodes and children with OM, but also results
in early resolution of OM after influenza season. This effect is
probably related to circulation of other viruses in the environment. RSV circulated in February may mask any effect of
influenza vaccine or perhaps influenza B virus circulated in
March allowing an additional effect of the vaccine. Winter et
al19 showed a poor effect of viral upper airway infections on the
middle ear ventilation and Heikkinnen et al pointed out the effect
of viruses on eustachian tube function in pathogenesis of OM.20
One limitation of this study is the fact that the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups are not randomized. One may
think that parents of the children with a history of either OM
or upper airway infection may be more willing to vaccinate
their children against influenza and therefore the children in
the vaccinated group may be more prone to OM. However, in
our study group, we found no difference in the 2 groups
regarding histories of OM. Another limitation is that the
children were not vaccinated with the same vaccine product.
However, they received 2 different brands that contain the
same strain. Therefore, no difference in the efficacy of these
2 vaccines was expected. Finally, we could not perform the
surveillance of influenza virus in the study group because of
technical and economic reasons.
As a conclusion, we found that influenza vaccine is
effective in reducing AOM and OME episodes in 6- to
60-month-old day care children. However, it is difficult to
recommend routine vaccination to all the children in this age
group because overall protection against OM, especially
protection against OME, is relatively low. These results
support the use of influenza vaccine in day care children and
children with recurrent OM. Some authors believe that the
attenuated nasal spray vaccines may be considered for universal immunization of healthy children.21 Because OM is a
polymicrobial disease and a large number of predisposing
risk factors exist, strategies considering all of these factors
may be more effective for prevention of OM than an individual vaccine application.
