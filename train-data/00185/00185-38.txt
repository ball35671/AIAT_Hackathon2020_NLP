abstract
The goal of this pediatric clinical trial was to assess the safety and immunogenicity of two different doses
of a monovalent inactivated pandemic (H1N1) 2009 vaccine in US children aged 6 months to 9 years of
age. Randomized, observer-blinded, US multicenter phase 2 study assessing 2 doses of vaccine given 21
days apart in 474 children aged 6–35 months or 3–9 years. Children in each age group were randomly
assigned to receive either a pandemic (H1N1) 2009 vaccine containing 7.5 or 15 g of hemagglutinin (HA)
or placebo in a 4:4:1 ratio. Primary outcome was hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody responses
21 days following each vaccination. Safety was monitored throughout the study. The first dose of either
A H1N1 vaccine formulation was more immunogenic in children older than 3 years than in younger children. 45–50% of children aged 6–35 months and 69–75% of children aged 3–9 year-old attained HI titers
of ≥1:40. A second dose of A H1N1 vaccine further increased HI antibody responses with seroprotection and seroconversion rates reaching 90–99% in both age groups. Interestingly, the pandemic (H1N1)
2009 vaccine formulations elicited similar rates of solicited and unsolicited injection site and systemic
reactions as the placebo. The data therefore demonstrate the high level immunogenicity in infants and
children of an (H1N1) 2009 influenza vaccine displaying a safety and reactogenicity profile similar to
placebo.

1. Introduction
In April 2009, a novel influenza A (H1N1) virus was identified in humans in Mexico and the United States and was followed
by rapid global spread, resulting in the World Health Organization (WHO) declaration of an influenza pandemic in June [1].
Between June and September 2009, while the first pandemic wave
occurred and peaked in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) winter
[2,3], the novel strain continued to circulate in the Northern Hemisphere (NH), causing higher than normal levels of influenza activity
for the season [4]. With the onset of the 2009–2010 NH annual
influenza season, influenza activity increased starting in September

in North America and Europe. This increase occurred much earlier
than observed during previous years with widespread activity in
almost all areas [5,6]. Data from the US confirmed that virtually all
influenza-positive respiratory specimens were the 2009 pandemic
influenza A (H1N1) virus [6].
Epidemiological data reported at the ACIP meeting in February 2010 [7] showed that in the United States between April
and December 2009, the rate of laboratory-confirmed 2009 H1N1
influenza-associated hospitalizations in children aged 0–4 years
was 7.1 per 10,000 compared to 3.2 per 10,000 for children
5–17 years and 2.7–3.4 per 10,000 for adults. Mortality rates for
laboratory-confirmed 2009 H1N1 infection were reported to be
0.49 per 100,000 in US children 0–4 years, and 0.50 per 100,000
in the 5–24 year age group. The majority of hospitalized patients,
and those with severe outcomes had underlying medical conditions
[6–8].
Children at least 6 months of age were identified as one of
the five initial target groups for pandemic influenza vaccination
in the US. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices

9 years of age was to vaccinate using a two-dose regimen [9].
Previously, we reported preliminary safety and immunogenicity
results after a single injection of pandemic influenza A (H1N1) 2009
monovalent vaccine given to children aged 6 months to 9 years,
and in adults including elderly [10]. We found that one injection
was highly immunogenic and well tolerated in adults and elderly,
with seroprotection rates of 93–100%. A single injection, although
immunogenic in children <9 years, did not raise sufficiently high HI
antibody titers to satisfy the immunogenicity criteria for licensure
set by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The hypothesis that a second dose of vaccine would augment HI responses
in children under the age of 9 years was supported by immunogenicity data obtained in studies of seasonal influenza vaccination,
where 2 administrations of the product were shown to be required
for inducing optimal responses in previously unexposed children
[11]. Here we report safety and immunogenicity results obtained
after the completion of two-dose pandemic A influenza (H1N1)
vaccination schedule in children aged 6 months to 9 years.
2. Materials and methods
We enrolled and randomized 229 children aged 6–35 months
and 245 children aged 3–9 years (i.e., children up to 1 day before
their 3 or 10 years birthday respectively) to receive two injections of
one of two H1N1 vaccine doses [7.5 g hemagglutinin (HA), 15 g
HA)] or placebo 21 days apart in an observer-blinded, placebocontrolled, multicenter Phase 2 trial. The study was reviewed by
the US Center for Biologics Evaluation & Research, US Food and
Drug Administration (CBER/FDA) and approved by the Western
Institutional Review Board (Olympia, WA, US) before enrollment.
The clinical trial was conducted in accordance with the Declaration
of Helsinki, Good Clinical Practice (as defined by the International
Conference on Harmonization) and federal regulations. Before
enrollment parents of all participants provided written informed
consent and children over 7 years of age gave their assent.
The study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov
(NCT00952419).
Healthy children aged 6 months to 9 years were eligible. The
main exclusion criteria were: known or suspected influenza infection since March 2009; any vaccination in the previous 4 weeks or
planned within 6 weeks following the first trial vaccination; hypersensitivity to any vaccine component or life threatening reaction
to a vaccine containing the same substances; known or suspected
immunodeficiency; recent history (<6 months) of immunosuppressive therapy or long-term systemic corticosteroid therapy; known
HIV, hepatitis B or C infection; receipt of blood or blood-derived
products in the previous 3 months, and febrile or acute illness on
the day of enrollment. Contact with a person infected with pandemic influenza A (H1N1) was not an exclusion criterion. As the trial
was organised in August 2009, study participants did not receive
the seasonal influenza vaccine of the 2009/2010 season prior to
enrolment in the trial. Information pertaining to history of previous influenza vaccination was collected by the investigator from all
participants. Both documented histories and parent’s reports were
taken into account.
We randomly assigned children to one of three study groups
(7.5 g HA, 15 g HA, placebo) using randomization lists. Scratch
off randomization lists stratified by age group (6–35 months
and 3–9 years) and trial center were generated by the sponsor’s
biostatistics department using block-permutation. Participants
received two intramuscular (IM) injections 21 days apart in an
observer-blinded manner (i.e., study staff members who were not
involved in any other aspect of the study prepared the assigned
vaccine or placebo and performed the vaccinations).
The investigational vaccine was an inactivated split-virion
preparation of the New York Medical College (NYMC) X-179A reassortant of the A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) strain and the PR8/8/34
strain, distributed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Seed virus was propagated in embryonated chicken
eggs, inactivated and split according to the process used to produce
a seasonal influenza vaccine licensed in the US for persons aged
>6 months (Fluzone®, sanofi pasteur, Swiftwater, PA). Vaccine was
supplied as single-dose vials without preservative for 6–35 montholds and multi-dose vials containing 0.01% thimerosal preservative
for 3–9 year-olds. In the absence of calibration reagents required for
the single radial immunodiffusion assay (SRID) at the time of clinical lot manufacturing, potency was assessed by high performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC). Hemagglutinin (HA) content was
quantified again by SRID when the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 reagents
became available. By SRID, the assigned 7.5 and 15 g HA vaccines
contained 11 and 24 g HA per 0.5 ml, respectively. As with seasonal influenza vaccines, the volumes injected were 0.25 ml (6–35
months) and 0.5 ml (3–9 years). Intramuscular injections were performed in the thigh (infants aged <1 year) or the deltoid region.
Serum samples were collected before and 21 days after each
vaccination for hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titration against the vaccine strain using the standard HI assay with
turkey erythrocytes [12]. Each sample was tested in duplicate, with
the geometric mean of the two results recorded as the final titer
expressed as the reciprocal dilution. Assays were performed at
the sponsor’s central clinical immunology laboratory (Swiftwater,
PA) under blinded conditions. Immunogenicity data were summarized using geometric mean titer (GMT), geometric mean titer ratio
(GMTR), seroprotection rate (defined as % of subjects with titers
≥1: 40), seroconversion rate (defined as % of subjects with a prevaccination titer <1:10 and a post-vaccination titer ≥1:40, or with a
pre-vaccination titer ≥1:10 and ≥4-fold increase after vaccination)
[13].
Participants remained under observation for at least 30 min
after each vaccination. Adverse events (AEs) occurring during this
period were reported as immediate adverse events. Parents or legal
guardians noted body temperature and any solicited reactions in
safety diaries every day for 7 days after each injection. Diaries
solicited the following injection site reactions: pain (children
≥2 years) or tenderness (children <2 years), erythema, swelling,
induration or ecchymosis, and the following systemic reactions:
fever, headache, malaise, myalgia and shivering (children ≥2 years)
or fever, vomiting, abnormal crying, drowsiness, loss of appetite,
and irritability (children <2 years). All other (unsolicited) adverse
events occurring within 21 days after each vaccination were also
recorded in the subject diaries and were judged to be either
related or unrelated to vaccination by the investigator. Therefore
for reporting the safety results (Table 3), the subjects were divided
by age into 3 groups (6–23 months, 24–35 months, and 3–9 years).
Adverse events judged by the investigator to be a new onset of
a chronic illness (NOCI) were to be reported separately. Serious
adverse events (SAEs), including adverse events of special interest
(i.e., anaphylaxis, Guillain–Barré syndrome, Bell’s palsy, optic neuritis, convulsions or syncope) were reported throughout the study
(until Day 201 after first vaccination) using the standard procedure
of immediate initial notification and follow-up reporting.
In view of the public health priority of the A influenza (H1N1)
2009 pandemic, no formal calculation of sample size was performed. The sample size was chosen pragmatically by balancing
the need for robust estimates of vaccine safety and immunogenicity
against the need to complete the trial as rapidly as possible. Analyses were descriptive, with no statistically powered hypotheses.
The planned overall study cohort (N = 450) provides a probability
of approximately 95% of observing any AE with a true incidence
of 0.66%. In each group of 100 subjects, there is a probability of

approximately 95% of observing any AE with a true incidence of
3%. For each endpoint, 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using the normal approximation for quantitative data and
the exact binomial distribution (Clopper–Pearson method) for proportions. Geometric mean titers and 95% confidence intervals (CI)
were calculated by the use of the mean, and lower and upper limits
of the 96% CI of log-transformed titers. The statistical analysis were
performed by a statistician who was aware of the treatment assignment, not involved in any other aspect of the study, and was the
only person to have unmasked access to the data. Immunogenicity
analyses were performed on the per protocol set. Safety analyses
were performed on all vaccinated participants, with data analyzed
according to the vaccine received.
3. Results
Between 6 August and 13 August 2009, 474 children were
enrolled and vaccinated with H1N1 vaccine or placebo (Fig. 1). Of
these, 460 received a second injection 21 days after the first vaccination and 458 attended the Day 42 visit. Blood samples were
obtained from all children who attended the Day 21 visit, while 446
out of 458 children provided a blood sample on Day 42. A total of
467 subjects were contacted at the Day 201 follow-up time point.
Two participants, both 7 year-old girls, in the 7.5 g HA vaccine
group had influenza-like illness 17 and 18 days after the first vaccination and were withdrawn from the study by the investigator
prior to the second vaccination. Laboratory virology testing was not
performed for these 2 subjects but a sibling was diagnosed with
H1N1 influenza within a week before both events started. Since
H1N1 infection could not be excluded, both subjects were excluded
from the per protocol population. These AEs were considered to be
unrelated to the vaccine by the investigator.
Study populations in each age group are shown in Table 1. In
the 6–35 month and 3–9 year age groups 45% (104/229) and 55%
(135/245) were known to have received seasonal influenza vaccine
for the 2008–09 season, respectively. None were known to have
been in contact with a pandemic H1N1 case prior to enrollment.
Antibodies against the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 strain were
detected before vaccination in 7/202 (3%) of children aged 6–35
months, and 18/213 (8%) of children aged 3–9 years, and in most of
these cases (all 7 younger children, and 13/18 older children) titers
were ≥40.
After the first vaccination with either dose of H1N1 vaccine,
titers increased approximately 3- to 5-fold in younger children and

6- to 10-fold in the 3–9 year group. The first vaccination was sufficient to induce seroprotective antibody titers (HI titers ≥ 40) in
45–50% of younger children and 65–75% of older children.
As measured on Day 42, the second vaccination (Day 21) elicited
a further 10- to 12-fold increase in titers in younger children and
5- to 6-fold increase in titers in older children (Table 2) and is illustrated in the reverse cumulative distribution curves shown inFig. 2a
and b. Immune responses after completion of the two dose schedule were comparable in both age groups with seroprotection rates
of 91–99% in each vaccine and age group and GMTs of 368–586.
Previously reported exploratory analyses had shown that the
administration of seasonal influenza vaccine to children in the
past five years had no effect on baseline GMTs and seroprotection
rates appeared lower in those vaccinated than unvaccinated [10].
Additionally, numbers were too small for meaningful analysis of
other factors that might affect baseline immune responses such as
influenza infection in 2009 or contact with persons infected with
the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus.
After two injections of either vaccine, immune responses satisfied the criteria set by the FDA: namely, in both age groups, the
lower limit of the 95% confidence intervals of the seroprotection
rates exceeded 70% and those of the seroconversion rates exceeded
40% [13].
In the placebo group, three children seroconverted during the
study (two older children and one younger child), bringing the seroprotection rate for the placebo group to 4% in younger children and
25% in older children.
No immediate unsolicited adverse reactions, vaccine-related
SAEs, adverse events of special interest, or new onset of chronic
illness occurred after either vaccination. Two unrelated SAEs
(furuncle and humerus fracture) and one unrelated NOCI (seasonal
allergies) were reported within 42 days after the first vaccination.
The proportion of children experiencing solicited reactions
within 7 days after at least one of the two injections are reported
separately for children 6–23 months, 24–35 months, and 3–9 years
and summarized in Table 3. Mild to moderate pain or tenderness,
followed by erythema, were the most common injection site reactions observed for vaccine or placebo recipients in all subject ages.
The most commonly reported systemic reactions were irritability in children aged 6–23 months and malaise and myalgia in the
older age groups. Fever was reported in a maximum of 13% (1/8)
children across all age and vaccine groups, with no indication of
increased frequency in subjects receiving the vaccine compared
to placebo recipients. Considering reactogenicity of the first and
second injections separately, reaction rates were lower after the
second injection than after the first (data not shown).
The proportion of subjects in each age and vaccine group experiencing unsolicited adverse events within 21 days after at least
one of the two injections ranged from 42% to 55% (Table 4). In
most cases, these were considered not to be vaccine related by the
investigator. Severe unsolicited events were detected at a maxi7.5 µg HA, D0 7.5 µg HA, D21 7.5 µg HA, D42

4. Discussion
Two injections of the licensed inactivated, subvirion, monovalent pandemic influenza A (H1N1) vaccine given 21 days apart were
highly immunogenic in children 6 months of age and older. Seroprotection and seroconversion rates elicited after two injections
of either the 7.5 g HA or 15 g HA vaccine formulation satisfied the US FDA’s immunogenicity requirements [13]. In children
younger than 10 years, the seroprotection rates observed after two
doses were similar to those seen in adults after a single injection
of the same vaccine (93–100%) [10]. Comparable results have been
reported in studies of other pandemic influenza A (H1N1) inactivated vaccines [14–21]. The level of immune responses observed
in 6–35 month-olds and 3–9 year-olds converged following the
second vaccination. These results confirm the benefit of a second
vaccination in this young population and suggest that the benefit
decreases with age.
Because of the urgent need to develop an A/influenza (H1N1)
2009 vaccine in the face of an ongoing pandemic, and in the
absence of specific SRID reagents, sanofi pasteur like other manufacturers, used high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)
to estimate the quantity of HA in the vaccine lots used for clinical
testing. Follow-up SRID testing when the reagents became available
showed that the vaccine formulated at 15 g by HPLC contained
24 g HA. The high immunogenicity of this formulation provides
assurance that vaccine lots formulated at 15 g by SRID would also
be highly immunogenic.
As noted in our preliminary report, pre-existing antibodies able
to inhibit the 2009 H1N1 virus were detected in very few children, but in most of these baseline-seropositive cases, the titer was
higher than 40, and therefore could be considered to be seroprotected prior to vaccination. The most plausible explanation for this
observation is that these few children had been recently infected
with the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus, of which a proportion may
have been asymptomatic. The results of a seroepidemiological
study conducted in England showed that ten times more children
were infected during the first wave of the 2009 pandemic than were
identified by clinical surveillance [22].

a Only classes of events characterized by a rate ≥2% in at least one group are presented.
There was no marked difference in the reactogenicity between
the H1N1 influenza vaccination and the placebo control. In particular, similar solicited reaction rates occurred in each of the three
groups. For instance there was no indication of an increased rate
of fever, pain or irritability after administration of the vaccine
compared to placebo. Since inactivated seasonal influenza vaccines have been licensed for several decades, placebo controlled
arms are rarely included in influenza vaccine clinical trials. Similarly, with the exception of a study conducted in China [14],
published pediatric studies of other (H1N1) 2009 candidate vaccines did not report comparisons to a placebo group [15–21].
Healthy children from 3 years of age were enrolled in the Chinese trial. Safety monitoring included observation of immediate
adverse events for 30 min after vaccination, collection of solicited
adverse events in a diary card for a period of 3 days after vaccination, and reporting of unsolicited adverse events throughout
the study. The proportion of children 3 to <12 years of age
reporting at least one adverse event in the 3-day period following any vaccination was found to range between 12.5% in the
placebo group and 33.0% in the 30 g unadjuvanted split inactivated H1N1 formulation. Contrary to our observations, these results
showed an increased rate of symptoms in subjects receiving vaccine
compared to placebo. The authors also reported a higher incidence of severe adverse events in the vaccine group compared
to the placebo group (0.6% vs. 0.1%). Overall these results differed from ours both in terms of comparison between vaccine
and placebo groups and in terms of overall frequency of adverse
events.
Another pediatric trial conducted in Mexico investigated
the reactogenicity of inactivated seasonal influenza vaccine as
compared with a placebo. In that study, Pedroza et al. [23]
measured rates of events over a 5-day period after vaccination and obtained results more comparable to those of our
study. For instance, pain was detected in 23–33% of subjects and malaise in up to 16% of children. Solicited adverse
events reported after each vaccination were similar between
the vaccine and placebo groups. The authors also reported
that a second dose appeared safe and provided enhanced
immune responses indicative of protection in this at risk population.
5. Conclusions
Two formulations of an A influenza (H1N1) 2009 vaccine were
highly immunogenic in infants and children from 6 months to 9
years of age. The results of this study confirm that two doses of
vaccine at dosages consistent with seasonal vaccines, namely 7.5
and 15 g of HA are needed to elicit antibody titers corresponding
to protective levels against the pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus
in children >6 months. A clear benefit of a second dose of vaccine
in further elevating HI titers was seen in all age groups. The safety
and reactogenicity of the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 vaccine, at either
dose, were acceptable and similar to placebo after both the first and
second vaccinations. The safety results observed were similar to
those seen historically with seasonal inactivated trivalent influenza
vaccines.
