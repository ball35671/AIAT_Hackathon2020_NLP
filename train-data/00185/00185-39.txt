Abstract
The reactogenicity and immunizing activity of vaccine influenza virus A (H1N1) and B strains used as mono- and bi-preparations in children of 3 to 14 years was studied. No increased reactogenicity after the use of bivaccine was observed in the children. Febrile reactions as well as 9 other clinical symptoms which could indicate the reactogenicity of the vaccines were identical for mono- and bivaccine and corresponded to the requirements of the technical documents for the vaccine. The optimal conditions for the evaluation of the immunogenicity of the B component by HI test were developed, and the necessity of using additionally the enzyme immunoassay for this purpose is substantiated. The above method demonstrated that the immunogenicity of the live influenza type A and B vaccine was high in children. No significant inhibition of immunological parameters was observed when the two viruses were combined in the bivaccine.
