Abstract
In order to assess the eectiveness of Vaxigrip in 1996±1997, we chose 1356 people in the Chinese Army, who had not
recently had in¯uenza and who were divided into an injection group and a control group. The injection group consisted of 80
children aged 3±6 years, 363 adults aged 18±59 years and 235 people over 60 years of age. The control group consisted of 88
children aged 3±6, 372 adults aged 18±59 and 218 people over 60. They were observed from the 21st day to the 6th month after
Vaxigrip administration. Each person was requested to report having a body temperature over 38.58C, headache, myalgia or
arthalgia, cough, pharyngodynia or nasal obstruction. Fever due to other causes was not included in the in¯uenza symptoms.
We counted the symptoms of in¯uenza and common cold only once during the observation period. Our ®nal ®nding was that
the incidence rates of the in¯uenza and common cold symptoms were reduced by 84.8% in children, 74.0% in adults and 68.6%
in elderly people.
In comparison with the control group, the incidence rate of in¯uenza-like symptoms was reduced by 71.1% in the injection
group, and the incidence rate of common cold symptoms in the injection group was lower than that in the control group. There
was no large dierence by age. The incidence rate of symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection in the injection group was
47.5% lower than that in the control group. Our ®ndings are basically the same as those in other countries. # 1999 Published

1. Introduction
In¯uenza, an acute, febrile, prostrating infection
caused by in¯uenza virus, has not yet been eectively
controlled. Between December 1996 and May 1997, we
carried out a study in the People's Liberation Army
on the eectiveness of an in¯uenza vaccination programme for people of three dierent ages, children,
adults and elderly persons. The in¯uenza vaccine was
`Vaxigrip', from Pasteur MeÂrieux Connaught, France.
2. Object and method
All 678 employees in areas designated as not being
at high risk for in¯uenza were given the vaccine. The
vaccinated group comprised 80 children aged 3±6, 363
adults aged 18±59 and 235 people over 60 years. The
control group consisted of 88 children, 372 adults aged
18±59 and 218 people over 60 years. Sex was not considered, and acceptance was 100%. Before the study,
the participants were interviewed and received a physical examination. Those with the following characteristics were excluded: body temperature over 38.58C,
acute infection 72 h before vaccination, evolving
chronic disease or known allergy to albumin.
The vaccine was stored at 2±88C. The doses given
were 0.25 ml in two injections at a 1-month interval
for children between 1 month and 3 years of age and
0.5 ml in one injection for adults and children over 3
years of age. The control group was followed-up at the
same time as the vaccinated group.
The observation period was from 21 days to 6
months after vaccination. The participants were asked
to report the following clinical syndromes:

fever>38.58C, headache, myalgia or arthralgia, cough,
sore throat and coryza. Fever due to other causes was
not included. During the observation period, several
occurrences of in¯uenza-like or common cold symptoms in one person were counted only once. The
results for people of dierent ages and in dierent
groups were analyzed by the w 2 test.
3. Results
The comparison of in¯uenza-like symptoms in the
vaccinated and control groups at the 6-months followup showed a signi®cant, 84.8%, reduction in the incidence rate of in¯uenza-like symptoms in children, a
74% reduction in elderly people and a 68.6% reduction in younger adults. The total incidence rate of
in¯uenza-like symptoms in the vaccinated group was
reduced by 71.7% (Table 1). The P value was <0.05.
Comparison of the prevalence of symptoms of the
common cold between vaccinated and control persons
of dierent ages at the six-month follow-up (Table 2)
showed that the incidence rate in the vaccinated group
was signi®cantly lower than that of the control group
(P < 0.01). The results showed no obvious dierence
among vaccinated people of dierent ages.
Comparison of the incidence of all upper respiratory
infection symptoms (Table 3) showed that the rate in
the vaccinated group was reduced by 47.5%.
4. Discussion
Vaxigrip was strongly preventive against in¯uenza in
people of dierent ages in the People's Liberation
Army. The risks of both in¯uenza and the common
cold were reduced after 6 months' observation. During
the period of little risk of in¯uenza, in winter, in
Beijing in 1996, the incidence rate of in¯uenza infection was reduced by 71.7% after Vaxigrip administration, and that of upper respiratory infection was
reduced by 50%. Similar ecacy has been found in
other countries. There were virtually no dierences by
age. Preventive eects were seen from the reduction in
the occurrence of in¯uenza-like symptoms and the
common cold.
No serious adverse reactions were reported during
the observation period. In general, Vaxigrip can provide good protection against in¯uenza and the common cold.
