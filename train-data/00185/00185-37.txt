,4 reassortant cold-adapted (ca) influenza B experimental live attenuated intranasal vaccine was
evaluated for safety and immunogenicity in children by means of a blind, placebo controlled study.
The vaccine contained the haemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes, and the gene for its
non-structural proteins from wild-type (wt) B]Ann Arbor/I]86 virus, the contemporary strain at
the time of the study. Other genes were derived from ca B]Leningrad]14155 virus. No increase in
illness rates was seen in the children from ages 3-15 years given vaccine at maximum potency (a
one in two dilution of infectious allantoic fluid, having a titre of 107.o EIDso ) compared to children
given placebo. About 60% of seronegative children, ages 3-7 years, exhibited a detectible antibody
response following one dose of intranasal vaccine, with the seroresponse rate rising to > 70% aider
two doses of vaccine, lmmunogenicity was lowest in seropositive children age 8-15 years, reaching
a maximum of 36% after two doses. Results indicated that the vaccine was highly attenuated, and
probably of adequate immunogenicity for kindergarten age children. The lower immunogenicity in
older children suggests the vaccine might be overly attenuated for use in school-age childrep who
are more likely to have a history of prior natural infection with influenza B virus. Further chnicai
and epidemiological studies of protection are needed to fully assess this.

Introduction
Surveillance studies in the US and USSR have shown
that influenza B viruses have been primarily or jointly
responsible for epidemics in four of the past twelve
winters• Excess mortality attributed to influenza B was
noted in the US in 1979/80 for the first time since 1961/62
(Ref. 1). Other recent influenza B epidemics have also
been associated with severe morbidity in adults 2, and
excess mortality has been detected 3. Thus, influenza B
virus epidemics, for many years considered a problem
primarily for children, must also be considered of
importance for adults.

School children (as a group) are generally highly
susceptible to new influenza variants, and usually exhibit
the highest infection rates *-7. This results not only in
direct effects upon the children, but also indirect effects
upon family members who are often absent from work
to care for sick children. Furthermore, children may play
an important role in dissemination of influenza in the
community, contributing to the extent of epidemics in
adults. This point of view is supported by the positive
results of a mass-vaccination programme of schoolchildren, which not only reduced illnesses among children
but also reduced the total rate of infections in adults in the
same community 8. Widespread adoption of vaccination
programmes to reduce the impact of epidemics of
influenza would probably be facilitated by the availability
of live attenuated vaccines. These include an influenza B
component suitable for use in pre-school and school-age
children.
Although live-attenuated cold-adapted (ca) influenza
A vaccines have been used for mass vaccination
programmes in the USSR for several years, and a special
pediatric live vaccine has been developed 9'1°, there is far
less information about the development and application
of live influenza B vaccines. Candidate influenza A ca
vaccines have also been extensively evaluated in the US

Cold-adapted influenza B live attenuated intranasal vaccine: N.P. Obrosova-Serova et al.
during the past 10-15 years 9'~1, but again, far fewer
studies have been performed with live influenza B
vaccines. In both nations prototype ca vaccines for type
B influenza have been developed by procedures similar
to those used for influenza A, and in a few clinical trials
attenuation, immunogenicity or protection have been
evaluated with positive results in children or healthy
young adults x2-16. In Yugoslavia live influenza B ca
vaccines have in the past been prepared for public use
in conjunction with influenza A vaccines (personal
communication). Descriptions of these vaccines and
reports of the outcome of their use have not been
identified. More recently, reassortants of some of the
prototype candidate ca influenza B live vaccines have
been.developed in the US and USSR, which contain
antigens of more contemporary epidemic strains. Results
of clinical trials in the US have been reported for two of
these reassortants, each having different ca and wt
parents ~,~s. Studies in the US are now emphasizing one
of the ca parents, B/Ann Arbor/I/86. In the USSR, where
reassortant ca influenza B vaccines are also under
development ~9, initial studies focused on the ca parent
B/Leningrad/14/55. As described in an accompanying
article, this laboratory-derived variant is almost fully
attenuated in ferrets, and its markers of cold-adaptation
and ferret attenuation were readily transferred to a
reassortant virus having antigens of the contemporary
epidemic strain B/Ann Arbor/I/86.
In this report, the clinical evaluation of the reassortant
virus, which was prepared and evaluated within one
season of recognition of the B/Ann Arbor/l/86 antigenic
variant is described. The clinical evaluation described
was conducted in children of kindergarten and school
age, as such a population represents one of the most
important target groups for vaccination programmes to
directly reduce the impact of influenza B epidemics on
children, or to indirectly reduce the impact on adults
caring for ill children, or acquiring illness by transmission
of virus from children.
Materials and methods
Preparation of the candidate ca parent
vaccine strain
Laboratory properties of the parental ca attenuated
virus B/Leningrad/14/55, and its reassortant designated
LEN-B/14/5/1, are described in a companion paper z°.
The reassortant virus contains the genes coding for HA
and NA, as well as one other RNA segment (NS gene)
from the wt virus B/Ann Arbor/I/86, and all other genes
from the ca parent B/Leningrad/14/55. Monovalent
vaccine was grown in eggs, and lyophilized. At the time
of use vaccine was reconstituted, diluted 1:2 in distilled
water and administered by aerosol spray as previously
described 2°. In the present studies, residual vaccine left
at the end of the immunization activities was found to
have an infectivity titre of ~ 10 v° EID5o.
Vaccination protocol
Before use in children, vaccine was first evaluated in
healthy adult volunteers, and found not to cause febrile
or other reactions. In the pediatric studies, children 8-15
years were immunized first, and vaccination of children
3-7 years old not undertaken until the following week,
by which time it was evident that no significant illnesses
occurred in the older children receiving either coded
preparation (vaccine or placebo). The study was conducted during March-May 1987 in a children's boarding
school and a children's nursery in the suburbs of Moscow.
At the time of the study no evidence of circulation of
influenza B viruses in Moscow was reported to the
laboratory responsible for surveillance in the region.
Procedures for the study, including authorization from
Health and Educational Ministries and Departments,
and guardians of the children, randomization, inoculation, specimen collection and reaction monitoring were
similar to those previously described 21. Two intranasal
inoculations were given, at an interval of 3 weeks.
Serologic studies
Sera were collected by finger stick before the first and
second inoculations, and three weeks later. Separated
sera were stored at - 20°C with 0.1% sodium azide. The
sera were coded by scientists from the L.A. Tarasevich
SSC Institute before undertaking HI tests in Moscow.
Human group O red blood cells were used in the HI test
to provide adequate sensitivity without requiring ethertreatment of virus used as antigen; titres with chicken
erythrocytes were very low or undetectable, consistent
with known problems of performing HI tests for human
antibody to recent influenza B viruses 22'23. Microneutralization tests were performed in Atlanta as
previously described 24. B/Ann Arbor/I/86 virus was used
as antigen in all tests.
Results
Altogether 109 children received at least one dose of
vaccine, and 84 received their second dose. Placebo
(distilled water) was administered to 87 children at the
initial inoculation visit, and 69 received their second
inoculation of placebo. Due to lack of serum samples for
some children who were absent on one or other of the
follow up visits, laboratory findings are for slightly fewer
overall numbers of participants.
As seen by the low incidence of fevers or respiratory
symptoms in the four days of observation after each
inoculation, the vaccine was highly attenuated even in
the 3-7 year old children (Table I), who all lacked any
detectable neutralizing antibody at the time the study
began (not shown). Haemagglutination inhibition tests
and microneutralization tests correlated well in detecting
antibody responses, and each test detected a small
number of rises not observed with the other (Table 2).
Just over one half of the 3-7 year old children (who all
lacked pre-inoculation antibody) exhibited a detectable
antibody rise after one dose of vaccine, increasing to
>70% after the second dose of vaccine. Responses to
one or two doses of vaccine were slightly less frequent
in 8-15 year old children without evidence of pre-existing
antibody, and were only about one third to one half as
frequent in the children who had unequivocal evidence
of pre-existing antibody (neutralization titre > 25 prior
to first vaccination). Very few antibody rises were
measured in sera from recipients of placebo (5-8%). This
may have represented background levels of test variation,
or low rates of spread of vaccine virus to contacts of
children infected with virus. In the absence of virus
isolation results these possibilities cannot be reliably
distinguished.

Discussion
Results reported here and in a companion paper 2°
indicate the feasibility of fairly rapidly preparing a
reassortant ca influenza B vaccine with contemporary
antigens, characterizing the virus in the laboratory, and
undertaking clinical trials with a prime target group for
vaccination programmes. The LEN-B/14/5/1 reassortant
virus vaccine induced measurable HI or neutralizing
antibody in >70% of totally susceptible 3-7 year old
children. This is highty likely to be enough to provide
herd immunity in groups of children such as those in
kindergartens. Antibody response decreased in the next
age group of children (8-15 years), in part apparently
because of the existence of low levels of antibody from
prior natural infection, this being enough to prevent
infection by the vaccine. It is unknown for this situation,
as well as with other live influenza vaccines, whether
protection against infection by attenuated virus vaccine
correlates with protection against illness from wt virus
in an epidemic. Efficacy studies are needed to address
this question. It is also unknown whether, in drawing a
balance between attenuation and immunogenicity, it is
theoretically or practically possible to prepare a live
influenza B vaccine which could achieve a higher level
of immunization in older children or adults than observed
here without sacrificing safety in young children.
It is possible that the infectivity and immunogenicity
of live influenza vaccines might be affected by the nature
of the haemagglutinin in the wt virus or its reassortant
progeny used as vaccine. Thus, it has been suggested that
isolation of influenza virus in eggs may on some occasions
select a sub-population which differs slightly from virus
which is isolated in mammalian cell culture 25. One
consequence of this might be that influenza B viruses can
also naturally vary in their efficiency of replication in
man as a result of minor sequence variations in their
haemagglutinins. However, the consistency and significance of so-called 'host-selected variation' in terms of
the properties of vaccines is not clear 26. Continued
examination of this question appears necessary.
However, although it is desirable to continue research
and development to search for practical ways to improve
influenza vaccines, a continuing problem is the lack
of internationally accepted standards for the clinical
performance of influenza vaccines (inactivated or live) in
different populations. Consideration should be given to
establishing such requirements, taking into account both
the potential risks of influenza and the benefits to be
gained from vaccination, as well as the limits of current
vaccine technology.
For example, in the present case the LEN-B/14/5/1
reassortant virus appears on the basis of limited numbers
thus far tested to be a useful vaccine for prevention of
influenza in kindergartens. Although there is presently
no influenza control programme directed specifically at
the 3-7 year age group, reduction of influenza morbidity
in such a setting as kindergartens is an objective worthy of
serious consideration. Benefits would accrue not only to
the pre-school children, but also to their parents or other
family members who might need to remain at home to
care for them when too ill to attend school.
