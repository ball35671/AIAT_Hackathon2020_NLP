ABSTRACT
OBJECTIVE. The objective of this study was to assess the safety of routine trivalent
influenza vaccine (TIV) administration among healthy children 6 through 23
months of age, after the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommendation.
METHODS. The study was a retrospective case-control study of children receiving TIV
in the first 2 seasons after the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices
recommendation. We assessed outcomes in the 42 days after vaccination in a
population of 13 383 children. Each case subject was matched, according to age
and gender, with 3 control subjects. Hazard ratios were calculated with conditional
logistic regression analysis.
RESULTS. We found no statistically significantly elevated hazard ratios for the first TIV
dose. An elevated risk of pharyngitis was found for children receiving a second TIV
dose. No elevated risk of seizure was found.
CONCLUSION. These results, for a population of healthy children, showed no medically
significant adverse events related to TIV among children 6 to 23 months of age.

NFLUENZA IS KNOWN to be an important source of
morbidity and death among children 2 years of age.
The Colorado influenza experience in 2003, when the
influenza season began early and children experienced a
large number of severe cases, including at least 11 deaths
resulting from respiratory complications, highlighted for
many parents the importance of influenza vaccination.1
The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices
(ACIP) recommended in 2002 that all children 6 to 23
months of age receive influenza vaccine.2 The American
Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of
Family Physicians have concurred regarding this recommendation.3 In 2004 to 2005, the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention reported that 48.4% of children
6 to 23 months of age received the influenza vaccine.4
There is a consensus, however, that study of the safety
and efficacy of the influenza vaccine among young children should continue.5
A review of Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System
(VAERS) reports from 1990 to 2003, covering the period
before and after the recommendation for general immunization, found that the number of reports had increased
since the recommendation for general administration
but the types of reports were similar to those received in
the earlier period. The most commonly observed, possibly vaccine-associated, adverse events were fever, urticarial rash, seizure, and injection site reactions.6 The
authors recommended additional surveillance, especially
for seizures. Using the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD),
France et al7 examined medically attended events in the
2 weeks after vaccination among children 18 years of
age, from 1991 to 1999 (before routine administration
among young children), and found no worrisome signals. Among children 6 to 23 months of age, they found
possible increases in rates of atopic dermatitis and impetigo. The signal for atopic dermatitis disappeared after
chart review found that many of the apparent cases
involved follow-up treatment. The impetigo cases were
found to be incident cases, but none was found at the
injection site. The VSD is now updating that study with
more recent data. At present, however, there are no
epidemiologic studies of the safety of trivalent influenza
vaccine (TIV) among healthy young children.
These knowledge gaps are important for pediatric
practice. In a recent survey of parents, Humiston et al8
found that nearly 80% intended to immunize their children but almost one half of parents were concerned
about the safety of the vaccine. An earlier survey of
pediatricians and family practice physicians found that
more than one half were worried about potential safety
issues regarding vaccination of infants and toddlers with
the influenza vaccine.9 Therefore, both clinicians and
parents seek more information about the vaccine risk/
benefit calculation for otherwise healthy children. This
article reports a retrospective case-control study of possibly vaccine-associated adverse events among children
6 to 23 months of age during the first 2 influenza seasons
after recommendation of the vaccine for routine vaccination among young children.
METHODS
Study Design
We conducted a retrospective case-control study to identify vaccine-associated adverse events during the first 2
seasons after the ACIP recommendation. Outcomes
studied were chosen on the basis of findings observed in
our population in the 42 days after vaccination. Case
subjects were matched, according to birth date and gender, with 3 children who did not have that outcome.
Each outcome was treated in a separate analysis; therefore, the same child could be in multiple analyses as a
case or control subject. The index date for the control
subjects was the date of the event for the case subject.
Conditional logistic regression analysis, controlling for
all vaccine exposures in the 42-day window, was used to
estimate a conditional hazard ratio and to adjust for
other variables.
Study Setting
The study was conducted with data on enrollees in the
HealthPartners Medical Group (HPMG) who were between the ages of 6 and 23 months (inclusive) when the
TIV was administered (approximately October 1 of each
season through March 31) in the 2002 to 2003 and 2003
to 2004 vaccine seasons. The actual first vaccine dates
were September 18, 2002, and September 25, 2003. The
actual last dates were March 21, 2003, and April 8, 2004.
HPMG serves 300 000 patients in the Minneapolis/St.
Paul metropolitan area, through 19 clinics and 200
physicians.
Eligibility
Eligibility for the study was defined on the basis of age
and enrollment in the study medical group. Age was
defined as being between 6 and 23 months for 1 day
during the TIV period defined above. Enrollment in the
HPMG for 1 day during the study period was required.
To avoid counting children who did not receive services
through the HPMG, we also required each eligible child
to have 1 diagnostic code for a HPMG clinic during the
study period.
Exposure Definition
All case and control subjects were evaluated for exposure to TIV. Children in this age group are scheduled to
receive numerous other routine childhood immunizations, which are often administered at the same time as
the TIV. The case-control design allowed us to test for
this kind of effect with multivariate modeling. To control
for this effect, we examined exposure to all vaccines, not
only the TIV. A dummy variable was created to indicate
e822 GOODMAN et al
Downloaded from pediatrics.aappublications.org at University of Connecticut on May 26, 2015
each vaccine received. Vaccine exposure information
was gathered from the HPMG vaccine registry. The registry contains the date of each vaccination and additional
information on the vaccine (such as lot number and type
of vaccine).
Vaccine-naive children should have 2 TIV injections,
4 weeks apart. Because the separate safety profiles of
the 2 vaccine doses have not been established, we coded
whether a dose was the first or second vaccine dose with
separate dummy variables. If the vaccination was given
on the day of condition onset, then the case was considered unexposed unless treatment for the condition was
administered in an inpatient or emergency setting, because conditions treated in the clinic on the same day as
vaccination might have been present before vaccination.
Outcomes
Outcomes were defined in 2 ways. First, our physician
investigators reviewed observed diagnoses in the exposed population for possible outcomes of interest. The
observed diagnoses were clustered and additional International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification diagnoses were added to create logically complete outcome classes. The outcome classes and
their diagnostic codes, as defined by our physician investigators, are shown in Table 1. Except for urticaria,
the risk window for these outcomes was 0 to 42 days.
For urticaria, the risk window was 0 to 3 days. Second,
to replicate the limited existing literature, we defined the
same categories and time periods as used by France et al7
(the Colorado VSD team). Table 1 contains only additional disease classes separate from those defined by
France et al.7 Combining our outcomes with the outcomes used by France et al7 resulted in 58 unique conditions. However, only 26 outcomes had individuals
with TIV exposure in the previous 42 days; therefore,
the other 32 outcomes were not evaluated further and
no risk was imputed.
The Colorado VSD team defined immediate events
with a risk window of 0 to 3 days, acute events with a
window of 4 to 14 days, and delayed events with a
period of 14 to 42 days. We conducted a similar analysis
of our data.
Outcomes were verified through physician chart review. The goal of the chart review was to determine
whether the event fit the definition of the condition of
interest and to determine the date of onset. The most
common example of an outcome not fitting a diagnostic
code was in the rheumatologic disease category. Several
outcomes coded this way were instead a result of
trauma. Influenza, defined with International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification
codes 487, 487.0, 487.1, and 487.8, was also identified as
an outcome.
Statistical Methods
Conditional logistic regression models were fit by using
the PHREG procedure in the SAS system (SAS Institute,
Cary, NC) to handle the 1:3-matched, case-control,
study design.10 Explanatory variables included exposure
to TIV, measles-mumps-rubella vaccine, diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis vaccine, inactivated polio vaccine, Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine, varicella vaccine, and pneumococcal conjugate vaccine during the
risk windows of interest. Variables with P values of .05
were considered statistically significant.
No correction was made for multiple comparisons.
The basic idea is that, with n comparisons, the probability that 1 will be significant is [1  (1  )n].11 For 26
comparisons, the probability of finding 1 statistically
significant comparison is 73.6%. A multiple-comparison
procedure would adjust  down from .05, so that the
overall probability of finding a significant effect would be
5%. In early safety studies of a new agent, this would
make the results unnecessarily conservative; therefore,
we did not make a correction for multiple comparisons.
We had the power to detect as significant hazard
ratios of varying sizes, depending on the number of cases
observed (Table 2). Power was calculated a priori with
PASS software.12

The study was approved by the HealthPartners Research
Foundation institutional review board.
RESULTS
In the HPMG, 13 383 individuals met our inclusion criteria and 3697 received vaccines during the study window (Table 3). The mean ages of the exposed and unexposed groups were similar. Male and female subjects
were equally likely to receive the vaccine.
Table 4 shows hazard ratios for conditions that were
estimable given our data set. For each condition, the
estimate for each vaccine and the confidence interval
(CI) are shown. Where no estimate is shown, the data
were insufficient for estimation of a hazard ratio and CI.
The CIs were large for all vaccines and effects. Only
reactive airway disease approached significance (P 
.10) for the first TIV injection, and this effect was protective. Two of the first TIV hazard ratios were 2.0, but
the lower limit of the CIs nearly reached 0.0, indicating
extremely wide variation in these estimates. For the
second TIV injection, 3 hazard ratios approached or
achieved statistical significance. Pharyngitis (P  .0090)
was more common after the second TIV administration.
The second TIV dose was protective for sinusitis (P 
.0707). Bacterial infection approached statistical significance (P  .0570), but the results were based on only 5
cases (only 2 with prior exposure to TIV).
To test for the possible protective effect of the TIV, we
used exposure to either TIV dose in the 42 days before
influenza. With this test, influenza vaccination was
highly protective (hazard ratio: 0.104; 95% CI: 0.013–
0.813; P  .0309).
DISCUSSION
This study indicates that adverse events possibly attributable to influenza vaccination among healthy young
children are unusual. Only pharyngitis had an increased
hazard ratio and then only with the second dose. This is
a common and usually mild event. Although our design
should control for seasonal effects and age, the increase
in these conditions with the second dose may reflect a
seasonal effect, because the second TIV dose is given 4
weeks after the first.
Our results are similar to those of earlier studies that
found only random mild effects. Compared with France
et al,7 whose data were from a period before the ACIP
recommendations, we found no evidence of other significant adverse events. Unlike France et al,7 we used a
case-control design and broader window to measure
effects. The design is the result of our smaller population,
compared with the VSD. The VSD study also separated
time windows and inpatient, outpatient, and emergency
department events. We did not find support for their
finding of increased impetigo rates. McMahon et al,6
using spontaneous VAERS reports, found that the most
common reactions were fever, seizure, urticarial rash,
and injection site reactions. We did not find support in
our data for increased rates of any of these reactions.
The authors of the VAERS report called specifically
for investigation of seizures.6 In the VAERS data, seizures were found within 3 days after vaccination. Neither our work nor the work by France et al7 found
support for an increased seizure rate.7 We did not have
the power to test such a short time window for seizures.
With a 42-day window, we had 80% power to detect a
hazard ratio of 2.27 with 2 control subjects per case
subject.
Given the number of comparisons both in our study
and in the prior work, it is not surprising that increased
and decreased hazard ratios were found for some minor
events. When the VSD codes and our codes were combined, we were testing for 26 possible effects with 2
vaccinations. By chance alone, we would expect to find
several statistically significant effects at the P  .05 level.
The events found in the published literature differed, as
would be expected if the elevated rates occurred through
chance alone.
The only events that seemed to increase significantly
were minor and were related to the second TIV dose.
Our control matching, ie, including only children with
no history of a previous event in the outcome class,
might have biased us to observe these events among
younger children receiving the second TIV dose. This is
because it was more difficult, for common events such as
pharyngitis, to find matching children who had not experienced the event of interest previously. Also, because
the incidence of pharyngitis increases during the winter
months, we were more likely to detect a spurious relationship with the second TIV dose. We think that additional research regarding adverse events related to the
spacing of the second dose may be warranted. For our
population, 80% of second injections were administered 27 to 42 days after the first TIV injection; this is
approximately the recommended interval. However, a
recent study in Seattle, Washington, found that, when
the components of the vaccine do not change, it is feaTABLE 3 Description of Population Eligible for Vaccination

Although this study was not powered to test the
effectiveness of influenza vaccination among young children, we found that influenza vaccination was highly
protective. However, this was not a robust test of this
question, because the study included only influenza
cases within 42 days after influenza vaccination and not
all influenza cases for the season.
Our study evaluated rigorously the safety of routine
administration of TIV among infants, with a population
treated entirely in the post-ACIP recommendation period. Our design considered the first and (if applicable)
second injections in a season separately, in addition to
other vaccines received, while controlling for age and
season. These design strengths give us confidence that
our identification of only minor events is robust despite
our fairly small study population. Because all events
were identified with electronic data and validated with
chart review, we are confident that our outcomes represent real events and that exposures were measured
accurately. These findings should be useful to clinicians
in reassuring parents about the safety of routine influenza vaccination.
Limitations were as follows. We defined TIV doses
within season; this put 2 different groups into the same
exposure category, ie, vaccine-naive children (who should
receive a second dose) and children who received TIV in
a previous season. Given sufficient power, these exposures should be separated. However, with only 2 seasons
of data, we did not have sufficient power for this separation.
Some case subjects were not included in the analysis
because we were unable to find matched control subjects. This affected mostly the common outcome classes
from the study by France et al7 (eg, common cold and
otitis media), because the number of children with no
prior occurrence of the event of interest in their lifetimes
was low. This tradeoff required by our matched casecontrol design was considered acceptable to ensure a
comparable control group.
