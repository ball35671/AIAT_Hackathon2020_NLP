Three groups of children were immunized with an inactivated Port Chalmers
(H3ChN2Ch) influenza vaccine (group A), a neuraminidase-specific (HeqlN2Ch) influenza vaccine (group B), or a placebo. Immunization induced seroconversion for H3Chand N2Ch-specific antibody in group A and for N2Ch antibody in group B. The protective efficacies observed against naturally acquired illness with the Port Chalmers strain
of influenza A virus were 68.70/0 and 37.4% in groups A and B, respectively, in comparison to the placebo group, and those against illness produced by the subsequent outbreak of the Victoria strain were 80.0% and 72.7%. These data support the role of
neuraminidase-specific immunization in protection against influenza. Although the
degree of protection after vaccination with the HeqlN2Ch vaccine was less than that
provided by the biphasic H3ChN2Ch vaccine against the Port Chalmers strain, it appeared to be similar in the two vaccine study groups against the Victoria strain.
Specific immunoprophylaxis against infection
with influenza A virus has been available for
almost three decades, and yet influenza A virus infections continue to remain a major public health
problem. Vaccines for the control of influenza A
virus have traditionally comprised inactivated or
live, attenuated strains of the prevalent or anticipated antigenic subtypes of the virus and contained both of the major surface antigens of the
virus: the hemagglutinin and the neuraminidase.
These types of vaccines have resulted in a high
degree of seroconversion for antibody. However,
protection against clinical disease after natural infection is at best minimal and of short duration
unless the vaccine strain is antigenically very
similar to the prevailing strain [1]. Recent studies
have suggested an important role for antibodies to
neuraminidase (AbNA) in immunity to influenza
[2-4]. Although AbNA do not prevent the establishment of infection, they appear to limit the

spread of virus and thus alter the nature and
severity of infection [4, 5]. Based on these observations, Kilbourne et al. [6] have proposed the use
of monospecific neuraminidase vaccines for immunoprophylaxis against influenza.
The present studies were designed to evaluate
the reactogenicity and immunogenicity of a neuraminidase-specific vaccine in school children and
to assess its effect on the outcome of natural infection with influenza A virus. We have previously
repo~ted the preliminary results of these studies involving one-third of the study population and the
outcome of one natural outbreak of influenza [7].
The present report presents our findings on the entire study population and two natural outbreaks
of influenza.
Materials and Methods
Vaccines. Preparations of two influenza virus
vaccines were used in these investigations: a conventional, inactivated Port Chalmers (H3ChN2Ch)
influenza vaccine (X-41) and a recombinant influenza vaccine (X-42), produced by the genetic hybridization of an equine and the Port Chalmers
strains of influenza virus. The progeny strain used
for immunization contained equine hemagglutinin
(Heql) and the Port Chalmers neuraminidase
(N2Ch) antigens. Vaccine diluent used for the reconstitution of X-41 or X-42 vaccine was used as a
placebo control. All vaccine preparations were
 at University of Arizona on September 5, 2015 http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from 
Neuraminidase-Specific Influenza Vaccine
produced by Merrell National Laboratories, Cincinnati, Ohio. The reciprocal hemagglutinin titers
of the X-41 and X-42 vaccines were 3,027 and
1,024, respectively, as determined by the precision
fractional dilution technique [8]. The X-41 vaccine
contained 2.3-fold more neuraminidase activity
than did the X-42 vaccine.
Study population. The study population consisted of 875 healthy children from the Buffalo,
N. Y., public school system. Written informed
consent for immunization with the influenza vaccines and participation in the study was obtained
from the parents or guardians of these children.
This study was reviewed and approved by the Buffalo Children's Hospital Human Experimentation
Committee.
The children ranged in age from seven to 14
years; both sexes were represented in approximately equal proportions. The children were randomly divided into three groups and immunized
under code. Group A consisted of 300 children
who were immunized with the X-41 (H3ChN2Ch)
vaccine; an additional 300 children (group B) were
immunized with the X-42 (HeqlN2Ch) vaccine.
Group C included 275 children who were immunized with the vaccine diluent alone (placebo). All
of the children were inoculated with a single dose
of 0.5 ml of the vaccine in September-November
1974. Serum samples were obtained before and at
regular intervals after vaccination for determination of antibody responses to the different strains
of influenza virus.
Influenza outbreaks. Two natural outbreaks
of influenza A virus occurred during the study
period. An outbreak of the Port Chalmers strain
was observed in the winter of 1974-1975, and infection with the Victoria strain was demonstrated
in the winter of 1975-1976. Evidence of Port
Chalmers infection was first demonstrated in Buffalo in the middle of December 1974, at least one
month after the completion of the immunization
of the study population. The peak activity of this
outbreak occurred in January-February 1975,
although sporadic cases were documented until
the middle of April 1975. From January to March
1976, outbreak of infection with the Victoria
strain occurred in the study population.
Clinical evaluation ofvaccinees. Data on reactogenicity of influenza immunization were obtained primarily through telephone calls and a
questionnaire mailed to the parents of the vac845
cinees. All children who reported any reactions on
the initial telephone contact were immediately examined by a physician and evaluated for the
degree of reactogenicity. Follow-up monitoring for
vaccine reactions was for one to four weeks after
administration of the vaccine. The extent and
nature of clinical illness in the vaccinees during the
subsequent outbreaks of natural influenza infection were evaluated by examination of all sick children within 24 hr.
Serum was collected from the children during
the peak activity of influenza infection regardless
of the clinical state of infection in individuals. In
addition, serum specimens were collected at threeto six-month intervals from the time of immunization until the termination of the study.
Serologic testing. Serum samples collected for
serologic evaluation were stored at - 20 C before
testing. HAl antibody activity was determined by
a standard microtiter procedure [8], using pretreatment with receptor-destroying enzymes, four
hemagglutinin units of influenza virus, and
chicken erythrocytes as indicator cells. Since
AbNA have been shown to effect the binding of
hemagglutinin to the erythrocyte by steric hindrance [9, 10], the immunizing antigen was not
used as the testing antigen in the HAl assay.
Samples were tested for specific H3Ch HAl antibody using the recombinant strain H3ChNeqi as
the test antigen. Serum samples from study groups
immunized with HeqlN2Ch were tested for specific Heql and H3Ch HAl antibody activity, using
HeqlNeql or the parental wild-type H3ChN2Ch as
the test antigens, respectively. HAl titers of >1:8
were considered positive for antibody.
AbNA titers were determined by a neuraminidase-inhibition assay [3, 11]. A suspension of
recombinant virus consisting of the hemagglutinin
antigen of avian influenza virus and the neuraminidase antigen of the Port Chalmers strain
(N2Ch) was used as the test antigen. AbNA titers
were expressed as the reciprocal of the dilution
that inhibited 500/0 of the enzyme activity. AbNA
titers of 4 were considered positive for antibody
in these studies. All serum samples collected before immunization were tested for the specific
HAl antibody activity to H3Ch and Heql antigens.
The evidence of seroconversion after immunization was obtained by demonstrating a fourfold or
greater rise in HAl and AbNA antibody titers one
month after immunization. Serologic evidence of

naturally acquired infection was obtained by testing the serum specimens collected in the acute
phase and one month after the onset of respiratory
illness. Serum specimens collected before and
after the peak of the influenza outbreaks were
tested to obtain data on natural infection in subjects who did not manifest respiratory illness. A
fourfold or greater rise in antibody titer was considered evidence of recent infection.
Cultivation of virus. The following strains of
influenza virus were used for serologic testing: A2
Port Chalmers/73 (H3ChN2Ch); A2/Port Chalmers/73-A/equine/56 (H3ChNeql); A/equine/
56-A2/Port Chalmers/73 (HeqlN2Ch); A/avianA2/Port Chalmers/73 (HavN2Ch); and A/equine/
56 (HeqlNeq1). All viruses were grown in embryonated chicken eggs from stock viruses furnished
by Drs. E. D. Kilbourne (New York, N. Y.), R. G.
Webster (Memphis, Tenn.), and J. Schulman
(New York, N. Y.). Viral pools were prepared by
allantoic inoculation of embryonated chicken
eggs. Allantoic fluid was harvested, pooled, clarified by centrifugation, and stored at - 85 C.
These preparations were used as antigens for serologic testing.
Results
Reactogenicity. Clinical reactogenicity observed in the population of vaccinated children is
presented in table 1. Although mild local and systemic reactions were observed in both vaccinated
groups, most vaccinees manifested no local or systemic reactions. Local erythema and swelling were
observed in 30010 and 11010 of group A and 25010
and 10010 of group B children, respectively. Local
erythema was observed in 7010 of group C (placebo) children, but no local swelling of the immuniBeutner et at.
zation site was seen. None of the children had erythema or swelling exceeding 10 mm in diameter,
and in most cases the local reactions resolved
within three to four days. The frequency of
erythema and swelling in the vaccinated children
(groups A and B) was significantly higher (P <
0.02) than in the placebo controls. However, the
degree of reactogenicity between group A and
group B was not significantly different.
No systemic reactions were observed in 75010 of
the children in group A, 77010 in group B, and 91010
in group C (table 1). The frequency of subjective
symptoms such as headache, nausea, and general
malaise was relatively low in all groups, although
these symptoms occurred more frequently in
groups A and B than in the placebo group. Febrile
reactions occurred with greater frequency (P <
0.02) in both groups of influenza-vaccinated children; 13010 of the children in group A and 17010 in
group B developed a temperature of 100 F-I03 F
within 48 hr of vaccination. Only three children
(l 010) in the placebo group developed pyrexia of
100 F-103 F after vaccination. All pyrexial reactions were transient and were not associated with
seizures or any other concomitant side effects. No
fevers were reported one week after immunization
by any of the children. No demonstrable correlation existed among the ages of the children, the
level of HAl antibody of AbNA activity, and the
presence or severity of local or systemic reactions.
Preimmunization serologic status. All of the
children were seronegative for Heq1, and 80010 and
90010 were seronegative for H3Ch and N2Ch antibody activity (table 2).

previously seronegative children are presented in
table 2. Immunization with H3ChN2Ch vaccine
(group A) resulted in H3Ch antibody conversion in
90% of the children, and the reciprocal mean
H3Ch antibody titer was 69.5, whereas immunization with HeqlN2Ch (group B) and placebo (group
C) induced essentially no H3Ch antibody activity.
Seventy-six percent of the children in group A and
93% in group B responded to N2Ch. No response
was observed in the placebo-treated children
(group C). The mean N2Ch antibody titer in group
B was threefold higher than that observed in
group A.
Approximately 160/0 of HeqlN2Ch-vaccinated
(group B) children gave an Heql antibody response. The reciprocal mean Heql antibody titer
in group B was 14.6. No Heql antibody response
was observed in H3ChN2Ch-vaccinated (group A)
and placebo-treated (group C) children (table 2).
The H3Ch and N2Ch antibody responses after
immunization in group A children who were
previously seropositive for H3Ch or N2Ch antibody was characterized by a fourfold or greater
rise in preexisting antibody titers in 930/0 of these
children whereas a fourfold or greater rise was
observed in 30% and 100% of previously seropositive group B children to H3Ch and N2Ch,
respectively. No booster response was observed in
the placebo group (group C).
Outbreak of Port Chalmers strain. The
greatest number of isolations of the Port
Chalmers strain of influenza A virus was observed
in January-February 1975. A fourfold or greater
rise in the H3Ch-specific antibody titer during the
outbreak was considered diagnostic of infection.
Based on serologic documentation of infection, 70
children in group A, 119 in group B, and 123 in
group C were found to be infected during the outbreak of Port Chalmers strain (table 3). The
number of children who were infected with influenza was 28, 56, and 82 in groups A, B, and C,
respectively (table 3). Based on these observations,

was 68.7 for group A (H3ChN2Ch) and 37.4 for
group B (HeqlN2Ch).
The reciprocal geometric mean titers of H3Chand N2Ch-specific antibody observed after immunization and correlation with outcome of subsequent natural infection with the Port Chalmers
strain are presented in table 4. In children in
whom infection with the Port Chalmers strain was
associated with clinical illness, the mean reciprocal
H3Ch and N2Ch titers were 5.4 and 6.3 for group
A, 2.8 and 16 for group B, and 3 and 2.5 for group
C, respectively. In children infected with the Port
Chalmers strain without clinical illness, the H3Ch
and N2Ch titers in group A subjects were 35.6 and
62, respectively. However, in HeqlN2Ch-vaccinated children (group B), although H3Ch antibody titers were very low (mean, 3.6) and similar
to those of the ill children, the mean N2Ch antibody titer was 120, about twofold greater than
observed in group A children. The mean N2Ch antibody titer of group B children infected without
illness was 10 times greater than that observed in
infected group B children. The highest titers of
both H3Ch and N2Ch antibodies before the outbreak were observed in uninfected children,
although the titers of H3Ch antibody of such
children among the group B and group C vaccinees were lower than those observed in group A
children (table 4).
Outbreak of Victoria strain. A minor outbreak of infection with the Victoria strain of inBeutner et al.
fluenza A virus occurred in Buffalo in the winter
of 1976 (January-March 1976). Most of the
children previously immunized with influenza
virus vaccine and followed during the Port
Chalmers outbreak in 1974-1975 were available
for evaluation during the outbreak of the Victoria
strain. The children available for evaluation included 220 in group A, 201 in group B, and 185 in
group C. The frequency of infection with Victoria
strain (H3VicN2Vic) observed in the population is
presented in table 3. Using a fourfold or greater
rise in antibody titer as the criterion for infection,
35 children in group A, 45 in group B, and 73 in
group C were found to be infected with the Victoria strain. Of these, nine, 12, and 38 children in
groups A, B, and C, respectively, were infected
with illness (table 3). Unlike infection with the
Port Chalmers strain, the protective efficacies
against illness following infection with the Victoria strain were remarkably similar in group A
(80.1070) and group B (72.7%) (table 3).
The relationship between the preexisting H3Ch
and N2Ch antibody titers and the outcome of
subsequent infection with Victoria strain is
presented in table 4. Relatively high titers of
H3Ch- and N2Ch-specific antibody were observed
in uninfected children regardless of the vaccine
they had received. Children asymptomatically infected with the Victoria strain manifested N2Ch
AbNA titers three- to fivefold greater than
symptomatic infected children. Symptomatic and

asymptomatic infected subjects had comparable
H3Ch-specific antibody titers. H3Vic HAl antibody titers prior to the outbreak of the Victoria
strain were low and similar in all groups (table 4).
The antibody titers presented here represent levels
before the outbreak of the Port Chalmers strain
and before the outbreak of the Victoria strain.
H3Ch and N2Ch antibody titers of group B
children were four- to lO-fold greater before the
outbreak of the Victoria strain in comparison to
the titers of the same group before the outbreak of
the Port Chalmers strain.
Discussion
The present clinical trial conducted with conventional Port Chalmers (H3ChN2Ch) and neuraminidase-specific (HeqlN2Ch) recombinant inactivated vaccines- in healthy school children has
shown that both vaccines are safe and immunogenic.
Analysis of antibody titers prior to both outbreaks of natural and influenza infection indicated that uninfected children had relatively
high titers of H3Ch- and N2Ch-specific antibody.
Children infected but not ill demonstrated mean
N2Ch-specific AbNA titers three- to lO-fold
greater than those observed in ill children.
Children manifesting clinical illness after infection
exhibited low H3Ch and N2Ch antibody activity.
The asymptomatically infected children had
similar low H3Ch antibody titers, but their N2Ch
titers were approximately three- to l5-fold higher
than in the symptomatic children. These findings
indicated that AbNA activity may provide a certain degree of protection against clinical illness.
This observation is consistent with other studies
that have shown that antibody to hemagglutinin
can prevent infection [12, 13] and that AbNA, by
preventing cell-to-cell spread of influenza virus, is
protective against illness but not infection [2-5].
Kilbourne et al. initially proposed the rationale
for the use of a monospecific neuraminidase vaccine for immunoprophylaxis against influenza [6].
They suggested that (1) immunization with neuraminidase monospecific vaccine would result in a
specific AbNA response in the absence of a
response to hemagglutin; (2) subsequent natural
homotypic infection in such vaccinees may result
in minimal clinical disease and (3) at the same time
result in the appearance of HAl antibodies and a
849
significant booster effect on preexisting AbNA
titers; and (4) this balanced HAl and AbNA
response would provide protection against reinfection and clinical illness following subsequent exposures to influenza A viruses with similar antigenic composition of neuraminidase. The
serologic responses following immunization and
our results with the Port Chalmers outbreak confirm the first two points of this hypothesis, namely, that immunization with monospecific neuraminidase vaccine results in a specific AbNA
response and that such vaccinees, while not being
significantly protected against influenza infection,
had some degree of protection against illness. The
protective efficacy of the monospecific neuraminidase vaccine against illness following infection with the Port Chalmers strain was 37.5 as
compared with placebo.
Studies conducted during the second outbreak
of influenza virus infection (Victoria strain) indicated that preexisting H3ChN2Ch antibody activity afforded an appreciable degree of protection
against infection with the Victoria strain. The
rates of influenza infection of both vaccine groups
were similar and two- to three-fold less than that
of the placebo group. Calculation of the protective efficacies indicated that both H3ChN2Ch- and
HeqlN2Ch-vaccinated subjects were protected to
the same degree against infection and illness produced by the Victoria strain of influenza A virus.
It should be noted that the H3Ch antibody titers of
the HeqlN2Ch vaccinees were four- to ninefold
greater after the Port Chalmers outbreak as compared with levels before the outbreak.
One of the difficulties in the present report
relates to the rather low levels of H3Vic HAl antibody activity observed in the serum samples obtained after the epidemic of the Port Chalmers
strain in this study population. The general experience would suggest a much higher degree of
H3Vic antibody activity after Port Chalmers infection than was observed. The explanation for this
apparent discrepancy is not available from the
present data, but it could possibly be related to the
use of a viral antigen for HAl testing that might
have been of a lower avidity than used by other
laboratories.
The present study partially confirms the third
and fourth points of the monospecific neuraminidase vaccination hypothesis presented by Kilbourne et al. [6]. Following a second influenza
 at University of Arizona on September 5, 2015 http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from 
850
outbreak (Victoria strain), the HeqlN2Ch-vaccine
recipients were protected against infection and illness. This protection, however, was no better than
that afforded by immunization with a conventional biphasic influenza vaccine (H3ChN2Ch).
The reduction of morbidity is a major goal of
influenza immunization. There are two sources of
morbidity that should be considered in the evaluation of parenteral immunization, namely, the vaccination process itself and illness following subsequent natural infection. As has been discussed
above, reactions to immunization with these two
vaccines were in general mild, but a significant
number of systemic reactions (headache, nausea
and vomiting, soreness, aching, chills, fever) was
observed. The biphasic and neuraminidase monospecific vaccine groups had a lower number of influenza infections as well as a lower incidence of
illness associated with infection as compared with
the placebo group. Considering total morbidity,
112, 137, and 145 episodes of systemic reactions to
vaccination and!or illness following natural influenza infection were observed in the recipients
of the biphasic vaccine, neuraminidase-specific
vaccine, and placebo, respectively. Thus, the
overall morbidity observed in the HeqlN2Ch vaccinees was similar to that of the placebo group
while the morbidity of the biphasic vaccinees was
less than either neuraminidase-specific or placebo
groups.
The present study has demonstrated that the
X-41 (H3ChN2Ch) and X-42 (HeqlN2Ch) influenza A virus vaccines are safe and immunogenic in
school-age children, that AbNA activity may protect against illness but not infection, and that the
rationale of monospecific neuraminidase vaccination is basically correct. However, monospecific
neuraminidase immunization offered no significant advantage over the conventional biphasic
vaccine.
