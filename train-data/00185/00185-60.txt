a b s t r a c t
Background: Excellent immune responses following 1 or 2 doses of the monovalent inactivated pandemic
H1N1 vaccines have been documented, but the effectiveness of these vaccines against laboratoryconfirmed H1N1 infections in the general population is not clear. We evaluated the effectiveness of the
pandemic H1N1 and seasonal trivalent influenza vaccines (TIV) used during the 2009 mass vaccination
campaign in Manitoba (Canada) in preventing laboratory-confirmed H1N1 infections.
Methods: A population-based case–control study using data from Cadham Provincial Laboratory (CPL) and
the Manitoba Immunization Monitoring System (MIMS). All Manitoba residents ≥6 months of age who
had a respiratory specimen tested at CPL for H1N1 were included in the study. Cases were individuals
who tested positive for pandemic H1N1 influenza A by reverse transcriptase-PCR (N = 1435). Controls
were individuals who tested negative for both influenza A and B (N = 2309). Information on receipt of
TIV or H1N1 vaccine was obtained by record linkage with MIMS, the population-based province-wide
immunization registry.
Results: Overall,the adjuvanted H1N1 vaccine was 86% (95%CI 75–93%) effective in preventing laboratoryconfirmed H1N1 infections when vaccination occurred ≥14 days before testing. Effectiveness seemed
lower among older (≥50 years) individuals [51% (−51 to 84%)] and among those with immunocompromising conditions [67% (−13 to 90%)]. There was also evidence that the H1N1 vaccine might be less
effective among those who had received the 2009/10 TIV.
Discussion: The adjuvanted H1N1 vaccine used during Manitoba’s H1N1 mass vaccination campaign was
highly effective against laboratory-confirmed pandemic H1N1 infection, especially among children and
younger adults.

1. Introduction
Excellentimmune responses following 1 or 2 doses ofthe monovalentinactivatedpandemicH1N1 vaccineshave beendocumented
in several immunogenicity trials [1–3]. Based on these results and
on experience with other influenza vaccines, it is assumed that
these vaccines could afford significant protection against H1N1
infections [4]. However, estimates of immunogenicity against the
vaccine strain, as measured by hemagglutination-inhibition (HI)
under the controlled conditions of clinical trials, do not necessarily translate into actual protection against all circulating pandemic
strains in community settings. Also,these trials were generally limited to younger healthy individuals, so the effectiveness of these
vaccines among the elderly and high-risk populations (e.g., the
immunocompromised) is not clear.

Since the first confirmed case of pandemic H1N1 in the Canadian province of Manitoba was detected on May 3, 2009, there
have been two epidemic waves; one between mid-May and the end
of June 2009, and the other during the 2009/10 influenza season,
which occurred predominantly between October and December of
2009 [5,6]. A total of 803 laboratory-confirmed cases of pandemic
H1N1 were reported during the first wave and additional 1866
laboratory-confirmed cases were reported during the second wave
[6]. Mass immunization against pandemic H1N1 commenced October 26th 2010 using primarily large scale vaccination clinics led by
public health teams and lasted approximately 8 weeks. Initially,
the Canadian-manufactured Arepanrix®, an AS03-adjuvanted split
virion pandemic H1N1 vaccine (GlaxoSmithKline [GSK]), was used
to vaccinate adults and children over 6 months of age. Later on, two
nonadjuvanted vaccines, from CSL Limited and GSK, were offered
to pregnant women and children over 10 years of age. The seasonal
trivalent inactivated influenza vaccines (TIV)—Fluviral® (GSK) and
Vaxigrip® (Sanofi Pasteur)—were less frequently administered.
All vaccines were offered free of charge, but limited vaccine
supply at campaign start necessitated the development of priority
groups for early vaccination. The initial priority group in Manitoba included health care workers, Aboriginal persons, pregnant
women, 6–60 months-old children, individuals under 65 years with
chronic medical conditions, immunocompromised individuals and
residents of remote communities. On November 18, the pandemic
H1N1 vaccines were made available to the whole population.
To evaluate the effectiveness of the abovementioned pandemic
and TIV vaccines in preventing laboratory-confirmed pandemic
H1N1 infections, we did a case–control study using data from Cadham Provincial Laboratory (CPL) and the Manitoba Immunization
Monitoring System (MIMS). We also measured the effectiveness of
these vaccines for different age groups and among high-risk populations, and by time since vaccination.
2. Methods
2.1. Data sources
This study was conducted using de-identified records obtained
by linking Manitoba Health’s (MH) administrative databases and
the CPL database with the approval of the Research Ethics Board
of the University of Manitoba and the Health Information Privacy
Committee of MH. MH provides publicly funded health insurance
coverage, including coverage for laboratory testing and for hospital
and out-patient physician services (e.g., immunizations), to most
of the 1.2 million residents of the province. Eligibility for coverage is not based on age or income [7]. For administrative purposes,
MH maintains several centralized electronic databases that can be
linked using a unique health services number.
2.2. Definition of cases and controls
Cases (laboratory-confirmed pandemic H1N1 patients) and controls (test-negative individuals) were identified using the database
of CPL, the province’s only public health laboratory. This database
stores results of all influenza testing performed in the province
since the beginning of the pandemic. Patients were tested in
both hospital and ambulatory care settings. During the pandemic,
guidelines for testing patients presenting with influenza-like illness or severe febrile respiratory illness were issued by MH, and
there is anecdotal evidence that they were followed by physicians
to great extent. For most of the duration of the “second wave”
(October–December 2009), all influenza testing in Manitoba was
completed at CPL using a real-time multiplex reverse-transcription
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay developed by the
National Microbiology Laboratory [8].
Any adult or child ≥6 months of age who normally resides in
Manitoba and who had a respiratory sample submitted to CPL for
influenza testing during the study period was eligible for inclusion
in the study (N = 3756). The study spanned the period from November 2, 2009 (1 week after the start of mass vaccination in Manitoba)
to February 10, 2010 (Fig. 1).
All eligible individuals in whom the pandemic H1N1 influenza
A was identified by RT-PCR (N = 1435; 38%) were included in the
cases group. Controls were individuals who tested negative for
both influenza A and B (N = 2309). We excluded twelve individuals because they tested positive for influenza A but not for H1N1.
The date of specimen collection was considered the ‘index date.’
2.3. Determination of vaccination status
For all cases and controls, information on the receipt of the pandemic H1N1, TIV and the polyvalent pneumococcal polysaccharide
(PPV23) vaccines during or before the 2009/10 season was obtained
from MIMS, the population-based province-wide registry recording virtually all immunizations administered to Manitoba residents
since 1988. Estimates of the completeness and accuracy of the
recorded vaccination information are high [9].
2.4. Potential confounders
Individuals were assigned to a neighbourhood of residence
(neighbourhood clusters within the capital city of Winnipeg and
regional health authorities in the rest of the province) based on
their postal code as recorded in MH’s Population Registry. Information on socio-economic status was obtained using postal code
of residence and a previously validated area-based Socioeconomic
Factor Index (SEFI) [10]. Information on pregnancy, comorbidities,
propensity to seek health care (measured as the number of hospital and family physician visits in the previous 5 years) and use
of antivirals was obtained from the Hospital Separation, Physician
Claims and Drug Program Information Network databases of MH
(See Web Appendix).
2.5. Analysis
We used unconditional logistic regression models to estimate
the odds ratio (OR) for the association between the receipt of the
pandemic H1N1 vaccine and the detection of laboratory-confirmed
pandemic H1N1 infections while adjusting for confounding. Results
are presented for unadjusted models (Model A) and for models that
were adjusted, a priori, for age, gender, place of residence (as a
proxy for pre-existing levels of herd immunity), SEFI and week of
specimen collection (to account for changes in disease incidence
and vaccination and laboratory testing practices) (Model B).
Other potential confounders (Table 1) were included in the fully
adjusted models if their inclusion resulted in a >2% change in estimates of vaccine effectiveness (VE). Using this criterion, the final
models (Model C) were adjusted for the number of hospital admissions and family physician visits in the last 5 years, receipt of the
2008/09 TIV vaccines, antiviral treatment, belonging to an H1N1
or TIV vaccination priority group and having a chronic respiratory
condition or immunosuppression. Adjustment of other chronic diseases did not appreciably change the VE estimates. These analyses
were repeated separately for the adjuvanted and nonadjuvanted
H1N1 vaccines, and for the TIV and PPV23. VE was estimated as
(1 − OR) × 100.
In primed healthy adults, the peak serum antibody levels are
typically observed >2 weeks after vaccination [11]. To account for
differences in effectiveness by time since vaccination, we classified

a All the fully adjusted models (Model C) for the 2008/09 and 2009/10 TIV and the PPV23 included the adjuvanted H1N1 vaccine. Receipt of TIV vaccines in 2008/09 was
not included in models of the 2009/10 seasonal TIV and PPV23, because it was not a significant confounder using the 2% change-in-crude-estimate criterion (see Section 2). b These models with interaction terms between H1N1 and TIV or PPV23 vaccines provide more valid estimates of the effectiveness of these vaccines than the models with
mutual adjustment for H1N1, TIV and PPV23 (models marked with superscript a; which are presented for completeness). c In these analyses, individuals vaccinated <14 days before the index date were considered unvaccinated.
vaccinated individuals into three groups depending on whether
vaccination occurred 1–6, 7–13, or ≥14 days before the index date,
and contrasted the odds of H1N1 infection in each group with the
odds of infection among the unvaccinated.
All above analyses were repeated separately for the adjuvanted
and nonadjuvanted H1N1 vaccines. In addition, analyses were
repeated for the adjuvanted pandemic H1N1 vaccine after stratifying by age group, place of residence, residence in an Aboriginal
community, epidemic phase (before and after the peak), presence
of high-risk conditions and belonging to a vaccine priority group.
We also assessed for possible confounding or effect modification
between pandemic vaccines and the TIV and PPV23. The statistical
significance of adding the interaction terms was assessed using the
likelihood ratio test [12].
Using two-sided 5% significance level, our study had 85% power
to detect an OR as small as 0.70 (VE = 30%) assuming 10% of controls
were fully vaccinated [13].
3. Results
About 51% of cases and 57% of controls were females (Table 1).
Cases were younger and more socioeconomically advantaged than
controls. They had fewer hospitalization and physician consultations, and were less likely to have been immunosuppressed or to
have had a diagnosed chronic medical condition (except asthma).
Cases were also less likely to belong to an H1N1 or TIV high priority
group or to have received antiviral prophylaxis.
About 8% of the cases and 18% of the controls received ≥1 dose
of the adjuvanted H1N1 vaccine before the index date (Table 2),
corresponding to a crude VE estimate of 63% (95%CI: 54–70%).
Adjusting for age, gender, region, SEFI and week of specimen collection (Model B)lowered the VE to 55% (54–70%). Further adjustment
for all other potential confounders (Model C) did not change the VE
estimates appreciably.
In fully adjusted models (Model C), the effectiveness of adjuvanted H1N1 vaccine among those who were vaccinated ≥14 days
before specimen collection was 86% (75–93%), but much lower
when vaccination took place <7 days [17% (−19 to 42%)] or 7–13
days before specimen collection [53% (29–69%)]. Effectiveness estimates of the nonadjuvanted H1N1 vaccine were less precise, but
suggestive of reduced effectiveness compared to the adjuvanted
vaccine (the differences were not statistically significant).
Neither receipt of the TIV nor ever-receiving the PPV23
appeared to confer any protection against pandemic H1N1 infections (Table 2). However, the effectiveness of the H1N1 vaccine
appeared lower among those who also received the 2009/10 TIV
[77% (28–93%)]than among those who only received the H1N1 vaccine, especially if they did not belong to a group for which the TIV
was recommended [97% (76–100%); Pinteraction = 0.009]. In analyses
limited by small numbers (data not shown), the effectiveness of
the adjuvanted H1N1 vaccine when given concurrently or before
the TIV [69% (22–88%)] was not statistically significantly different from that when it was given after the TIV [59% (−43 to 88%)].
H1N1 VE was also lower among those who ever received the PPV23
(Pinteraction = <0.001).
In addition, effectiveness of the adjuvanted H1N1 vaccine
seemed lower among older (≥50 years) individuals [51% (−50 to
84%)] compared to young adults and older children [90% (76–96%)]
and very young (6–35 months) children [97% (72–100%)] (Table 3).
VE was also lower among those with immunocompromising conditions [67% (−13 to 90%)]. However, gender, area of residence, the
epidemic phase and belonging to a vaccine priority group did not
seem to influence vaccine effectiveness.
4. Discussion
Overall, we found that the adjuvanted H1N1 vaccine was
86% effective in preventing laboratory-confirmed H1N1 infections

when received ≥14 days before testing, although effectiveness
seemed lower among persons aged ≥50 years (51%) and among
those with immunocompromising conditions (67%).
These results are generally consistent with the results of
immunogenicity trials and with the findings of observational studies that examined the effectiveness of the H1N1 vaccine [14–19].
A multi-center test-negative case–control study utilizing sentinel
primary care practitioners belonging to the European Influenza
Surveillance Network reported an overall VE (14 days following
vaccination) of 66% with VE approaching 100% for those under 15
[17]. Also, high estimates of VE (>90%) were reported from similar
studies fromCanada [18,19], Scotland[14] andSpain[15]. The effectiveness ofthe nonadjuvanted H1N1 vaccine was 87.3% (75.4–93.4)
among Chinese school-age children [16]. No information was available on VE among adults from that study.
Our results are also within the range of 70–90% effectiveness
estimates typically found in studies of the seasonal influenza vaccines among healthy younger adults in years with good antigenic
match [20]. Effectiveness of influenza vaccines among the elderly
remains controversial. Like many studies of seasonal TIVs, our
results indicate lower effectiveness among older adults [21].
In this and other studies, the TIVs did not appear to protect
against the pandemic strain. In fact, a Canadian study has suggested that the receipt of the 2008/09 TIV might be associated
with increased risk of detection of pandemic H1N1, although no
increased risk of severe illness was detected [22]. The results ofthat
study were not confirmed by studies from Australia, Mexico, and
the US [23]. In our study, subjects who only received the 2009/10
TIV were not at increased risk of pandemic H1N1 infections. And
although the effectiveness of the H1N1 vaccine appeared lower
among those who received both the 2009/10 TIV and the H1N1
vaccines, a similar pattern was observed among those who also
ever-receivedthe PPV23, suggesting thepossibility of “confounding
by indications” of the TIV [24]. However, our findings are consistent with those from an immunogenicity trial among children, in
which HI antibody titres following a single dose of the nonadjuvanted H1N1 vaccine were lower among children who received
the TIV prior to H1N1 vaccination [25].

4.1. Strengths and limitations
Because of its population-based design and the availability of
accurate automated vaccination records, this study is less susceptible to selection and recall biases that commonly afflict conventional
case–control studies. Because both cases and controls were identified on the basis of an accurate diagnostic test (RT-PCR), disease
misclassification and bias due to differential access to laboratory
testing are not a major concern in this study.
To avoid confounding by access to and propensity to seek health
care, we employed a test-negative case–control design where all
participants were tested for influenza. However, it is still possible that in some cases viral RNA may not be detectable by RT-PCR
(e.g., due to delay in the collection of specimen), which means
that some cases may be misclassified as controls. Depending on
whether the occurrence of a false-negative testis related to the likelihoodof receiving the vaccine,this will generally bias our estimates
upwards or towards the null masking any beneficial effects, and
will not,therefore, explain the strong protective effect we observed
[26]. Furthermore, we used proxies for access to health care (e.g.,
frequency of physician encounters) to adjust for factors associated
with promptness of testing. Because we used the specimen collection date as a proxy for the date of symptom onset which was not
available from the laboratory database, itis possible that some individuals included in the ≥14 day vaccination group might not have
been fully protected resulting in an underestimation of the vaccine
effectiveness.
Information on several confounders was obtained from administrative databases. The completeness and accuracy of the MH
database are well established [27,28], and these databases have
been used extensively in studies of post-marketing surveillance
of various drugs and vaccines [7,29]. It is still possible that some
variables were measured with some error, which could result in
residual confounding. However, the observed protective effects of
H1N1 vaccination are unlikely to be due to the “healthy vaccine
effect” (individuals, especially seniors, who get vaccinated are on
average healthier than those who do not [30]), because vaccination
was targeted at the higher-risk, and generally less healthy, groups,
and we adjusted for vaccine indications in our models. Also, we did
not observe any protective effects for the TIV and PPV23 which are
presumably subject to the same bias.
Confounding by herd immunity following the summer wave
of the pandemic is also unlikely explanation for our findings. We
adjusted for area of residence in all models. Also, VE estimates were
similar for northern and southern communities (Table 3) despite
significant differences in H1N1 seroprevalence between these communities at the end of the summer wave of the pandemic [31].
5. Conclusions
We demonstrated that the adjuvanted H1N1 vaccine used during Manitoba’s mass vaccination campaign was highly effective
against laboratory-confirmed H1N1 infections, especially among
children and younger adults. Despite logistical and communication challenges to vaccine delivery during the campaign, vaccine
effectiveness appears comparable to that observed for influenza
vaccines during non-pandemic seasons in years with good antigenic match. This study demonstrates the utility of laboratory
information systems and administrative databases for evaluating
the effectiveness of influenza vaccines.
