Abstract
A total of 10,971 children aged 3-15 years were immunized with live influenza vaccine (the variant intended for children), type A (H1N1). The vaccine proved to be nonreactogenic and produced no harmful effect on the child organism. The genetic stability of the vaccine strain and its high immunogenic activity were shown.
