21: 574-582.
A survey enrolling 814 schoolchildren was conducted immediately after a peak epidemic in the 1988-1989 influenza
season and then a case-control study for influenza-like illness (ILI) was carried out using information concerning illness
onset and usual lifestyle. Based on the analysis of the correlations among symptoms and actions taken due to symptoms, cases were defined as those with fever >38°C and subsequent absenteeism and medical consultation during
peak epidemic; within this, mild-ILI (MILD was defined as fever >38°C and <39°C, and severe-ILI (SILI) as fever
>39°C. Controls were defined as those with no symptoms (NS) during that period. Adjusted odds ratios (OR) were
obtained through an unconditional logistic regression model between the MILI (80) or SILI (48) and NS (196) groups
from among respondents (803). For MILI, increased risks were observed for easily-inflamed tonsils (OR = 3.0,
95% Cl : 1.7-5.4); and larger family size (1.9, 1.1-3.4); with decreased risks for higher school grades (0.4, 0.2-0.9); frequent intake of vegetables or fruits other than green/yellow vegetables (0.5, 0.3-1.0); and larger room space per capita
(0.4, 0.2-0.9). For SILI, there were increased risks for easily-inflamed tonsils (3.8, 1.8-8.1) and history of doctordiagnosed asthma (2.9, 1.2-6.7); and decreased risks for higher grades (0,2, 0.1-0.6), frequent intake of milk or dairy
products (0.3, 0.1-0.6) and vaccination (0.3, 0.1-0.8).
A wide range of characteristics possibly associated
with the occurrence of influenza have been suggested.
These include age, previous experience of viruses,
nutrition, predispositions, crowded situations, temperature, etc.1
"

 However, the extent to which these
characteristics influence risk of illness has not been
widely studied because of the considerable difficulties associated with analytical epidemiological studies
in which both influenzal and noninfluenzal subjects
have to be selected from the source population. The
present case-control study was designed to investigate the individual and environmental characteristics associated with 'influenza-like' illness among
schoolchildren.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Subjects, Vaccination and Influenza Epidemic
The study subjects were recruited from a public elementary school in Kasuga City in Fukuoka Prefecture,
in western Japan. The school had a total of 814 pupils
aged between 6 and 12 years on 8 January 1989, the
beginning of the third term. There was no change in
the number of pupils until 25 March 1989 (the end
of the third term). Kasuga City which has a total
population of 75 555 and 8031 children in nine elementary schools has an extraordinarily high population density of 5298 people/km2
. This compares with
an average density of 322 people/km2
 for Japan
overall, according to the 1985 census.10
Influenza vaccination was performed at the school,
on the pupils whose parents consented, using commercial inactivated vaccine containing 200 CCAeq/ml
of each of A/Yamagata/120/86(HlNl), A/Fukuoka/
C29/85(H3N2) and A/Sichuan/2/87(H3N2), and 100
CCAeq/ml of B/Nagasaki/1/87. Two subcutaneous

injections of 0.3 ml of vaccine were given, the first
dose on 25 October, and the second on 16 November,
1988. Overall vaccination rate in the school was
39.1%; 16.1% for once-vaccinees and 23.0% for
twice-vaccinees, the remaining 60.9% were not
vaccinated.
An influenza epidemic was experienced in Fukuoka
between 30 October 1988 and 1 April 1989, with a
sharply-defined epidemic peak from 25 December 1988
to 11 February 1989, as recorded by the Surveillance
System for Tuberculosis and Infectious Diseases
(Figure 1). In Fukuoka Prefecture 56 clinics or
hospitals with specialists in paediatric diseases or
respiratory illnesses are designated as the surveillance
sites for influenza. These sites report weekly the
number of new patients presenting to the prefectural
government as a part of the nationwide system. In this
system, the diagnosis of influenza is primarily based on
clinical signs. The laboratory analysis conducted by
the prefectural centre on the specimens submitted
from surveillance sites or collected by the health
centres during the influenza season, revealed 27
type-A viruses (H1N1;26, H3N2;1) and 1 type-B virus
(Figure 1). The numbers and types of viruses isolated
from different age groups were: 1 type A (H3N2) from
a 5 year old; 18 type A (H1N1) from the 6-12 year age

group; 5 type A (H1N1) and 1 type-B from 13-16 year
olds; and 3 type A (H1N1) from those Ss 20 years. The
predominant influenza virus strain circulating during
this season was A/H1N1 (95%), followed by A/H3N2
(3%) and type B (2%) among 1575 virus isolates from
all over Japan, and 90% of the type A (H1N1) viruses
isolated were antigenically similar to A/Yamagata/
12O/86(H1N1) in the vaccine.
Survey
A survey was conducted using self-administered questionnaires. Parents were requested to complete items
on his or her child's health during 'the previous
month' and on potential risk factors in their usual
lifestyle. These questionnaires were distributed to all
parents through the pupils during the last week of the
epidemic peak. This was done by tracing the number
of influenza patients reported weekly through the
surveillance system. During the sharply-defined epidemic peak (25 December 1988 to 11 February 1989),
the school was closed for vacation from 25 December
1988 to 7 January 1989, and questionnaires were
distributed in the last week (5-11 February). This
resulted in the respondents noting onset of acute
respiratory illness (ARI) during that 1 month (8
January to 11 February 1989, i.e. observation period)
which was the beginning of the third term.
The questionnaire included the items concerning
ARI onset during 'the previous month' and potential
risk factors; the symptoms (fever, rhinorrhoea, cough,
sore throat, nausea or vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal
pain);" actions taken due to symptoms (taking
medicine, seeking doctor's consultation, school
absenteeism); gestational age, birthweight; predispositions (easily-inflamed tonsils, liable to get eczema,
history of doctor-diagnosed asthma, history of doctordiagnosed allergies); usual dietary intake (meat or
meat products, fish or fish products, eggs, milk or
dairy products, green/yellow vegetables, and other
vegetables or fruits); gargling, physical exercise, sleeping hours; family composition, passive smoking;
number of rooms, total room space, window or door
sashes (metal, wood or both), and home heating (seven
categories).
Fever was asked for in eight categories; <37°C, and
^37°C to ^40°C by 0.5°C interval. Room space was
defined by asking the number of 'tatami', the traditional Japanese mat covering the room floor. This
measurement is customarily used as a unit 'Joh' for
any room space including western-style rooms. The
'Joh' was then expressed in square metres. Information on height and weight at the beginning of the third
term, absenteeism corresponding to the ARI onset,

and pre-season vaccination status was obtained from
the official school records.
Analysis of ARI Onset, and Definition of Case and
Control Series
The changes in rates of absenteeism (total man-days of
absenteeism per week divided by pupil-weekdays) during the observation period paralleled the epidemic
peak; 1.64, 2.72, 4.9, 3.43 and 1.7% in second to
sixth week in 1989, respectively (Figure 1). Among 803
respondents, those who answered affirmatively to
having experienced any of ARI symptoms were 602
(75%). Those with fever ^38°C and <39°C, and
^39°C were 139 (17.3%) and 78 (9.7%), respectively.
Those who experienced each of six symptoms investigated were 51.2% had rhinorrhoea; 53.7% sore throat;
54.9% cough; 16.6% nausea or vomiting; 14% diarrhoea; and 30% abdominal pain. Those who took any
of the three actions investigated due to their symptoms
were 59.2% took medicine; 33.7% consulted a doctor
and 40.6% were absent from school.
To determine a suitable definition for influenzalike illness, the association in each combination among
ten variables (fever and six symptoms, and three
actions) was assessed by calculating Cramer's V or phicoefficient. Since the fever was categorized in order of
increasing temperature, the Mann-Whitney test was
also used to assess the difference in distributions of
temperature between two groups with or without each
symptom or action (Table 1). No significant association was determined in the x
2
 test between fever and
three respiratory symptoms. However, the MannWhitney test revealed significant associations between
fever and cough or sore throat. The Mann-Whitney
test for rhinorrhoea showed not only an insignificant
result, but an inverse one. Three digestive symptoms
were significantly associated with fever. No significant
association was observed for each combination betTABLE 1 Association in each combination among ten variables (fever, three respiratory symptoms, three digestive symptoms, and three actions

ween three digestive symptoms and three respiratory
symptoms, except between abdominal pain and sore
throat. Between fever and three actions taken due to
symptoms, strong associations were confirmed in both
the x
2
 and Mann-Whitney tests with P-values of less
than 0.001. Fever and doctor's consultation or school
absenteeism showed correlation with Cramer's V of
about 0.5. Both doctor's consultation and school
absenteeism were significantly associated with each of
three digestive symptoms, which were confirmed to
correlate with fever. Doctor's consultation was also
significantly associated with cough and sore throat.
Thus, doctor's consultation or school absenteeism
were strongly associated with fever as well as with
symptoms other than rhinorrhoea.
It has been shown that influenza epidemics in a
closed setting8
'
12-'4
 and school absenteeism due to
these15
 fall within a short period, and that influenza
virus isolations or infections were confirmed at high
levels among patients seeking medical care for ARI.2
'
16
Therefore, fever plus doctor's consultation and school
absenteeism within the peak epidemic period were considered to be suitable criteria for defining subjects as a
homogenous case series. Therefore, from among
pupils who contracted ARI during the observation
period (8 January to 11 February 1989), cases were
those with fever ^38°C and subsequent absenteeism
and medical consultation. Within this series two
categories were defined; (1) The mild influenza-like
illness (MILI) group; those pupils with fever ^38°C
and <39°C; and (2) the severe influenza-like illness
(SILI) group; those with fever ^39°C. The control
series were defined as those with no ARI onset, no
absenteeism and no medical consultation (NS: nosymptom group) during that period. Among 803 respondents, 80 (10.0%) fell into the MILI group, 48
(6.0%) into the SILI group and 196 (24.4%) were the
NS group.
In the comparison between MILI and SILI groups,
the proportion of those with rhinorrhoea was higher
among MILI than among SILI (77.2% versus 54.2%,
X
2
 = 7.35, P = 0.007). No significant difference was
determined for other symptoms; 83.5% among MILI
versus 77.1% among SILI for sore throat; 77.2%
versus 83.3% for cough; 32.9% versus 43.8% for
nausea or vomiting; 20.3% versus 27.1% for diarrhoea; and 45.6% versus 45.8% for abdominal
pain. Although statistically insignificant, the upper
respiratory symptoms, i.e. rhinorrhoea and sore
throat, were observed more among MILI. On the other
hand a lower respiratory symptom, i.e. cough, was
more prevalent among SILI. And in the SILI group,
the relative frequency, increased in order of upper to
lower respiratory symptoms; 54.2% for rhinorrhoea,
77.1% for sore throat, and 83.3% for cough. Most of
the cases experienced at least one of three respiratory
symptoms; 96.3% among MILI and 95.8% among
SILI. This finding is comparable with the other criteria
which defined influenza-like illness by the combination
of fever and individual symptom or group of symptoms (e.g. fever plus cough, sore throat, and/or
rhinorrhoea).8
'
12'
13
 Since the present case definition
omitted the ARI onsets during the first 2 weeks of
epidemic peak (25 December 1988-7 January 1989),
those who had contracted illness before the observation period were possibly included into the NS category, as well as those who contracted ARI after the
period. However this type of misclassification is considered to enhance the conservative determination for
the risk factors, rather than to bring about unreasonable results.
Reliability of Information Collected
Overall response rate was 98.6% (803/814) ranging
96.7-100% by grade. The 11 nonrespondents included
longterm absentees and refusals. A respondent bias
can be disregarded because of this fairly high response
rate. Concerning the items related to the potential
illness risk, another survey enrolling 10% random
samples was conducted to evaluate the reproducibility
of the parents' answers, using an identical form of
questions, 1 month after the first survey. The items
which showed an intraclass correlation coefficient of
less than 0.5 between the first and second surveys were
excluded from data analysis. Only gestational age and
two items for home heat fell into this exclusion
criteria. The items used for analysis showed acceptable
reproducibility with intraclass correlation coefficients
of 0.55 for one home heating method, up to 1.00 for
physical exercise habits. Since the questionnaires in the
second survey only asked about usual lifestyle, this explains the favourable reproducibility and why the
recall bias was inconsequential.
Statistical Analysis
A x
2
 statistic or a Fisher's exact test were used to assess
proportions of case (MILI or SILI) and control (NS)
groups with various factors. For multivariate analysis,
an unconditional logistic regression model was used to
obtain adjusted odds ratio (OR) and its 95% confidence interval (95% CI).
 17
 The test for trend in risk
was also performed to confirm the dose-response relationship. These calculations were conducted using the
Logistic Multiple Regression Model (LOGIST) procedure in the Statistical Analysis System (SAS).18

RESULTS
In univariate analysis between MILI and NS groups
(Table 2), the lower height and weight categories were
more often observed in the MILI group, but obesity
which was assessed by Quetelet index or Rohrer index
showed no significant difference. Significant difference was determined for 'other vegetables or fruits'
but not for green/yellow vegetables. Larger family size
and smaller room space per capita were more frequent
in the MILI group, but 'number of rooms' and 'total
room space' showed no significant difference. Vaccination status was not significantly different (vaccinee
versus nonvaccinee; x
2
 = 0.005, P = 0.94, twicevaccinee versus nonvaccinee; x
2
 = 0.039, P = 0.84).
The characteristics not mentioned in Table 2 showed
no significant difference between groups.
Between the SILI and NS groups, the characteristics
with significant difference through a univariate
analysis are shown in Table 3, along with the results
for vaccination status. School grade, easily-inflamed
tonsils, history of doctor-diagnosed asthma, and other
vegetables or fruits revealed significant differences as
seen between MILI and NS groups. Vaccination status
remained at marginal significance (vaccinee versus
nonvaccinee; x
2
 = 3.17, P = 0.075, twice-vaccinee
versus nonvaccinee; x
2
 = 3.59, P = 0.058).

"The OR was obtained from the model in which family size was replaced by room space per capita, ance these two variables strongly
correlated. Almost identical OR were obtained for other variables;

daily or more frequent intake of other vegetables or
fruits, but it was statistically insignificant (OR = 0.14,
95% CI : 0.02-1.18). Vaccination rates in each class or
grade were not significant variables for SILI. Significant dose-response relationships were determined
for grade, milk or dairy products and vaccination
(Table 6).
DISCUSSION
The decreased risk observed in higher school grades
for both MILI and SILI indicates the significant
changes in susceptibility to the illnesses for school age
groups. This result is consistent with previous studies,
which have demonstrated decreases in numbers and
severity of such infections with increasing age among
school children. Some studies have explained this protective effect by abundant previous experience with influenza viruses.2>7>l9"

Elevated risk for easily-inflamed tonsils for MILI
and SILI should be interpreted cautiously. The quesNote: the model included school grade, easily-inflamed tonsils, history
of doctor-diagnosed asthma, milk or dairy products, other vegetables
or fruits, and vaccination.
tion asked was 'Do his/her tonsils seem to become inflamed easily?'. Those with symptoms such as sore
throat, pain in swallowing, hoarseness, etc., usually
tend to say 'inflamed tonsils'. Therefore the condition
described by a positive answer does not necessarily
imply tonsillitis itself. However it is conceivable that
certain pathological conditions in the upper respiratory
tract described by the answer 'easily-inflamed tonsils'
are strongly associated with the risk of influenza-like
illness. The history of doctor-diagnosed asthma was
associated with SILI risk. It has been reported that influenza virus infections precipitate episodes of wheezing in asthmatic children23'
24
 and children with asthma
are listed in the target groups for special vaccination
programmes because of influenza-related complications.25
 Our findings revealed that 'history' of doctordiagnosed asthma was associated with the risk of severe
illness.
The analysis for MILI showed elevated risk for larger
family size, and decreased risk for larger room space
per capita with a significant dose-response relationship. Closed or crowded situations have been discussed
in relation to influenza outbreaks.4

Note: The OR was obtained from an unconditional logistic regression
model, with indicator variables for each level of a factor. The model
included school grade, easily-inflamed tonsils, history of doctordiagnosed asthma, milk or dairy products, other vegetables or fruits
and vaccination, and factors for adjustment were put into the model as
single variables which were coded in ordinal numbers with increasing
dose levels, due to limited number of subjects.
results demonstrated that such an association can be
observed even in household settings, although it seems
unlikely to correlate with immediate manifestation of
severe illness.
The association between milk or dairy products and
SILI risk is somewhat difficult to interpret. The
lifestyle related to frequent intake of milk or dairy products might be associated with decreased risk rather
than this characteristic contributing benefit directly. A
decreased risk, significant for MILI and suggestive for
SILI, was observed from frequent intake of other
vegetables or fruits, but not in green/yellow vegetables.
The former factor was intended to represent the food
group rich in vitamin C and the latter to represent the
. group rich in vitamin A. If this categorization really
reflects the ingestion of such nutrients, the results are
comparable to previous reports which have suggested
or demonstrated the prophylactic or therapeutic
effects of ascorbic acid on the common cold or influenzal illness.26"
28
Our results which show that vaccination was inversely associated with SILI risk but not with MILI
risk allow the following interpretations. Firstly, the
SILI group included many influenza patients per se
according to the strict criteria, while the MILI group
included many ARI patients with diseases other than
influenza. Secondly, if vaccinees who might have been
categorized into SILI fell into the MILI group by
virtue of the protective effect of the vaccine, then the
difference between the MILI and NS gToups decreased
because of the increased number of vaccinees among
the MILI group. There has been controversy about
whether annual revaccinations for influenza are really
beneficial.29"
31
 In Japan, all schoolchildren including
nursery schoolchildren were covered annually by the
universal influenza vaccination programme until the
1987-1988 season, and the annual vaccination
coverage in the subject school was maintained at about
80% before 1988. Therefore a fairly large part of the
student body must have received at least one vaccination or annually repeated revaccinations before the
current season. However, further interpretations are
of limited value because individual data on the past
history of vaccinations were not available.
In the present study, the criteria for case and control
series might have brought about selection bias, since it
included absenteeism and medical consultation. Socioeconomic status and predispositions are considered to
be the most likely factors which would introduce this
bias. However, if the control series, defined as those
who did not seek medical care, are regarded as a group
of individuals of low socioeconomic status, an inverse
association between room space per capita and illness
risk is quite a contradictory finding. Also no significant difference was observed for predispositions other
than easily-inflamed tonsils and doctor-diagnosed
asthma. Therefore the risk factors determined here
cannot be fully explained by selection bias.
The present case-control study, which was elaborated to align observation of illness onset with a
sharply defined epidemic peak, demonstrated the
several risk factors for an influenza-like illness.
Although analytical epidemiological study of influenza
involves considerable difficulty in which the investigation has to encompass illness definition, selection of
both influenzal and noninfluenzal subjects, peculiarity
of population, etc., further studies are required among
different populations, by different methods, and in
different seasons, to explain the natures of the human
host, the pathogen and the environment for influenza.
