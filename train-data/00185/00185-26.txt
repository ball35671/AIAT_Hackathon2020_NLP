ABSTRACT
OBJECTIVE. The goal was to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of an investigational, refrigerator-stable formulation of live attenuated influenza vaccine
(cold-adapted influenza vaccine-trivalent) against culture-confirmed influenza,
acute otitis media, and effectiveness outcomes in young children in day care over
2 consecutive influenza seasons.
METHODS. Children 6 to 36 months of age who were attending day care were
assigned randomly in year 1 to receive 2 doses of vaccine or placebo intranasally,
35  7 days apart. In year 2, subjects received 1 dose of the same treatment as in
year 1.
RESULTS. A total of 1616 subjects (vaccine: 951 subjects; placebo: 665 subjects) in
year 1 and 1090 subjects (vaccine: 640 subjects; placebo: 450 subjects) in year 2
were able to be evaluated for efficacy. The mean age at first vaccination was 23.4
 7.9 months. In year 1, the overall efficacy of the vaccine against influenza
subtypes similar to the vaccine was 85.4%; efficacy was 91.8% against A/H1N1
and 72.6% against B. In year 2, the overall efficacy was 88.7%; efficacy was 90.0%
against H1N1, 90.3% against A/H3N2, and 81.7% against B. Efficacy against all
episodes of acute otitis media associated with culture-confirmed influenza was
90.6% in year 1 and 97.0% in year 2. Runny nose or nasal discharge after dose 1
in year 1 was the only reactogenicity event that was significantly more frequent
with cold-adapted influenza vaccine-trivalent (82.3%) than placebo (75.4%).
CONCLUSIONS. Cold-adapted influenza vaccine-trivalent was well tolerated and effective in preventing culture-confirmed influenza illness in children as young as 6
months of age who attended day care.

NFLUENZA IS A major cause of serious respiratory illness and acute otitis media (AOM) in young children
and is associated with significant public health and socioeconomic burdens through excess hospitalizations,
clinic and outpatient visits, antibiotic prescriptions, and
lost parental workdays.1–6 Influenza-associated hospitalization rates for children 2 years of age are comparable
to those seen for elderly persons and adults at high risk
for complications of influenza.7–13 During an influenza
season, up to 33% of emergency department visits for
children 12 months of age8 and 20% of excess hospitalizations for children 3 years of age12 have been
attributed to influenza infection.
High influenza attack rates and the propensity to shed
larger amounts of influenza virus for longer periods than
older children and adults indicate that young children
are significant reservoirs of influenza in the community.14–17 Children attending day care frequently experience the highest influenza attack rates2,18; however, influenza is underdiagnosed frequently in this age group.19
Routine immunization of young children may provide
communitywide benefits by reducing the transmission
of influenza to susceptible populations, decreasing the
overall community disease burden, and reducing the
overall economic burden of influenza.20,21
Inactivated trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) is recommended in the United States for use in children 6
months to 5 years of age.22 Few efficacy studies using
TIV in young children have been published. Estimates of
TIV efficacy against influenza illness range from 12% to
83% and vary according to age, circulating influenza
virus strains, level of disease burden, and other variables.23 Variability in TIV efficacy and effectiveness
against AOM has also been observed.23–27
The frozen formulation of live attenuated influenza
vaccine (LAIV) (FluMist; MedImmune, Gaithersburg,
MD) was approved in the United States in 2003 for
healthy persons 5 to 49 years of age. A new, refrigeratorstable formulation of LAIV, referred to as cold-adapted
influenza vaccine-trivalent (CAIV-T), is currently in development. The clinical trial described here evaluated
the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of CAIV-T against
culture-confirmed influenza, during 2 consecutive influenza seasons, in children 6 to 36 months of age who
were attending day care. Vaccine efficacy against AOM
and certain effectiveness outcomes were also determined.
METHODS
Design
This prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled, multicenter trial was conducted over 2 consecutive influenza seasons at 70 clinical centers located
in Belgium, Finland, Israel, Spain, and the United Kingdom, between October 2, 2000, and May 31, 2002. The
study was conducted in accordance with the principles
of Good Clinical Practice and the Declaration of Helsinki.
The study protocol and all subsequent amendments
were approved by the human ethics committees, institutional review boards, and any regional or national
ethics committees at participating centers.
Participants
Eligible subjects were children who were 6 to 36
months of age at the time of enrollment and who were
in good health, as determined by medical history and
physical examination. Children were required to be attending day care for a minimum of 12 hours/week.
Eligibility to participate in the second year of the trial
required continued good health and completion of the
primary dosing series and surveillance in year 1. Written
informed consent was obtained from the parent or
guardian of each child. Exclusion criteria for both years
included any serious chronic disease, Down syndrome or
other cytogenetic disorders, immunosuppression or a
household member with immunosuppression, receipt of
immunoglobulin in the previous 6-month period, receipt of any investigational vaccine or agent 1 month
before enrollment or any influenza treatment within the
2 weeks before enrollment, documented history of hypersensitivity to egg or egg protein, clinically confirmed
respiratory illness with wheezing within 2 weeks before
enrollment, receipt of aspirin within 2 weeks before
enrollment, receipt of any live virus vaccine within 1
month before enrollment, and previous influenza vaccination (year 1) or off-protocol influenza vaccination
(year 2).
Vaccine and Placebo
CAIV-T was manufactured and release-tested by Wyeth
Vaccines Research (Marietta, PA) and consisted of 3
cold-adapted, attenuated, reassortant strains, representing the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase antigens of
the A/New Caledonia/20/99 (H1N1), A/Sydney/05/97
(H3N2), and B/Yamanashi/166/98 influenza strains for
the first year of the study and the hemagglutinin and
neuraminidase antigens of the A/New Caledonia/20/99
(H1N1), A/Panama/2007/99 (H3N2), and B/Victoria/
504/2000 influenza strains for the second year of the
study. Each 0.2-mL dose of CAIV-T was formulated to
contain 107 median tissue culture dose (or equivalent
fluorescent units in year 2) of each of the 6:2 influenza
reassortant virus strains. After manufacture, the vaccine
was stored frozen and then shipped to the study sites at
2°C to 8°C, at which temperature it was stored until just
before administration.
The hemagglutinin and neuraminidase antigens of
the wild-type influenza strains used to generate the type
A/H1N1 and type B vaccine reassortants for the year 1
CAIV-T formulation were antigenically representative of
virus recommended by the World Health Organization
PEDIATRICS Volume 118, Number 6, December 2006 2299
for the 2000/2001 influenza season in the Northern
Hemisphere. Because of industrywide technical problems encountered in the production of the recommended H3N2 A/Panama/2007/99 (A/Moscow/10/99-
like) vaccine strain,28 a decision was made to use the
H3N2 vaccine strain (A/Sydney/05/97) recommended
for the previous 1999/2000 season in the year 1 CAIV-T
formulation. This decision was based on the antigenic
similarity of the hemagglutinin antigen with that of
A/Panama/2007/99, the circulation of A/Sydney/05/97-
like viruses before the 2000/2001 season,29 and previous
clinical trials with a frozen formulation of CAIV-T that
demonstrated both cross-reactive antibody development
(as measured with a hemagglutinin-inhibiting antibody
assay) and efficacy against mismatched influenza
A/H3N2 virus.30 The A/Sydney/05/97 antigens matched
the antigens used in commercial TIV for that season. The
vaccine composition for year 2 consisted of vaccine
strains that were antigenically representative of the
World Health Organization 2001/2002 Northern Hemisphere composition recommendations.31 Placebo consisted of sterile physiologic saline solution manufactured
by Wyeth Vaccines Research.
In year 1, subjects were assigned randomly to receive
a primary series of 2 doses of either CAIV-T or placebo,
in a 3:2 ratio, 35  7 days apart. In year 2, all subjects
received a single dose of either CAIV-T or placebo according to their year 1 treatment assignments. In both
years, study subjects, their parents or guardians, and the
clinical personnel were unaware of the treatment being
administered. CAIV-T and placebo were supplied in single-dose, identically packaged sprayers labeled with the
codes to which subjects were assigned. The total singledose volume of 0.2 mL (0.1 mL into each nostril) of
vaccine or placebo was administered intranasally with
the spray applicator intended for commercial use. The
first dose of the primary series was administered on
study day 0, after informed consent had been obtained.
Surveillance for Influenza Illness
Surveillance for influenza-like illness was based on regular telephone contacts, clinic visits, or home visits (as
applicable). In both years, contact started 11 days after
receipt of the first study dose (day 0) and continued
weekly through completion of the first (May 31, 2001)
or second (May 31, 2002) season surveillance period.
A nasal swab sample was required if subjects exhibited fever (rectal temperature of 38°C or axillary temperature of 37.5°C), wheezing, shortness of breath,
pulmonary congestion, pneumonia, or ear infection
(suspected or diagnosed AOM). A nasal swab sample
was also required if subjects showed 2 of the following:
runny nose or nasal congestion (rhinorrhea), sore throat
(pharyngitis), cough, muscle aches, chills, headache, irritability, decreased activity, or vomiting. A viral culture
was also obtained at the investigators’ discretion.
Nasal specimens were cultured in Madin-Darby canine kidney monolayer cultures, and typing was determined by immunostaining positive cultures with influenza type A-specific and type B-specific monoclonal
antibodies. Nasal specimens were cultured and typed in
the Department of Virology at the University of Turku
(Turku, Finland). Positive specimens were shipped to
Wyeth Vaccines Research (Pearl River, NY) for additional identification. Subtype identification and antigenic characterization were performed for 78.3% of all
influenza-positive isolates in year 1, by the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta, GA), with serologic techniques. In year 2, identification assays, including polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays and sequencing of HA1 gene fragments, were performed by
Wyeth Vaccines Research with methods similar to those
described previously for H3N2 and B viruses.32,33 In the
second season, wild-type B/Hong Kong/1351/02 strain
cocirculated32,34 and was associated with difficulties in
serotyping. PCR analyses and HA1 sequencing methods
were used for subtype identification and antigenic characterization of 99.0% of all influenza-positive isolates in
year 2, whereas only 87.6% of isolates were identifiable
with serologic testing. All strain-specific efficacy analyses
in year 2 were based on PCR analyses, with serotyping
confirmation when possible. Influenza-positive specimens obtained within 28 days after any vaccine dose
were tested to determine whether they were CAIV-Tlike or wild-type (community acquired).
AOM
An ear examination was performed if the subject developed symptoms suggesting AOM. AOM was defined as a
visually abnormal tympanic membrane (with regard to
color, position, and/or mobility) suggesting an effusion
in the middle ear cavity, concomitant with 1 of the
following signs and/or symptoms of acute infection: fever (rectal temperature of 38°C or axillary temperature
of 37.5°C), earache, irritability, diarrhea, vomiting,
acute otorrhea not caused by external otitis, or other
symptoms of respiratory infection.35,36 An episode of febrile otitis media was defined as an episode of AOM in a
child with a documented fever (rectal temperature of
38°C or axillary temperature of 37.5°C), and an episode of influenza-associated AOM was defined as an
episode of AOM in a child with a positive culture for
influenza virus. An episode of AOM in a study participant was included in the efficacy analysis if it complied
with the definition of AOM given above, occurred 15
days after receipt of the first dose of vaccine or placebo,
and occurred during the period in which influenza virus
was isolated in each country.
Effectiveness Outcomes
The ability of CAIV-T, relative to placebo, to reduce the
burden of respiratory illness in children attending day
2300 VESIKARI et al
care was determined by evaluating the reduction in the
following predefined end points during the influenza
season: (1) the incidence of a parent or guardian taking
time off from paid work at least once to care for the child
during the current influenza-like illness, (2) the total
number of days of paid work missed for parents or
guardians, (3) the total number of days missed from day
care as a result of influenza-like illness, (4) the incidence
of 1 outpatient or emergency department visit because
of acute febrile and/or respiratory illness, (5) the incidence of 1 prescription of antibiotics as a result of
influenza-like illness, and (6) the number of days of
treatment with an antibiotic prescribed as a result of the
influenza-like illness.
Safety Assessment
After each study vaccination, parents and legal guardians were asked to record information on a diary card
regarding axillary or rectal temperature, runny nose/
nasal congestion, sore throat, cough, vomiting, activity
level, appetite, irritability, headache, chills, muscle pain,
and the use of antipyretic medications (for prophylaxis
or treatment), as well as any unscheduled physician
visits and medications, for 11 consecutive days, including the day of vaccination (day 0). An adverse event
(AE) was defined as any clinically significant event, including but not limited to (1) events that required any
prescription or nonprescription medication within 11
days after vaccination, (2) events that required an unscheduled health care provider visit and/or health care
provider consultation within 11 days after vaccination,
(3) events that resulted in study termination, or (4) any
other clinically significant event that occurred at any
time during the course of the study. Serious AEs, including hospitalizations, were monitored and collected
through the end of the influenza season in each year of
the study.
Statistical Analyses
Sample size estimates were based on assumed attack
rates of culture-confirmed influenza in the placebo and
CAIV-T groups of 12% and 3%, respectively (as observed in a previous trial of LAIV in older children30) and
a subject discontinuation rate of 25%. A sample size of
1100 children that were able to be evaluated (with 3:2
randomization) permitted 90% power that the lower
limit of the 95% confidence interval (CI) of efficacy over
the first season would be 45%. The planned sample
size for this study provided 80% power to detect frequency differences between the CAIV-T and placebo
groups ranging from 4.3% to 8.2%.
The randomization schedule was generated by Wyeth
Vaccines Research. Study product for year 1 was labeled
with 1 of 5 letter codes, namely, A, H, or M (CAIV-T) or
B or K (placebo). Each subject was assigned the next
sequential number by the study site investigator and
received study product for the treatment assigned to that
subject number, according to a preprinted randomization allocation list provided to the study site by Wyeth
Vaccines Research. The number sequence was concealed
until interventions were assigned. Two efficacy populations were defined for both seasons, that is, the intentto-treat population (all subjects who received 1 dose of
study vaccine or placebo in year 1 or who received a
single dose of study vaccine or placebo at the start of year
2) and the per-protocol (PP) population (subjects who
received both vaccinations, or a single vaccination in
year 2, to which they were assigned; who received no
live viral vaccine within 28 days of any study vaccination; and who had no major protocol violations).
The primary efficacy end point was the efficacy of a
primary series of 2 doses of CAIV-T, relative to placebo,
against culture-confirmed influenza caused by subtypes
antigenically similar to those contained in the vaccine in
the first season. Secondary efficacy end points included
the efficacy of 2 doses of CAIV-T against culture-confirmed influenza caused by any community-acquired
subtypes in season 1; efficacy of CAIV-T against cultureconfirmed influenza caused by subtypes antigenically
similar to those contained in the vaccine and against any
subtype in year 2; efficacy against all episodes of AOM,
febrile AOM (first and all episodes), and influenza-associated AOM (first and all episodes) in both years; and
improvement in effectiveness outcomes.
Vaccine efficacy was estimated as vaccine efficacy 
1  (C/NC)/(P/NP), where NC is the number of subjects
who received CAIV-T, C is the number of CAIV-T subjects who were case subjects, NP is the number of
subjects who received placebo, and P is the number of
placebo subjects who were case subjects. For these estimates, conditional on the total number of cases, 95% CIs
were obtained from the binomial distribution. For the
purpose of estimating efficacy, only the first episode of
each kind of illness for each subject was taken into
account, unless otherwise indicated.
An episode of AOM was defined as one in which 30
days had passed since the onset of the previous episode.
Estimates of efficacy (with 95% CIs) of CAIV-T, relative
to placebo, against first episodes of AOM associated with
a positive culture for influenza virus antigenically similar
to virus contained in the vaccine and AOM associated
with fever were calculated for the PP population. Estimates of efficacy of CAIV-T, relative to placebo, against
all episodes of AOM, all febrile AOM, and all influenzaassociated AOM were based on the hazard ratio estimated from the Andersen-Gill model for multiplicative
hazards of recurrent events, with treatment as the only
effect.
For effectiveness end points, relative effectiveness
was defined in the same manner as for vaccine efficacy
against influenza, that is, relative effectiveness  1 
IC/IP, where IC and IP are incidence rates for CAIV-T and
PEDIATRICS Volume 118, Number 6, December 2006 2301
placebo, respectively, in the PP population. For the variables that were not defined as incidence variables, the
rates IC and IP were defined as the quotient of the total
number of days of missed work or days of antibiotic
treatment, as appropriate, divided by the total number of
days of surveillance. CIs at the 95% level for relative
effectiveness were computed from the binomial distribution, as for vaccine efficacy.
Because the circulation of influenza and its resulting
impact on the community vary according to region, the
analyses of efficacy for effectiveness end points were
conducted with events that occurred during the influenza season of each country, for more accurate assessment of the true impact of the vaccine on these end
points. The influenza season within each country was
defined as the period from the time of isolation of the
first wild-type influenza-positive culture among study
participants after vaccination through the time of the last
identification of an influenza-positive culture in that
country.
All subjects who received any dose of study vaccine
were included in the analysis of safety. For the analysis
of safety according to dose, subjects were analyzed according to the vaccine that they actually received (as
treated), CAIV-T or placebo. For analyses of the safety
population that included 1 dose, subjects who received
1 dose of CAIV-T were classified as “CAIV-T” and
subjects who received only placebo were classified as
“placebo.” For AEs within 11 days after vaccination, the
incidence rates for each body system and for each event
for the 2 treatment groups were compared by using
Fisher’s exact test (2-sided). For the summary of reactogenicity events, P values were obtained by using Fisher’s
exact test. Mild, moderate, and severe fevers were defined with axillary temperatures of 37.5°C, 38.6°C,
and 40.0°C, respectively. These cutoff points were considered equivalent to rectal temperatures of 38.0°C,
39.1°C, and 40.0°C, respectively. Subjects whose
temperature was measured orally were analyzed with
the same fever cutoff points as for rectal temperature
measurements. Subjects whose temperature was measured aurally or whose method of measurement was
unknown were analyzed with the most conservative
fever cutoff points (ie, those for axillary temperature
measurements). These conversions were similar to those
used in a previously published efficacy trial of LAIV.37
RESULTS
Subjects
Enrollment began on October 2, 2000, before the start of
the first influenza season, and was completed on November 18, 2000. A total of 1784 subjects, at 70 sites,
prospectively underwent random assignment to 1 of 2
study groups, in a 3:2 ratio (CAIV-T/placebo). All doses
of CAIV-T or placebo in the primary series were administered by December 29, 2000. Participant flow, including withdrawals and reasons for exclusion from the efficacy analysis during year 1, is summarized in Fig 1.
A total of 1735 subjects (97.3%) completed year 1; of
the 49 subjects (2.7%) who withdrew during year 1,
most did so at parental request (1.2%) or were lost to

follow-up monitoring (1.0%). Four subjects (2 in the
CAIV-T group and 2 in the placebo group) withdrew
during year 1 because of AEs; 3 of these AEs were judged
to be not related to study medication, and 1 (idiopathic
thrombocytopenic purpura in a placebo recipient) was
judged to be probably not related to study medication.
In year 2, 1119 subjects, at 62 sites, who completed
year 1 successfully (ie, received both doses of study
vaccine according to the protocol) received a single dose
of the same treatment they had received in year 1.
Clinical supply of CAIV-T for year 2 was not available
until the end of November in 2001; all vaccine doses in
year 2 were administered between December 3 and December 21, 2001. A total of 1112 subjects (99.4%) completed the study; 7 subjects (1 in the CAIV-T group and
6 in the placebo group) were lost to follow-up monitoring during year 2. No subjects withdrew from the study
in year 2 because of AEs. An additional 22 subjects (17 in
the CAIV-T group and 5 in the placebo group) were
excluded from the PP efficacy analysis in year 2 because
of major protocol violations.
A total of 1616 subjects (90.6%), including 951
CAIV-T recipients (89.8%) and 665 placebo recipients
(91.7%), were included in the primary analysis of efficacy in season 1 (2000/2001). Baseline demographic
characteristics for the PP efficacy population are presented in Table 1. A total of 4210 nasal swabs were
collected during 4717 illness visits in season 1, and conclusive culture results (whether positive or negative for
influenza) were obtained for 98.7% of the swabs. Fiftysix samples failed to yield results, primarily because of
culture contamination by fungus or other agents. During
the first season, an average of 2.34 and 2.38 swabs per
subject were collected from CAIV-T and placebo recipients, respectively. In season 2, 1537 nasal swabs were
collected during 1651 illness visits; conclusive results
were obtained for 98.4% of swabs, of which 12.8% were
determined to be positive for influenza. Swab rates in
season 2 were 1.33 and 1.44 swabs per subject for
CAIV-T and placebo recipients, respectively.
Culture-Confirmed Influenza
Influenza strains that were circulating in the community
during the 2 seasons are summarized in Table 2. During
the first season, all circulating influenza strains matched
the vaccine strains, and most illnesses were caused by
influenza A/H1N1 and influenza B strains. During the
second season (2001/2002), a variety of influenza strains
were circulating in the community, with clinical disease
being caused by all 3 of the vaccine-like strains of influenza (A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and B). In addition, illness was
caused by 2 influenza B strains that emerged from a
different influenza B lineage and were antigenically distinct from the influenza B vaccine virus.
Vaccine efficacy against culture-confirmed influenza
is summarized in Table 3. In year 1, the overall efficacy
of CAIV-T against community-acquired subtypes of influenza virus antigenically similar to those in the vaccine
was 85.4% (95% CI: 74.3%–92.2%), with efficacy for
individual vaccine strains of 91.8% (95% CI: 80.8%–
97.1%) against A/New Caledonia/20/99-like (H1N1) viruses and 72.6% (95% CI: 38.6%– 88.9%) against B/
Sichuan/379/99-like viruses. In year 1, only 1 case of
A/Panama/2007/99-like (H3N2) virus was detected in a
placebo recipient; therefore, efficacy could not be assessed. The vaccine also provided similar protection in
year 1 against all wild-type influenza strains, regardless
of antigenic similarity to the vaccine, with efficacy of
85.9% (95% CI: 76.4%–92.0%). In a posthoc analysis,
efficacy against any antigenically similar strain was
90.8% (95% CI: 69.6%–98.2%) and 83.6% (95% CI:
66.9%–92.6%) for subjects 12 to 23 months and 24

months of age, respectively. For subjects 6 to 12
months of age, the numbers of influenza cases were too
small (2 CAIV-T recipients and 5 placebo recipients) to
allow reliable evaluation of efficacy against antigenically
similar strains; however, significant efficacy was demonstrated against any influenza strain in this age group
(83.4%; 95% CI: 12.7%–98.3%).
In year 2, CAIV-T demonstrated protective efficacy
similar to that in year 1, including against the A/New
Caledonia/20/99-like virus, against which subjects had
received 2 doses in year 1. In year 2, efficacy against
influenza illness caused by influenza strains antigenically similar to those in the vaccine was 88.7% (95% CI:
82.0%–93.2%). In contrast to year 1, circulation of wildtype A/H3N2 influenza virus was more prevalent in year
2, as evidenced by the high attack rate among placebo
recipients. In year 2, efficacy of CAIV-T against each of
the individual vaccine strains was found to be 90.0%
(95% CI: 56.3%–98.9%), 90.3% (95% CI: 82.9%–
94.9%), and 81.7% (95% CI: 53.7%–93.9%) for the
H1N1 A/New Caledonia/20/99-like viruses, H3N2
A/Panama/2007/99-like viruses, and B/Victoria/504/00-
like viruses, respectively.
Influenza seasons according to country began as early
as December 1, 2000 (Israel), and ended as late as May
31, 2001 (Spain), in year 1. In year 2, influenza seasons
began on December 14, 2001 (Spain), and ended on
April 18, 2002 (Finland and Israel). Table 4 summarizes
efficacy against culture-confirmed influenza in both seasons according to country. In year 1, statistically significant efficacy against influenza strains antigenically similar to those in the vaccine was observed on a country
basis in Israel, Finland, and the United Kingdom. Each of
these countries had a placebo attack rate of 16%. In
Belgium and Spain, much lower attack rates were observed, and vaccine efficacy could not be determined.
In the second season (2001/2002), a much more significant influenza epidemic occurred, with high placebo
attack rates of 30% being seen in Belgium, Israel, and
Spain and with substantial attack rates also being observed in Finland (16.3%) and the United Kingdom
(18.6%). Statistically significant efficacy was observed in
all countries in year 2. Overall, strain-specific attack
rates were 3.1% (A/H1N1), 22.4% (A/H3N2), and 7.3%
(B). In year 2, all A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 virus isolates
were identified as antigenically similar to the vaccine.
However, only 29 (62%) of 47 influenza B isolates were
identified as antigenically similar to the vaccine; 17
(36%) were identified as antigenically not similar to the
vaccine, and the antigenic relatedness of 1 remaining
isolate (from a CAIV-T recipient) could not be determined. Twelve (67%) of these 18 isolates came from
children in Israel, and most were B/Hong Kong/1351/
02-like. The emergence of these divergent strains was
reflected in a lower efficacy estimate against any community-acquired strains, particularly in Israel. The attack
rates for these 17 identified divergent strains were 1.1%
and 2.2% in CAIV-T and placebo recipients, respectively;
however, efficacy did not achieve statistical significance
(50.8%; 95% CI: 43.0% to 84.1%).
AOM
Efficacy of CAIV-T against all AOM end points is summarized in Table 5. The efficacy of CAIV-T against all
episodes of influenza-associated AOM was high (90.6%
and 97.0% reduction in incidence in years 1 and 2,
respectively). However, no difference between groups in
the incidence of all episodes of AOM, first episode of
febrile AOM, or all episodes of febrile AOM in either year
was seen.
Effectiveness Outcomes
Effectiveness of CAIV-T against socioeconomic end
points was most apparent in year 2, when the overall
placebo attack rate for influenza was 30.9%. CAIV-T was
effective against all socioeconomic end points in year 2
and effective against some in year 1, despite the lower
influenza attack rate in placebo recipients (Table 6).
During season 2 (2001/2002), CAIV-T reduced significantly the need for a parent or guardian to take time off
from work by 45.1%, days of work lost by 47.5%, days
of missed day care by 36.3%, and days of antibiotic use
for influenza illness by 24.0%. Furthermore, the results
demonstrated the substantial effect of vaccination with
CAIV-T on severe disease, as reflected by a 35.1% reduction in the number of subjects with 1 emergency
department visit during the second season.
Safety Evaluation
Reactogenicity events are summarized in Table 7. Runny
nose or nasal discharge was observed in a marginally but
statistically significantly greater proportion of CAIV-T
recipients (82.3%), compared with placebo recipients
(75.4%), after the first dose in year 1 (P  0.001). No

other significant differences in reactogenicity events after any dose in either year were observed, although the
CAIV-T group had greater incidence of headache (15.0%
vs 8.9%; P  .070) and fever of 37.5°C (32.0% vs
27.8%; P  .098) after the first dose in year 1. For
children 24 months of age, chills were reported less
frequently by CAIV-T recipients than placebo recipients
after dose 1 in year 1 (0% vs 16.7%; P  .029), and
runny nose or nasal discharge was more frequent in
CAIV-T recipients after dose 2 (81.3% vs 74.6%; P 

events in children 24 months of age were observed.
Similar proportions of subjects in the CAIV-T (36.4%)
and placebo (35.4%) groups (P  .688) reported 1 AE
within 11 days after the first vaccination in year 1, and
the proportions reporting AEs within each body system
were also similar. AEs reported most frequently among
CAIV-T and placebo recipients after the first study dose
included fever (8.7% and 7.2%, respectively), rhinitis
(8.2% and 8.0%), cough (6.4% and 7.9%), otitis media
(5.8% and 4.0%), and upper respiratory tract infection
(4.3% and 4.6%). The AEs reported most frequently
after dose 1 among CAIV-T and placebo recipients 6 to
12 months of age were diarrhea (5.6% and 2.9%,
respectively), bronchospasm (0% and 5.7%), cough
(5.6% and 4.3%), rhinitis (9.6% and 4.3%), upper respiratory tract infection (9.6% and 7.1%), fever (15.2%
and 11.4%), and otitis media (9.6% and 5.7%). Similar
AE profiles were observed within 11 days after the second vaccination in year 1 and the single vaccination in
year 2. With the exception of bronchospasm after the
second vaccination (P  .016), there were no statistically
significant differences in the proportions of subjects in
each treatment group who experienced each of these
events (all P  .10). Lower respiratory tract illnesses
reported as AEs were infrequent and were similar between treatment groups after the first (pneumonia: 3
CAIV-T recipients and 2 placebo recipients; bronchitis: 5
CAIV-T recipients and 5 placebo recipients; bronchiolitis:

ent), bronchitis (2 CAIV-T recipients and 0 placebo recipients), and bronchospasm (1 CAIV-T recipient and 0
placebo recipients). Serious AEs judged to be possibly,
probably, or definitely related to study vaccination were
reported for 9 CAIV-T recipients (pneumonia and AOM,
2 recipients; bronchopneumonia, 2 recipients; pneumonia, 1 recipient; bronchiolitis, 1 recipient; bronchitis and
AOM, 1 recipient; idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura,
1 recipient; and fever, acute respiratory tract infection,
dehydration, and AOM, 1 recipient) and 5 placebo recipients (1 each for pneumonia and constipation; cough,
wheeze, and lung consolidation; pneumonia; idiopathic
thrombocytopenic purpura; and hypersensitivity, erythema, and periorbital edema). There were no statistically significant differences in serious AEs between treatment groups during the second influenza surveillance
period. Six lower respiratory tract illnesses were reported, all among CAIV-T recipients (5 cases of pneumonia and 1 of bronchospasm). Two cases of pneumonia
were judged to be possibly, probably, or definitely related to study vaccination. A total of 4 subjects (2
CAIV-T recipients and 2 placebo recipients) were withdrawn from the study because of AEs. No deaths occurred during the study period.
DISCUSSION
In the current trial, vaccination of children 6 to 36
months of age (mean age: 23 months) with CAIV-T over
2 consecutive influenza seasons was safe, well tolerated,
and highly efficacious against culture-confirmed influenza illness. The frozen formulation of LAIV was studied
previously over 2 seasons by using similar nasal swab
criteria and was shown to be highly effective in year 1
against vaccine-matched A/H3N2 virus (95%; 95% CI:
88%–97%) and B virus (91%; 95% CI: 79%–96%) and
in year 2 against a mismatched A/H3N2 virus (86%;
95% CI: 75%–92%).30,37 Children in that study had a
mean age of 40 months, and few children 2 years of
age were enrolled. Data from the current trial demonstrated high efficacy rates in children with a mean age of
23 months.
This study demonstrated the efficacy of CAIV-T
against all 3 A/H1, A/H3, and B strains circulating in the
same season. Because Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention subtyping and full antigenic characterization
of isolates were unsuccessful for 22% of isolates in year
1, influenza viruses that could not be matched to vaccine
antigen in that year might have been a mixture of vaccine-like and unmatched viruses. PCR assays in year 2
allowed subtyping and antigenic characterization of
99% of isolates and therefore dramatically improved the
ability to distinguish isolates as vaccine-like or unmatched. The efficacy against a related but drifted influenza B virus in the second season was not surprising,
given previous observations with the frozen formulation
of CAIV-T among older children,30 which demonstrated
protection between strains of considerably less antigenic
similarity. In the current trial, the point estimates of
efficacy against antigenically similar influenza B strains
in years 1 and 2 were lower than those for influenza A
strains. However, because the CIs for these point estimates overlapped, conclusions regarding relative efficacy against matched A or B strains could not be drawn.
In the current trial, 36% of influenza B isolates in year 2
were not antigenically similar to the vaccine strain; although the point estimate of efficacy against these unmatched B viruses was 50.8%, this did not achieve statistical significance.
In previous trials, the 2-dose primary series of LAIV
was administered at intervals of 60  14 days.37 In the
current study, doses were planned to be given at a
reduced interval of 35  7 days. Despite an actual mean
dosing interval of 33 days in a much younger population, vaccine efficacy was high and comparable to that
reported among older children.
In this trial, CAIV-T demonstrated a high level of
efficacy against episodes of AOM that were associated
with a positive influenza nasal swab. This was not surprising, given the high efficacy against culture-confirmed influenza. For this trial, a case definition for AOM
that had been published previously and was used in
previous trials involving other pediatric vaccines in this
age range35,36 was used. As also seen in clinical trials with
pneumococcal conjugate vaccine35 and TIV,26 CAIV-T
was not able to reduce significantly all episodes of AOM
from any cause during the influenza season. TIV was
shown to reduce AOM rates for children attending day
care,24,38 but a study conducted in younger children did
not support those findings.26 Influenza viruses might
represent a smaller fraction of the pathogens associated
with AOM in younger children, limiting the impact of
influenza vaccine in preventing this illness.
The impact of CAIV-T vaccination on effectiveness
outcomes was most apparent when influenza attack
rates for children were high. Vaccine effectiveness was
statistically significant for all parameters measured in the
second year of the trial. In that year, CAIV-T reduced
significantly the proportion of households with a parent
taking time off from work to care for a child, the number
of days lost from day care, the number of days of parental work loss, the number of antibiotic prescriptions written, the number of days of antibiotic use, the use of
outpatient clinics and emergency departments, and the
use of nonprescription medications for respiratory illness. Vaccinating children had effects on equivalent parameters that were comparable to those of directly immunizing healthy adults with CAIV-T.39 Although this
study was not designed to address the community impact of vaccinating children, other studies showed that
vaccinating school-aged children decreases significantly
health care utilization and school and work days
missed.40–43 In addition, an economic analysis of LAIV
PEDIATRICS Volume 118, Number 6, December 2006 2309
vaccination of children 15 to 71 months of age demonstrated that vaccination is cost-effective from societal
and third-party payer perspectives and that the greatest
benefits occur when children are vaccinated in a group
setting and when only 1 dose is required for protection.44
With respect to safety and tolerability events reported
by parents or legal guardians that occurred in the first 11
days after each dose, CAIV-T, when administered to this
much-younger pediatric population, had fewer significant reactogenicity and tolerability findings than reported for older children.30,37 Although previous reports
indicated statistically significant increases of fever, runny
nose or nasal congestion, abdominal pain, and vomiting
among CAIV-T recipients, only runny nose or nasal congestion achieved statistical significance in this trial of
younger children and only in the first year, after the first
dose. No statistically significant increases in rates of fever
were observed for placebo or CAIV-T recipients after any
dose in either year.
Furthermore, no significant safety events were observed in the 2 study groups during the influenza season.
A large-scale clinical trial showed an increase in asthma
episodes in children 18 to 35 months of age who were
given the frozen formulation of CAIV-T.45 No such observations were found in this clinical trial; however, this
trial was not powered to detect small differences in such
events among CAIV-T versus placebo recipients. In a
large study of children 6 to 59 months of age who were
assigned randomly to receive CAIV-T or TIV, there was a
small but significant increase in medically significant
wheezing in previously unvaccinated children 6 to 23
months of age who received CAIV-T.46 However, in a
similar study in children 6 to 71 months of age with a
history of recurrent respiratory tract infections, there
was no difference between treatment groups in the incidence of wheezing.47 Similar findings were seen in a
trial comparing TIV and CAIV-T in children and adolescents 6 to 17 years of age with asthma; there was no
difference between treatment groups in pulmonary outcomes, including asthma exacerbations.48
This clinical trial of an intranasally delivered liquid
formulation of LAIV in children 6 to 36 months of
age demonstrated conclusively efficacy against cultureconfirmed influenza illness over 2 consecutive seasons,
including efficacy against all 3 vaccine-like influenza
viruses. Significant vaccine effectiveness was also observed. Other than a previously observed increase in
runny nose or nasal congestion, no significant tolerability or safety findings were observed. CAIV-T represents a
valuable public health intervention for reducing influenza illness in young children.
