Abstract
The effectiveness of the influenza vaccine used in the 2001–2002 influenza season in Japan was investigated in a large-scale, geographically widely distributed, Internet-based study. Data were collected from 8841 of 9902 subjects registered by 38 clinics prior to the start
of influenza season. Subjects were categorized into three groups by vaccination regimen: unvaccinated, vaccinated once, and vaccinated
twice. Efficacy was also analyzed for three age groups: 0–15, 16–64, and 65–104 years. Influenza-like illness (ILI) was diagnosed according
to Ministry of Health (MWH, Labor and Welfare in Japan) criteria. Laboratory-confirmed influenza cases were analyzed separately. The
respective vaccine efficacy in the 0–15 years group for the one- and two-dose regimens was 67.6 and 84.5% for ILI and 54.0 and 79.8% for
laboratory-confirmed influenza. Influenza vaccination was also shown to be effective in subjects 16–64 years. Vaccine effectiveness was
not able to be determined for the over 65 years group, probably due to an insufficient number of infected patients. These results suggest that
influenza vaccination is effective for children and adults and that a two-dose regimen is superior to a single dose in children 0–15 years.

1. Introduction
It has been reported that the policy of vaccinating
schoolchildren against influenza in effect before 1993
possibly provided protection and reduced mortality from
influenza among the elderly in Japan [1]. The relation between current increases in influenza related mortality and
the lack of a Japanese regulation mandating influenza vaccination of schoolchildren is now under discussion. Partially
funded by the Japanese government, a single dose vaccination was recommended for residents over 65 years starting
in 2001. However, no prospective megastudy of the efficacy
and safety of vaccination against influenza that includes all
ages has been done in Japan. In addition, differences in the
effectiveness of the one- and two-dose regimens have as yet
not been fully quantified on a prospective basis.
Commercialized rapid diagnosis kits have made it possible to easily diagnose influenza in outpatient clinics. The
Internet has made it easy to collect data from any region of

the world and to analyze data quickly. To our knowledge, no
prospective, Internet-based study of influenza has as yet been
done. This large-scale, prospective, Internet-based study of
influenza in 2001–2002 influenza season in Japan was to
determine the effectiveness and safety of influenza vaccination and includes a comparison the one- and two-dose
regimens.
2. Methods
2.1. Study procedures
Family doctors, pediatricians and physicians at 38 clinics
belonging to the Influenza Study Group of the Japan Physicians Association (the members of the group are listed in
Appendix A) participated in the study.
The main computer system, based on a Pentium workstation running a Structured Query Language (SQL) database
and a World Wide Web server, was placed in a secure room
at the Gifu City Medical Association [2]. Doctors with an
ID and a password were allowed access to this computer

system via the Internet to input data into the SQL database,
using the web-based reporting system (Fig. 1).
First, a common ID and password for entering the registration site was sent by Internet to doctors who applied to participate in this study. In the registration site, the database server
allotted an individual ID automatically to those doctors who
consented to the protocol and registered their names, clinic
names, addresses, telephone numbers and mail addresses.
Each participating doctor also registered a personal password.
From 1 October to 31 December 2001, the doctors enrolled unvaccinated and vaccinated subjects who consented
to be registered in this study. All consenting vaccinated
subjects at each participating clinic were enrolled in the
database. Also enrolled were unvaccinated control subjects
from the same clinic, age and sex matched as closely as possible to the vaccinated subjects, selected at the same clinics. The enrollment data were the enrollee’s number, initial,
birthday, gender, school or occupation, vaccination history
in the last year (2000–2001 season), vaccination regimen,
and the date of vaccination (Fig. 1).
After the influenza season and before the closing date of
31 May, the participating doctors added the following information to the enrollment data: adverse reactions to vaccination, the observed clinical symptoms of influenza (e.g.
highest body temperature, duration of fever, duration of bed
rest), complications, therapy, and the results of rapid diagnosis, culture, and serum titer of paired sera. The clinical
symptoms of each subject were ascertained by any of the
following: self-report questionnaire, phone calls, or by mail.
Most data were collected by self-report questionnaire.
2.2. Vaccination regimen and influenza diagnosis
Vaccination was done once or twice as requested by the
subject. The dosage per inoculation was 0.5 ml for subjects aged over 14 years, 0.3 ml for 6–13 years, 0.2 ml
for 1–6 years and 0.1 ml for subjects under 1 year. The
vaccine contained 30 g of antigen from the component
strains A/New Caledonia/20/99, A/Panama/2007/99 and
B/Johannesburg/5/99. The interval between the two vaccinations ranged for 1–4 weeks, by patient choice.
Influenza-like illness (ILI) was defined as all cases fitting
the symptomatic criteria (presence of all of the following
four symptoms; sudden onset, fever over 38 ◦C, sore throat
as a clinical symptom of upper respiratory tract infection,
and general fatigue) set by the Ministry of Health, Labor
and Welfare in Japan. In this study, influenza was defined
as ILI cases with positive results by rapid diagnosis kits,
influenza virus isolation, or serum antibody titer elevation.
Commercialized rapid diagnosis kits based on enzyme immunoassay [3] or immunochromatography [4] were used
with specimens from throat swabs, nasal swabs, or nasal
aspirates. Virus isolation was done with standard methods.
Serological diagnosis was done by a more than four-fold
elevation of serum titer by hemagglutination inhibition test.
2.3. Statistical analysis
χ2-test was used for comparison, with a P-value below
0.05 considered statistically significant. The patients were
stratified into ten year age cohorts and Mantel–Haenszel
test was done to adjust for age in tests of between group

differences in vaccine efficacy. Multiple regression analysis
was done to determine factors affecting ILI and influenza
prevalence. Age, sex, number of vaccinations, and vaccination in the previous season were included the analysis.
3. Results
3.1. Vaccination status
Complete follow-up data were obtained from 8841of the
9902 enrolled subjects. Base-line characteristics of the 8841
subjects are listed in Table 1. The number of unvaccinated,
one- and two-dose vaccinated subjects was 2188 (1190 female, 998 male), 4359 (2801 female, 1558 male), and 2294
(1391 female, 903 male), respectively. The mean ages of the
three groups were 53.2, 64.0, and 33.4 years old.
The subjects were divided into three age groups: 0–15,
16–64, and 65–104 years. The respective frequencies of subjects taking one- and two-dose vaccinations among vaccines
were 20.1 and 79.9% in subjects 0–15 years, 51.4 and 48.6%
in subjects 16–64 years, and 89.2 and 10.8% in subjects
65–104 years.
3.2. Adverse reactions
Adverse reactions to the influenza vaccine were noted by
96 of the 6626 vaccinated subjects (1.45%) with complete
data. They included skin redness or exanthema (44 cases),
swelling (27 cases), itching (11cases) and pain (7 cases) as
local reactions, and fever (7 cases) and fatigue (6 cases) as
general reactions.
3.3. Diagnosis of ILI and influenza
Of the 8841 subjects, ILI was diagnosed symptomatically
in 127 patients (1.44%). Of these, 75 had one or more laboratory tests for influenza. By the rapid diagnosis kit, 64 patients were positive. Influenza viruses were isolated in three
of six tested cases; two A/H3N2 and one A/H1N1. All three
positive cases were also positive by rapid diagnosis kit. Elevation of serum HI titer was found in five of the six cases
for whom paired sera were tested: four with elevation for
A/H3N2 and one for A/H1N1. Of these five serologically
positive cases, one was negative by the rapid diagnosis kit.
Overall, confirmed influenza cases were 65 of the 75 ILI
patients who had laboratory tests.
3.4. Vaccination efficacy
Efficacy by vaccination status is summarized in Table 2.
The frequency of ILI observed in patients (infection rate)
of all ages was significantly lower in the one- and two-dose
vaccinated groups than in the control group (P < 0.001
by Mantel–Haenszel test). No significant differences were
found between vaccinated once and twice vaccinated patients. The calculated values of efficacy to ILI in the oneand two-dose vaccinated groups were 73.0 and 60.4%, respectively.
In the 0–15 years group, the infection rate was significantly lower in the two-dose vaccinated group than in the
unvaccinated group (2.10% versus 13.53%, P < 0.001 by
χ2-test). The infection rate was also significantly lower in the
one-dose vaccinated group than in the unvaccinated group
(4.38% versus 13.53%, P < 0.001 by χ2-test). The infection rate was significantly lower in the two-dose vaccinated
groups than in the one-dose vaccinated groups (2.10% versus 4.38%, P < 0.05 by χ2-test). The calculated values of
efficacy to ILI in the one- and two-dose vaccinated groups
were 67.6 and 84.5%, respectively.
The subjects 0–15 years were divided into five subgroups:
0–3, 4–6, 7–9, 10–12, and 13–15 years. The infection rate
was significantly lower in two-dose vaccinated subjects than
in unvaccinated subjects in all subgroups. The infection rate
was also lower in one-dose vaccinated subjects than in unvaccinated subjects in the 7–9 and 13–15 years age groups
(Fig. 2).
In the 16–64 years age group, the infection rate was significantly lower in two-dose vaccinated (0.33%) than in unvaccinated subjects (1.83%) (P < 0.01 by χ2-test). The efficacy by one- and two-dose vaccination to ILI was 54.9 and
82.1%, respectively. In subjects 65–104 years of age, no significant differences in infection rates were found among the
unvaccinated, one- and two-dose vaccinated groups.
The infection rates by laboratory-confirmed influenza
were significantly lower for all ages in the one- (0.37%)
and two-dose vaccinated (0.70%) groups than in the unvaccinated group (1.51%) (P < 0.001 by Mantel–Haenszel
test). The efficacy of one- and two-dose vaccination to
laboratory-confirmed influenza was 75.7 and 53.8%, respectively.
The infection rates of laboratory-confirmed influenza
were significantly lower in the two-dose vaccinated groups
than in the unvaccinated group in the 0–15 and 16–64 years
age groups. The efficacy of one- and two-dose vaccination to laboratory-confirmed influenza in the 0–15 years
age group was 54.0 and 79.8%, respectively. In the 0–15
years age group, the infection rate of laboratory-confirmed
influenza was significantly lower in the one-dose vaccinated group than in the unvaccinated group (P < 0.05
by χ2-test). In the 16–64 years age group, the infection
rate of laboratory-confirmed influenza was not significantly
lower in the one-dose vaccinated group than in the unvaccinated group. The efficacy of one- and two-dose vaccination
to laboratory-confirmed influenza in the 16–64 years age
group was 69.6 and 78.5%, respectively.
3.5. Influence of vaccination in the previous season
To assess the influence of vaccination in the previous
season, the frequency of ILI and laboratory-confirmed influenza were surveyed in 2188 unvaccinated patient in the

2.08% in the patients vaccinated in the previous season and
2.99% in previously unvaccinated patients. There was no significant difference between the two groups. The frequency
of laboratory-confirmed influenza was 1.57% in the patients
unvaccinated in the previous season, but no laboratoryconfirmed influenza was found in the vaccinated group. There
was no significant difference between the two groups
(Table 3).
3.6. Factors influencing ILI

regression analysis was done including these factors. Patient

age and the number of vaccinations were extracted as independent factors affecting the prevalence of ILI (P < 0.001).
No significant relationship to ILI was shown for sex or immunization in the previous season.
4. Discussion
One of most important characteristics of this study is
that it was a prospective, Internet-based study in which a
large number of subjects were enrolled from widely distributed clinics in Japan. To our knowledge, this is the first
trial of an Internet-based prospective study of influenza
vaccination. When using the Internet, security is of utmost
importance. In the system used in this study, we permitted

only previously registered doctors to access their own data
in the main computer via the Internet, while checking both
the common and individual ID and passwords. The main
computer system was placed and managed carefully in a
secure room. The Internet is useful for megastudies because the data input system is easily operated. Considering
the merits of the Internet, prospective studies using this
modality may become common in the future.
Vaccination status was shown to differ in the three age
groups. Two-dose vaccination was predominant in the 0–15
years age group. In contrast, one-dose vaccination was predominant in the 65–104 years age group. These results indicate the present preference of Japanese physicians and patients to influenza vaccination: two-doses for children and
one-dose for the elderly. Government financial support for
only a single injection for the elderly may have influenced
this tendency.
The effectiveness and safety of influenza vaccine has been
reported in different settings [5–19]. The frequency of adverse reactions to influenza vaccine was low in this study
compared to other studies. Minor adverse reactions were reported by only 96 of 6626 vaccinated subjects (1.45%), and
no severe adverse reactions were reported. Self-report based
data collection might have resulted in underestimation of
adverse reactions. However, these results indicate the safety
of influenza vaccination of the general population.
Previous studies of the clinical effectiveness of influenza
vaccination had conflicting results [5–8], possibly because
of differences in the match between the virus strains in the
tested vaccines and the circulating strains. In 2001–2002 influenza season, epidemic strains were compatible to vaccine
strains. Incorrect diagnosis of influenza may also have affected the results. Commercially available rapid diagnosis
kits allowed us much more precise diagnosis of influenza
than was previously possible [3,4]. Of the 127 ILI patients,
75 had one or more laboratory tests for influenza and 65
had influenza confirmed. These results indicate that the diagnostic criteria for ILI in this study were reliable as most
patients initially diagnosed with ILI actually had influenza.
Prospective studies have been done on subjects at
high-risk: children, the elderly, and healthy working adults
[8–16]. However, the efficacy and safety of vaccination
has not previously been fully examined by a prospective,
multi-center study that involved thousands of subjects of
all ages. Such a study has been suggested to provide information on the benefits, risks, and economic effects of
immunization [20]. In analysis of the three age groups,
vaccination resulted in a reduction in the number of ILI
patients in the 0–15 and 16–64 years age groups. In the
0–15 years subjects, the infection rate by ILI was smaller
in both the one- and two-dose vaccinated groups than in the
unvaccinated group. And the infection rate of the two-dose
vaccinated group was lower than that of unvaccinated group
in the 16–64 years age groups. These results indicate that influenza vaccination is effective for both children and adults.
Although one-dose vaccination was effective in children,
two-dose vaccination may give better protection.
The efficacy of vaccination has been reported in the
elderly in nursing homes [16], and the effectiveness of
one-dose vaccination compared with two-dose vaccination
was reported in elderly people receiving annual influenza
vaccination [21]. In the present study, we were not able
to confirm the efficacy of influenza vaccine in the 65–104
years age group, possibly because the number of ILI patients
was too small. The National Institute of Infectious Diseases
(IDSC) in Japan reported on its homepage that the number of ILI patients was relatively small in the 2001–2002
influenza season compared with the last 10 years. ILI was
found in only 25 of the 4423 enrolled 65–104 years age
group subjects in this study. Further study is necessary to
evaluate the efficacy of influenza vacciation for the elderly.
To our knowledge, the effect of vaccination in the previous
season has not been fully evaluated. In this study, the influence of vaccination in the previous season was investigated
in 2188 unvaccinated enrollees. Although the frequency of
ILI and laboratory-confirmed influenza was lower in the previously vaccinated enrollees than in enrollees unvaccinated
in the previous season, no significant difference was found
N. Kawai et al. / Vaccine 21 (2003) 4507–4513 4513
between the two groups. In the multiple regression analysis, vaccination in the previous season was not a significant
factor affecting ILI, nor was laboratory-confirmed influenza.
These results suggested that vaccination in the previous season did not provide significant protection in the 2001–2002
influenza season. Continued investigation, especially in 1
year with a relatively large-scale epidemic, should provide
important further information concerning the protective effect of previous influenza vaccination.
In conclusion, influenza vaccination was shown to be safe
and effective in this prospective, large-scale, Internet-based
study. Although one vaccination was shown to have protective efficacy, two vaccinations should be recommended
for children and adults to achieve the greatest possible
protection.
