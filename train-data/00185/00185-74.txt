Abstract Background: The effectiveness of inactivated influenza vaccine in healthy infants and young children has
been controversial. The aim of this study was to determine the prophylactic effect of inactivated influenza
vaccine in young children.
Methods: Eighty-six healthy infants and children younger than 7-years-old were immunized by a subcutaneous injection of inactivated influenza vaccine before the 1999/2000 influenza season. Ninety-four agematched children were randomly assigned as the control. These children were followed-up from January to
April, 2000. A diagnosis of influenza A virus infection was made rapidly by a positive result of the the
enzyme immunoassay membrane test using enzyme-conjugated monoclonal antibodies specific for a
conserved epitope of influenza A nucleoprotein. The incidence of influenza A infection was compared and
statistically assessed.
Results: The prevalence of influenza A virus infection, diagnosed by the influenza A rapid detection test, was
5.8% in the vaccine group and 17.0% in the control group, that is significantly lower in the vaccine receiving
group than the non-receiving group (P = 0.016). However, four out of five infected children in the vaccine
group were younger than 2-years-old.
Conclusion: We conclude that inactivated influenza vaccine reduces the incidence of influenza A virus
infection in 2–6-year-old children.

Outbreak of influenza virus infection is seen throughout the
world almost every year and thousands of children have
influenza virus infection. Each country have addressed the
different programs in their vaccine recommendations. In the
USA, inactivated influenza vaccines are recommended for
use by elderly individuals or high-risk persons1 to prevent
severe complications, but healthy infants and young children
are excluded. In Japan, inactivated influenza vaccines had
been administered to school-aged children to control
influenza virus spread in the community.2,3 However, because
of the lack of any supporting study about this attempt, the
government discontinued the program.2–4 Hence, the
vaccination level in Japan has been very low.
Under the circumstances, many cases of influenzaassociated encephalitis–encephalopathy were reported in
Japan and the major target of the complication are children
younger than 5-years-old.5,6 Thus, the recent interest of the
vaccination is whether immunization of healthy infants and
young children with inactivated influenza vaccines should be
recommended. However, there have been few field trials
about the effectiveness of inactivated influenza vaccines in
these children.
Our objective was to estimate the clinical prophylactic
effect of inactivated influenza vaccine in healthy infants and
young children under the field condition.

children were given inactivated influenza vaccine between
November and December 1999 at Public Shisou General
Hospital or Rokko Island Hospital. As the control group, 94
age-matched infants and children in good health, not
receiving any influenza vaccine within 1 year of enrollment,
were randomly assigned from medical records of the
hospitals.
Children with any congenital disorders or chronic
illnesses were precluded from the study. Children who were
taking medication that might interfere with the study were
also excluded.
Immunization
The immunization was begun early in November and ended
in December 1999. The vaccine group received commercial
inactivated influenza vaccine provided by the Research
Foundation for Microbial Disease of Osaka University,
which contained 200 chick cell agglutination units per
milliliter (CCA/mL) of A/Beijing/262/95 (H1N1), 350 CCA/mL
of A/Sydney/5/97 (H3N2) and 300 CCA/mL of B/Shandong/
7/97. Each dose of subcutaneous injection was as follows.
Infants younger than 1-year-old were given 0.1 mL of the
vaccine, young children from 1 to 6-years-old were given
0.2 mL and children older than 6 years were given 0.3 mL.
They received each dose of the vaccine twice, 14 days apart.
For the ethical reasons, we did not use any placebo
injection as a substitute for the vaccine to the control group.
Diagnosis of influenza A virus infection
Influenza A virus infection was defined by a positive result
of the enzyme immunoassay membrane test (Directigen
FLU-A antigen test: Becton Dickenson Microbiology
Systems, Cockeysville, MD, USA) of specimens from
patients’ pharynges. The test was performed according to the
direction of the manufacture. This enzyme immunoassay
membrane test is using enzyme-conjugated monoclonal
antibodies that are specific for conserved of influenza A
nucleoprotein and detects influenza A virus, but not influenza
B.7 A result was available in less than 15 min.7
Follow-up
The follow-up period was from January to April, 2000. The
participating children were asked to come to the hospitals
whenever they presented with febrile illness. When the
children were seen for the febrile illness (> 37.8°C), in
addition to the physical examination, throat swabs from all
the children were examined by the enzyme immunoassay
membrane test to detect the influenza A virus antigen. The
results of the examinations were recorded.
Whether febrile episodes of all children could be recorded
was confirmed by questionnaires regarding febrile illness
during the follow-up period sent to all participants, or direct
interviews at the end of the study period.
Statistical analysis
The outcome was compared by Fisher’s exact test.
Differences were considered significant if P was < 0.05.
Results
Eighty-six children (44 boys and 42 girls) younger than
7 years (38.7 ± 22.2 months) received inactivated influenza
vaccine. Ninety-four children (54 boys and 40 girls,
36.2 ± 19.9 months) were enrolled as the control group. The
characteristics of vaccine group and the control group were
statistically not different (Table 1).

Influenza vaccine to young children 45
Among the febrile patients, five patients (5.8%) in the
vaccine group and 16 (17.0%) in the control group were
positive for influenza A virus antigen. As the enzyme
immunoassay membrane test was performed for all febrile
patients, the result indicated the incident of influenza A virus
infection, which was significantly lower in the vaccine
receiving group than the non-vaccine group (P = 0.016)
(Table 2). However, 80% (four out of five) of immunized
children infected with influenza A virus were younger than
2-years-old (Table 2).
Discussion
In the present study, the incident of influenza A virus
infection was significantly lower in the vaccine-receiving
group than the non-vaccine group. Therefore, it could be
concluded that the inactivated influenza virus vaccine was
effective in preventing the healthy young children from the
influenza A virus infection. However, four out of five
immunized children infected with influenza A virus were
younger than 2-years-old (Table 2). Rates of influenza in the
vaccine group and the non-vaccine group among the toddlers
younger than 2 years were 15.4% and 13.3%, respectively,
which was not statistically significant (P = 0.562). Although
sero responses of infants and young children to the influenza
vaccines were identified, the responses vary with the vaccine
immmunogen in these population.8 Mbawuike et al. demonstrated that vaccination with inactivated influenza A virus
vaccine does not invariably induce detectable cytotoxic T
lymphocyte activity in infants aged 6 months to 2 years.9
These facts, together with our result, may suggest that the
prophylactic effect of the vaccine in toddlers older than
2 years are limited, although the number of the 0–2-years
children in our study was not enough to conclude the inefficiency of the vaccine in these children. Two recent studies
have shown increased rates of influenza-related hospitalizations among children older than 2-year-old children10,11 and
suggest that routine influenza vaccination should be
considered in these children.11 However, more detailed
studies focusing on the children younger than 2-years-old
will be necessary.
Estimation of the usefulness of the vaccine among infants
and young children under the field condition has not been
easy, partially because it is difficult to distinguish influenza
virus infection from the other respiratory viruses infections.
For example, in particular, respiratory syncytial virus, of
which clinical manifestation resemble that of influenza is
prevalent in the winter and often coincidial with influenza.12
In our present study, to make a diagnosis of influenza A virus
infection, an enzyme immunoassay membrane test (Directigen
FLU-A test) was used. The negative predictive value and the
false-negative rate of the test were 100 and 0%, respectively,
and there was no evidence of cross-reactivity with noninfluenza A antigen.7 Hence, the reliability of the results of
the test were comparable to the other diagnostic methods,
such as virus isolation.7
The efficacy of inactivated influenza vaccines in adult and
older children has been well studied.13–15 However, in young
children and infants, there have been few field trials for
evaluation of prophylactic effect of inactivated influenza
vaccines. Thus, each country has addressed the different
programs in their vaccine recommendations for these children.
In Japan, the inactivated influenza vaccine had been administered to school-aged children to control influenza virus spread
in the community. However, because of growing doubt about
the effectiveness of this attempt,1–4 the government discontinued the program and the public in Japan has been reluctant to
accept influenza vaccines especially for healthy infants and
young children.3
 The results of our study indicate the prophylactic effect of inactivated influenza vaccine in preschool-aged
children, which would encourage health-care practitioners to
improve the vaccination rate of these populations.
In conclusion, administration of the inactivated influenza
vaccine reduced the incident of influenza A virus infection in
2–6-year-old children. The future direction of the study will
be one that determines the prophylactic effect of the vaccine
on the toddlers younger than 2-years-old.
