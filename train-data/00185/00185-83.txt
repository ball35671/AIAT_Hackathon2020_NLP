Abstract
The formation of immunity and epidemiological effectiveness of inactivated influenza vaccines in children, regularly immunized against influenza for three years, were evaluated. The study revealed that a year after each immunization the number of children having antibodies in liters regarded as protective decreased 2-2.5 times. At the periods of epidemics morbidity rate among the vaccines dynamically decreased in these years 1.3, 2.0 and 2.8 times. Considering that a year after the second immunization a high immune stratum (60-78%) was retained in the group under study, we propose that annual immunization of the same children be limited by a period of three years, followed by an interval of one year.
