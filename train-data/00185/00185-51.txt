Introduction
Influenza is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in the
US and abroad, affecting approximately 20% of children and 5%
of adults worldwide each year.1
 In the United States, influenzarelated mortality is highest among the elderly, but deaths attributable to influenza also occur in the pediatric population, with
infants at greater risk than older children.2,3 Influenza-associated
hospitalization rates among infants are comparable to rates in
the elderly population, ranging from approximately 150/100,000
person-years among otherwise healthy children to more than
1,000/100,000 person-years among children under one year of
age with high-risk medical conditions.4-6 Influenza also accounts
for a significant number of pediatric outpatient clinic visits and
emergency department visits each year, increased use of antibiotics and other medications and loss of productivity due to parent
and caregiver absenteeism.7,8
In 2003, the Advisory Committee on Immunization
Practices (ACIP) began recommending annual vaccination of
otherwise healthy infants 6 to 23 months of age for the prevention and control of influenza. In 2006, the ACIP expanded its
Influenza is a common and potentially serious infection in infants. Previous studies of influenza vaccine in this age group
have reported widely varying estimates of vaccine effectiveness, and few have used laboratory confirmation of influenza
diagnoses. We evaluated the effectiveness of one and two doses of the trivalent inactivated vaccine against laboratoryconfirmed influenza in children aged 6 to 23 months within the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Medical Care
Program for the 2003–2004, 2004–2005 and 2005–2006 influenza seasons. 1,648 children were included in the analyses,
with an average of 4.5 controls matched to each of the 300 cases (213, 29 and 58 cases identified for each of the influenza
seasons, respectively) based on birth month/year and zip code. Vaccination status was determined as of 14 days prior
to the case patient’s positive test result. Conditional logistic regression was used to calculate vaccine effectiveness for
each season, adjusting for chronic medical conditions and other possible confounders. During the 2005–2006 influenza
season, when predominant circulating virus strains and vaccine strains were well-matched, vaccination was 76%
(95% CI: 37–91%) effective against laboratory-confirmed infection. There was no statistically significant effect of
vaccination, however, for the 2003–2004 or 2004–2005 seasons. Our results highlight the need for further study of
influenza vaccine effectiveness in this age group.

recommendations for influenza vaccination to include otherwise
healthy children up to 5 years of age; in February 2008 this was
extended to include all children and adolescents less than 18
years.9
 The recommendations state that children less than 9 years
old who have not been vaccinated previously against influenza
should receive two doses of the vaccine at least one month apart
within the same influenza season. Children previously vaccinated
against influenza need only receive a single dose.10
Infants as young as 6 months old develop protective levels of antibody titers against influenza following vaccination,
although two doses are required to produce an optimal response
among children who have not been vaccinated previously.11-13
Infants and young children also appear to produce a cellular
immune response to vaccination.14,15 The effectiveness of the
influenza vaccine in preventing clinical disease, however, is less
clear in this population. The few published studies that have
evaluated influenza vaccine in children less than 24 months of
age have estimated the vaccine efficacy/effectiveness to range
from -7% up to 52%, depending on a variety of factors including the outcome measured, the particular influenza season,
and the number of vaccine doses.16,17 In contrast, studies of the
effectiveness of influenza vaccination among older children

premature birth and low birth weight, routine infant immunization status and influenza vaccination status. Overall, asthma
or reactive airway disease (documented on at least two separate
occasions) accounted for 41% of chronic illnesses. For the 2003–
2004 and 2005–2006 seasons, a higher percentage of case subjects had a chronic medical condition compared to controls (p =
0.011 and p = 0.003, respectively), with asthma or reactive airway
disease accounting for a significant proportion of this difference
for the 2003–2004 season (p = 0.004). There were no differences
between cases and controls in terms of premature birth, low birth
weight or routine infant immunization status. Across all 3 influenza seasons, only 10.5% of the 1,648 children included in the
study were fully vaccinated and 19.7% were partially vaccinated
against influenza as of 14 days prior to the relevant test date.
To investigate the effectiveness of influenza vaccine in preventing laboratory-confirmed disease, we performed univariate
conditional logistic regression to assess the relationship between
vaccination status and disease outcome for each influenza season (Table 3). A significant protective effect of the vaccine was
seen only for the 2005–2006 influenza season, with an estimated
vaccine effectiveness of 80% (95% CI 50–90%) for partially
vaccinated children, 59% (95% CI 1–80%) for fully vaccinated
children and 71% (95% CI 41–86%) for partially and fully vaccinated groups combined.
We next performed multivariate conditional logistic regression to explore the relationship between influenza vaccination
and laboratory-confirmed disease and to identify independent
predictors of disease outcome (Table 3). For the 2003–2004
season, 890 out of 1,164 subjects (76%) were included in the
multivariate analysis, excluding any subject whose KPNC membership was not continuous from birth. For the 2004–2005 and
2005–2006 seasons, 118 out of 153 subjects (77%) and 216 out
of 331 subjects (65%) were included, respectively. Children with
chronic medical conditions were more likely than healthy children to have a positive influenza test regardless of vaccination
status for both the 2003–2004 season [adjusted OR (AOR) 1.84,
95% CI 1.1–3.1] and the 2005–2006 season, with an AOR of
3.66 (95% CI 1.3–10.7). We also found a statistically significant
effect of male gender, with boys more likely than girls to have a
positive influenza test during the 2005–2006 season [OR = 2.33
(CI: 1.1–5.1)]. In our multivariate analyses, influenza vaccination was protective during the 2005–2006 season for partially
vaccinated infants with a VE of 83% (95% CI 40–100%), and
for partially and fully vaccinated subjects combined with a VE
of 76% (95% CI 37–91%). There was a trend toward decreased
incidence of disease among fully vaccinated subjects alone during
this season, but the effect did not reach statistical significance
(p = 0.053).
Discussion
Our results indicated a significant protective effect of the TIV
against laboratory-confirmed influenza in children less than two
years of age for only one of three successive influenza seasons.
This apparent difference in vaccine effectiveness across influenza
seasons fit well with KPNC data regarding the degree of match or
have more consistently demonstrated a protective effect for the
vaccine.18
To evaluate influenza vaccine effectiveness among children
in this youngest age group, we identified children aged 6 to
23 months within the Northern California Kaiser Permanente
Medical Care Program who tested positive for influenza during the years 2003–2006. Control subjects without a positive
influenza test were matched to each of these cases based on birth
month/year and zip code, and the vaccination status of each
case and control subject was assessed. Here we report the vaccine effectiveness against laboratory-confirmed influenza infection among children 6 to 23 months of age for three consecutive
influenza seasons.
Results
We identified 293 infants with positive influenza test results during the 2003–2004 season. Of these, we excluded 80 due to noncontinuous Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC)
membership or lack of appropriately matched controls, resulting
in a total of 213 cases. For the 2004–2005 season, we identified 40 infants with positive influenza test results and excluded
11 for similar reasons, resulting in a total of 29 cases. For the
2005–2006 season, we identified 83 infants with positive influenza test results and excluded 25, resulting in a total of 58 cases.
There were no significant differences in gender, chronic disease
status or vaccination rates between included and excluded cases.
For all 3 influenza seasons, the peak incidence of laboratoryconfirmed influenza in this study population was December, with
the latest influenza cases identified in February, March and April,
for the 2003–2004, 2004–2005 and 2005–2006 seasons, respectively. The vast majority of positive tests were for influenza A, with
100% of cases detected by direct immunofluorescence antibody
staining in 2003–2004, then moving toward a more even distribution of DFA-confirmed and culture-confirmed cases by 2005–
2006 (Table 1). Viral culture is typically considered the gold
standard for influenza diagnosis. Compared with viral culture,
the sensitivity and specificity of DFA for detection of influenza
in children have been estimated at 62% and 98%, respectively.19
The shift in testing techniques over time is explained in part by
the labor-intensive nature of DFA testing and was eventually followed by a switch to PCR testing by the end of 2006.

according to gender, presence of a chronic medical condition,

US studies that specifically assess influenza vaccine efficacy/
effectiveness in children under two. Hoberman et al. published
the results of a randomized controlled trial aimed at evaluating the efficacy of the TIV in preventing acute otitis media in
children aged 6 to 24 months. They reported a vaccine efficacy
against culture-confirmed influenza of 66% for the 1999–2000
influenza season (95% CI 34–82%) but -7% for 2000–2001
mismatch between vaccine strains and predominant circulating
strains of the virus, with a much better match for 2005–2006,
during which vaccine efficacy was demonstrated, than for either
of the previous two seasons.
Overall, our results are in accord with previous research
indicating a variable effect of the influenza vaccine in this age
group. To our knowledge, there have only been a few major

We did not restrict our control group to include only those
individuals with a negative influenza test during the given season
because this would have severely limited the number of controls
available to match and also because one negative influenza test
would not preclude the possibility that an individual was infected
with influenza at another point during the season. However, by
limiting cases to those patients with laboratory-confirmed infection, we increased our ability to detect an effect of the vaccine
by only counting cases of influenza-like illness actually documented as being caused by influenza. Finally, we acknowledge
the limitations posed by lack of access to data regarding symptoms prompting influenza testing. We recognize that every parent has different criteria for seeking medical attention for a child
with febrile respiratory illness, and every clinician has different
criteria for performing influenza testing. This is complex issue, a
full discussion of which is beyond the scope of this paper, but a
strength of our study is that it reflects the results of populationbased vaccination and influenza testing practices.
A 2006 Cochrane review of influenza vaccination in healthy
children concludes that “[n]ational policies for the vaccination
of healthy young children are based on very little evidence” and
that, for children under two, the little evidence available suggests that TIV efficacy is similar to placebo.24 Several of the more
recent studies described above lend support to the idea that two
doses of the vaccine can provide infants with significant protection against influenza infection. In our study, even one dose was
effective when there was a good match between the vaccine strains
and the predominant circulating strains in the community. When
the match is off, however, our data suggest that vaccination may
do little to protect infants from infection. Several recent reviews
and a meta-analysis have confirmed that the protective effect of
influenza vaccination in children increases with increasing age
meaning, in general, that those at highest risk of influenza-related
complications and death are least likely to respond to inactivated
vaccine.18,25,26 The question arises, then: how can we do better?
One option is to use a different vaccine. The live attenuated
influenza vaccine (LAIV) is not currently licensed for children
under the age of two because preliminary studies found an
increased incidence of reactive airway disease among children in
this age group vaccinated with LAIV.27 Recent studies, however,
indicate that LAIV is quite efficacious in young children, likely
more so than TIV, even against drifted strains. Symptoms such
as runny nose and nasal congestion were more common in the
LAIV groups, but for children older than 12 months with no history of reactive airway disease, there was no increase in wheezing
following LAIV administration.28-30 In October 2007, the ACIP
recommend expanding the use of LAIV to include healthy children ages 2–4 years old without a history of asthma or recurrent
wheezing.31 Further studies may confirm that LAIV is a better
alternative for at least a subset of even younger children.
Another option is to rely on herd immunity to protect those
at greatest risk. Rates of influenza infection are highest among
school-age children, and it is these children who are largely
responsible for the spread of influenza within communities.32 An
idea that has gained recent attention is that vaccinating otherwise
healthy school-age children against influenza could potentially
(95% CI -247%–67%), a difference due at least in part to varying
influenza attack rates.16 In 2005, Ritzwoller and colleagues published a retrospective cohort study of influenza vaccine effectiveness in preventing medically attended influenza-like illness (ILI)
and pneumonia and influenza (P&I). According to their report,
vaccine effectiveness for fully vaccinated infants was 25% against
ILI (95% CI 0–44%) and 49% against P&I (95% CI 9–71%).
For partially vaccinated infants, however, there was no statistically significant reduction in either ILI or P&I rates.20 A 2006
report by Allison et al. supported these findings.21 More recently,
Shuler and colleagues published the results of a case control study
of influenza vaccine effectiveness against laboratory-confirmed
influenza during the 2003–2004 influenza season. In the 6 to 23
months age group, vaccine effectiveness was 52% for fully vaccinated children but, again, there was no significant reduction
in influenza for partially vaccinated children.17 A 2008 study by
Eisenberg et al. replicated this result of reduced influenza-related
medical visits among fully vaccinated patients 6 to 59 months
of age for one of the two seasons under study (2004–2005), but
demonstrated no protective effect of partial vaccination for the
2003–2004 season or the 2004–2005 season.22 And in a casecohort study of the same age group and same two influenza seasons, Szilagyi et al. found no significant protection conferred by
vaccination.23
In our study, it is evident that the power to detect a significant
effect of the vaccine (as judged by the 95% confidence intervals
for vaccine effectiveness) was less than ideal, particularly for the
first two seasons under study. A contributing factor to the lack
of statistical power was the smaller sample size for the 2004–
2005 season. Given the relatively constant number of infants
and young children enrolled in the system, it is unclear why we
saw discrepancies in the number of influenza cases identified in
2003–2004 versus in the latter two seasons (even accounting for
higher influenza attack rates seen across the country for 2003–
2004). The power of our study was also limited by relatively low
vaccine coverage, starting close to 25% (including both fully and
partially vaccinated children) for the first year the new ACIP recommendation was in effect, and approaching 50% for the subsequent seasons. This is relatively consistent with national data
published in the MMWR citing 33% influenza vaccine coverage
among infants 6 to 23 months of age.10 The lower number of fully
vaccinated patients also likely contributed to our counterintuitive
finding that partial vaccination, but not complete vaccination,
provided statistically significant protection during the 2005–
2006 season. Incomplete data on birth weight, gestational age,
chronic disease status and routine infant immunizations limited
the power of our multivariate analysis, though this represented
less than 25% of subjects for the first two seasons. In addition,
our study was non-randomized, leading to possible selection bias
with respect to which patients received the vaccine and, because
control subjects were not necessarily tested for influenza, might
have allowed for some misclassification bias. Another potential
source of misclassification bias was the predominant use of DFA
testing (vs. viral culture) during the first two seasons under study
which, due to its lower sensitivity, may have led to an underestimate of VE for those seasons.

Circulating virus and vaccine strains. For the 2003–2004
season, the trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine for the U.S.
included A/Panama (H3N2), A/New Caledonia (H1N1), and
B/Hong Kong virus strains. With the emergence of the drifted
Fujian/411/2002 (H3N2) strain, which accounted for the majority of influenza A cases in California and throughout the country,
this season’s vaccine provided limited protection against predominant circulating strains of the virus. The 2004–2005 U.S.
vaccine, which included A/New Caledonia/20/1999 (H1N1),
A/Wyoming/3/2003 (H3N2) and B/Jiangsu/10/2003 strains,
was also a poor match with 71% of influenza A specimens tested by
the state lab representing a drifted California strain [unpublished
data]. For the 2005–2006 season, however, the vaccine included
A/New Caledonia/20/1999 (H1N1), A/California/7/2004 (or
the antigenically equivalent A/New York/55/2004, both H3N2)
and B/Jiangsu/10/2003 strains, and provided a good match with
predominant circulating virus strains aside from a small outbreak
of a B/Malaysia strain that occurred in California around week
12 of the influenza season.
Vaccination status. Based on the KPNC immunization tracking system, influenza vaccination status was determined for each
case and control subject according to the following criteria:
• Fully Vaccinated: patient received two doses of the influenza
vaccine—at least one month apart—between September 1st of
the current influenza season and 14 days prior to the relevant test
date (the date of the positive influenza test for the case subject
and for matched control subjects) or patient received at least one
dose of the vaccine during the previous influenza season as well
as one dose during the current season between September 1st and
14 days prior to the relevant test date.
• Partially Vaccinated: patient received only one of the two
recommended doses of the influenza vaccine between September
1st and 14 days prior to the relevant test date and did not receive
a dose during the previous influenza season.
• Unvaccinated: patient received zero doses of the influenza
vaccine between September 1st and 14 days prior to the relevant
test date (patient may or may not have been vaccinated during the
previous influenza season).
All children immunized during this time received the trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV).
Covariates. In addition to influenza vaccination status and
laboratory-confirmed disease outcome, we also looked at a number of covariates that we might expect to influence vaccination
rates, rates of influenza infection or both:
(1) Chronic medical conditions. The ACIP has identified groups
of people who, based on the presence of certain underlying medical conditions, are recommended to receive annual influenza
vaccination regardless of age due to increased risk of influenzarelated complications.10 We reviewed ICD-9 codes associated
with all inpatient and outpatient KPNC visits for both case and
control subjects to identify children with these conditions, such
as chronic pulmonary disease (including asthma or reactive airway disease, documented on at least two separate occasions),
chronic cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, hematologic or metabolic
disorders, immunosuppressive conditions and neurologic/neuromuscular disorders.
reduce flu-related morbidity and mortality in the population as a
whole, perhaps even more effectively than increasing vaccination
coverage among at-risk groups themselves. This approach is supported both by epidemiologic studies and mathematical models,
as well as analyses of cost-effectiveness.33-36 If parents and clinicians follow the current ACIP recommendation of annual vaccination for all children and adolescents, in addition to vaccination
of household contacts of the youngest children, one would hope
to see a significant decrease in influenza-related morbidity and
mortality in all age groups.
Materials and Methods
Study population. Children between the ages of 6 and 23
months as of September 1st of the given influenza season who had
been continuously enrolled as KPNC members since 6 months
of age were eligible for inclusion in the study. The total number
of enrolled children less than 2 years of age in the KPNC system
remained relatively constant across influenza seasons at approximately 65,000. The study was approved by the Institutional
Review Boards of KPNC, University of California Berkeley, and
Stanford University.
Study design. For this case control study, we defined our
study period as September 1st through May 1st for each of the
three influenza seasons (2003–2004, 2004–2005 and 2005–
2006). Surveillance was extended through May 1st based on
KPNC data indicating a late peak in influenza B activity during
the 2005–2006 season. We defined a case as having a laboratory-confirmed positive influenza test during the study period
by at least one of the following methods: viral culture, immunofluorescence antibody staining (DFA or IFA), reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction or any commercially available
rapid diagnostic test for influenza. We elected to include all testing methods available in order to capture as many laboratoryconfirmed cases as possible, and acknowledge that this would
preclude having culture confirmation of each infecting strain.
Influenza testing was performed as clinically indicated at the
discretion of each clinician. We assumed that children tested
for influenza had symptoms suggestive of infection although,
because testing was at the discretion of the clinician, it is possible that a proportion of children with URI symptoms were not
tested for influenza.
We identified cases through database review of KPNC laboratory records, and only the first positive influenza test for each
infant in each influenza season was considered. Controls did not
have a positive test for influenza and were matched with cases by
birth month and year as well as zip code as of February of the
given year. Whenever more than five controls per case were identified, five were randomly selected to act as controls. Whenever
two or more cases in a given flu season shared the same birth
month, birth year and zip code, matched controls were randomly
divided between the cases. Based on our preliminary power calculations, assuming three cases per control and a 50% prevalence
of exposure among control subjects, we estimated that we would
need 100 cases per season to detect a vaccine effectiveness of 50%
with 80% power.

Statistical analysis. We used conditional logistic regression
to analyze the relationship between influenza vaccination status
and laboratory-confirmed influenza. To generate an unadjusted
odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for laboratory-confirmed disease, matched analyses examined flu vaccination
status and influenza disease for each season. We also performed
multivariate conditional logistic regression to adjust for gender,
chronic disease status, premature birth, low birth weight and routine infant immunization status. Preliminary analysis included a
main effects term for each of these possible confounders as well
as an interaction term for the confounder with influenza vaccination status. We excluded any non-significant interactions in the
preliminary analysis (p > 0.05) from the final model. We calculated the vaccine effectiveness using the unadjusted or adjusted
OR, where VE = [1 - OR] * 100, and used SAS Enterprise Guide
(version 4.1) for all analyses.

(2) Premature birth and low birth weight. We examined KPNC
data on gestational age and birth weight to identify premature
and low birth weight infants (defined as <37 weeks gestation and
<2,500 grams, respectively) who might be at increased risk of
influenza infection or influenza-related complications.
(3) Routine infant immunization status. As an indicator of overall healthcare utilization, we reviewed complete immunization
records for all case and control patients, and assessed whether
or not each child was up to date on these routine infant immunizations. Children between 6 and 23 months of age as of the
positive influenza test date for the case subject were considered up
to date if they received at least 3 doses of diphtheria-containing
vaccines by 7 months of age. Children 24 months and older as of
the relevant test date were considered up to date if they received
at least one measles, mumps and rubella vaccine and 4 doses of
Haemophilus influenza type b-containing vaccines by 24 months
of age.
Although most case and control subjects were continuously
enrolled as KPNC members from birth through the relevant test
date, those who were not were excluded from multivariate analyses due to the possibility of missing data regarding chronic medical conditions and immunization records.
