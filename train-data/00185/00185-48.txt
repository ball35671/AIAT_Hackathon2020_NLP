A monovalent, zonally purified, inactivated influenza B vaccine was administered to 29 children, 3 to 6 years of age, and 16 infants, 12 to 28 months of age, as a single dose of 0.25 ml containing 250 chick cell agglutinating units. The vaccine was both antigenic and well tolerated in the older group of preschool children, In the infant the vaccine was also antigenic but poorly tolerated clinically. Febrile reactions to 102° or greater were seen in 9 of the 16 infants, and two of these infants experienced a seizure following vaccination. The clinical reactions observed with the administration of influenza B vaccine in the dose used in this study would suggest significant limitations on its use in children under 3 years of age.
