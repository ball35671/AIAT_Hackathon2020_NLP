Ninety-two children received single doses of one of 13 monovalent vaccines derived
from influenza virus strain A/New Jersey/8/76 (A/NJ), and 18 children received placebo. Five influenza virus vaccines were whole-virus vaccines, and eight
were split-product vaccines. Samples of sera were taken once three weeks after vaccination. All of the 29 children receiving whole-virus vaccines developed a titer of antibody to A/NJ virus of ~1:20, and the geometric mean titers were 1:14-1:45. One of
the 60 children who received split-product vaccines developed a titer of antibody to
A/NJ of ~1:20, and geometric mean titers were all <1:10. There was a trend toward correlation between titers of hemagglutination-inhibiting (HAl) antibody to
A/NJ and titers of HAl antibody to A/Victoria/3/75 viruses, with a correlation
coefficient of 0.10 for children who received whole-virus vaccines. Three of 60 recipients of split-product vaccines and two of 20 recipients of whole virus developed
a fever of ~38 C. One of the two febrile children who had received whole-virus vaccine had otitis media. Therefore, reactogenicity of whole-virus vaccines and splitproduct vaccines appeared to be similar in these children.
The isolation and serological identification of a
type A influenza virus, characterized as similar
to the swine strains of influenza virus isolated
during 1918, from the respiratory tract of a recruit in Fort Dix, N.J., occurred in the spring
of 1976. An intensive program was initiated
to provide the necessary data upon which a nationwide immunization program might be based.
Prior experience with immunization of children
against influenza A viruses was minimal. Members of the Department of Pediatrics, Duke University Medical Center (Durham, N.C.) in active cooperation with colleagues at the Lincoln
Community Health Center (LCHC, Durham,
N.C.) elected to participate in a program to
provide information concerning the responses of
children to single doses of whole-virus vaccines,
split-product vaccines, and placebo.
This study was supported by contract no. AI 22507 from
the Development and Applications Branch, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health.

Materials and Methods
Patient population. Members of the Pediatric Staff at the LCHC provide longitudinal
health services to members of the community of
Durham City. The estimated number of children younger than 14 years of age receiving care
at the LCHC is 6,383. The patients are predominantly black and from the neighborhoods surrounding the LCHC. The community participates
in the programs of the LCHC, and continuity of
care is excellent.
During May 17-24, 1976, personnel and patients visiting the LCHC were informed that
a study of vaccination of children three to 10
years of age would be held the following week.
Between May 24 and May 28, vaccination was offered to all children of the appropriate ages who
appeared at the LCHC and whose physician allowed participation. Written consent was obtained after the purpose, procedures, and risks of
the study had been explained to the accompanying parent.
Study design. The collaborative study divided children into two groups by age (three to six
years and six to 10 years) for administration of
vaccine. Vaccine was produced from influenza
virus strain A/New Jersey/8/76 (A/NJ).

Vaccines and placebo were prepared by four licensed manufacturers. Vials were coded and labeled by personnel from the Bureau of Biologics
(Food and Drug Administration, Bethesda,
Md.) Each child was identified by age and then
assigned his or her vaccine by continuous rotation of vial numbers. Children received 0.25
ml of the appropriate vaccine or placebo. The
preparations utilized are listed in table 1. Merrell-National Laboratories (MN, Cincinnati,
Ohio) and Merck Sharp and Dohme (MSD, West
Point, Pa.) vaccines were whole-virus preparations, whereas Wyeth Laboratories (W, Philadelphia, Pa.) and Parke, Davis and Company (PD,
Detroit, Mich.) vaccines were "disrupted-virion" or "split-product" vaccines.
Vaccine was administered into the deltoid muscle, and children remained at the LCHC for 20
min after vaccination. The mother was given
two thermometers to take home; one was to be
used in 6 hr and the other in 9 hr, and both
were to be returned the next day to be read by

the investigators. The child returned the following day to be examined for adverse reactions
or fever. The mother was given a sheet on which
to record adverse reactions, i.e., pain at the site
of injection, malaise, myalgia, headache, fever,
nausea, and signs of local irritation including
tenderness, redness, and induration. This form
was completed in the LCHC the day after vaccination. During the study a physician was available to the vaccine recipients for advice and care
when an adverse reaction was recognized or suspected by the parents. Three weeks following
the vaccination, the children returned to donate
sera for determination of the titer of HAl antibody. All sera were assayed for titer of HAl antibody to A/Victoria/3/75 (A/Victoria), A/
swine/1976/31 (A/swine), A/Mayo Clinic/
103/74 (A/MC), and A/NJ viruses at the laboratories of the Center for Disease Control (CDC,
Atlanta, Ga.).
After the antibody titer was reported to the
investigators, those children who had not
achieved a titer to A/NJ virus of ~1 :20 were offered revaccination with 100 chick cell-agglutinating (CCA) units of MN vaccine. In calculation of
the geometric mean titer (GMT) of antibody in
serum, titers of 0 were assigned a value of 1:5.
Results
One hundred sixteen children were immunized
during the initial phase of vaccination, and
sera from 110 of these children were assayed by
the CDC.
Response of children three to six years of age
to A /NJ virus vaccine. Thirty-one children received vaccines, and 12 received placebo. The
manufacturer, dosage level of CCA units, number
of subjects, number of subjects with a titer of HAl
antibody to A/NJ virus of ~1:20, and GMT of
antibody to A/NJ virus are presented in table 1.
The nine subjects who received 100 CCA units of
MN whole-virus vaccine developed a titer of HAl
antibody to A/NJ virus of ~1:20 (range, 1:20-
I :320; GMT, 1:37). Two of the 12 children in
the three- to six-year-old group who received 100
CCA units of W vaccine developed a titer of
I: 10, and 20 children who received 100 CCA
units of W or PD vaccine had a titer of <I: 10.

ceived vaccine, and six received placebo (table 1).
Twenty-three children received whole-virus vaccine. Of the six who received 100 CCA units of MN
vaccine, three developed a titer of antibody to A/
NJ virus of~1 :20. The 11 children who received
200 or 400 CCA units of MN vaccine and six children who received 100 CCA units of MSD vaccine
developed titers of antibody to A/NJ virus of
~1:20. The GMTs of antibody to 100,200, and 400
CCA units of MN vaccine were 14, 25, and 30, respectively, and the GMT of antibody to 100 CCA
units of MSD vaccine was I :45. Thus, 20 of 23
children who received whole-virus vaccine developed a titer of antibody to A/NJ virus of
~1:20.
Thirty-eight children received split-product
vaccine. No child who received 100, 200, or 400
CCA units of W vaccine, 100 or 200 CCA units
of PD vaccine, or placebo deveoped an antibody response to A/NJ virus of ~1:20. One child
who received 400 CCA units of PD vaccine
developed a titer of antibody to A/NJ virus of
1:160.
Correspondence of titers of antibody to A /NJ
virus with titers of antibody to A /MC and A /
swine viruses. There was identity between titers of HAl antibody to A/NJ virus and A/
MC virus in 80 children, and the remaining 12
titers were within one dilution of correspondence. This observation indicated a direct relation between these two determinations. Only
14 of the 92 children who received vaccine
achieved an HAl titer of antibody to A/swine
of ~1:10, and there was no apparent relation
between responses to A/NJ and to A/swine.
Titers of antibody to A / Victoria virus. Influenza was widespread in Durham in the
winter of 1976. Influenza virus strain A/Victoria was identified in North Carolina during
this period. It was, therefore, of great interest
that 94 (86%) of 110 children had titers of HAl
antibody to A/Victoria of ~1: 10, and 74
(68%) had titers of HAl antibody to A/Victoria of~1 :20 when measured after immunization
with A/NJ influenza virus vaccine. It seems likely that this finding represented prior exposure
to A/Victoria virus. The data were analyzed to
determine any effect of previous exposure to
influenza virus on the response to vaccine.
Similar titers of antibody to A/NJ and A/
Victoria viruses occurred in four instances, and
5577
an additional 16 children had titers that differed
by one dilution (table 2). The correlation
coefficient was 0.10 (P < 0.05) and indicated a
general correspondence between titers of antibody to A/NJ and A/Victoria viruses.
Twenty-three children aged six to 10 years received the whole-virus vaccines, which had induced a titer of antibody to A/NJ virus of
~1:20 in the majority of instances. Eleven of
these children had a titer of antibody to A/Victoria virus of 0 or 10, and 12 had a titer of antibody to A/Victoria virus of ~1 :20. The GMT of
antibody to A/NJ virus for the former children
was 19 and for the latter was 36 (P < 0.07).
These data suggest a trend toward increased responsiveness to A/NJ virus vaccine among children who had had prior exposure to A/Victoria virus. Since sera were not drawn before vaccination, it is also possible that administration
of A/NJ virus vaccine boosted titers of antibody
to A/Victoria virus in some instances.
Finally, data concerning titers of antibody to
A/Victoria virus were pooled for all children
of all ages for the following three groups: (1)
those 32 children who had received MN or MSD
vaccines (GMT, 1:17; SD, ± 1:13); (2) those 60
children who had received PD or W virus vaccines (GMT, 1:21; SD,± 1:10); and (3) those 18
children who had received placebo (GMT, 1:13;
SD, ± 1:10). The difference between GMTs of vaccinees and recipients of placebo was significant
(0.05 < P < 0.01). The proportions of each
group that had titers of antibody to A/Victoria

91% for group 2, and 77% for group 3.
Adverse reactions. Three- to six-year-old children. Toxicity in the 34 younger children who
received vaccine was minimal (table 3). A local
reaction characterized only as a palpable lump
at the site of injection was observed in two children. Neither of these children developed significant detectable antibodies. Three of these 31
children had temperatures of 38.0 C-38.2 C.
These three children had received split-product
vaccine, and the fever was noted only because
the mothers were requested to take the child's
temperature. None of these children developed
detectable antibodies to influenza A/NJ virus.
Six- to 10-year-old children. Twelve of the 64
six- to Itl-year-old children who received vaccine
reported a palpable lump at the site of injection.
Nine of these children developed no detectable
antibodies, and three had rises in titer of antibody of ==1 :20. Four children reported headache
or malaise after the immunization, although
normal activities were unaltered.
One child reported a temperature of 38.3 C,
and another child had a temperature of 39.9 C.
The former child had no demonstrable symptoms, and a temperature was taken only because
of his participation in the study. The latter child
had purulent bacterial otitis media. These children had received MN and MSD vaccines, and
both developed titers of HAl antibody to A/NJ
virus of ==1:20.
Discussion
One hundred sixteen children volunteered for
this evaluation of vaccine, and antibody response
was determined in 110. One of 60 children who
received split-product vaccine had significant antibody to AjNJ virus detected after immunization with a single dose of vaccine. Twenty-eight
of 32 children receiving a single dose of wholevirus vaccine had titers of HAl antibody of
====1 :20. The children who received whole-virus
vaccines showed a trend toward a correlation
between the titer of HAl antibody to A/Victoria virus and the titer of HAl antibody to
A/NJ virus. However, those children who received the poorly immunogenic, split-product
vaccine or placebo also had serologic evidence
of prior exposure to A/Victoria virus that was
equivalent to that of children who had received whole-virus vaccines.
Five of 98 children receiving vaccine and
none of 18 receiving placebo had fevers of ==38 C.
Four of these children had no associated symptoms, and one had associated otitis media. Three
children with fever had received split-product
vaccines and developed no detectable titer of antibody to A/NJ virus, and two children had received whole-virus vaccines and did develop a
titer of antibody to A/NJ virus of ====1 :20. These
findings suggest that whole-virus vaccines and
split-product vaccines were approximately similarly reactogenic in this population.
