Abstract : The English summary appended to the paper is as follows: -
" The authors studied the efficacy of using interferon induction with the living influenza vaccine (oral) for prophylaxis of influenza and other acute respiratory diseases. The trial was conducted during an epidemic of A2/Hong Kong 1/68 influenza in winter of 1970. The incidence of the disease among children aged from 1 to 3 years given this preparation twice at an interval of 10-15 days was 1.5 times lower than among children given placebo and 2 times lower than in a group of unvaccinated children in the same collective body.
" At the height of the seasonal rise of the acute respiratory diseases in winter of 1971 a double, at an interval of 15 days, use of this vaccine in increased (2-4 times) dosage led to reduction of the incidence of these diseases among the vaccinated preschoolchildren 8 times and among the schoolchildren-2.65 times. The efficacy index of the vaccine in schoolchildren was statistically significant (P <0.01)".
