To estimate the effectiveness of influenza vaccine against medical care visits for laboratory-confirmed
influenza in young children we conducted a matched case–control study in children with acute respiratory illness or fever from 2005–2007. Influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) was calculated using cases
with laboratory-confirmed influenza and controls who tested negative for influenza. The effectiveness of
influenza vaccine in fully vaccinated children 6–59 months of age was 56% (95% CI: 25%–74%); a significant
VE was not found for partial vaccination.

1. Introduction
Influenza virus infection has a substantial burden among young
children in both inpatient and outpatient settings [1–3]. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) of the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has gradually expanded
the age recommendation for influenza vaccination over the past
years [4–8] and currently recommends vaccination for all children

6 months of age and older and for all adults [9]. For children <9
years of age, the CDC recommends 2 doses for those with no previous vaccination and one dose for those children who had been
vaccinated with influenza vaccine in the preceding year.
A number of influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) assessments
have been conducted using both influenza-like illness [10,11]
and laboratory-confirmed influenza as the study outcomes, with
case-cohort or case–control designs [12–15]. The changing characteristics of circulating influenza viruses, the need to update vaccine
viruses annually, differences in match between vaccine and circulating strains [16], and the variable VE found in prior studies make
it necessary to assess influenza VE each year [10–15].
In recent years, studies have used designs similar to a traditional
case–control design, allowing for more expeditious determination
of VE estimates [13–15]. In these studies, cases and controls were
drawn from children with acute respiratory illness seeking care
in a hospital, emergency department (ED) or outpatient setting.
Cases were children who tested positive for influenza and the
matched controls were children who tested negative [13–15]. Modeling studies have shown that the use of test negative controls to
estimate vaccine exposure in the population compares favorably
with cohort studies and more traditional case–control designs [17].

In addition, this design controls for factors that may be more difficult to measure using other observational study designs, such as
the propensity to seek care.
In this study, we assessed the effectiveness of the trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine against laboratory-confirmed influenza
for the 2005–2006 and 2006–2007 influenza seasons. Vaccination
rates among children 6–59 months of age with acute respiratory
illness or fever (ARI) and laboratory-confirmed influenza were
compared with influenza test-negative controls who also had a
medically attended ARI. We used data from our active, populationbased influenza surveillance system, the New Vaccine Surveillance
Network (NVSN), established by the CDC to determine the disease burden of vaccine preventable diseases in young children and
to assess the impact of new vaccine recommendations on disease
outcomes.
2. Methods
2.1. Study setting
This study was conducted in three counties: Davidson County,
Tennessee (total population approximately 595,000 people; 8000
births per year) including the city of Nashville; Monroe County, NY
(total population approximately 750,000; 11,000 births per year)
including the city of Rochester; and Hamilton County, Ohio (total
population approximately 800,000; 12,000 births per year) including the city of Cincinnati.
2.2. Study design
We employed a prospective, population-based, case–control
design based on active surveillance in which we compared the
influenza vaccination status of children with laboratory-confirmed
influenza to laboratory-confirmed influenza-negative matched
controls. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board
at each study site as well as the CDC. VE was evaluated separately
for two age groups (6–23 months and 24–59 months) and the combined group of children (6–59 months of age) and for two influenza
seasons (2005–2006 and 2006–2007)in children identified in three
clinical settings (inpatient, ED, and outpatient practices) in three
geographic sites. Methods for surveillance and selection of cases
have been described elsewhere [1,12,13,18]. VE was estimated as:
100 × [1 − adjusted odds ratio].
2.3. Inpatient setting
Study coordinators enrolled children five days a week after
admission to surveillance hospitals. Eligible children were county
residents, younger than five years of age, who were admitted with
signs or symptoms of ARI. Children were excluded if they had fever
and neutropenia associated with chemotherapy, were hospitalized
in the prior 4 days, transferred from another surveillance hospital,
or were newborns never discharged from the hospital.
2.4. Outpatient settings
Prospective surveillance of county children presenting with ARI
to selected clinics and EDs was conducted during the two seasons.
Study personnel enrolled children in the clinics and the EDs on
specified surveillance days using similar inclusion and exclusion
criteria to inpatient enrollment. Children were enrolled one or two
days per week in one to four pediatric clinics per county and were
enrolled three or four days per week in the EDs.
2.5. Laboratory testing
Nasal and throat swabs obtained from each enrolled child
were tested for influenza at each site’s research laboratory with
standardization of assays across sites using reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays, as described previously
[1,18,19]. A subset of children had viral cultures done. A specimen
was defined as being influenza-positive if viral culture or duplicate
PCR assays were positive for influenza A or B. There were no children with a positive culture for influenza and a negative PCR, while
9 children with a negative culture had a positive PCR for influenza.
2.6. Inclusion of children for the vaccine effectiveness analysis
Children whose specimens tested positive for influenza were
eligible to be cases and those who tested negative were eligible
to be controls. To ensure that all children included in this study
were eligible for vaccination based on current recommendations,
the following parameters were used. Since the minimum age to
receive a primary influenza vaccination is 24 weeks (168 days), followed by a second vaccination a minimum of 24 days later (192
days), and the child is considered protected two weeks following
the final dose (206 days), 206 days was used as the lower age limit
for this study. The upper age limit was 59 months at the onset of
symptoms. The onset of the child’s symptoms must have occurred
during influenza season for each geographic site. The start of the
influenza season was defined as the occurrence of one or more
positive influenza specimens in two consecutive weeks through
local research or hospital laboratories at each site. The end of the
influenza season was defined as the absence of one or more positive
specimens of influenza in two consecutive weeks.
2.7. Determination of influenza vaccination status
Influenza vaccination status at the time of the ARI visit was
determined through a telephone call or fax to the child’s primary
care practice and subsequent extraction of influenza vaccination
data from the child’s primary care medical record, and/or, if available, the state immunization registry. Children were classified as
fully vaccinatedif vaccinatedaccording toACIP guidelines [6] which
included either (1) 2 doses in the current season administered ≥24
days apart, or (2) ≥1 vaccine dose in a previous influenza season
and 1 dose in the current season, administered ≥14 days before
ARI onset. Children were classified as being partially vaccinated if
they received (1) only 1 of the 2 recommended doses in the current
season, ≥14 days before ARI onset or (2) 2 vaccinations in the current season with the second dose administered within 14 days of
the onset of ARI or <24 days after the first dose. Children were classified as unvaccinated if they received no influenza vaccine doses
during the study season or received the first of 2 recommended
doses within 14 days before ARI onset during the study season.
2.8. Variable definitions
The primary dependent variable was testing positive for
influenza. The primary independent variable was vaccination status at the time of the influenza visit. Control variables included
demographic and clinical characteristics obtained from a chart
review and a questionnaire administered to each patient’s parent or
guardian. Demographic variables included gender, insurance type
(public, private or none) and high risk status. Clinical characteristics were obtained through parental report and chart reviews.
Children were classified as high risk for influenza using ACIP definitions thatincluded asthma, cancer, diabetes mellitus, heart disease,

immunodeficiency, kidney disease, sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis and chronic lung disease [4,6].
2.9. Statistical analysis
Conditional logistic regression was used to model the association between influenza vaccination and laboratory-confirmed
influenza after adjustment for potential confounders (gender,
insurance type and high risk status). Control children werematched
to case children by disease onset date (plus or minus 7 days),
clinical setting (inpatient, ED or clinic), geographic site (Nashville,
Cincinnati, Rochester), and age (6–23 months, 24–59 months). The
number of matched controls per case varied from 1–4 [one control
(28%), two controls (15%), three controls (12%) and four controls
(34%)]. For 18 children, 8 from the ED and 10 from outpatient practices, only one control that matched 2 cases was available, so both
cases were matched to the same control.
3. Results
3.1. Study population
Over the two influenza seasons, the three NVSN sites enrolled
a total of 2097 (70%) of the 2991 eligible children 6 through 59
months of age with ARI (Fig. 1). Of the 894 children not enrolled
or excluded from analyses, the major reasons were parental or
guardian refusal (36%), protocol deviation at the Cincinnati site
(30%), and lack of an interpreter (13%). Overall, enrolled children
did not differ from non-enrolled or excluded children with respect
to age (p = 0.96) or gender (p = 0.82), but did differ by the proportion
uninsured (9.5% for non-enrolled and 5.3% enrolled; p ≤ 0.001). Of
the 2097 children enrolled in ARI surveillance, we also excluded
those specifically ineligible for the VE analysis [age < 206 days
(n = 84), illness onset date outside the influenza season (n = 365), a
repeat visit (n = 30), missing vaccination or insurance data (n = 98),
and receipt of nasal-spray influenza vaccine (n = 2)]. Overall, there
were 1515 eligible children for matching and 159 (10%) were
positive for influenza; 12% for the 2005–2006 season and 9% for
the 2006–2007 season. Of the 159 cases, 158 case children were
matched to 372 controls. Of the 158 cases, 119 (75%) had influenza
A and 39 (25%) had influenza B. In 2005–2006, 91% of influenza
cases were type A while in 2006–2007, 58% were type A.
3.2. Characteristics of cases and controls
The demographic characteristics and vaccination status for case
and control children enrolled are shown in Table 1. There were no
significant differences between cases and controls with regard to
gender, insurance status, or high risk status in either season or the
combined seasons. However, the distribution of vaccination status was significantly different between cases and controls for the
2006–2007 season (p = .04) and the combined seasons (p = 0.006)

but not the 2005–2006 season (p = 0.11). The number of days
children had been ill at the time of specimen collection was significantly longer for controls (median = 4 days) compared to cases
(median = 3 days) (p = 0.006). When we adjusted for this variable,
the VE was comparable to the VE without adjustment; therefore
this variable was not included in the final model.
Table 2 shows the analysis examining factors associated with
influenza vaccination status in the influenza-negative controls
selected for the case–control analysis. There were no significant
differences in vaccination status by gender, insurance group or risk
status.
3.3. Vaccine effectiveness (Table 3)
Over the two seasons, including all clinical settings, the VE
estimates for fully vaccinated versus unvaccinated children were
significant for children aged 6–59 months (VE = 56%; CI: 25%, 74%),
and each of the age subgroups: 6–23 months (VE = 61%; CI = 16%,
82%) and 24–59 months (VE = 56%; CI = 3%, 80%). For partially vaccinated children versus unvaccinated children, the point estimate
of the VE was similar for each age group category but was not
significant for any age group: 6–23 months (VE = 39%; CI = −27%,
70%), 24–59 months (VE = 34%; CI = −64%, 73%) and 6–59 months
(VE = 33%; CI = −17%, 61%).
Examining each season separately, the VE estimates were significant only for fully vaccinated children aged 6–23 months in the
2005–2006 influenza season and 6–59 months in the 2006–2007
influenza season. No significant VE estimates were found for partial
vaccination for any of the age groups or years.
The VE was estimated for fully vaccinated children seen in the
inpatient and ED settings combined and the outpatient setting
alone. The VE estimate for fully vaccinated children seen in outpatient clinic settings was statistically significant (VE = 56%; CI: 10%,
79%); the VE estimate for those cared for in the inpatient/ED settings was slightly lower and not statistically significant (VE = 47%;
CI: −24%, 78%). For fully vaccinated children, the VE for the
inpatient setting was 67% (−48%, 92%) and for the ED was 16%
(−167%, 74%).
VE estimates for the 119 cases with laboratory-confirmed
influenza A and the 39 cases with laboratory-confirmed influenza
B infections, found the VE against influenza A was significant
(VE = 58%; 95% CI: 21%, 77%), while the VE against influenza B was
not (VE = 37%; 95% CI: −105%, 80%) (Fig. 2). For influenza A, there
was no significant difference in the VE between the 2 seasons. For
2005–2006, the VE for full vaccination was 53% (3%, 77%) compared to a VE of 66% (−24%, 90%) for the 2006–2007 season. For
influenza B, seasonal differences could not be assessed due to the
small sample size for 2005–2006.
Given the large number of children excluded from the Cincinnati site, additional analyses were done excluding this site entirely.
WithouttheCincinnati site,theVE over the two seasons for children
6–59 months of age was 57% (95% CI: 17%, 78%) compared to the
VE reported from all three sites of 56% (95% CI: 25%, 74%). Thus, the
exclusion of these children did not change the overall conclusions
of the study.
4. Discussion
We used prospective, laboratory-confirmed, surveillance data
from three urban counties in the United States to estimate the
effectiveness of the trivalent inactivated influenza vaccines in
reducing medically attended influenza visits in children 6–59
months of age during the 2005–2006 and 2006–2007 influenza
seasons. We found a statistically significant VE for children aged
6–23 months (61%), children aged 24–59 months (56%) and for
the combined ages 6–59 months (56%). We found no statistically significant VE in children with partial vaccination. Our study
builds on our previous work and the work of others [12–15]
and contributes to the literature by estimating VE using children with laboratory-confirmed influenza over two seasons, across
three geographical sites and in three clinical settings (inpatient,
ED, and outpatient clinic practices). It further extends the literature by demonstrating the use of a potentially rapid, efficient and

less expensive method for determining VE using children with
laboratory-confirmed influenza as cases and influenza-negative
children as controls, as part of ongoing population-based ARI
surveillance.
Prior studies have demonstrated inconsistent estimates of VE
across years and locations, as would be expected given the fact
that the circulating strains may vary by location and by the match
between the vaccine and the circulating strains [12–15]. However,
despite the differences, case–control studies have generally been
consistent in showing that partial vaccination of young children is
not effective and that full vaccination is effective when vaccine and
circulating strains are well matched [13–15,17]. A few studies have
failed to show VE, even for fully vaccinated children, but generally
these studies were small or conducted in years with poor match
between circulating strains [14,15].
The VE of 56% for fully vaccinated children in our study is comparable, but slightly higher than most values reported previously
[11–13] and slightly lower than the VE reported in one study covering the same years [15].Aprior study using similar methodology for
the same geographical areas, sites and age groups reported similar
results as found in the present study for the 2004–2005 influenza
season, but lower VE for the 2003–2004 year [13]. It is also reassuring that two randomized clinical trials examining the efficacy
of the trivalent influenza vaccine in adults found similar results to
ours for the 2004–2005 season (54%) [20] and 2007–2008 season
(68%) [21].
Among our study population in 2005–2006, 91% ofthe influenza
viruses were type A. National data estimates for the 2005–2006
season in which influenza A (H3N2) predominated suggest that
there was a fairly good match between vaccine strains and circulating strains, especially for type A with 76% of H3N2 and 97% of
H1N1 similar to the vaccine strain [22]. However, only 22% of type
B viruses were similar to the vaccine strain. For the 2006–2007 season, 58% of the influenza positive children in our study were type
A. Nationally 58% of H3N2 viruses, 73% of H1N1 viruses, and 48%
of influenza B viruses were well matched to the vaccine strains
[23].
Our overall results were driven by VE for influenza A because
119 (75%) of the 158 cases had influenza A. As would be
expected, VE estimates against influenza A were similar to VE estimates for both influenza A and B combined. However, because
the predominant circulating influenza B viruses were from a
different lineage than the influenza B vaccine strain, little to
no protection was likely obtained against non-vaccine lineage
influenza B infections which would contribute to lowering the
VE estimate [24,25]. The continued co-circulation of two different influenza B lineages has prompted discussions about including
a second influenza B virus in seasonal influenza vaccinations
(one from each lineage) which would help to improve yearly
the overall protection of influenza vaccines against influenza
B.
Strengths of our study include the use of a novel approach for
VE determination using a potentially rapid estimation of VE. Rapid
testing of laboratory specimens and electronic verification of vaccination records would speed up the process even further. Health
care-seeking bias wasminimizedsince influenza-positive cases and
influenza-negative controls were recruited from the same careseeking population. A final strength of our study was the strategy
for matching influenza-negative controls with influenza-positive
cases. The fact that the matches were by geographical site and
clinical setting, as well as age and onset date, approximates the traditional case–control methodology for selecting matched controls
[26].
There are some limitations to our study. The relatively small
number of cases across the two years necessitated combining seasons and clinical settings to achieve sufficient power for analyses. It
is possible that VE differed across the seasons and settings. A larger
sample size was needed to determine if this occurred. In addition,
our study also has limitations that are inherent in non-randomized
designs. As with any non-randomized study, differences other than
vaccination status could be due to other observed or unobserved
differences in the groups. However, our case matching and conditional logistic regression models should have largely controlled for
differences in the measured variables.
Finally, while a large proportion of eligible children were
enrolled, 30% of eligible children were not enrolled. While these
children did not differ significantly from enrolled children by age or
gender, they were significantly less likely to be insured. In addition,
30% of these non-enrolled children (representing 25% of eligible
children from the Cincinnati site) were excluded due to a protocol
deviation. However, neither the estimates of VE nor the conclusions of the study changed with the exclusion of all children from
the Cincinnati site.
5. Conclusions
Each year, young children experience high rates of hospitalizations, ED visits and outpatient visits due to influenza. We found
that full vaccination with the trivalent inactivated vaccine prevented nearly 60% of medically attended influenza visits across two
influenza seasons for individual and combined age groups of children. An estimated 5–10% of children have an influenza-related
ARI visit each year, and the visit often results in an antibiotic prescription [1,2,27]. This study and others’ suggest that widespread
influenza vaccination of children will have a major impact on health
care utilization. Our study supports recommendations from the
CDC to vaccinate young children against influenza disease and
M.A. Staat et al. / Vaccine 29 (2011) 9005–9011 9011
highlights the importance of full vaccination, since partial vaccination showed no significant VE.
