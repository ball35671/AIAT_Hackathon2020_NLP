Abstract
The study of the based on the A/Leningrad/134/17/57/(H2N2) attenuated adult live influenza vaccine (LIV) investigated features for immunization of the children, aged 3-6 years. During autumn, 1999, out of 256 children, aged 3-6 years, residents of the Leningrad region, who attended the kindergarten, 184 children were immunized with 1 or 2 doses of the live influenza vaccine, and 72 ones were given placebo. There were no any moderate or strong temperature reactions revealed after the inoculation. The LIV was shown to be genetically stable. After a single dose of the vaccine seroconversion to influenza type A virus and to influenza type B virus was observed respectively in 58% and in 39% of seronegative 3-6 year old vaccinees. The twofold LIV administration failed to give any advantages in stimulation of the immune response. During 6 months after immunization the morbidity rate in vaccinees did not exceed the morbidity rate in unvaccinated children. Thus LIV for adults proved safe and immunogenic and can be recommended for single dose immunization both of adults and children.
