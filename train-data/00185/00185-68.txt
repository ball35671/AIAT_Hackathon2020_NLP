Abstract
During the autumn-winter epidemic of influenza-like diseases in December, 1983--first quarter, 1984, in Moscow commissioned coded observations on the effectiveness of prophylactic vaccination against influenza of 3-7-year-old children with a preparation "Grippovak SE-AZh" were carried out in day-care centers. In the previous large-scale trials, 1981-1984, the "Grippovak" had been evaluated positively as a completely harmless, serologically and immunologically active preparation reducing 3-3.5-fold the number of laboratory-verified cases of viral type A and B influenza in the vaccinees. In 1986, however, the "Journal of Microbiology, Epidemiology, Immunology" (JMEI, 2: 49-54) published a paper whose authors, on behalf of the Commission which had checked the preparation in the day-care centers (Z.A. Bashliaeva, A.A. Sumarokov, et al.), came to a conclusion that "Grippovak" was ineffective in children. Other members of the above Commission disagreeing with this conclusion made a repeat analysis of the decoded materials of the observations in the day-care centers using computer methods and demonstrated that because of significant prevalence of non-influenza ARD cases and recurrent (up to 44%) ARD cases in children in the 4 months of observation, it was impossible to judge the effectiveness of the vaccine by comparison of the total incidence of influenza and ARD from the clinical data
