Influenza is unique among the viral respiratory diseases
for its annual outbreaks of widespread infection and
accompanying morbidity in all age groups. Each year in
the United States, between 10% and 20% of the
population is estimated to have an influenza-associated
illness’. Influenza is most likely to affect individuals
with the least prior exposure and immunity. Consequently, influenza attack rates are particularly high in
children who then serve as an important source of
epidemic spread in the community’4. Immunization
with trivalent inactivated vaccine against influenza A
HINI, influenza A H3N2, and influenza B is currently
recommended to provide protection against influenza
illness’. However, two doses of these vaccines are
recommended to induce a protective antibody response
in previously unvaccinated children less than 9 years of
age, and immunogenicity of inactivated vaccine is
inconsistent in young infant?. These features and the
need for yearly intramuscular immunization represent
stumbling blocks to broader application of these
vaccines to the pediatric population. New live, attenuated, intranasal influenza vaccines offer a promising
alternative to the currently licensed vaccines.
Live, attenuated influenza A and B vaccines have
been made by reassortment of a master cold-adapted

serial passage at low temperatures (25”C)9-“. Monovalent live, intranasal influenza A and B cold-adapted
(ca) vaccines have been shown to be safe and immunogenic in children’3-‘7.
Multivalent vaccines containing influenza A strains
have been associated with variable frequencies of virus
shedding and serologic responses in seronegative young
children for each HlNl and H3N2 subtype contained
in the vaccineH.‘7-‘4. Relatively few clinical studies have
been conducted to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of ca influenza A vaccine in young children
less than 6 months of age”,‘5.
In the largest U.S. pediatric study of ca influenza
vaccines to date, we administered 104, lo”, or 10’
TCIDso of bivalent ca influenza A vaccine or placebo to
1126 healthy children 2-36 months of age to further
determine the relationship of age, dose, and vaccine
content to safety and immunogenicity.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Vaccines
Bivalent ca influenza A vaccines were derived by
reassortment and prepared in eggs by Wyeth-Ayerst,
Philadelphia, PA. Vaccines contained 104, 10h, 10’
TCID,,, ca A/Kawasaki/9/86 (HlNl) virus and ca
A/Beijing/3.52/89 (H3N2) virus per 0.5 ml dose. A
single lot of vaccine was used for each dose. Doses
were chosen based on limited experience with WyethAyerst manufactured vaccine in young children and
few trials of any ca vaccine in children less than
6 months of age22,‘5. Placebo was egg allantoic fluid.

Subjects received either ca trivalent influenza vaccine
or placebo by nose drops as a single 0.5 ml dose.
Subjects
In the fall of 1993, 1126 healthy infants and children,
2-36 months of age were recruited from populations of
children available for study at 13 participating institutions. 635 subjects were 2-18 months of age and 491
were 19-36 months of age. Subjects were randomized
in a double-blind fashion to receive a single 10J, 10”. or
IO’ TCIDS,, dose of ca bivalent influenza vaccine, or
placebo in a 3:3:3:1 ratio. An independent data and
safety monitoring board evaluated safety in the first 70
subjects for each dose prior to enrollment of additional
subjects.
A history, physical examination, CBC with differential, and liver function tests were obtained on each
subject to assure good health and eligibility for vaccination. Routine pediatric vaccines were not administered
concurrently with study vaccines. Subjects were
excluded if they had received any vaccines within
3 weeks prior to vaccination with ca influenza vaccine
or placebo. After vaccine or placebo was administered,
a diary card was kept by a parent or guardian for
7 days to record upper respiratory symptoms or fever.
Parents were permitted to obtain rectal, oral. or
axillary temperatures and to include this information
on the diary card. Fever was defined as a temperature
of 38.6”C rectally, 38.1”C orally, or 37S”C axillary for
purposes of comparison between groups. The study
center was notified if the subject experienced > 1
symptom on a given day and/or fever. Serum specimens
for antibody determinations were obtained from all
enrolled subjects by fingerstick or venipuncture before
vaccination, and 3.5 days after vaccination. Vaccine
administration and serum sampling were completed
prior to the onset of the influenza season.
Serology
Hemagglutination antibody inhibition (HAI) assays
were performed on serum specimens obtained before
and 35 f 2 days after immunization to assess immunogenicity of vaccine. All antibody determinations were
performed at Vanderbilt University under the direction
of the principal investigator (W.C.G.). Subjects were
considered to be seronegative if their serum specimen
prior to vaccination had HAI titers _< 1:4. The HAI
assay used egg-grown whole formalin inactivated
AIKawasaki/9/86 (H 1 N 1) and A/Beijing/352189 (H3N2)
virus (Wyeth-Ayerst). Seroconversion to HlNl or
H3N2 was defined as a 4-fold or greater rise in
antibody titer between paired specimens to
A/Kawasaki/9/86 (HlNI) or A/Beijing/352/89 (H3N2),
respectively, or a rise from < I:4 to 1:8. The initial
serum dilution for HA1 was 1:4.
Statistical methods
Symptom rates and seroconversion rates across
groups were compared using Fisher’s exact test for
consistency in comparison of larger and smaller groups
(StatXact Software, version 2, 1991, CYTEL Corp.,
Cambridge, MA). Serologic responses to HlNl and
H3N2 within subjects were compared using McNemar’s
test (StatXact Software, version 2, 1991, CYTEL Corp.,
1380 Vaccine 1997 Volume 15 Number 12/13
Cambridge, MA). Serologic results were compared by
dose, serologic status, age, and response to the alternate vaccine antigen using logistic regression analysis
for frequency of response and linear regression analysis
for change in geometric mean titers (GMT) of
antibody (SAS Statistical Software, version 6.10, SAS
Institute Inc.. Cary, NC).
RESULTS
Reactogenicity
Bivalent ca influenza vaccine was well tolerated by
enrolled subjects at all administered doses. Data for
evaluation of fever after vaccine were available for
98% of 1126 enrolled children. Fever occurred infrequently on any of 7 days after vaccine in enrolled
children without statistically significant differences
between vaccine or placebo groups (Tahlr I). Data for
evaluation of constitutional and respiratory symptoms
was availahle from 99% of enrolled subjects. No statistically significant reductions in usual level of activity
were reported for ca influenza vaccine recipients in
comparison to control subjects for children at any age
at any dosage. Cough was reported in nearly one-third
and rhinorrhea in nearly half of vaccine or placebo
recipients. No statistically significant differences
between study groups were observed in the frequency
of respiratory symptoms reported on any of 7 days
after vaccination (Table 2). No statistically significant
differences were observed in safety labs between study
groups.
Serologic response
HA1 antibody titers to A/Kawasaki/C)/86 (HlNl) and
A/Beijing/352189 (H3N2) were determined on sera
obtained before administration of vaccine and 35 days
later. Responses in seronegative and seropositive
children are shown in Table 3 and Tnhk 4, respectively.
Adjustments for other factors when analyzing seroresponse were done using logistic regression analysis.
Adjustments when analyzing change in titer were made
using linear regression analysis. Four-fold or greater
antibody responses to HlNl and H3N2 were more
frequent and GMTs were higher after 10” and 10’
TCID,,, of vaccine than after lo4 TCIDS,, (P<O.OOOl),

tion, and response to the alternate influenza antigen in
the vaccine. Paired analysis indicated that serologic
responses to HlNl were significantly less frequent and
GMT’s were lower than those observed to H3N2 after
bivalcnt ca vaccine (P<O.OOOl). When responses wcrc
analyzed in all subjects after bivalcnt vaccines, fewer
subjects achieved an antibody titer of 2 I:32 to HlNl
(55%) than to H3N2 (80%). Statistically significant
differences were observed in both seropositive and
seronegative subsets (P < 0.0001).
Four-fold or greater antibody responses wcrc significantly less frequent to HlNl (P = 0.0004) and tended
to be less frequent to H3N2 (P = 0.12) in children
16 months of age. in comparison to responses in older
children. Notably, GMTs of HA1 antibody to HlNl
after 10” or 10’ TCID5,, of ca vaccine approached or
exceeded 1:.32 in all groups, except seronegative infants
<6 months of age; mean antibody titers to HlNl in
these young infants were Icss than 1:32, even after a
10’ dose (P < 0.0001). GMTs were also lower to H3N2
(P = 0.01) in these infants.
A 4-fold or greater antibody response to one ca
strain was not associated with 4-fold or greater
antibody response to the other ca vaccine component.
Serologic response to A/Beijing/352189 (H3N2) was
associated with an increased likelihood of response to
A/Kawasaki/9/86 (H 1 Nl ) in seronegative children
(odds ratio 2.7:1, P~O.0001). Likewise, serologic
response to HlNl was associated with an increased
likelihood of response to H3N2 in seronegative
subjects (odds ratio 8:1, P~O.0001).
DISCUSSION
We have demonstrated that bivalent influenza vaccines
containing H 1Nl and H3N2 viruses can be safely
administered to children aged 2 to 36 months of age.
Excess fever or respiratory symptoms were not
observed in vaccine recipients. These observations
support previous results demonstrating minimal reactogenicity of ca influenza vaccines delivered as monovalent or multivalent vaccines to children and compare
favorably to after
vacc~ne5~X~13.15~ly~?l~~~~
reactogenicity parenteral
The current study is also the largest investigation to
date to evaluate the relationship of dose to serologic
response in young children to ca vaccine containing
both influenza HlNl and H3N2 antigens. A single
dose of ca bivalent vaccine containing 10J TCIDS,, each
of ca HlNl and H3N2 viruses did not induce acceptable HAI antibody responses for seronegative or
seropositive children 2-36 months of age. In contrast,
the highest 4-fold or greater antibody responses to
HlNl and H3N2 were observed after a single 10’ dose,
in 278% and 92% of children, respectively. The 10’
dose did not provide a clinically significant increase in
serologic response in comparison to a 10” dose, for this
population of young children. Responses in children
6-18 months to HlNl and H3N2 were uniformly
better after a single dose of ca vaccine than reported
responses after a single intramuscular dose of inactivated influenza vaccine5-‘.
In recent trials, virus shedding and serologic
responses to ca HlNl strains after monovalent or
multivalent ca influenza vaccines have generally been
somewhat lower than those to ca H3N2 strains in
seronegative children older than 6 months of ageN.‘7-‘3.
Most investigations with smaller experimental groups
demonstrate wide confidence intervals for serologic
response to HlNl and H3N2, which overlap the
current study results. There are notable exceptions.
A/Korea/l/82 and A/Bethesda/l/85 H3N2 viruses were
associated with relatively low serologic responses in
comparison to the H3N2 viruses investigated in other
trials. In infants 6-18 months of age ca multivalent
vaccine containing A/Los AngclcsJ2187 and
A/Kawasaki/9/86 made by PRI laboratories, Rockville
MD, produced seroconversions exceeding 75%) to the
HlNl component after a single dose”. However, in a
trial of ca hivalcnt vaccine containing 10” TCID5,, each
of A/Kawasaki/9186 and A/Los Angeles12187 manufactured by Wyeth-Aycrst, HA1 seroconversions to
matched HlNl antigens A/Taiwan/l/86 and ca
AiKawasakii9iXh were particularly poor in scronegativc
infants 26 months of age. ELISA antibody to HlNl,
the most sensitive measure of response, did not exceed
40%“. The ca bivalent vaccines described in the
current report contained the same Wyeth-Ayerst strain
of A/Kawasaki/9/86 investigated in the previous trial in
combination with a different H3N2 virus. Four-fold or
greater HA1 responses to A/Kawasaki/9/86 occurred in
70% or more of children between 6 months and 3 years
of age, when co-administered with A/Beijing/352/89
(H3N2) virus at doses of 10” or 10’ TCIDr,,. In the
current study. there was no evidence of interference
between the component vaccine strains: serologic
evidence of response to one vaccine antigen was not
associated with decreased response to the other. Our
current and previous findings support the potential
importance of vaccine dose, type of vaccines used in
combination, and differences in vaccine preparations in
ensuring adequate serologic responses to bivalcnt
vaccine in children older than 6 months of age. The
antigen used in measurement of response may also
influence interpretation of serologic response; the
highest responses were seen to antigen directly derived
from vaccine as opposed to prototype strains provided
by the Centers for Disease Control and Prcvcntion.
Seropositive children 26 months of age may have
experienced natural influenza infection leading to
mucosal. humoral and cellular immune responses. This
preexisting immunity is likely responsible for the
decreased serologic response to ca vaccine antigens
that we observed in older seropositive children. The
presence of passively acquired maternal antibody might
also account for the reduced serologic responses to
influenza vaccines that we observed in scropositive
children 16 months of age”.
The current investigation documents decreased
serologic responses to both HlNl and H3N2 in seronegative children 16 months of age in comparison to
older seroncgative children. These findings suggest
either decreased replication of virus or a decreased
ability for infants to process and respond to live attenuated influenza viral antigens when administered in the
first 6 months of life. These finding have implications
for live respiratory virus vaccines targeted to this age
group. GMT to HlNl were particularly low (<1:32)
after the first dose in these young infants. Other investigators have noticed a decreased response to HlNl

antigen in young infants. 50% or less of infants less
than 6 months of age demonstrated 4-fold or greater
antibody responses to one or two consecutive 10”
TCIDs,, doses of ca A/Kawasaki/9/86 vaccine’5.2h. Fortunately, the decreased response may be overcome by
repetitive high doses. Clements et al. have shown two
consecutive doses of 10’ TCIDS,, ca AIKawasaki/9/86
administered 1 month apart, produce 4-fold antibody
response in nearly all vaccinated subjects2”. In their
study, administration concomitantly with routine childhood immunizations was not associated with decreased
immunogcnicity to the influenza vaccine or oral polio,
diphtheria, pertussis, or Haemoplzilus influmza type B
vaccines.
Live attenuated, bivalent ca influenza A virus
vaccines can be safe and immunogenic in young infants
6-36 months of age when administered as a single 10”
or 107 TCID5,, dose. Additional studies are required to
determine the optimum dosing regimen for children
less than 6 months of age and to establish efficacy of
multivalent ca combinations in young children.
