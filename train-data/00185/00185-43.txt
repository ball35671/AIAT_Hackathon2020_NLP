Randomized, placebo-controlled studies with 103-10' 50% tissue-culture infectious dose
(TCIDso) of avian-human (ah) and cold-adapted (ca) influenza A/Bethesda/85 (H3N2) reassortant viruses were completed in 106 seronegative young children 6-48 months of age. Although
the reassortants differed in six of eight RNA segments, they exhibited similar properties in level
of attenuation, infectivity, immunogenicity, and efficacy. The 50% human infectious dose was
104.
6 TCIDso for ah and 104.4 for ca vaccines. Both reassortants were satisfactorily attenuated
with restricted replication and were no more reactogenic than placebo. The mean peak titer of
virus shed was 101.5 (ah) to 102.
0 (ca) TCIDso/ml, and each of 37 isolates tested retained their
characteristic vaccine phenotypes. Infection with ah or ca virus conferred immunity to experimental
challenge with homologous virus. These findings indicate that both ah and ca influenza
A/Bethesda/85 (H3N2) reassortants should be suitable vaccine candidates for use in healthy infants and young children.
Influenza is a common respiratory illness in children <2
years old [1-5], with reported attack rates of 33.7 cases per
100 child-years of observation, [6] and hospitalization of 3
to 12 per 1000 infants [3-5]. Because of the high morbidity
associated with influenza [6-10], the Institute of Medicine has
recommended that priority be given to the development of
effective vaccines to prevent influenza A and B virus infections [11].
Live attenuated influenza virus vaccines may offer some advantages over inactivated vaccines, in terms ofease ofadministration and acceptability. Studies in young children suggest

dose intranasally, is tolerated better [12] and confers greater
resistance to experimental challenge with attenuated influenza
virus vaccine than inactivated influenza vaccine given parenterally [13]. The live attenuated influenza A viruses that we
and others are evaluating as vaccine candidates contain two
RNA segments coding for the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) glycoproteins derived from epidemic strains
and six internal RNA segments from an attenuated donor strain
[13-17].
Live cold-adapted (ca) and avian-human (ah) influenza A
reassortant virus vaccines have been extensively studied in
young adults [18-27] and appear to be comparable in terms
of safety, infectivity, immunogenicity, phenotypic stability,
and efficacy [27]. Previous studies in hundreds ofinfants and
children have shown that ca influenza A H3N2 and H1N1 reassortants exhibit these same desirable properties [12, 13, 15,
28-32]. However, experience with ah vaccines in children has
been limited and studies to compare the ah and ca vaccines
in pediatric subjects have not been performed [15].
We conducted a series ofrandomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled studies in which we compared ca and ah influenza
A H3N2 reassortants derived from the same wild-type influenza
A virus for their infectivity, level of attenuation, and immunogenicity in healthy seronegative infants and children 6
months to 48 months of age. Also, we assessed the level of
vaccine-induced resistance to reinfection and viral replication by administering the homologous live influenza virus vaccine to a group of vaccinees who received ca or ah vaccine
1-2 months earlier.

Methods
Vaccines. Two candidate vaccines were used in this study: ah
A/Mallard/New Yorkl6750178 x influenza A/Bethesda/1/85 (H3N2)
reassortant virus (lot E-246, 107.
9 50% tissue culture infectious dose
(TCIDso)/ml) and ca influenza A/Ann Arbor/6/60 x A/Bethesda/
1/85 (H3N2) reassortant virus (lut E-254, 107.
8 TCIDso/ml). The
production and characterization ofthese reassortants have been described elsewhere [27, 33, 34]. Each vaccine was diluted in L-15
medium (Whitaker Bioproducts, Walkersville, MD) to achieve the
desired number ofinfectious units. Suspensions ofvirus used in this
study were grown in the allantoic cavity of specific pathogen-free
eggs and tested for the presence of adventitious agents by Louis Potash (Flow Laboratories, McLean, VA). Both reassortants had been
shown to be safe and immunogenic in adults [27] before studies in
children were initiated.
Study design. A series ofrandomized, placebo-eontrolled studies
with the ca and ah vaccines were conducted in 1986 and 1987. Studies
with the ca and ah vaccines were conducted separately in a stepwise, dose-escalating fashion, starting with the 103 TCIDso dose
and, subsequently by evaluating a tenfold higher dose until the maximum dose (107lCIDso) was reached. One to 2 months after receiving the initial vaccination with 107lCIDso of ca or ah vaccine, these
vaccinees were offered a booster dose of 107TCIDso of the homologous reassortant virus.
Subjects. Infants and children 6-48 months old were selected
for participation in this study ifthey were healthy and seronegative,
i.e., had a serum hemagglutination inhibition (HAl) antibody titer
of ~1:8 to influenza A/Bethesda/85 (H3N2) virus. Infants and children were excluded from participation if they had any underlying
medical condition or acute illness at the time ofinoculation or lived
with a pregnant or immunodeficient person. With the parents' consent, blood for HAl antibody determination was obtained. Seroeligible individuals were screened by history, physical examination,
and a complete blood count.
Of the 107 infants and children who were randomly assigned to
study groups, 38 received ah vaccine; 34, ca vaccine; and 35, placebo.
One child who received 107 TCIDso of ca vaccine was withdrawn
from the study by his parents the day after vaccination.
Clinical studies. Subjects were observed daily at the Center for
Immunization Research in a large playroom that resembled a daycare facility. Children in studies of the ca vaccine were monitored
for 1-2 h daily for 10 consecutive days (3 days before and 7 days
after inoculation). Since this was the first extensive evaluation of
the ah reassortant in children, vaccinated subjects who received 1()3
to 1()6 lCIDso of ah vaccine during 1986 were monitored in the
playroom for 4-6 h daily for 12 consecutive days (3 days before and
9 days after inoculation) to detect potential adverse reactions. Placebo
recipients were concurrently evaluated. When it was evident that
the ah vaccine was no more reactogenic than the ca vaccine or
placebo, the daily observation period for all vaccine studies was shortened to 1-2 h.
During each trial, individuals who remained well were randomly
assigned on the third day of the study to receive vaccine or L-15
medium as placebo by intranasal inoculation. With the individual
in a supine position, 0.25 ml of vaccine or placebo was instilled in
each nostril using a tuberculin syringe. Interval symptom histories
and vital signs were taken each day and the infants and children were
examined by two investigators. Rectal temperatures were also taken
and recorded at least once each evening by the parents who were
instructed to take the temperature again within 15 min if any reading was 38.1°C or higher. We refer to a temperature reading of
38.1°C as fever. Infants and children were considered to have an
influenza-like illness if they developed any of the following signs
or symptoms within 7 days after inoculation: fever, upper respiratory tract illness (rhinorrhea, pharyngitis, or both) observed on 2
or more consecutive days, or lower respiratory tract illness (persistent wheezing or cough) observed on 2 or more consecutive days.
Otitis media was defined as loss of normal tympanic membrane landmarks and decreased mobility, as determine by two independent examiners. An illness was attributed to influenza A virus when there
was laboratory confirmation of influenza A infection (recovery of
influenza A H3N2 virus from nasal washes, development of a serum or nasal wash antibody response, or both).
Virus isolation. Specimens for influenza virus isolation were collected immediately before inoculation and daily for 7 (ca vaccine
studies) or 9 (ah vaccine studies) days after inoculation. Ten to 15
ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and a rubber bulb were used
to wash the nasal cavity [35, 36]. Hemadsorption-positive specimens
were identified by HAl assay [37] as being influenza A H3N2 virus
by using influenza A/Mississippi/85 specific antiserum. The quantity of virus present in the nasal wash specimens was determined
on frozen aliquots by titration of decimal dilutions of nasal wash
sample (four wells per dilution with an O.1-ml inoculum) on MDCK
cells. The smallest quantity of virus detectable by this system is
lOO.
7s TCIDso/ml. A negative sample was assigned a value of lOO.
s0
TCIDso/ml for calculation of mean peak titer of virus shedding.
The phenotypic properties ofinfluenza A isolates recovered from
ca vaccinees and ah vaccinees were characterized by determining
the efficiency of plaque formation (EOP) in MDCK monolayer culture at temperatures permissive and restrictive for the vaccine viruses.
The ca virus has a temperature sensitive (ts) phenotype, as indicated by a marked reduction in plaque number or plaque size at 39°C.
Isolates from ca vaccinees were tested for temperature sensitivity
ofplaque formation at permissive (33°C) and restrictive (39°C) temperatures. The ah viruses plaque efficiently at 42°C, a temperature
restrictive for human wild-type viruses. The EOP on MOCK cells
ofah isolates, therefore, was determined at 37°C, a temperature permissive for the avian and human influenza viruses, and at 42°C.
Analysis ofsera and nasal washesfor antibody. Serum and nasal wash specimens were collected before inoculation and 3 to 4 weeks
afterwards to evaluate systemic and local antibody responses. The
method for concentrating the nasal wash samples for antibody determination has been described elsewhere [24]. Preinoculation sera
were screened by a standard HAl assay [37] using influenza A/
Bethesda/85 virus and an antigenically closely related H3N2 influenza
virus, A/Mississippi/85, as antigens.
Influenza-specific antibodies in serum (lgG) and nasal washes (lgA)
were measured using an ELISA as previously described [38, 39].
Purified ah influenza A/Bethesda/85 x A/Mallard/New York/
6750178 (H3N2) whole virus (provided by Dr. Mark H. Snyder, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, MD)
was used as antigen in the ELISA. Serial fourfold dilutions were
employed in the ELISA. End-point serum IgG titers represented the
highest serum dilution generating an optical density (00) reading
>0.200 OD units at 405 om. End-point IgA titers represented the
highest dilutions of nasal wash sample generating a reading of >0.065

NOTE. All infants and children were seronegative (serum hemagglutination-inhibition antibody 1:8 in serum) before inoculation. Each received 0.5 ml ofah or ca reassortant virus or placebo intranasally. Virus isolation, antibody response, or both signified infection. Data from infected individuals were used for calculations ofthe mean duration
of virus shedding and peak titer of virus shed. Culture-negative samples were assigned a value of 0.50 TC1Dso/ml for purposes of calculation.
*Insufficient quantities of nasal wash specimens from one subject precluded testing for antibody responses.
OD units at 405 om. OD readings for ~99% of antigen-free control
wells containing nasal wash specimens at 1:2 dilution were below
this cutoff. Specific nasal wash 19A antibody titers were corrected
for the total protein content ofthe nasal wash specimen, which was
measured by a microplate modification of the BCA protein assay
(Pierce Chemical, Rockford, IL). Nasal wash antibody titers were
adjusted to a value of 400 p.g protein/mI, which approximated the
median value ofthe protein distribution, by using the formula: titer
of specimen x (400/protein concentration of specimen in p.g/mI).
Nasal wash specimens with antibody titers <1:2 were assigned a titer
of 1:1 for purposes of calculation.
When paired samples from placebo recipients were evaluated, 9%
of nasal wash specimens and 6% ofserum specimens showed fourfold increases in titer, indicating a false-positive rate of 6%. With
this limitation in test specificity, we considered a fourfold increase
in antibody titer to be a significant rise.
Laboratory evidence of influenza A virus infection was defined
as: (1) isolation ofinfluenza A (H3N2) virus, (2) a fourfold or greater
rise ofserum IgG or nasal wash 19A influenza-specific antibody titer,
or (3) both. Vaccinated individuals who demonstrated evidence of
infection with vaccine virus are referred to as vaccine responders.
Statistical analysis. ANOVA and Mann-Whitney Utests were used
to compare the means of the groups and two-tailed X2 test and
Fisher's exact test to compare proportions [40]. The 50%infectious
dose (H1Dso) was estimated by the method of Karber [41], assuming that infection rates were 100% with the 108 TCIDso dose for
both viruses, and 0 for H)2 TCIDso of ah virus. P values <.05 were
considered statistically significant.
Results
Dose response, infectivity, and immunogenicity ofthe vaccines. Both vaccines infected a high percentage of infants
and children, as measured by shedding of virus, a serum or
nasal wash antibody response, or both. The HIDso for each
reassortant was similar: lQ4·6 TCIDso for the ah vaccine virus and lQ4·4 for the ca vaccine virus. The difference in the
rate ofisolation ofthe vaccine viruses (8/38 ah vs. 15/33 ca)
was not statistically significant. In each group given a dose
exceeding 10 HIDso (106 to 107 TCIDso), 57%-67% of ca
vaccinees, but only 29%-38 % of ah vaccinees, shed vaccine
virus; these differences were not statistically significant. At
these doses, the mean duration of virus shedding among ca
vaccine responders was almost twice that of ah vaccine responders, but these differences were not statistically significant
(table 1). At the highest dose given (107 TCIDso), ah vaccine
virus was generally recovered sporadically from serial nasal
washes ofah vaccine responders whereas ca virus was recovered consistently from serial nasal wash specimens of vaccine responders from postvaccination days 1 through 6 or 7
(mean ± SD days of virus recovery, 1.5 ± 2.6 vs. 4.5 ± 2.6
for ah and ca vaccine responders, respectively, P = .053,
Mann Whitney U test).
Overall, peak viral titers of 103 TCIDso or greater per milliliter were detected in only 6 ca vaccinees and 4 ah vaccinees.
The mean peak titer ofvirus shed by ah and ca vaccinees who
were infected with the 107 TCIDso dose was comparable
(101.5 and 102.
0 TCIDso/ml, respectively). Each of 16
influenza A isolates recovered from 7 ah virus recipients produced plaques at 42°C. Each of 21 isolates recovered from
11 ca vaccinees retained the ts phenotype.
The frequency and magnitude of serum ELISA IgG
influenza-specific antibody responses of children immunized
with the ca or ah H3N2 virus vaccine were similar (table 1).

NOTE. Virus shedding, an antibody response, or both signified infection. Influenza-like illness and otitis media are defined in Methods. Other illnesses included diarrhea,
vomiting, conjunctivitis, vesicular or herpes simplex stomatitis, bronchiolitis, and exanthem. All numbers are percentages unless noted.
* 9% of the placebo group had lower respiratory illnesses.
At the 107 TCIDso dose, 14 (88 %) of 16 ah vaccinees and 9
(75%) of 12 ca vaccinees had a serum ELISA IgG antibody
response. The frequency ofELISA IgA influenza-specific antibody responses detected in nasal washings of children immunized with a 106 to 107 TCIDso dose was relatively low,
ranging from 33% to 43 % in ah vaccinees and from 43 %
to 58% in ca vaccinees.
Examination ofthe transmissibility ofvaccine viruses to unvaccinated controls. By allowing placebo recipients to play
together with vaccinees, we could seek evidence ofvirus transmission from infected vaccinees to susceptible, unvaccinated
age-matched individuals. The ah virus was not recovered from
12 placebo recipients who were in contact daily for 4-6 h
with 11 infected vaccinees, 2 of whom shed ah virus. Similarly, 9 placebo recipients did not shed ah virus after contact
for 1-2 h daily with 14 infected ah vaccinees, nor did 14
placebo recipients shed ca virus after 1-2 h of contact with
23 infected ca vaccinees.
Four placebo recipients had a fourfold rise in titer of antibody in serum (two individuals) or nasal washes (three individuals). Two placebo recipients with a serologic response
(one also had a nasal antibody response) were in contact for
4-6 h daily with three infected ah vaccinees, one of whom
shed ah virus up to 9 days (peak titer, 104 TCIDso/ml). Two
other placebo recipients with an increase in nasal wash antibody.titer were in contact with vaccine recipients for 1-2 h
daily. Since vaccine virus was not isolated from nasal wash
specimens collected from the placebo recipients throughout
these studies, we could not determine whether the rises in
ELISA antibody titer were a consequence oftransmission of
vaccine virus from infected vaccinees to controls or were falsepositive results. The mean rise in serum antibody titer of infected vaccinees was more than twice that in the placebo
recipients who had significant antibody rises (9.9 vs. 4-fold
rises). This suggests that the rise in titer in placebo recipients
was not due to infection by vaccine virus.
Reactogenicity. To compare the reactogenicity of ca vaccines and ah vaccines with placebo, we examined the illnesses
that occurred within the first 7 days after inoculation (table
2). Mild to moderate illnesses, especially fever and rhinorrhea, were observed frequently among individuals who received placebo, ah, or ca vaccine. Temperature elevations
<39°C were noted in 9 of 14 febrile ah vaccinees, 5 of 9 febrile ca vaccinees, and 5 of 9 febrile placebo controls. Fever
>39.5°C was observed in only 1 ah vaccinee, 2 ca vaccinees,
and 2 placebo controls.
The rates of upper respiratory illness and fever appeared
higher, although not statistically different with our sample size,
among individuals who received lower doses (103 to 106
TCIDso) of ah vaccine than among those who received the
same doses of ca vaccine. These ah vaccinees had remained
in the playroom for 4-6 h daily. The rates of influenza-like
illness appeared higher (but were not statistically different)
among the ah vaccine responders, nonresponders, and unvaccinated infants and children who spent 4-6 h for 9 days
in the playroom than in the infants and children who spent
1-2 h in this setting (table 3). We found that the rate of
influenza-like illness was significantly higher for the combined
groups ofplacebo recipients and vaccine nonresponders who
spent 4-6 h per day in the playroom than those who were observed for only 1-2 h each day (16/22 vs. 3/11, P = .03, twotailed Fisher's exact test).
Because infants and children in close contact for more than
2 h appeared to be more likely to acquire intercurrent illnesses

not related to the vaccine, we reduced the period of observation in the playroom to 1-2 h daily for individuals given the
highest dose (107 TCIDso) of ca or ah vaccine. The total
number of days (person-days) of illness among the ah vaccinees, ca vaccinees, and placebo controls in these shorter
trials were similar (table 4). These results demonstrate that
there was no increase in illness with increasing doses of ah
or ca vaccine and the reactogenicity of each vaccine at 107
TCIDso was no greater than that of placebo. Only 2 of 12 ill
ca vaccinees and none of 19 ill ah vaccinees had influenza
A virus detected in nasal wash samples that were collected
at the time ofillness. Thus, influenza-like illness did not correlate with shedding of ah or ca vaccine virus. -
Protection from challenge with homologous vaccine virus. One to two months after primary immunization with
107 TCIDso of vaccine virus, 9 ah vaccinees and 10 ca vaccinees were challenged with a second dose of 107 TCIDso of
homologous influenza A/Bethesda/85 vaccine virus (table 5).
All but one individual in each vaccine group had been previously infected with vaccine virus. There was ample evidence
that intranasal infection with the ah or ca vaccine virus conferred substantial resistance to experimental challenge with
the homologous virus. First, none ofthe challenged vaccinees
shed virus (table 5). Second, there was a reduction in the rate
ofinfection among challenged ah and ca vaccinees compared
with their naive counterparts. The second dose of attenuated
virus induced an antibody response in 33 %of the 9 ah vacDiscussion
Studies in adults, children, and infants have repeatedly
demonstrated that the six internal RNA segments derived from
the ca influenza AIAnn Arbor/6/60 (H2N2) attenuated donor have reproducibly conferred a satisfactory level ofattenuation, safety, infectivity, immunogenicity, and phenotypic
stability to human wild-type influenza A viruses ofthe H1N1
and H3N2 subtype, even in fully susceptible infants and children [12, 13, 15, 18-32]. Our results are consistent with these
observations.
Two earlier studies with ah reassortants in a small number
of children yielded conflicting results [15]. The ah influenza
A/Washington/80 (H3N2) reassortant appeared to be over attenuated, whereas, in another study, children vaccinated with
ah influenza A/California178 (H1N1) reassortant had a high
rate of lower respiratory tract illness (as did the placebo
recipients) [15]. We found that the ah and ca reassortant
viruses that possessed the same genes encoding the HA and
NA surface glycoproteins for the human wild-type influenza
A/Bethesda/85 (H3N2) virus exhibited similar properties in
young children and infants. Both ah and ca reassortants were
attenuated, as indicated by a 100-fold or greater reduction
in amount of virus shedding among infants and children who
were infected after receiving 107 TCIDso of vaccine virus,
compared with the quantity of virus shed by adult volunteers
who were challenged experimentally [27]. Different patterns
of virus replication were observed in ah and ca vaccine
responders. The ah vaccine virus was recovered less often
from serial nasal wash specimens than was the ca vaccine virus. Whether this represented a difference in extent of virus
replication of the two reassortant viruses or a difference in
the ability of each virus to be isolated in MDCK cell culture
is not clear. Isolates from infants and children infected with

the ah or the ca vaccine viruses retained their parental phenotype even after replication in permissive hosts. Transmission
of vaccine virus from ah or ca vaccinees to susceptible contacts was not observed in this or previous studies [42, 43].
The HID50 of the ah and ca H3N2 vaccine viruses for
seronegative infants and children were remarkably similar (ah,
1()4·6 TCIDso; and ca, 1()4.4 TCIDso). Both reassortant viruses
were 100 times less infectious for seronegative adults [27].
The HIDso ofthe ca influenza A/Bethesda/85 reassortant was
similar to that reported for ca influenza A/Korea/82 reassortant virus (l()4.6 TCID50) [32], but neither of these H3N2 ca
reassortants was as infectious for young children as the ca
influenza A/California/78 (H1N1) reassortant (103.
s TCIDso)
[29]. In adults, ah or ca influenza H1N1 reassortant viruses
were more infectious than H3N2 reassortants [27]. These
findings are consistent with the concept that the inherent properties ofthe HA and NA ofthe wild-type parent virus influence
the infectivity of ah and ca reassortant virus vaccines in humans [27, 28].
At the 107 TCIDso dose, vaccination with ah or ca vaccine
elicited an ELISA influenza-specific IgG antibody response
in serum of most (75 %-88 %) seronegative infants and children but induced a nasal wash ELISA IgA antibody response
in only 33%-58%. Lower rates of serum (64%) and nasal
wash (23%-36%) antibody responses were observed previously in adult volunteers who were vaccinated with 107.
5
TCIDso of the same lots of ah and ca H3N2 vaccines [27].
The most likely explanation for the difference in rates ofimmune responses between seronegative infants or children and
adults wastheir different levels ofbackground immunity, which
would have altered their susceptibility to infection with live
virus vaccine. It is important to emphasize that despite the
low nasal wash antibody response ofthe vaccinees, they failed
to shed virus after administration ofa second dose of vaccine
virus.
There was no association between illness and infection with
vaccine virus or virus replication in these studies. Importantly,
lower respiratory tract illnesses were not observed in ah or
ca vaccinees. Of note, the incidence of influenza-like illness
was substantially higher among placebo recipients and ah vaccinees who spent 4-6 h compared with vaccinees who stayed
only 1-2 h in our day-care-like setting. Our findings are consistent with the well-documented association ofincreased rate
of transmission of infectious agents and risk of respiratory
illness in day-care settings [44]. When the length of stay in
the playroom was limited to 1-2 h for all children, there was
no difference in rates of illness among the infants and children who received the highest dose ofah vaccine, ca vaccine,
or placebo. These findings, together with the marked restriction in virus replication, indicate that the ah and ca influenza
A/Bethesda/85 (H3N2) reassortant viruses are satisfactorily
attenuated even at a dose of 200 HIDso.
Since attenuated viruses rather than wild-type influenza A
virus were used for our challenge studies, we could not assess the level of protective efficacy of each vaccine against
illness. We were, however, able to determine that ah and ca
vaccine-induced immunity effectively restricted virus replication and partially protected against reinfection with ah and
ca vaccine viruses. Our data suggest that a second dose of
live ah or ca vaccine may be beneficial for some infants and
children.
In summary, even though six of eight RNA segments
differed, the ah and ca influenza A/Bethesda/85 reassortant
vaccine viruses demonstrated remarkably similar properties
in susceptible infants and young children. These results, together with our previous findings in adults, demonstrate that
the ah and ca influenza A/Bethesda/85 (H3N2) reassortant
viruses are comparable, suitable live influenza virus vaccine
candidates. Studies in children with ah and ca influenza
A/Kawasaki/87 (HIN1) reassortant viruses are being conducted
 at University of Arizona on July 10, 2015 http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from 
400 Steinhoff et al. JID 1990;162 (August)
to assess the ability of the avian donor virus reproducibly to
confer attenuation and other desirable characteristics to wildtype viruses.
