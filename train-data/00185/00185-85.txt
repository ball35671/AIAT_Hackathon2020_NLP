ABSTRACT: The purpose of this study was to assess the impact a free, on-site influenza immunization program could have on attendance in Title 1 schools. Four Title 1 elementary schools
participated in the study. Students at 2 schools were offered free FluMist immunizations on site,
and students at 2 control schools were not. Compliance on receiving FluMist was measured on
the percentage of students participating after evaluating for medical exclusions. Documentation
on the reason for absences at all 4 schools included self- or parent-reported influenza. Attendance
rates for the year also were compared with the previous year for all 4 schools. A comparison was
done of total days absent versus total days enrolled between schools receiving FluMist and
schools not receiving the vaccine. Despite the fact that FluMist is a new vaccine and is not
required for children, 57% of those medically eligible to receive it had parental permission and
received the vaccine. The 2 schools receiving FluMist increased their attendance rates from 95.3%
and 93.9% to 96.1% and 95.8%. Previously, the comparison schools each had a 94.6% attendance
rate; one fell to 94.4% and the other rose very slightly to 94.7%. The differences in self- or parentreported influenza absences were not significant. However, the difference in days absent between
individual vaccinated and nonvaccinated schools was statistically significant.

attendance rate for the state of Indiana in the 95th
percentile would be 97.8%. School nurses noted that
none of the local Title 1 schools met this benchmark.
Title 1 is a federal entitlement program allocated on
the basis of student enrollment and census poverty
data. The U.S. Department of Education disburses
funds to state education agencies, which then distribute these funds to local school districts. The intent is
to ensure that all children have an opportunity to obtain a high quality education and to reach grade-level
proficiency (No Child Left Behind Act, 2001).
Previous research has shown that school absentee
rates increase during influenza season (Neuzil, Hohlbein, & Zhu, 2002). The goal of the Parkview Community Nursing Research Group was to increase
school attendance rates. Members of the group observed that influenza and absences due to influenza
were challenges each winter, particularly in schools
with a high population of children with a low socioDownloaded from jsn.sagepub.com at Uniwersytet Warszawski on July 1, 2015

economic status. Many of these school families lived
in multifamily dwellings, a situation that increased
person-to-person contact and promoted the spread of
bacteria and viruses. Although influenza vaccines were
available in the community, these families often did
not have the funds or transportation to receive preventive health care.
LITERATURE REVIEW
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) stated that the primary option for reducing the
number of influenza cases is immunoprophylaxis with
vaccine (CDC, 2005). Influenza virus vaccine live, intranasal (FluMist) is a live, trivalent, nasally-administered vaccine intended for active immunization to
prevent disease caused by influenza A and B viruses in
healthy children and adolescents 5–17 years of age
and healthy adults 18–49 years of age (MedImmune
Vaccines, Inc., 2005).
Belshe and colleagues (1998, 2000) described a
study in which FluMist was administered to 20,228
subjects in clinical studies. The population that was
evaluated included 10,297 healthy children 5–17 years
of age. The Pediatric Efficacy Study was a multicenter,
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial
performed on healthy U.S. children to evaluate the efficacy of FluMist against confirmed influenza over
two successive seasons. The overall efficacy of FluMist against culture confirmed wild-type influenza
was 86.9%.
The SchoolMist Study Group recently examined the
effect of FluMist on elementary school children on
several influenza-related outcomes in families. Three
schools participated in the study, with one school receiving the vaccine. In that school, 40% of the children received the FluMist vaccine. All families from
the three schools were sent an anonymous questionnaire asking for a 7-day recall of ‘‘fever or respiratory
illness (FRI)-related’’ medical visits, medications purchased, or days of school or paid work lost during the
peak influenza week. There were significant reductions
in the FRI-related outcomes between the target school
and the comparison schools. The increases in absentee
rates from baseline to the peak influenza outbreak period were not significant between the target and the
control schools. However, within the target school,
there was a statistically significant, smaller increase in
absenteeism rates in the FluMist recipients compared
with the non-FluMist recipients (King et al., 2005).
METHODOLOGY
Funding for the vaccine cost of the study was obtained from the Parkview Hospital Community Health
Improvement Program. Institutional Review Board approval was obtained from both Parkview Hospital and
the local school system.
Free vaccinations were offered to all staff
and students who were medically eligible
at the elementary schools designated to
receive vaccines.
The Parkview Community Nursing Research Group
compared four Title 1 elementary schools in a large
urban school system. The schools were comparable in
size, race, and socioeconomic status, as determined by
the percentage of children qualifying for free or reduced lunch (Table 1). Free vaccinations were offered
to all staff and students who were medically eligible
at the elementary schools designated to receive vaccines. School nurses evaluated current medical histories and checked for immediate medical exclusions.
Staff and students who had prior documentation of
medical conditions that excluded them from the
study were sent a letter explaining that free flu immunizations were being offered, but their medical
condition prevented them from obtaining FluMist.
They were referred to other sources to obtain an inactivated influenza vaccine. Staff and students who
had no such documentation were given an educational sheet explaining the FluMist study and a permission slip in either English or Spanish. School nurses
and a Spanish-speaking social worker were available to
answer questions from parents. A pediatrician was
available for any screening questions the nurses might
have.
As the day of vaccination approached, school nurses called parents to encourage them to return forms

and permission slips. On the day of the vaccinations,
a nurse went into each classroom and called all the
children who had signed permission slips from parents and whose medical eligibility had been reconfirmed. Children age 5–8 years who had not been vaccinated previously with FluMist received two doses
of FluMist 60 days apart. Children and adults age 9–
49 received one dose. Approximately 0.25 ml was administered into each nostril while the recipient was in
an upright position. A total of 277 children were vaccinated.
RESULTS
There were 273 students enrolled in Vaccine School
1. Although 51 students were medically excluded, 222
students were eligible to obtain FluMist. Of those
who were medically eligible, 143 students (64%) obtained the vaccine. Due to initial letters, follow-up letters, and phone calls, the parental response rate (i.e.,
returning a completed form to school, whether agreeing or not agreeing to have child participate) was 78%.
There were 323 students enrolled in Vaccine School
2, of which 273 were eligible to obtain FluMist; 50
students were medically excluded. Of those who were
medically eligible, 134 students (49%) obtained the
free FluMist vaccine. The parental response rate was
60%.
Teachers and school staff also were offered free
FluMist. Due to age and other medical conditions, a
large number of staff were medically excluded. Twenty-two staff members from each school obtained
FluMist.
The attendance rates at the two schools
receiving FluMist increased, whereas the
nonvaccine schools had a decrease in
overall attendance.
Attendance was calculated by dividing total days in
attendance by membership days (number of student
enrolled per day). The attendance rates at the two
schools receiving FluMist increased, whereas the
nonvaccine schools had a decrease in overall attendance. Differences in the self- or parent-reported influenza absences were not significant (Table 2). However, difference in days absent between individual vaccinated and nonvaccinated schools was statistically
significant with a chi-square p value of .001 (Table
3).
DISCUSSION
The 57% vaccination rate for medically eligible
children may have created some ‘‘herd immunity’’
and protected a larger number of children than those
immunized. Herd immunity happens when a part of
a population has been vaccinated and then has antibodies that neutralize a virus, making vaccinated individuals less likely to transmit a virus to the unvaccinated population. The proportion of children vaccinated that is required to control the spread of influenza is unknown. Piedra and others (2005) found that
vaccination of approximately 20–25% of children 1.5–
18 years of age resulted in protection of 8–18% in
adults older than 35 years of age. Hurwitz and colleagues (2000) gave inactivated vaccine to children in
day care and found infection rates of older siblings
reduced by 80% compared with siblings of unvacciDownloaded from jsn.sagepub.com at Uniwersytet Warszawski on July 1, 2015

nated day care attendees. Longini and Halloran (2005)
stated the goal should be to vaccinate 70% of schoolchildren, although if only 50% of the schoolchildren
are vaccinated, community-wide transmission would
be reduced.

community-wide transmission would be
reduced.
The attendance rate increases at the FluMist
schools and decreases at the control schools were significant. It was difficult to track the ‘‘self-reports’’ of
absence from influenza (Table 2) due to several factors,
including no parent call, a message with no reason for
absence, multiple staff taking calls, and lack of education of parents on what constitutes influenza. If this
study were replicated, we would recommend that
‘‘self-reports’’ of influenza be discouraged and that a
study on a larger number of schools would assess only
the overall attendance rate changes.
IMPLICATIONS FOR SCHOOL NURSING PRACTICE
This study found that a free, on-site, mass immunization with FluMist had a positive impact on
school attendance. One of the goals of the National
Association of School Nurses is to promote the health
and academic success of children. This can be facilitated by ensuring that all students are immunized. In
areas where immunization rates are low and parents
do not have the resources for immunization services,
school nurses can work with community organizations to provide free, on-site immunizations. By reducing the incidence of influenza in the school setting, absentee rates can be reduced so that students
can remain in school ready to learn. Many schools,
particularly Title 1 schools, struggle to maintain statemandated attendance rates. School nurses may want
to consider recommending mass influenza immunization programs to increase school attendance. It also
is essential that school nurses keep data on how such
immunization programs affect illness and attendance
rates. Such data validate the effectiveness that mass
immunization clinics have on increasing attendance.
By reducing the incidence of influenza in
the school setting, absentee rates can be
reduced so that students can remain in
school ready to learn.
