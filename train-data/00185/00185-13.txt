\s=b\In 1985, we enrolled 189 school-age
children by family in a double-blind study
to determine protection against influenza
by a single dose of cold-recombinant bivalent A vaccine or commercial trivalent inactivated vaccine compared with placebo.
All children in school or day care, 3 to 18
years of age, in an enrolled family received
the same preparation. Following vaccination, 60% and 21% of cold-recombinant
bivalent A vaccine recipients and 73% and
83% of trivalent inactivated vaccine recipients demonstrated fourfold or greater response in hemagglutination-inhibition
antibody titer to A/H1N1 and A/H3N2, respectively. Sixty-seven percent of all trivalent inactivated vaccine recipients demonstrated a fourfold or greater serologic
response to H1N1, H3N2, and influenza B
following a single dose of vaccine. During
the 1985-1986 influenza B/Ann Arbor epidemic, heterotypic protection afforded by
the influenza B/USSR component of trivalent inactivated vaccine was 62% compared with placebo. A single dose of trivalent inactivated vaccine protected schoolage children, 6 to 19 years of age, from
influenza B infection; the rate of protection was 64% against infection and 73%
against febrile illness.

T nfluenza virus infection is an impor¬
tant cause ofserious morbidity in chil¬
dren.1 Annual infection rates have aver¬
aged 42 per 100 children; acute
respiratory illnesses attributed to those
infections occurred in 36 per 100 per
year and included lower respiratory
tract involvement in 10%.2 Otitis media
is also a common complication. During
influenza epidemics, the rate of hospitalization of preschool children (=s5
years of age) with acute respiratory
tract disease has approached the rate
for the elderly (3=65 years of age), but
mortality has been much higher in the
latter.8
Furthermore, influenza virus infec¬
tion of school-age children promotes the
spread of influenza in the community.4"7
Data from the Houston (Tex) Family
Study (HFS) regularly have shown a
strong relationship between the occur¬
rence ofinfluenza virus infection among
school-age children in the family and the
secondary attack rates among other
family members.8,9 Surveillance ofinflu¬
enza in the community also supports
this concept.10,11 Hence, control of influ¬
enza epidemics will require curtailment
ofthe spread of virus by school-age chil¬
dren. Monto et al12 observed that the use
of an inactivated vaccine in school-age
children was effective in reducing the
severity of a community influenza A
outbreak.
In the fall of 1985, we enrolled 189
children aged 3 to 18 years by family in a
study to determine the protective effect
ofattenuated cold-recombinant (CR) in¬
fluenza vaccine or trivalent inactivated
vaccine (TIV) against natural influenza
challenge. Infection in household con¬
tacts was monitored to determine
whether vaccination of all school-age
children could reduce the risk of in¬
fluenza virus infection for unvaccinated household contacts. The influenza
B/Ann Arbor epidemic of 1985-1986 af¬
forded us the opportunity to study effi¬
cacy of a single dose of TIV containing
B/USSR antigen against the heterotypic challenge caused by influenza B/Ann
Arbor. Significant protection of school
children with inactivated influenza B
vaccine was observed.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
Vaccines
Bivalent CR influenza A vaccine and TIV
were evaluated in this study. The bivalent
CR vaccine was composed of two vaccine
strains, each ofwhich contained the six genes
coding for internal proteins from the coldadapted parent influenza strain A/Arm Ar¬
bor/6/60. Derivation of the donor virus has
been detailed elsewhere.13 We used CR-59
(H3N2; lot E-204) containing 107 3
50% tissue
culture infectious doses (TCIDM) per milliliter diluted 1:10 with stock CR-64 (H1N1, lot
E-221), containing 106S TCID«, per milliliter
and stored the vaccine at
-
70°C until it was
used; CR-64 and CR-59 contain the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase of A/Dunedin/6/83 (H1N1) and A/Korea/1/82 (H3N2),
respectively. The TIV was the standard li¬
censed vaccine (Fluogen, subvirion, ParkeDavis, Morris Plains, NJ), which contained
15 p-g each of A/Chile/83 (H1N1), A/Philippines/82 (H3N2), and B/USSR/83 hemagglutinin antigens in 0.5 mL.14 The H1N1 and
H3N2 antigens contained in the CR prepara¬
tions are serologically equivalent to their
counterparts in the TIV.
Clinical Design
Atotal of92 families with healthy children
3 years of age or older were recruited from
the HFS, the University of Oklahoma Fam¬
ily Practice Center (Oklahoma City; OFP),
and the Baylor College of Medicine Family
Practice Clinic (Houston, Tex; BFP). Thirty
percent of enrolled families were assigned to
each vaccine and 40% to placebo (control fam¬
ilies). All children who were 3 years of age or
older and who attended school or day care
received the vaccine orplacebo to which their
family was assigned. Fifty-seven percent of
vaccinated children were from HFS families,
34% from OFP families, and 9% from BFP
families. Subjects received 0.5 mL intranasally (CR) or intramuscularly (TIV) as a sin¬
gle dose. Placebo recipients were randomly

assigned to receive 0.5 mL of buffered saline
intranasally or sterile saline for injection in¬
tramuscularly. Vaccines were coded and ad¬
ministered in a double-blind fashion by indi¬
viduals who were not responsible for clinical
evaluations. Families enrolled in the study
were independently randomized at each par¬
ticipating institution.
Before vaccination, a medical history and
physical examination were obtained on each
child to ensure that the subject was healthy
and eligible for study. Serum specimens for
influenza sérologie study were obtained from
all family members 3 years of age or older
(OFP) or all family members (HFS, BFP) to
bracket vaccination for vaccinées and to
bracket the respiratory disease season for
all. Families were contacted by telephone to
record local, systemic, or respiratory symp¬
toms occurring within 2 weeks after vaccina¬
tion. When ongoing community surveillance
at the Influenza Research Center (Baylor
College of Medicine) indicated that influenza
virus was present in the community, weekly
telephone contacts to families were initiated
to evaluate all respiratory illnesses. Home or
clinic visits were scheduled for physical ex¬
amination and collection of nasal washes and
throat swab specimens for virus isolation. An
illness was attributed to influenza B infection
if an isolate was obtained during the illness
or, in a person with a postseason antibody
rise only, if the illness occurred within 10
days of an isolate in household contact or
during the period ofmost intense viral activi¬
ty in the community. Occasionally, more than
one illness occurred during that interval. If
severity differed, the most severe illness was
attributed to the infection (<5% of classifi¬
cations).
Illnesses were characterized by review of
illness records, which included date of onset,
symptoms, physical signs, and diagnosis for
each contact. Multiple clinical contacts were
occasionally made because of continued ill¬
ness or illness in other family members. A
composite of all relevant records was used to
characterize each illness. Evidence of fever
(temperature, 3=37.8°C) included history or
identification of fever when the patient was
clinically evaluated. Illnesses were classified
as afebrile or febrile. Febrile illnesses in¬
cluded upper respiratory tract illness with
fever, otitis media, influenzalike illness with
fever, or lower respiratory tract illness with
fever.
This study protocol was approved by the
institutional review boards of all participat¬
ing institutions, and their guidelines for con¬
duct of clinical studies were followed. Writ¬
ten informed consent was obtained from the
parents of all subjects.
Viral Identification
Nasal wash and throat swab specimens
were inoculated on MDCK,15 WI-38, and
Hep-2 cell lines. Viruses were initially de¬
tected by cytopathic effect or hemadsorption; influenza identities were confirmed by
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or fluo¬
rescent antibody staining of infected cells.16
Serologie Study
Hemagglutination
-
inhibition antibody
(HIA) to influenza A and neutralizing anti¬
body to influenza B were determined on all
serum specimens using the following anti¬
gens: A/Dunedin/83 (H1N1), A/Chile/83
(H1N1), A/Philippines/82 (H3N2), A/Panama/83 (H3N2), B/Ann Arbor/86, and
B/USSR/83.17 In contrast to measurement of
sérologie response to influenza A by HIA,
measurement of sérologie responses to influ¬
enza B by HIA is generally insensitive; mea¬
surement ofneutralizing antibody to influen¬
za B has proved more reliable.17 Antigens
were chosen for testing of serum samples
based on sérologie equivalence to antigens
contained within the vaccines or antigens of
1985-1986 epidemic influenza strains. Sero¬
logie response to vaccination was defined as a
fourfold or greater rise in antibody titer in a
postvaccination serum specimen; fourfold or
greater rise in antibody titer between pre¬
season and postseason serum samples (or vi¬
rus isolation) was considered indicative of
infection. Statistical comparison of infection
rates between groups was performed by \z
analysis. Comparison of geometric mean
antibody titers (GMTs) between groups was
made by analysis of variance and NeumanKeuls multiple comparison test.
RESULTS
Demographic Data and
Vaccine Reactors
A total of 92 families were enrolled in
this study. One hundred ninety-one
children 3 to 19 years ofage were admin¬
istered CR, TIV, or placebo. These chil¬
dren and their 175 unvaccinated family
contacts were followed up during the
subsequent influenza B/Ann Arbor/86
epidemic. No significant differences
were noted in socioeeonomic status, av¬
erage size of family, or age distribution
of vaccine recipients (Table 1). Local
reactions to intramuscular administra¬
tion characterized by tenderness at the
site of injection that did not limit func¬
tion occurred in 20% of TIV recipients
and 19% of controls. Upper respiratory
tract symptoms (rhinorrhea, nasal con¬
gestion) were infrequent and mild, oc¬
curring in 15% and 19% ofCR and place¬
bo recipients, respectively.
Serum Antibody Responses
Comparison of TIV and CR Re¬
sponses. —Table 2 compares by age the
HIA responses to the influenza A com¬
ponents of TIV and the bivalent A CR
vaccine. Virtually all children (85% and
94%) 6 years and older who received
TIV had fourfold or greater HIA re¬
sponses to the influenza A viruses;
GMTs ranged from 1:89 to 1:158 after
vaccination. The responses of children 3
to 5 years of age were less satisfactory:
only 50% and 61% responded to a single
dose of TIV, and the GMTs were 1:34
and 1:39, against A (H1N1) and A
(H3N2) antigens, respectively.
The HIA serum antibody responses
of children who received the bivalent
CR vaccine were lower (Table 2), but
60% had a fourfold or greater response

to influenza A (H1N1) and 21% to influ¬
enza A (H3N2). Included among those
with fourfold rises were 50% and 42%, of
the 3- to 5-year-old children, respective¬
ly. The postvaccination GMTs of serum
antibody after TIV were significantly
higher (P=£.05) than those for CR vac¬
cine. An interesting dichotomy in the
pattern of antibody response to the
H3N2 component was observed; 9 of 12
children with preexisting antibody titers of 1:8 or lower had a significant
response to the CR vaccine, while only
6 of 14 children with such titers re¬
sponded to TIV. Few children with
higher titers had evidence of serum
antibody response to the CR virus,
while almost all of the TIV recipients
with detectable preexisting antibodies
had a significant rise.
Influenza B Neutralizing Antibody
Response to TIV.—Table 3 illustrates
the serum neutralizing antibody re¬
sponse to B/USSR for children who re¬
ceived TIV. Prevaccination GMTs of
neutralizing antibody were equivalent
to those of placebo and CR recipients.
The responses of children 6 years and
older were similar to those for the A
antigens: 80% to 89% had a fourfold or
greater rise with GMTs of 1:49 and
1:111, respectively. The responses to
B/Ann Arbor (not given) were much
lower; only 21 (62%) of the 34 older chil¬
dren demonstrated a rise to new B/Ann
Arbor variant, and the postvaccination
GMTs were 1:6, 1:10, and 1:24 for the
three age groups.
Protection Against Natural
Influenza B Infection
During the 1985-1986 influenza B/
Ann Arbor epidemic, we evaluated pro¬
tection against influenza B infection and
illness in TIV recipients and their con¬
tacts. As shown in Table 4, the infection
rate for TIV recipients, 18.5 per 100,
was significantly lower than that for pla¬
cebo recipients (P=s.01).
Influenza B infections were observed
with intermediate frequency in CR vac¬
cine recipients (26%) in comparison with
placebo and TIV recipients despite the
absence ofinfluenza B antigen in the CR
vaccine. Protection afforded by TIV
vaccine was most prominent for chil¬
dren 6 years of age and older. We ob¬
served influenza B infection in 6 (23%) of
26 TIV recipients aged 6 to 9 years in

COMMENT
We have compared sérologie respons¬
es to TIV and CR influenza vaccines in
school-age children and have observed
these subjects for protection against in¬
fluenza infection during the 1985-1986
B/Ann Arbor epidemic. Given as a sin¬
gle intramuscular dose, TIV produced
fourfold or greater sérologie rises to
H1N1, H3N2, and influenza B antigen
contained in the vaccine in the majority
of school-age children. Moreover, a single dose of TIV protected school-age
children against subsequent influenza B
infection as identified by virus culture
and antibody response. The intermedi¬
ate influenza B infection rate observed
in CR recipients was an unexpected
finding. The CR recipients were slight¬
ly older and their families were slightly
larger (Table 1). Review of HFS study
records revealed that 69% of these chil¬
dren had a culture-positive infection
with influenza B during previous epi¬
demics. In contrast, only 17% and 39%
of TIV and placebo recipients, respec¬
tively, had previous culture-positive
infections. Thus, the low influenza B
infection rate among CR vaccinées
probably resulted from protection provided by prior natural infection. This
previous experience was not reflected
in the preseason neutralizing antibody
titers; CR recipients' titers were com¬
parable with those of placebo recipi¬
ents.
Serologie responses to influenza A
(H3N2) were significantly reduced in
CR recipients when compared with
those of TIV recipients. However, 75%
of seronegative children who received
CR vaccine demonstrated a sérologie
response to H3N2; preexisting HIA to
H3N2 seemed to be associated with di¬
minished infection with CR H3N2. Con¬
versely, TIV response was less likely to
occur in seronegative children (43%).
Hence, seronegative children seemed to
respond best to CR vaccine, but priming
by prior natural infection likely was
important for sérologie response to
inactivated H3N2. An extensive epi¬
demic due to influenza A/Philippines/82
(H3N2) that occurred during the respi¬
ratory disease season just before the
vaccine study produced a largely H3N2
seropositive subject population and
could account for our observations.
Different responses to CR and inacti¬
vated vaccine based on sérologie status
have been previously reported. Johnson
et al18,19 have shown that seronega¬
tive live virus vaccine recipients had
significantly higher and more sustained
nasal wash and serum HIA and enzymelinked immunosorbent assay IgG and
IgA titers and were better protected
against subsequent CR influenza A vac¬
cine challenge than inactivated-virus
vaccinées. In contrast, Clements et
al20,21 have reported seropositive adult
populations in which the frequency and
magnitude of serum IgA and IgG anti¬
body rises were greater following inac¬
tivated vaccine than following CR vac¬
cine. Yet, compared with unvaccinated
control volunteers, CR vaccinées were
betterprotected against subsequent ho¬
mologous wild-type challenge than inac¬
tivated vaccinées. Thus, circumstances
of induction of sérologie antibody re¬
sponse may be a better predictor of im¬
munity than the absolute level of an¬
tibody produced. The absence of a
significant H3N2 attack rate did not al¬
low us to confirm this observation in our
population following natural wild-type
influenza challenge. However, in a resi¬
dential school study, Davies and Grilli22
Downloaded From: http://archpedi.jamanetwork.com/ by a New York University User on 05/24/2015
recently reported that antibody follow¬
ing natural infection was associated
with a significantly lower infection rate
than infection rates of students with
similar levels ofantibody following inac¬
tivated vaccine. In part, improved pro¬
tection afforded by CR vaccine or natu¬
ral infection may be due to better local
IgA response seen in both seropositive
and seronegative populations.
Monto et al12 previously have shown
inactivated vaccine-induced protection
of school-age children in a community
setting against influenza A; our data
would indicate efficacy ofinactivated in¬
fluenza B vaccine in school-age children.
We were unable, however, to demon¬
strate directly the protection of unvaccinated household contacts from influ¬
enza B during the 1985-1986 B/Ann
Arbor epidemic; attack rates were low
in household contacts, 90% of whom
were adults with apparent partial im¬
munity to infection. Recurrent prior ex¬
posure to influenza B may have induced
durable immunity in the adult contacts.
Community studies incorporating satu¬
ration immunization of the target popu¬
lation may be necessary to demonstrate
"herd" immunity with influenza vac¬
cines.
Previous recommendations have pro¬
moted administration of two spaced
doses ofTIV to previously unvaccinated
high-risk children 12 years of age or
younger to ensure adequate protection
against influenza.23 Glezen et al24 have
previously shown high sérologie re¬
sponse rates in children with sickle-cell
disease following a single dose of TIV.
Our data support the view that two
doses of TIV may be unnecessary for
protection against influenza B of schoolage children 6 years of age or older.
Moreover, we noted good sérologie response to both influenza A subtypes in
the majority of children 6 years of age or
older following a single dose of TIV.
Surveillance data from our center and
others have regularly shown high at¬
tack rates of circulating influenza A and
influenza B strains in preschool chil¬
dren, which likely provide a priming ef¬
fect.2,5,8,9 In the absence of major antigenie shifts, it is doubtful that a second
TIV dose would improve significantly
the responses for school children who
have had ample opportunity for priming
by natural infection during the pre¬
school years.
The protection afforded by a single
dose of TIV was remarkable because
the epidemic virus, B/Ann Arbor, was
antigenically different from the B/
USSR virus used to produce the vac¬
cine. Protection cannot be explained
based on prior B/Ann Arbor exposure,
since this virus was not prevalent in the
community before the 1985-1986 epi¬
demic, and prevaccination neutralizing
GMTs to B/Ann Arbor were less than
1:2 in the TIV group. Centers for Dis¬
ease Control (Atlanta, Ga) investiga¬
tors tested HIA responses of subjects
who received B/USSR vaccine and
found that responses measured by
B/Ann Arbor were low (GMT, 1:15)
compared with the homotypic virus
(GMT, I'M).25 Similarly, the children in
our study had an almost fourfold-higher
neutralizing titer to the vaccine anti¬
gen, B/USSR (GMT, 1:36), compared
with only 1:10 to B/Ann Arbor. Table 5
illustrates the high correlation of the
postvaccination B/Ann Arbor antibody
level to protection against infection. De¬
spite the antigenic drift, a single dose of
vaccine provided significant protection
against the prevalent virus.
The protection is all the more remarkable when compared with other studies
of the efficacy of influenza B vaccine in
children. The protection rates have
ranged from 47% to no significant pro¬
tection. These studies have varied con¬
siderably in structure and in follow-up
mechanisms. Three controlled studies
showed protection rates of 43% to 47%
under widely varying conditions.26"28 In
most instances, the antigen content of
the vaccines was probably considerably
less than that in current vaccines.27"29
Others were carried out during the time
that antigen content was standardized
by chick cell agglutination units26,80; this
method was unreliable. The 1985-1986
B/Ann Arbor epidemic was associated
with a particularly high risk ofinfection
in the study population as evidenced by
the attack rate in the placebo-treated
group. The high attack rate likely fa¬
vored demonstration of vaccine efficacy
in comparison with studies conducted
during less pervasive influenza B
epidemics.
Even with better protection afforded
by available inactivated vaccines, poor
acceptance of injections and cost of an¬
nual immunization make inactivated
preparations unlikely instruments for
controlling the problem in the general
population. As noted previously, live at¬
tenuated vaccines administered by nose
drops have greater potential for influen¬
za control, but further studies are
needed to define this role.

In Sickness and in Wealth: American Hospitals in the Twentieth
Century, by R. Stevens, 432 pp, $24.95, New York, NY, Basic Books Inc,
1989.
As the title shows, the author, currently chairman of the
Department of History and Sociology of Science at the
University of Pennsylvania, uses the English language
well. Formerly a hospital administrator, then a policy
analyst and subsequently a historian, she has studied both
the British and American health care systems and has
written knowledgeably about a variety of subjects relating
to them.
In this latest book, she describes our current hospital
system, where it has come from, its characteristics, how it
works, and why it does not work better. She discusses
technological vs social welfare goals, characteristics of the
American hospital system, and the process of change.
Most physicians who work daily in hospitals fail to have
this long-term broad perspective, and certainly few of us
could write as well about it as Rosemary Stevens. There
are chapters on charities and businesses, regulating hospitals, the case for cooperative medicine (World War I),
hospitals in the 1920s (the flowering of consumerism),
hospitals during the depression and the early New Deal
era, the genesis of Blue Cross, consolidation without
jeopardy (planning in the shadow of World War II), pillars
of respectable independence (the 1950s), the drive for
reimbursement, marketplace pragmatism (1965-1980), and
hospitals at the end of the 20th century.
The book ends with a broad overview of the American
hospital system in historical perspective, Professor Stevens
asking finally, "What next?" She concludes that the United
States has a "de facto national health system, expressed
through its hospitals, although Americans are unwilling to
recognize the fact and will, indeed, go to enormous lengths
to deny it." She cites a physician who, "looking back on his
own simpler, beeperless housestaff days, remarked, 'Com¬
paring medicine then and now is like comparing horse-andbuggy days with interplanetary travel.' "
She looks at the
quality of the hospital system as a reflection of the quality
of American medical care and, indeed, as "an index of
American civilization."
Time for reading is precious, but I strongly recommend
this thoughtful, well-written book. All of us interested in
provision of health care for the disenfranchised whom we
serve—children—will learn more about our health care
system and how it affects our patients. The book is
beautifully indexed and referenced. Three cheers to the
Commonwealth Fund, the National Library of Medicine
(National Institutes ofHealth), the Rockefeller Foundation,
and the Guggenheim Foundation for supporting the author
in the preparation of this superb review.
