Characteristics ofavian-human (ab) and cold-adapted (ca) influenzaA/Kawasaki/9/86 (HIN1)
reassortant vaccineviruseswerecompared in 37seronegativeadults and 122seronegativeinfants
and children. The 50% human infectious dose (HIDso) in infants and children was 1()2·9 and
1()2·6 TCIDso for the ab and ca vaccine, respectively. The ah influenza A/Kawasaki/9/86 reassortant was reactogenic: 24% of infants and children infected with ~100 HIDso had fever
~39.4°C. Since H3N2 ahvaccineswerepreviouslyshown to be adequately attenuated, it is reasonable to suggest that the genes that code for hemagglutinin and neuraminidase of the HIN1
virusapparentlyinfluence the reactogenicity ofreassortantviruses derived fromthe avianinfluenza
A/Mallard/NewYork/6750/78 donor virus. Becausethis avian virus does not reproduciblyconfer
a satisfactorylevelof attenuation to each subtype of influenza A virus, it is not a suitable donor
virus for attenuation of wild-typeinfluenza viruses. In contrast, the ca A/AnnArbor/6/60donor
virusreliably confers attenuationcharacteristicstoa varietyofHIN1and H3N2influenza Aviruses.
Influenzavirus infectionscause significant illnessin infants
and children [1-4]. Since the inactivatedinfluenzavirus vaccines confer incompleteand short-livedprotection [5], recent
efforts havebeen directed towardsthe developmentof live attenuated influenza virus vaccines.
Live attenuated influenza A virus vaccines are produced
by genetic reassortment of the six genes that code for the internalproteinsofan attenuateddonor strain withthe twogenes
coding for the hemagglutinin(HA) and neuraminidase (NA)
surfaceglycoproteins from the epidemicwild-typevirus. Two
donor viruses havebeen used successfullyto produce attenuated reassortants: humaninfluenza A/AnnArbor/6/60(H2N2)
cold-adapted (ca) virus and the avian influenza A/Mallard/New York/6750/78 (H2N2) virus.

An important requirement for attenuated donor viruses is
that they should reproducibly confer attenuation to each new
influenza A wild-type virus. Studiesin largenumbersofadults
[6-11] and children [12-20] haveshown that the ca donor virus reproduciblyconfersthe properties of attenuationand immunogenicityto reassortants derived from several influenza
A HINI and H3N2 wild-type viruses. Avian-human (ah)
influenza A HINI and H3N2 reassortants have been shown
to be attenuated and immunogenic in adults [11, 21-23], but
the experience in children is limited [19, 20]. Comparisons
of ah and ca influenzaA (H3N2) reassortants derived from
the influenza A/Bethesda/85 (H3N2)virus revealed theywere
similar in their levels of attenuation, infectivity, and immunogenicityin adults and in seronegativechildren [11, 20].
However, preliminary data suggested that an ah influenza
A/California/78(HINl)reassortant may havebeen associated
with mild lower respiratory tract involvement in seronegativechildren [19]. Wethereforecomparedah and ca influenza
reassortants derived from the contemporary A/Kawasaki/86
(HINI) wild-type virus to determine if the avian donor virus
would confer the same level of attenuation to this influenza
A wild-typeHINI virus as it did to the A/Bethesda/85 H3N2
wild-type virus.
Materials and Methods
Vaccines. The influenza A/Kawasaki/9/86 (HINI) wild-type viruswas isolated inprimary chickkidney (PChK) tissue culturefrom
a throatwash specimen provided byKunaki Nerome (National Institutes of Health, Tokyo). The wild-type virus was passaged four

1024 Steinhoffet al. JID 1991;163 (May)
times in PChK tissueculture, includinga plaque-to-plaque passage
at 39°C, followed by one passage in the allantoic cavityof specific
pathogen-free embryonated eggs. The passage history of the two
attenuated donor viruses has been described [24-26], as havethe
methods forproduction andcharacterization ofcaandahreassortants
[24, 25]. Two candidatereassortantvaccineswereevaluated: ahinfluenza A/Kawasaki/9/86 x A/Mallard/New York/6750/78 (HINI)
reassortant virus (lot E-265, 109.
0 TCIDso/ml) and ca influenza
A/Kawasaki/9/86 (H1N1) reassortant virus (lotE-263, 107.
6 TCIDso/
ml). Suspensions ofvirus used in this studyweregrownin the allantoic cavityofspecific pathogen-free eggsand testedfor the presence
of adventitious agents byLouisPotash(FlowLaboratories, McLean,
VA). Eachvaccine was diluted in L-15 medium (WhittakerBioproducts,
Walkersville, MD) to achieve the desirednumberofinfectious units.
All subjects received 0.25 ml of viral suspension in each nostril.
Studydesign. Vaccines wereevaluatedin 1987and 1988during
periodswheninfluenza virus wasnotcirculating. Thevaccine viruses
were evaluated initiallyin youngadults to determinethe levelof attenuationandimmunogenicity. Then, a seriesofplacebo-controlled
studiesof the caandahvaccineswereconductedin infantsandchildren in a dose-escalating fashion, beginning with the 103 TCIDso
dose. After each vaccinewas showntoo be safe at the lowerdose,
lO-fold higher doses were studied sequentially until the dose of 106
TCIDso was reached. Vaccinees who had received a 105 TCIDso
dose of either vaccine were given a second dose of 105 TCIDso of
the homologous reassortant virus 6 weeks to 11 months after the
firstdose. Weinoculatedan additionalgroup of 15seronegative infants and children with lOS TCIDso of ca or ahvaccineviruses or
placebo and used nasopharyngeal swabs instead of nasal washes to
collect specimens for daily viral cultures.
Studies in adults. Healthyadults 18-45 years old who were not
takingmedications, had no history of influenzaimmunization, and
were seronegative (serum hemagglutination inhibition[HAl] antibody titer ~1 :8) to influenza A/Kawasaki/86 (H1N1) virus were
recruited from college campuses and the community.
Volunteers wereexaminedbeforeinoculationanddaily for4 days
afterwards. In adult subjects, influenza-like illness was defined as
the occurrenceof anyof the following signsor symptoms: systemic
illness(myalgia withor withoutchillsor sweating), fever(oraltemperature ~37.7°C), upperrespiratorytract illness(rhinitis or pharyngitis), or lower respiratory tract illness (persistent cough) on ~2
consecutive days.
Studies in infants andchildren. Healthy infants andchildren6-48
months oldwhowereseronegative to influenza A/Kawasaki/86 (HIN1)
virus and did not live with a pregnant or immunodeficient person
wereeligiblefor these studies.Infantsand childrenwereinoculated
after a physicalexaminationand completeblood count were done.
A total of 122infants andchildrenwererandomly assigned to receive
a first dose of ahor ca reassortant vaccineor placebo; 40 received
ah vaccine, 39 ca vaccine, and 43 placebo. The age distributions
were similar in each group: 38% were 6-11 months, 42% 12-23
months, and 20% 24-48 months old.
Infantsand children were observed for 1-2 h daily for 1 daysbefore inoculation and 7-9 days after inoculation. Influenza-like illness occurring in the infantsand children was defined as any of the
following signsor symptoms thatdeveloped within7 days afterinoculation:fever (rectaltemperature ~38.JOC), upper respiratorytractillness (rhinorrhea, pharyngitis, or both), or lower respiratory tract
illness (persistentwheezingor cough)for ~2 consecutive days. An
illness was attributed to influenza A virus when there was laboratory confirmationof influenza A infection.
Virus isolation. Nasal washspecimenswere collectedfor viral
culture as previously described [20, 21] from all subjects, except
for the 15 recipients of a 105 TCIDso dose of ah or ca vaccines or
placebowhohadnasopharyngeal swabs doneinstead ofnasalwashes.
The latter group was not included in the analysis of the virologic
data. Specimensfor influenza virus isolationwere inoculatedonto
MDCK cells, titrated, and identifiedby HAl assayusing influenza
A/Kawasaki/86-specific antiserum [27]. Nasal washspecimensof
ill children were tested for adventitious agentsas described previously [20].
The phenotypicpropertiesofinfluenza A isolatesrecovered from
vaccinees werecharacterized bydetermining the efficiency ofplaque
formationin tissue culture at temperaturespermissiveand restrictive for each vaccine virus, as previously described [20].
Analysisofsera and nasal washes for antibody. An initial serum sample collected from each subject was tested by HAl assay
usinginfluenza A/Kawasaki/86 virusas antigen [27]. Serumandnasal
washspecimens obtainedbeforeinoculation and4 weeksafterwards
weretestedto evaluatesystemic and local antibodyresponses.Each
nasal wash sample was concentrated and the total protein content
was determined as described elsewhere [20, 21].
Influenza-specific antibodies in sera (lgG) and nasalwashes (IgA)
weremeasuredbyELISAas previously described[20,28,29], using
purifiedahinfluenza A/Kawasaki/86 wholevirus(provided byM. H.
Snyder, NationalInstituteofAllergyand Infectious Diseases)as antigen.Specific nasalwash19A antibody titerswerecorrectedforprotein content of the specimen by adjusting to a value of 400 /J,g of
protein/ml [20].
Laboratory evidenceof influenza A H1N1 infectionwas defined
as isolation of influenza A H1N1 virus, a fourfold or greater rise
in titer of serum IgG or nasal wash19A influenza-specific antibodies, or both. Individualswho wereinfectedwith a vaccinevirus are
referred to as vaccine responders.
Statistical analysis. Data from twochildren who did not return
for the daily visitswere excluded from analysesofthe dailyclinical
and virologicresultsbut not fromthe analyses ofimmunologic data.
Student'st test and two-tailed Mann-Whitney U test were used to
compare the means of continuous variables and two-tailed X2 test
or Fisher's exact test to compare categoricalvariablesbetweenthe
groups [30]. The 50%humaninfectious dose (HIDso) wasestimated
bythe methodof Karber[31], withthe assumptionthat the infection
rate for 102 TCIDso of each reassortant virus was O.

significant. While 11 of 17 ahvaccinees shed virus, only 1
of 20 ca vaccinees did so (P<.001, Fisher's exact test). Both

101.5). Upper respiratory symptoms, otitis, or cough did not
seem to be temporally associated with administration of vaccine or with high fever, and the rates of these symptoms in
the vaccinees or placebo recipients were not significantly
different (table 3).
Although not statistically significant with our sample size,
the increase in fever and influenza-like illness in the ca vaccinees who received ~100 HID50 doses suggests that the ca
vaccine retains a mild level of reactogenicity. A much larger
number of subjects is needed to determine the frequency of
less common vaccine-associated side effects.
Phenotypic stability. Evaluation of phenotypic stability
showed that each of the 25 influenza A isolates from 11 ah
vaccinees produced plaques efficiently at 42°C, similar to the
parent avian virus. Likewise, each of 10 isolates recovered
from six ca vaccine recipients retained the characteristic ts
phenotype.
Evaluation of vaccine efficacy against challenge. Eight ah
vaccinees and 9 ca vaccinees who had received a dose of 105
TCID50 6 weeks-ll months previously were revaccinated
with 105 TCID50 of the homologous vaccine virus. The ah
and ca reassortant viruses induced a high level of protection
(100% and 73%, respectively) against reinfection, and both
conferred complete protection against viral shedding (table
4); in vaccinees the protection lasted up to 11 months after
vaccination (table 4).

Discussion
The ah influenza A/Kawasaki/86 reassortant was attenuated and safein adultsbut was associated with an unacceptably high rate of febrile reactions when given at a dose of
~100 HIDsoto seronegative infants and children. The apparent doseeffect, the temporalrelationship to inoculation, and
the association offever with shedding ofvaccine virus all indicatethat the ah A/Kawasaki/86 (HINl)reassortant caused
the febrile responses. In contrast, the ca reassortant, which
sharedthe sameHAand NAsurface glycoproteins andwhich
demonstrated similarlevels ofinfectivity andimmunogenicity, was associated with rates of reactions not significantly
different fromthoseseenin placebo recipients. Lower respiratorytractillness andotherillnesses were notassociated with
inoculation witheitherreassortant, indicating thatbothviruses
were attenuated in the lower respiratory tract.
The ah and ca influenza A/Kawasaki/86 (HINl) reassortant viruseswere30-60 timesmore infectious forseronegativeinfants andchildren thanwere theinfluenza A/Bethesda/85
(H3N2) reassortants thathadthesamesixRNA segments codingforinternal proteins [20]. Among fully susceptible infants
and children, the HIDso of caHINIreassortants seems lower
(1()2.LIQ3·s TCIDso) [15] thanthatreported for ca H3N2 reassortants(104.4 and 104.6) [18, 20]. This observation has also
been madein seronegative adults[11] and supports the conceptthat the HA and NA glycoproteins are importantdeterminants of infectivity of influenza A viruses for humans.
Previous evaluations of reassortant viruses derived from
theinfluenza A/Mallard/New Yorkl6750178 donorvirushave
shown theyweresafe, attenuated, andphenotypically stable.
In squirrel monkeys, the ah reassortants were restricted in
replication in both upper and lowerrespiratory tracts comparedwith wild-type influenza virus [32]. Earlierstudies in
a total of 366 seronegative adults demonstrated that the six
transferrable A/Mallard/78 RNA segments conferred satisfactory attenuation to reassortants derived fromtwo wild-type
influenza A HINIsubtypes (influenza A/California/l0178 and
A/Texas/l/85) and three H3N2 subtypes (A/Washington/
897/80, A/Koreall/82, andAlBethesda/1/85) [11, 21-23]. Moreover, our previous studies in seronegative infants and children givendosesas high as 107 TCIDso(>200 HIDso) of the
ah influenza A/Bethesda/85 H3N2 reassortantshowed noreactogenicity [20]. Theunanticipated febrile reactions associated
with the phenotypically stable ah influenza A/Kawasaki/86
reassortants and the experience with other candidate virus
vaccines [33-36] emphasizes the valueof careful evaluation
of candidate vaccine viruses in susceptible infants and children as the critical test of attenuation.
The differences in reactogenicity observed between the
HINIandH3N2ah reassortants clearly indicatesthatHAand
NA surfaceglycoproteins modify not only the infectivity of
a vaccine virus but also the level of attenuation specified by
the attenuating genes. Avariety ofmechanisms mightaccount
for our observations, including different interactions of the
A/Kawasaki/86 HAandNAgenes withthegenesoftheavian
A/Mallard/78 virus and thoseof the ca A/Ann Arbor/60virus. The attenuating genes of the A/Mallardl78 virus have
been identified in squirrelmonkeys as those coding for the
membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (NP) gene products [37].
Either (or both)of thesegeneproducts isthought to interact
withthesurface glycoproteins during theprocess ofviralbudding[38].It ispossible thattheA/Mallardl78 MandNPproteins were able to interactmore efficiently with the HA and
NAglycoproteins of the HINI parent than with thoseof the
H3N2 parent. The resulting enhanced efficiency of the buddingprocess would resultina higherlevel ofviralreplication
and a higher frequency of illness. In contrast, three of the
fourattenuating genes oftheA/Ann Arbor/6/60 caviruscode
for the polymerase proteins [39], which are not thought to
directly interactwiththe surface glycoproteins. Ifthisspeculation is correct, it would be reasonable to suggest that attenuating mutations in live attenuated influenza A donor
virusesshould be sought in those genes whose products do
not interact with the surface glycoproteins. In this way, the
effect ofthe interaction between thesurface glycoproteins and
the attenuating genes could be minimized.
The ca influenza A/AnnArbor/6/60 (H2N2) donor virus
has an excellent history of reproducibly conferring characteristics of satisfactory attenuation, immunogenicity, and
phenotypic stability to newinfluenza variants in adults [6-11]
andinfants andchildren [12-20]. Thepresentstudyconfirms
the satisfactory attenuation in adults, infants, andchildrenof
the careassortant derived fromthe influenza A/Kawasaki/86
(HINI) wild-type virus. Efficacy studies using ca influenza
A HINI andH3N2 reassortant vaccines in seronegative childrenare needed, in addition to assessment of thesevaccines
in infants <6 months old. If ca influenza A reassortants are
efficacious in thesepopulations, live attenuated ca influenza
vaccines may be usefulin seronegative infants and children
as well as in adults.
