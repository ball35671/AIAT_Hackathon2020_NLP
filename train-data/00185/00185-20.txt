Abstract
Reported is a study of live, cold-adapted (CA) reassortant mono-, di-, and trivalent influenza type A and B vaccines in a series of controlled clinical and epidemiological investigations involving nearly 130 000 children aged 3-15 years. The results of clinical, immunological, and morbidity investigations of the vaccinees and a control group over 6-months' follow-up indicated that the vaccines were completely attenuated by the children. Transient febrile reactions occurred in < 1% of the children after vaccination, including double seronegative individuals with low antibody titres. The type A reisolates examined were genetically stable. The reassortants did not suppress each other after simultaneous inoculation of children and stimulated antibody response to influenza virus strains A1, A3, and B. The incidence of influenza-like diseases was approximately 30-40% lower among the vaccinated group than among the control group. The study demonstrates, for the first time, the efficacy of CA vaccine against infections caused by influenza B virus.
