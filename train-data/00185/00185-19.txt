Children aged 7-14 years in Novgorod, Russia, were given Russian live cold-adapted or inactivated influenza vaccines or placebo over a 2-year period. Schools were randomly assigned as a
whole to one ofthe preparations. In the first year, the vaccines were bivalent, containing types A
(H3N2) and A (HINI) components. In the second year, the vaccines also contained a type B
component. In the first year, all viruses isolated were type A (H3N2); in the second, about
three-quarters of the isolates were type B and the rest type A (HINI). During both years, the
vaccines protected the vaccinated children. Where significant differences existed, the live attenuated vaccine was more protective than the inactivated. Vaccination rates in schools in which live
attenuated vaccines had been used were inversely related to illness rates ofstaff and unvaccinated
children, suggesting that viral transmission had been reduced by the vaccine.
Inactivated influenza vaccine has been used in North
America not to control virus spread and morbidity but to
prevent severe complications in the elderly and those with
chronic diseases [1]. Other countries have addressed the
problem differently in their vaccine recommendations. The
policy in Japan has been to attempt control of influenza
transmission in the community by administering inactivated
vaccine to school-aged children [2]. Most of the rest of the
world has not taken this approach, as it would involve annual use of an injected preparation [3, 4]. Development ofa
live attenuated intranasal vaccine has allowed the former Soviet Union to contemplate widespread vaccination ofschoolchildren [5]. Such a vaccine will have a number of advantages, including ease ofadministration. We present results of
a 2-year study in Novgorod, Russia, in which children 7-14
years old in >30 schools were given live attenuated vaccine,
inactivated vaccine, or placebo. Direct effects ofthe program
on the vaccinated and indirect effects ofthe program on the
unvaccinated are described.

Materials and Methods
Location of trial and vaccination program. Novgorod is in
northwest Russia, located 150 km southeast of S1. Petersburg,
with a population of--250,000. The trial was conducted among
school-aged children in the city with the collaboration of the
local health department and the school system. During the 2-
year period, there were 34 schools with children 7-14 years old
in the city and suburbs. In 1989, personnel of the Institute of
Experimental Medicine and the D. I. Ivanovsky Institute ofVirology contacted staff of the Novgorod Region and City Health
Departments for permission to conduct the study. All investigators, American and Russian, explained the purpose and plan to
these officials and members of the school system. Lists were
provided ofthe schools, their locations, and their enrollments so
that each could be randomly assigned as a whole to one of the
vaccines or to the placebo preparation. The assignment process
was structured so that the different geographic regions ofthe city
would be represented in each vaccination group. The school
assignment remained the same throughout the study, but new
schools not previously participating were introduced in year 2.
Children in classes in which the age was 7-14 years were
eligible for participation and parents were informed about the
evaluation. Each year, groups of children were vaccinated in
advance of the study to confirm lack of reactogenicity and appropriate immunogenicity. These children were bled before vaccination and 4 weeks after the final vaccination had been given.
They were visited daily for the first 4 days after inoculation, at
which time temperature (axillary) and symptoms (if present)
were recorded.
The main vaccination program was begun in mid-October of
each year. In year 1, a total of 30 schools participated in the
study, of which 10 were in the live attenuated group, 9 in the
inactivated vaccine group, and 11 in the placebo group. In year
 at Monash University on November 26, 2014 http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from 
882 Rudenko et al. lID 1993; 168 (October)
2, the numbers, respectively, were 14, 9, and 11. Six of these
schools comprised students who had not participated in the previous year, and 1 each of the inactivated vaccine and placebo
schools had dropped out. Children in schools assigned to receive
inactivated vaccine were further subdivided by age: Children
7-10 years old received an inactivated vaccine preparation that
was more highly purified than the inactivated vaccine preparation given to children I 1-14 years old. In year I, the placebo
group ofschools was also divided into two groups, with half of
the schools assigned to an intranasal placebo and half to an
injected placebo.
Vaccines and schedule ofadministration. The live attenuated
vaccines were reassortants derived from A/Leningrad/I 34/47/
57 (H2N2) and B/USSR/60/69 cold-adapted donor strains [5].
They were manufactured and licensed for use in the former
USSR. Infectivity was determined in Moscow and Leningrad. In
year 1, no type B component was included, and the wild-type
parents of the type A vaccines were A/Sichuan/2/87 (H3N2)-
like and A/Taiwan/l/86 (H IN I)-like viruses. In year 2, the
wild-type viruses were A/Shanghai/I 1/87 (H3N2)-like, A/Taiwan/I/86 (HINI)-like, and B/Victoria/2/87-like. These vaccines contained ~6.25 loglo median EIDso per 0.2 mL. They
had the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes from the wildtype parents and all other genes from the cold-adapted parent.
The inactivated vaccines were undisrupted whole virus preparations inactivated by formalin. Bivalent vaccines were used in
year I and trivalent vaccines in year 2. The strains used were
similar antigenically to the wild parents of the live attenuated
preparations described above. The vaccines were evaluated for
potency and antigenic characteristics in the appropriate national
establishments for vaccine control in the former USSR and the
United States. The inactivated vaccines used for the 7-10 years
group had been chromatographically purified, while those given
to older children were whole virus preparations. According to
the Center for Biologics and Evaluation Research (Food and
Drug Administration, Bethesda, MD), these vaccines contain
acceptable amounts offree formaldehyde but variable amounts
of endotoxin. In year I, the hemagglutinin content was -- 3-8
I-Lg for each component; in year 2, it was --7-10 I-Lg. Placebos
were prepared from normal allantoic fluid handled in the same
way as vaccines and packaged similarly.
The live attenuated vaccine was administered by intranasal
spray in two doses 3 weeks apart. Inactivated vaccine was administered subcutaneously in year 1and intramuscularly in year
2. To ensure blinding, the placebo group was divided during the
first year so that children in about half of the schools received
intranasal placebo twice, while half received injected placebo
once. In year 2, despite the continued use of disposible equipment for injection, it was not possible to obtain approval for an
injected placebo. Thus, all placebo in that year was given intranasally. The students participating in the program were monitored for 7 days after each inoculation by examining school absences with medical certification as an index of reactogenicity.
Surveillance of influenza outbreaks and data collection. In
Russia, each schoolchild returning after an absence due to an
illness must bring a certificate from the polyclinic with a medical
explanation. Starting in mid-October, the nurse in each participating school began to monitor illnesses recorded as acute respiratory disease on medical certificates. A series ofspecific respiratory diagnoses was used. Since most illnesses were termed
respiratory illness or influenza, any illness with one of these
respiratory diagnoses was considered a case. Follow-up investigation with the polyclinics was made in cases for which no medical certificate was provided after an absence. When acute respiratory disease increased, virologic surveillance was started. In
general, specimens from at least 5 children (pre- and postillness
blood and nasal swab) were collected per week to identity influenza viruses.
Each year of the study, data were entered for each student
indicating school and class attended, date ofvaccination(s), and
a code for type ofpreparation received. Thereafter, illness information was entered on the basis ofweek of onset. It was linked
with vaccination records using the identifying code number assigned to each student at the time ofvaccination. Illness data on
nonvaccinated students and staff were collected in year 2.
Data analysis. Illnesses were analyzed according to the epidemic period as determined by virus isolation, serology, and
epidemic curves. For data analysis, presence of one or more
respiratory illnesses in the epidemic period was counted as one
outcome, and no respiratory illness during that period was the
other outcome. This method was used to avoid the lack ofindependence associated with counting multiple illnesses separately.
Age-specific comparisons were made between the vaccinated
and placebo groups. A child receiving vaccine or placebo was
included for analysis only ifhe or she received the full schedule
of doses. The two subgroups receiving parenteral and intranasal
placebos in year I were combined for analysis. Efficacy was
calculated as I minus the risk ratio, and 95% confidence intervals were determined.
Analysis was also done by school, as all those vaccinated in a
single school received the same vaccine or placebo. An attack
rate by age group was calculated for the vaccinated children in
each school to give an overall measure. The Wilcoxon rank sum
test was used to compare illness rates between live attenuated
vaccine and placebo schools and between inactivated vaccine
and placebo schools. The test was done so that each school was
treated as a unit and contributed equal weight.
In year 2, data were also collected on whether unvaccinated
children and school staff had experienced one or more illnesses
during the epidemic period. Effect ofoverall vaccination rates in
schools in which children had received one ofthe two vaccines
or placebo on the illness frequencies ofthese two unvaccinated
groups was evaluated by using linear regression. The slopes and
95% confidence intervals around the slope were determined as
an indicator of the indirect effect of vaccines in protecting the
unvaccinated contacts.
Laboratory tests. Hemagglutinin-inhibition (HI) tests were
done in Moscow to identify change in antibody titer. Tests for
vaccine immunogenicity were done using paired samples collected from the subgroup immunized before the main vaccination program began; the HI tests were also used to identity those
infected during the period of virus circulation. Antigens used
were those contained in the vaccine. Standard methods for HI
were used, including treatment ofserum specimens with receptor-destroying enzyme [6]. A rise in titer was considered to have
occurred if there was a fourfold change or if antibody in the

postvaccination specimen was I:20 following a prevaccination
titer of <1:10.
Influenza virus isolation was done in the laboratory of the
regional health department. Embryonated eggs were used, and
hemagglutinating isolates were identified as influenza using
standard diagnostic sera provided by the Ivanovsky Institute.
Isolates were further characterized by HI there and, in part, at
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention using postinfection ferret serum.
Results
Reactogenicity and immunogenicity of vaccines. Each
year, children in one or more schools were vaccinated in
advance to assess reactogenicity and immunogenicity. At
least 100 children were assigned to each group. In 1989, I
(0.6%) of 162 had low-grade fever «38.5°C) after receiving
live vaccine. No fever was observed in recipients of either
placebo or inactivated whole virus vaccine, and no local induration at the injection site was observed in the latter group.
In 1990, low-grade fever was observed in 2 (0.6%) of 323 live
attenuated vaccine recipients and in 2 (0.7%) of278 placebo
recipients. In contrast, 5 (1.8%) of 271 inactivated vaccine
recipients in age group 7-10 years developed low-grade fever
and 3 (1.1 %) induration. Eight (1.8%) of the 435 children
who were 11-14 years old developed low-grade fever after
receiving the inactivated vaccine. An additional 3 (0.7%) developed fever of~38.5°C and 17 (3.9%) demonstrated induration. Inactivated vaccine had been administered subcutaneously throughout year 1 and in the initial phase of year 2.
Among other possible reasons for the number of reactions
observed, in addition to route ofinjection, was the increased
total hemagglutinin content in the inactivated vaccines given
in year 2, which now contained a type B component. The
higher reactogenicity among the older children may also be
related to use ofa less purified vaccine. Therefore, the inactivated vaccine was administered intramuscularly during the
remainder of year 2 with reduction in reactogenicity evident
through monitoring postvaccination absenteeism.
Blood specimens were collected before and after the final
vaccination (two doses for the intranasal preparations) from
a subset of the above children to evaluate immunogenicity.
Results are shown in table 1 for both years; for year 2, this
analysis is restricted to first-time vaccines. In previous studies, response to live attenuated vaccines as measured by HI
antibody has generally not been as dramatic as to inactivated
vaccine, despite efficacy being demonstrated [7]. This phenomenon is more apparent (table 1) among those with prior
antibody titer. Among those with little or no antibody, there
was no consistent difference between responses to live and
inactivated vaccines. The inactivated vaccine results are separated by age because different vaccines were used in these
age groups. The hemagglutinin content in these vaccines was
somewhat lower than that used in the United States, which
may partially explain the findings. Ofinterest is the response
in 1990 to the trivalent live attenuated vaccines. With the
two-dose schedule, there did not seem to be interference demonstrated between type A and B viruses. The results with the
placebo are within the range of experimental error.
Evaluation of vaccine efficacy, 1989-1990. The 1989-
1990 outbreak of influenza in Novgorod was exclusively A
(H3N2) in etiology. As in most ofthe rest ofthe world, isolates from western Russia were A/Shanghai/l 1/87 (H3N2)-
like. These viruses were related to but could be distinguished
from the A/Sichuan/2/87-like viruses contained in the vaccine [8]. Figure 1 shows the epidemic curve of respiratory
illnesses during the period and the numbers of specimens
isolated. The first isolate was made from a specimen collected on 15 January 1990, and isolations continued through
22 February 1990. Incidence of respiratory illnesses inTable 1. Hemagglutination-inhibition antibody responses of children vaccinated for the first time in vaccine or placebo groups.

creased in early January and decreased in March. Thus, the
period used to determine frequency of influenza-associated
illness was from the week of I January to 4 March 1990 (9
weeks).
Table 2 compares the age-specific illness attack rates of
each vaccination group with those ofthe placebo group. Protective efficacy is calculated as 1 minus the risk ratio. Since
all respiratory illnesses that occurred in this period (including many that are not likely to be influenza) are included,
this calculation should be viewed as a minimal estimate of
the ability ofthe vaccines to prevent influenza and more as a
way of comparing the efficacy of different preparations. In
the 7-10 years group, the live attenuated vaccine was 30.0%
effective in preventing respiratory illness, while the inactivated vaccine was 24.2% effective. As can be seen from the
confidence intervals, while those estimates indicated statistically significant protection (confidence intervals do not include zero), they are not significantly different from each
other. In contrast, in the older group, the efficacy ofthe live
attenuated vaccine was significantly higher (51.9%) than that
ofthe inactivated vaccine (19.6%). Again, both were significantly different from results with the placebo.
Schools were assigned as a whole to one ofthe two vaccine
groups or placebo, and differences in overall illness attack
rates during the influenza periods were also compared. In
this analysis, for each school, an attack rate was constructed
from the illness occurrence in the completely vaccinated or
placebo-recipient children; the attack rates for schools whose
students received live or inactivated vaccine were compared,
by using the Wilcoxon rank sum test, with attack rates in the
schools assigned to placebo. The differences between the illness attack rates in the live vaccinated and placebo schools
for children who received vaccine were highly statistically
significant in both age groups; in contrast, for the inactivated
vaccines, the difference was statistically significant only at P
= .04 level for the 7-10 years group (table 3).

strains. Isolation of viruses was limited by the availability of
embryonated eggs; as can be seen in figure 2, about threequarters ofthe isolates were type Band the remainder type A
(H IN I). The type B strains were either B/Yamagata/16/88-
or B/Victoria/II/87-like, while the type A (H IN I) viruses
resembled A/Taiwan/ 1/86. Illness frequency increased gradually in mid-January, and the peak period lasted through
March. The epidemic period for analysis was thus defined as
lasting from 14 January through 24 March 1991 (II weeks).
Attack rates of respiratory illnesses during this period for
children receiving one of the two vaccines or placebo were
again compared. In the 7-10 years group, efficacy ofthe live
vaccine was 39.5%, significantly higher than the 27.3% seen
with inactivated vaccines (table 4). For the 11-14 years
group, differences between the vaccines were not statistically
significant, but both were significantly different from zero.
The collective protective effect ofthe vaccines on illnesses of
vaccinated children in particular schools was also evaluated
by the Wilcoxon rank sum test (table 5). Differences between overall illness rates in the vaccine and placebo schools
Table 4. Vaccine efficacy for completely vaccinated children, 14
January through 24 March 1991.
were all statistically significant. However, as before, the P
values were greater for the live vaccine versus placebo
schools than for the inactiva.ted vaccine versus placebo
schools; with similar sample sizes, this is an indication ofthe
difference in attack rates.
Effect of vaccination on the unvaccinated. All the above
analyses compared individual children or groups of children
given the vaccines with placebo recipients. In each school,
additional children did not receive vaccine or placebo. Staff
were also unvaccinated and were exposed to both vaccinated
and unvaccinated children. Data were collected in 1990-
1991 on the respiratory illnesses of these two unvaccinated
groups during the influenza season. Ifvaccinating large numbers of children had an effect on the probability ofinfection
of the unvaccinated, that indirect effect would be related to
the proportion ofschoolchildren who were vaccinated. The
relationship of the summary illness rate for each school to
the percentage ofchildren vaccinated in that school was evaluated using linear regression. An example of this regression

is shown in figure 3 for staff in schools in which students
received live attenuated vaccines. The slope indicates a clear
relationship, with higher levels of vaccination resulting in
lower levels of illness in the staff. Table 6 shows the slopes
({3) and correlation coefficients (r 2
) ofeach ofthese analyses.
In only two situations was a significant slope found (i.e., one
not including zero in the confidence interval). The first was
the relationship in live attenuated vaccine schools ofpercentage of children vaccinated to staff illness (figure 3); the second was the independent relationship of percentage of children vaccinated to the illness rates of unvaccinated students
in the same schools. No such relationship was demonstrable
for either the inactivated vaccine or placebo schools. This
suggests that live vaccine was able to affect transmission in
the school, indirectly protecting the unvaccinated students
and staff. This "herd immunity" effect is the aim of national
vaccination strategies in which children are regularly vaccinated.

Discussion
It has been recognized for many years that school-aged
children have among the highest infection and illness rates
for all influenza types and subtypes, which has resulted in
the proposal that attempts at control ofinfluenza morbidity
should involve this age group [9-12]. This approach would
protect them directly through use of vaccines or possibly antiviral medications. It would also ideally protect others indirectly through reduction ofinfection in this age group. Such
indirect reduction in probability ofinfection has been documented by computer simulation to be a likely outcome of
reducing infection rates in the school-aged group; the magnitude of the decrease will depend on the role these children
play in transmission, which can vary [13]. A practical demonstration ofthis approach to reducing virus transmission and
the rate of influenza-like illness was done in Tecumseh,
Michigan, with type A (H3N2) influenza during the 1968-
1969 pandemic. The vaccine used in that situation was inactivated, and overall 85% of the school-aged children in the
entire community were vaccinated. The result was a threefold reduction in the rate ofinfluenza-like illness in Tecumseh in comparison with another community [14].
In Novgorod, a much larger city, the design was quite different, with two vaccines and placebo used and considerable
variation in vaccination rates within schools. In this situation, all vaccines exhibited significant efficacy, but with the
large number of children involved, it was not possible to use
laboratory methods to identify influenza illnesses specifically. Any respiratory illness occurring during the period of
influenza activity was assumed to be possible clinical influenza. The efficacy calculations are therefore diluted by cases
of noninfluenza respiratory illnesses, which would be ex·
pected to occur equally in the vaccinated and placebo
groups. Thus, the efficacy determinations should be viewed
as minimal estimates and used more for comparison ofdifferent vaccines than to predict the proportion of laboratory-

confirmed influenza likely to be prevented. In both individual and school-based comparisons, the live attenuated vaccines given as two doses appeared to be more protective than
the inactivated vaccines given once. The differences in the
level ofprotection were more consistent in analysis by school
than by individual children, although the differences seen in
the latter also favored the live attenuated vaccine. Other studies using the American cold-adapted influenza vaccines in
children or adults have shown either no difference with inactivated vaccine or have favored the live attenuated vaccine,
as have small studies using the Russian vaccines [15-17].
The school-level analysis was done because all children in a
single school received the same preparation. Thus, the overall effect on illnesses in a particular school becomes another
indicator of vaccine effect. This analysis was unweighted by
size ofschool, as large schools already contributed more to
the individual level analysis.
An indirect effect ofvaccination on unvaccinated students
and staff was found only in schools whose students had received live attenuated vaccines. This was somewhat unexpected, as an indirect effect in Tecumseh, Michigan, had
been produced with inactivated vaccine in an unprimed population. The difference may relate to the proportion vaccinated. In Tecumseh, 85% ofschool-aged children were vaccinated; in Novgorod, the proportion was generally lower,
ranging from 95% to 23%. The Japanese experience with inactivated vaccine also suggests that a high level of vaccination is required to produce an indirect protective effect [18].
This advantage oflive attenuated vaccine can at least theoretically be related to its ability to produce secretory IgA antibody and reduce viral shedding [19-21].
The results ofthis study indicate the feasibility of controlling influenza in the community by vaccinating school-aged
children. In a two-dose schedule, the Russian live attenuated
vaccine protected against type A (H3N2) disease in year I. It
also was protective in a mainly type B outbreak in year 2,
when a trivalent vaccine was used. While these data directly
apply to the Russian vaccine, it is not unreasonable to expect
other live attenuated preparations to behave similarly. Thus,
as the live attenuated influenza vaccines become available
more generally worldwide, it may at last be possible to affect
individual and community morbidity through vaccination of
school-aged children.
