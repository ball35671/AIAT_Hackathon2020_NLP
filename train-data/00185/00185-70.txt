Abstract
This study was carried out to investigate the effectiveness of influenza vaccine among 2913 children (1512 vaccinees and 1401 nonvaccinees)
under 6 years of age during the 2002–2003 season. Study subjects were recruited from 54 paediatric clinics, located in eight areas in Japan.
Maximum body temperatures were obtained weekly from parents between 2002 December 16 and 2003 April 13. Influenza-like illness (ILI)
was defined as an acute febrile illness (≥38.0 ◦C) during the peak epidemic period in each study area. The vaccine antigens included were A/New
Caledonia/20/99(H1N1), A/Panama/2007/99(H3N2) and B/Shandong/7/97. Vaccine effectiveness was analyzed by comparing the frequencies
of ILI between vaccinees and nonvaccinees. The adjusted odds ratio (OR) and its 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were calculated by the
proportional odds model using logistic regression with three-level outcome variables (<38.0/38.0–38.9/≥39.0 ◦C). A significantly decreased
OR of vaccination was observed (OR: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.66–0.88), corresponding to a vaccine effectiveness (1-OR) of 24% (95% CI: 12%–34%).
When the analysis was confined to those aged ≥2 years, a more pronounced OR (0.67, 0.56–0.79) was obtained with a vaccine effectiveness
of 33% (21%–44%). On the other hand, no significant vaccine effectiveness was detected among very young children; the ORs were 1.84
(0.81–4.19) for those <1 year of age and 0.99 (0.72–1.36) for those 1.0–1.9 years of age and 1.07 (0.80–1.44) when these two age groups
were combined. Thus, among very young children vaccine effectiveness could not be demonstrated.

1. Introduction
Epidemics of influenza occur almost annually and contribute to hospitalizations and outpatient visits in all age
groups, especially in people at high risk of complications
from this disease.
Recently it was reported that healthy children less than
2 years of age have high hospitalization rates that are, in
fact, similar to the rates among older adults for whom annual
influenza vaccination is recommended [1–3]. In October
2003, the US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended that influenza vaccine be administered to
all children aged 6–23 months from the 2004–2005 season,

after encouraging the use of influenza vaccines in this age
group for the 2002–2003 season [4,5].
Although previous studies have investigated the efficacy of
influenza vaccine among young children [6–9], their results
are not consistent. Controversy also exists about the use of
influenza vaccine in young children without high-risk conditions. Therefore, this study was conducted to assess the
effectiveness of influenza vaccine among children under 6
years of age during the 2002–2003 season.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Study subjects
The study subjects were children under 6 years of age
who were recruited from the 54 paediatric clinics located

in eight different areas in Japan: Hokkaido (2 clinics, 395
subjects), Iwate (11 clinics, 379 subjects), Tokyo (6 clinics,
386 subjects), Mie (7 clinics, 353 subjects), Osaka (12 clinics,
325 subjects), Shikoku (10 clinics, 399 subjects), Fukuoka (4
clinics, 397 subjects) and Okinawa (2 clinics, 300 subjects)
between 2002 October 1 and 2002 December 15. A total of
2934 children (1521 vaccinees and 1413 nonvaccinees) were
enrolled in this study.
At each clinic, children who received vaccine on parental
request were entered into the vaccinated group. Then,
one or two children, who visited the paediatrician subsequent to each vaccinee and whose parents did not
request to have their children vaccinated, were enrolled
into the unvaccinated group. Vaccinations were performed
using commercial inactivated influenza vaccine containing
A/New Caledonia/20/99(H1N1), A/Panama/2007/99(H3N2)
and B/Shandong/7/97. These vaccines contained 30g of
haemagglutinin per 1.0 ml from each strain. Two doses of
vaccine were given subcutaneously 2–4 weeks apart. Each
dose was 0.1 ml for children under 1 year of age, while for
children 1 year of age and older, each dose was 0.2 ml, in
accordance with the standard recommendations for vaccine
use in Japan. Informed consent to participate in the study
was obtained from all parent(s) or guardian(s), even though
no intervention was involved. This study was approved by
the institutional review board associated with the Osaka City
University Graduate School of Medicine.
2.2. Information collection
Three kinds of data were collected for each subject. Two
kinds of data, physical and environmental characteristics,
as well as health-related conditions, were collected for use
as baseline data, while weekly maximum body temperature was collected as part of the attack survey. Physical and
environmental information was obtained by means of selfadministered questionnaires that were completed by parents
or guardians at the time of enrolment. The questionnaires
gathered information about: date of birth; gestational age (six
categories); birth weight (six categories); preschool attendance; number of family members and number of siblings;
number of rooms and total room space of the residence; disease onset during the previous influenza season and history
of hospitalization; and influenza vaccinations within the last
3 years.
Information on the following health-related conditions of
each child was collected from his or her paediatrician by
using a structured questionnaire: vaccination status; vaccine
manufacturer and lot number if vaccinated; current body
weight; physician visits within previous 6 months (for cold
symptoms, otitis media, digestive symptoms or other reasons); underlying conditions (i.e., heart disease, renal disease,
diabetes mellitus, anaemia, bronchitis, tonsillitis, urticaria,
atopy, allergy, other); and long-term treatment with corticosteroids or aspirin. These questionnaires were filled out before
2002 December 16.
With respect to the attack survey, the parents were
requested to fill out a postal questionnaire in which the child’s
maximum body temperature during the preceding week was
to be indicated using one of eight categories (<37.0 ◦C and
37.0 to ≥40.0 ◦C by 0.5 ◦C intervals). This questionnaire was
to be returned each week to the paediatrician’s office for 17
weeks, from the 51st week of 2002 (December 16–22) to the
15th week of 2003 (April 7–13).
2.3. Viral surveillance
The National Epidemiological Surveillance of Infectious
Diseases in Japan provides weekly reports on the numbers
of clinically diagnosed influenza cases based on data from
influenza sentinels, consisting of 4824 clinics (3025 paediatricians and 1799 general physicians) as of 2002 January 1. If
specimens are collected from patients with clinical influenza,
they are sent to prefectural and municipal public health laboratories (PHLs) for virus isolation.
Influenza virus isolations during the 2002–2003 season in
Japan were reported between the 46th week of 2002 (November 11–17) and the 23rd week of 2003 (June 2–8), with the
first epidemic peak of AH3 in the 4th week of 2003 (January 20–26) and the second peak of type B in the 6th week
(February 3–9) [10]. During the season, influenza virus isolates at PHLs across the whole country included 4850 type
AH3 (66%), 2451 type B (34%), and only 1 type AH1 [10].
Both the AH3 and B virus isolates were antigenically similar to the vaccine strains. The number of reported cases and
virus isolates showed that the largest epidemic since 1999
had occurred during the 2002–2003 season [10].
2.4. Case definition and epidemic
An influenza-like illness (ILI) was defined as an acute
febrile illness that occurred during the highest epidemic
period of influenza in each study area. This period was
determined by using the following two surveillance data in
each area [11–13]: the weekly number of clinical influenza
cases reported by the sentinels; and the weekly number of
influenza virus isolates at the PHLs. Eventually, the highest epidemic period in each study area was defined to be
7-week-long. This period was earliest in Fukuoka (southwest Japan), from the 51st week of 2002 to the 5th week of
2003, and the latest in Iwate (north-east Japan), from the 5th
to the 11th week of 2003. All subjects were classified into
three categories according to the highest body temperature
reported during the epidemic peak: non-disease with fever
<38.0 ◦C; ILI with fever 38.0–38.9 ◦C; and ILI with fever
≥39.0 ◦C.
2.5. Data analyses
The proportion of subjects with various characteristics
was compared between vaccinees and nonvaccinees using
chi-squared or Fisher’s exact test. For continuous variables,
M. Fujieda et al. / Vaccine 24 (2006) 957–963 959
the Wilcoxon rank-sum test was employed. To assess vaccine effectiveness independent of confounding factors, the
adjusted odds ratio (OR) and its 95% confidence interval
(95% CI) were calculated by a proportional odds model or a
binary model on logistic regression [14]. Vaccine effectiveness is equivalent to one minus the OR. For adjustment, age
was included in the model as a categorical variable (0–5 years
of age by 1 year intervals) rather than as a continuous variable
in order to simultaneously control the vaccine dose by age.
These calculations were all conducted using the Statistical
Analysis System (SAS, Version 8.2) [15].
3. Results
Data from a total of 2913 subjects were analyzed since 21
from among the initial 2934 children were excluded due to
non-participation in the attack survey. To compare vaccinees
and nonvaccinees, the baseline characteristics with statistically significant difference are shown in Table 1. Factors that
were thought to decrease the risk of disease, such as older
age, heavier body weight, smaller family size, fewer siblings,
and previous vaccinations, were observed more frequently in
the vaccinated group. However, children attending preschool
who have an increased risk of virus exposure were also more
frequent in the vaccinated group.
Among the total subjects, 1304 (44.8%) contracted ILI
with fever ≥38.0 ◦C (19.1% with a fever of 38.0–38.9 ◦C and
25.7% with fever of ≥39.0 ◦C). Among the 1512 vaccinees,
41.2% contracted ILI with fever ≥38.0 ◦C (18.5% with a
fever of 38.0–38.9 ◦C and 22.7% with fever of ≥39.0 ◦C),
while among the 1401 nonvaccinees, 48.6% contracted ILI
with fever ≥38.0 ◦C (19.6% with a fever of 38.0–38.9 ◦C and
29.0% with fever of ≥39.0 ◦C).
In the first analysis, ORs for ILI were calculated using a
proportional odds model with a three-level outcome variable
(maximum body temperature: <38.0, 38.0–38.9, ≥39.0 ◦C)
(Table 2). The model included six explanatory variables (vaccination, age, number of siblings, physician visits for cold
symptoms within the last 6 months, disease onset in the previous season, and preschool attendance). When analyzed as
an entire sample, the adjusted OR of vaccinees decreased
significantly to 0.76 (95% CI: 0.66–0.88). Thus, vaccine
effectiveness was estimated to be 24% (95% CI: 12%–34%).
To consider the fluctuation in vaccine efficacy by study
area, an additional calculation was performed in the model
including dummy variables discriminating eight areas.
Nearly the same OR (0.75, 0.64–0.87) was obtained after

adjusting for study area. The adjusted ORs calculated by area
ranged from 0.49 to 1.02, and were less than unity except for
Osaka. A significantly decreased OR was observed in Tokyo
(OR: 0.49). The crude ORs were less than unity in all study
areas.
During the highest epidemic period, the number of type A
(H3) and B isolates, respectively, out of total samples submitted to PHLs in each study area were 163 (55%) and 15 (5%)
out of 298 in Hokkaido, 60 (43%) and 40 (28%) out of 141 in
Iwate, 111 (36%) and 29 (9%) out of 312 in Tokyo, 127 (30%)
and 19 (5%) out of 419 in Mie, 40 (61%) and 15 (23%) out of
66 in Osaka, 224 (49%) and 111 (24%) out of 460 in Shikoku,
58 (45%) and 4 (3%) out of 130 in Fukuoka, and 49 (68%) and
7 (10%) out of 72 in Okinawa. To assess the relation between
adjusted OR and circulating virus type, study areas were categorised into two groups according to the proportion of type
B viruses isolated. The adjusted ORs in the study areas with
a relatively higher circulation of type B viruses, i.e., >20%
of total samples, where the isolations of type A viruses were
43%–61%; it as 0.70 (0.46–1.08) in Iwate, 1.02 (0.64–1.64)
in Osaka and 0.83 (0.55–1.26) in Shikoku. The OR combined for these three areas, adjusted in the same model as in
the first analysis, was 0.83 (0.65–1.06). On the other hand,
in study areas with lower circulation of type B viruses, i.e.,
less than 10%, where the percentage of type A virus isolates were 30%–68%, adjusted ORs were 0.76 (0.49–1.18)
in Hokkaido, 0.49 (0.32–0.75) in Tokyo, 0.72 (0.45–1.14) in
Mie, 0.93 (0.63–1.38) in Fukuoka and 0.68 (0.40–1.15) in
Okinawa. The adjusted OR combined for these four areas
in the same way as above was 0.73 (0.61–0.88). Somewhat
smaller ORs were obtained in the latter four areas than the
former three areas, but no clear relation between adjusted
ORs and predominant virus type was indicated.
In the second analysis, ORs were calculated using binary
models with three combinations of two-level outcomes
(<38.0 ◦C versus ≥38.0 ◦C, <39.0 ◦C versus ≥39.0 ◦C, and
<38.0 ◦C versus ≥39.0 ◦C). In these computations, the same
explanatory variables as those in the above-mentioned first
analysis (Table 2) were considered for adjustment. The
adjusted ORs of vaccination were 0.77 (0.66–0.90) for
<38.0 ◦C versus ≥38.0 ◦C, 0.74 (0.62–0.88) for <39.0 ◦C
versus ≥39.0 ◦C, and 0.71 (0.59–0.86) for <38.0 ◦C versus
≥39.0 ◦C. The lowest OR (0.71) or the highest vaccine effectiveness (29%) was observed in the comparison of <38.0 ◦C
versus ≥39.0 ◦C. Thus, the calculation applying stricter criteria, or contrasting extreme categories, revealed lower ORs
and exhibited more pronounced vaccine effectiveness.
In the third analysis (Table 3), ORs were calculated by age
category using a proportional odds model. In the age group
of 2.0–5.9 years, the same explanatory variables as those in
the first analysis (Table 2) were included in the model, while
in the calculations by 1-year interval, “age” was excluded
from the models. In addition, special attention was paid to
the model construction in two age groups: for the age category <1 year, only two variables, “siblings” and “preschool
attendance”, were used for adjustment, since the other two

variables, “physician visits for cold symptoms within the

were not possible variables for this age group; for children
in the 5.0–5.9 years age group, “preschool attendance” was
excluded, since almost all children (99%, 425 out of 430)
attended preschool.
When children aged 2 years and over were combined, a
decreased OR (0.67, 0.56–0.79) was observed. The adjusted
ORs by 1-year interval ranged from 0.60 to 1.84 and were
less than unity except for children under 1 year. After combining some of these age categories, the adjusted ORs were
0.74 (0.63–0.86) among children aged 1.0–5.9 years, and 1.07
(0.80–1.44) among those aged <2.0 years.
4. Discussion
The present results must be interpreted carefully. This
study was conducted using a non-randomized design, in
which vaccination or non-vaccination were self-selected by
parents. It is, therefore, essential to consider potential confounders in the analysis, since they are unlikely to be distributed in equal frequency between the groups. In fact,
vaccine effectiveness in the Mie Prefecture increased 65%
(from 17% to 28%) after adjustment with the logistic model.
Thus, we calculated adjusted ORs of vaccination to control
confounding effects using the available data.
In addition, the definition of ILI, as an acute febrile illness during an epidemic peak, must have affected the present
results since this definition inevitably includes noninfluenzal illnesses. To measure the onset of a febrile illness, we
prospectively collected information on the maximum body
temperature each week by using a postal questionnaire. This
method enabled us to observe each individual of the all
study subjects with an equal intensity throughout an epidemic period. This method also minimized the uncertainty
in the parents’ answer as well as gave a similar recall stimulus to parents in both groups. Moreover, only a febrile illness
contracted during an influenza peak epidemic period in each
area was regarded as a study outcome (ILI). Such procedures that define an epidemic peak by using local data have
also been used in other studies [16–18]. It is reasonable to
assume that the extent to which the ILI category includes noninfluenzal illnesses and the non-diseased category includes
influenza per se was similar in the vaccinated and nonvaccinated groups. Such nondifferential misclassification results
in an underestimation of vaccine efficacy, but does not affect
the validity of the study results. Measurement error in maximum body temperature would also have occurred similarly
among vaccinees and nonvaccinees. Thus, the true association can be considered to be at least as great as that observed.
It seems likely that parent(s) or guardian(s) who make their
child immunized tend to be more conscious of their child’s
health and to measure their child’s body temperature more
frequently. Thus, the maximum body temperature may have
been reported to be higher in vaccinees than in nonvaccinees. In this situation, vaccine effectiveness would also be
underestimated.

In the present study, even though most of the virus isolates
of the 2002–2003 season were antigenically similar to the
vaccine strain, a relatively low vaccine effectiveness for ILI
was found for children under 6 years of age: 24% (12%–34%)
for the group as a whole and 33% (21%–44%) for children 2
years and over. Similarly, a previous randomized, controlled
study among children 24–60 months of age showed insufficient vaccine effectiveness: 7% (−30% to 23%) against
febrile illness and 31% (−95% to 73%) against A/H3N2 and
45% (−2% to 69%) against type B of serologically confirmed
influenza [8]. On the other hand, another randomized trial
among healthy children aged 1–6 years reported a higher vaccine effectiveness of 67% (59%–74%) against influenza-like
illness [9]. The vaccine effectiveness in our study is thought
to have been underestimated due to our definition of ILI. The
presence of the diluting effect caused by noninfluenzal illnesses was reflected in a more pronounced OR when strict
criteria were used for ILI.
Among very young children, we obtained a vaccine effectiveness of −84% (−319% to 19%) for children <1 year and
1% (−36% to 28%) for children 1.0–1.9 years of age. Thus,
influenza vaccine effectiveness could not be demonstrated in
these age groups. In a recent randomized, controlled study
conducted over 2 consecutive influenza seasons, the vaccine efficacy among children 6–24 months of age was not
consistent. There was a significant vaccine efficacy of 66%
(34%–82%) against culture-proven influenza in the first year,
while in the second year, a negative efficacy of −7% (−247%
to 67%) was found. Meanwhile, in the placebo group, attack
rates during the same two seasons were 15.9% in the first
year and 3.3% in the second year [6]. On the other hand, in
a previous study in which the authors reanalysed the data on
the subset of children <16 years of age (including very young
children) from the entire population aged 1–65 years, a higher
vaccine efficacy was reported, and the estimated efficacy
against culture positive influenza was 91.4% (63.8%–98.0%)
for A/H1N1 and 77.3% (20.3%–93.5%) for A/H3N2 [7].
A few factors have been indicated that help to explain the
failure to detect vaccine effectiveness in very young children.
A recent study reported that there is a lower immune response
to influenza vaccine in children less than 1 year of age than
in older children aged 1–3 years [19]. It has also been shown
that influenza epidemics often overlap with the circulation
of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [3] and that the health
impact of RSV seems to be greater in very young children
than in older children [20,21]. ILI defined to measure vaccine
effectiveness is thus diluted more by noninfluenzal illnesses
among young children than among older children. Furthermore, in our study, the sample size of the young age group was
too small to clearly demonstrate vaccine efficacy, as shown
by the wide confidence interval.
In this study, vaccine effectiveness was observed to be
39% for those aged 2.0–2.9 years, 40% for those aged 3.0–3.9
years, and 28% for those aged 4.0–4.9 years; all of these were
either statistically significant or marginally statistically significant. However, the vaccine effectiveness among children
aged 5.0–5.9 years was merely 20% and was not statistically
significant. One possible interpretation is that this age group
had already acquired natural immunity through the influenza
virus experiences before this season, as suggested by the high
proportion of children in this age group attending preschool
(99%) in the present study. Under these circumstances, the
differences in susceptibility to the disease between vaccinees
and nonvaccinees tend to become small. Further analysis was
performed to adjust for preschool or school attendance of
the siblings, by adding this variable to the first multivariate
model. Nearly the same OR was obtained (0.74, 0.64–0.86).
In the stratified analysis by area performed to consider
regional variation of influenza epidemic, no clear trend was
observed. The main concern of these subgroup analyses
involves loss of statistical power, since the results were based
on only a small segment of the total subjects. The results were
therefore susceptible to random variability. Adjusted ORs
close to null value in Osaka and Fukuoka (1.02 and 0.93,
respectively) do not necessarily mean no vaccine efficacy in
these areas. Similarly, the largest reduction in ORs in Tokyo
(0.49) does not necessarily mean vaccine was most effective
in this area.
In summary, a statistically significant, protective effect of
influenza vaccine against an ILI attack was found in children
under 6 years of age (24%), with the rate rising to 33% in
children aged 2.0–5.9 years. However, vaccine effectiveness
was not clearly shown in children under 2 years of age. There
are several factors which make it difficult to detect vaccine
efficacy among very young children, including, among others: a low immune response to the vaccine; susceptibility to
co-circulating infectious agents; the illness definition used
to measure the outcome event; and the method of obtaining
clinical information. Further studies are required by different
methods, among different places, and in different seasons, to
clarify the effectiveness of influenza vaccine among young
children.
