ABSTRACT. Objective. To evaluate the effectiveness
of 1 and 2 doses of the 2003–2004 influenza vaccine in
preventing medically attended influenza-like illness
(ILI) among children 6 to 23 months and 6 months to 8
years of age.
Design and Methods. Outpatient and emergency department visits and immunization records were used to
conduct a retrospective cohort study among children 6
months to 8 years of age. ILI and pneumonia and influenza (P&I) outcomes were defined on the basis of International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision,
codes. Influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) was calculated as (1  hazard rate ratio)  100.
Results. A total of 29 726 children were included in
the analyses; 17.3% were 6 to 23 months of age. By November 19, 2003, the start of peak influenza activity, 7.5%
and 9.9% of children 6 months to 8 years were fully or
partially vaccinated against influenza, respectively. For
fully vaccinated children 6 to 23 months of age, VE
against ILI and P&I was 25% and 49%, respectively. No
statistically significant reduction in ILI or P&I rates was
observed for partially vaccinated children 6 to 23 months
of age (3% and 22%, respectively). For fully vaccinated
children 6 months to 8 years of age, VE against ILI and
P&I was 23% and 51%, respectively. For partial vaccination, VE was significant only for P&I (23%).
Conclusions. Despite a suboptimal match between
the influenza vaccine and predominant circulating
strains, influenza vaccination provided substantial protection for fully vaccinated children and possibly some
protection for partially vaccinated children <9 years of
age. These findings support vaccinating targeted children even when the vaccine match is suboptimal, and
they highlight the need to vaccinate previously unvaccinated children with 2 doses for optimal protection. Pediatrics 2005;116:153–159; influenza, vaccine effectiveness,

nfluenza-related illnesses result in the hospitalization of 1 to 2 children per 1000 children 5
years of age annually in the United States, with
children 2 years of age being at particularly high
risk.1–4 Beginning in 2004 –2005, yearly influenza
vaccination was recommended for all children 6 to 23
months of age and for out-of-home caregivers and
household contacts of children 2 years of age; influenza vaccination of children 6 months of age
with certain medical conditions has been recommended for many years.5 Concerns about logistic
challenges in vaccinating millions of US children
during the autumn and early winter months have
been raised, particularly considering that children
9 years of age who have not been vaccinated previously against influenza are recommended to receive 2 doses of inactivated influenza vaccine 1
month apart for the first year.6–8 Therefore, many
children 6 to 23 months of age would need 2 doses of
vaccine the first year of vaccination for optimal protection. Limited data are available on the effectiveness of 1 vs 2 doses of vaccine among children 9
years of age; the recommendation for the age cutoff
was based principally on serologic data.9 In addition,
few studies have assessed the effectiveness of the
inactivated influenza vaccine among children 6 to 23
months of age during years with and without an
optimal antigenic match between the vaccine and
circulating strains.10,11 The overlap in circulation of
influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and
other viruses and low vaccination rates have limited
the ability of previous studies to evaluate the effectiveness of the influenza vaccine against non–laboratory-confirmed outcomes.1,2,10–12
The 2003–2004 influenza season in Colorado was
unusual in 2 particular respects. First, influenza activity started earlier than usual (November 1, 2003, to
January 17, 2004) and overlapped little with RSV
activity (December 13, 2003, to April 17, 2004).13,14
Because of the distinct times for these disease entities, International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) respiratory diagnoses were much more
likely to be influenza-related during November and
December of 2003. Second, the predominant circulating influenza A virus strain was antigenically different from the vaccine strain. Using the electronic medical records and immunization tracking system of

Kaiser Permanente Colorado (KPCO), we sought to
capitalize on the unusual, early, 2003–2004 influenza
season to provide estimates of vaccine effectiveness
(VE) among children. The primary objective of this
study was to evaluate the effectiveness of influenza
vaccine in preventing medically attended influenzalike illness (ILI) among children 6 to 23 months of
age enrolled in KPCO during the 2003–2004 influenza season and the combined 6-month to 8-year age
group. We examined VE for both partially vaccinated and fully vaccinated children, allowing for
varying vaccination status over time for a given child
depending on when shots were completed and the
lag time needed for immunity.
METHODS
Study Population
Children 6 months through 8 years of age on October 1, 2003,
who lived in the Denver/Boulder metropolitan area and were
enrolled continuously in KPCO from October 1, 2003, through
December 2003 were eligible for inclusion in the study population.
The Denver/Boulder metropolitan market area of KPCO has
380 000 members. To ensure that children were using KPCO as
their primary source of health care, enrolled children were required to have had 1 health care visit to the health maintenance
organization in the past 8 months for 1-year-old children, 12
months for 1- to 2-year-old children, 2 years for 2- to 4-year-old
children, and 2.5 years for 5- to 8-year-old children. Overall, 29 726
children were included in the analyses.
Vaccination Status
For many years, KPCO has identified members at high risk for
influenza and encouraged influenza vaccinations. The KPCO Immunization Task Force recommended that all children 6 to 23
months of age, in addition to the other high-risk groups, be
immunized with the influenza vaccine beginning in the 2002–2003
influenza season, before the full recommendation made by the
Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). In addition to high-risk members, KPCO identified proactively and sent
mailings to families with children 6 to 23 months of age, to
encourage influenza vaccination. The influenza vaccination status
of the cohort for years 2002 and 2003 was determined with the
KPCO Immunization Tracking System. Immunizations completed
during clinic visits were entered into the KPCO electronic medical
record by health care providers in the pediatrics, family medicine,
primary care, urgent care, and trauma departments and then
transferred immediately to the Immunization Tracking System.
Large numbers of influenza shots were also provided during
designated influenza clinics organized during the autumn. Pediatric vaccinations given during influenza clinics were entered
from consent forms directly into the electronic medical record. The
accuracy and timeliness of this system are high priorities, because
the system is the final repository of all immunization data and
generates all vaccine reports used by KPCO. Full vaccination
status was defined as having 2 influenza shots a minimum of 14
days before the ILI event date. Children vaccinated in the prior
year had to have only 1 shot completed in the autumn of 2003 to
meet the full vaccination definition. Children were considered
partially vaccinated if they had only 1 influenza shot in the autumn of 2003 at least 14 days before the ILI event and no prior
vaccination recorded in the previous year. Children vaccinated
only in the previous year were considered unvaccinated.
Presence of Chronic Medical Conditions
To adjust for variations in health status and the prevalence of
chronic conditions that could influence the likelihood of having a
medically attended ILI during the period of observation, KPCO’s
asthma and diabetes registries, as well as a pharmacy-based risk
adjustment system called RxRisk, were used to identify patients
with 1 relevant condition.15–18 The RxRisk system is a clinically
validated algorithm that classifies children into chronic disease
categories on the basis of drug prescriptions filled.19 Conditions
deemed relevant for inclusion in the final models to be used for
comorbidity adjustment included allergic rhinitis, asthma, diabetes mellitus, history of gastrointestinal disorders, cognitive or
behavioral health disorders, and an aggregate category denoting a
history of malignancy, liver or renal disease, and transplants.
Underlying cardiac disease was not included in the model because
0.05% of the study population was identified as having this
condition.
Respiratory Illness Outcomes
The primary outcomes were ILI and pneumonia and influenza
(P&I) outpatient and emergency department visits; data on inpatient
visits were not available at the time of this analysis. Outcomes were
defined with ICD-9 codes validated in prior studies.2–4,20 The extracted ambulatory care data from the KPCO medical office visit also
included the patient’s recorded temperature at the time of the visit.
The ILI outcome included all ICD-9-defined diagnosis codes noted in
Appendix 1, and the P&I outcome included ICD-9 codes 480 to 482
and 485 to 487.
Study Period
To minimize misclassification attributable to non–influenzarelated respiratory ILI, the outcome period was defined as November 19 through December 7, 2003, the peak weeks of influenza
activity based on surveillance data from the Children’s Hospital
(TCH) Department of Epidemiology and Pathology, the Colorado
Department of Public Health and Environment-sponsored Influenza Surveillance Program, and the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention-sponsored Bioterrorism Surveillance Demonstration Program.13,14,21 The primary data source used to define this
period was the laboratory isolate data derived from the TCH
Department of Epidemiology and Pathology. This source of data
represents a subset of all laboratory isolates of confirmed influenza cases collected and reported by the Colorado Department of
Public Health and Environment, but these data are specific to
children in the Denver metropolitan area and TCH is the primary
contract hospital for KPCO pediatric patients. We chose the peak
period of November 19 through December 7 for the following
reasons: laboratory-confirmed cases increased from 50 during the
week ending November 8 to 200 during the week ending November 15, total cases reported by TCH peaked at 350 during the
week ending November 22, and the number of reported cases of
influenza fell below 100 by December 13, whereas the number of
cases of RSV was increasing. During the period of November 19
through December 7, TCH reported 15 positive tests each for
RSV, parainfluenza, rhinoviruses, and pertussis.
Statistical Analyses
The association between influenza vaccination and subsequent
medically attended ILI events was modeled with Cox proportional-hazards models.22,23 Survival analyses were used to account for
changes in vaccination status during the period of interest; influenza vaccination status was a time-varying variable. Time to event
used a count of days elapsed since the start of the selected time
interval. The proportional-hazards assumption was tested by using interaction terms for fully and partially vaccinated variables
with time. Both interaction terms were nonsignificant (P  .10).
When multiple ILI visits were found for a child, only the first ILI
was modeled. The limited time frame for these analyses (19 days)
made multiple events very rare. The vast majority of children had no
ILI event (N  27 375 [92.1%], an additional 2105 children (7.1%) had
only 1 ILI event, and 1 ILI event occurred for only 246 children in
this sample (1%). Rates of ILIs among vaccinated and unvaccinated
children could be modeled with multiple ILI events by using Poisson
regression models. Preliminary models for this sample compared
vaccination associations with ILI outcomes from Poisson regression
and survival analyses. These comparison models produced very
similar results in the estimated magnitude of association between
vaccination status and ILI outcomes. We selected survival analysis
for all remaining analyses because these models could account more
readily for daily changes in vaccination status through the use of
time-varying variables.
We estimated models for all children 6 months to 8 years of age.
Given the recent ACIP recommendations, we also estimated separate models for children 6 to 23 months of age. In addition to
estimating the hazard rate ratio (HRR) of an ILI outcome according to vaccination status, we also expanded the models to include

age, gender, and dichotomous comorbidity flags denoting the
presence of a chronic condition and to assess their contribution to
having a medically attended ILI. Separate models were also estimated for all children 6 months to 8 years of age that were
identified in KPCO’s asthma disease management registry. Influenza VE was estimated to be (1  HRR)  100.
RESULTS
Vaccination Status and Prevalence of Chronic Medical
Conditions
Table 1 describes the distribution of the population
according to age, vaccination status, and prevalence of
chronic conditions for the study population. At the
beginning of the study period, estimates of full and
partial vaccination coverage for children 6 to 23 months
of age were 7.3% and 19.6%, respectively, and those for
children 2 to 8 years of age were 7.5% and 7.9%. By the
end of the study period, children 6 to 23 months of age
had the highest rates of full or partial vaccine immunization, with rates of 14.6% and 27.0%, respectively.
Among all ages, 28.8% were either partially or fully
vaccinated by December 7, 2003. Live attenuated influenza vaccine is not approved for children 5 years of
age; therefore, no patients 5 years of age received live
attenuated influenza vaccine. During the time period of
these analyses, only 46 children 5 to 8 years of age
received a dose of live attenuated influenza vaccine
(0.8% of all patients who received any vaccination).
Asthma was the most prevalent chronic condition in
the study cohort (7.5%). A total of 5.5% of 6- to 23-
month-old children and 0.8% of 2- to 8-year-old children had a history of being dispensed a gastroprotective agent such as cimetidine or ranitidine.
Examination of medical records for a subset of these
children suggested that these products were prescribed
in this cohort for the treatment of reflux disease. A
history of allergic rhinitis was present in 0.9% of cases.
Other comorbidities were present in 0.3% of cases.
Source of ILI Events
A total of 2351 children (7.9%) had an ILI event
during the study period, across all pediatric age categories. Approximately 92% of these events were
derived from outpatient visits at a KPCO facility. The
remaining events originated from emergency department visits. Of patients 6 to 23 months of age, 774
(15.1% of the population) had an ILI visit. Less than
3% of the total population had a P&I visit, with 221 of
these events involving children 6 to 23 months of age
(4.3% of the 6- to 23-month-old population). A
slightly higher proportion of these P&I events, 9.5%,
were derived from emergency department visits.
Estimates of VE
The results of the Cox proportional-hazards models for the broad ILI outcome and the narrower P&I
outcome for children 6 months to 8 years of age are
described in Table 2. For the ILI outcome, models
with only vaccination status indicators demonstrated
a significant protective effect, with a HRR of 0.85
(95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.73– 0.99) and VE of
15% for all children 6 months to 8 years of age. With
adjustment for age, gender, and chronic conditions,
the fully vaccinated HRR was more protective (HRR:
0.77; 95% CI: 0.66 – 0.90), corresponding to a VE estimate of 23%. For the P&I outcome, this finding was
even more pronounced for the fully vaccinated, with
estimated HRR values of 0.56 (95% CI: 0.42– 0.76; VE:
44%) for the univariate model and 0.49 (95% CI: 0.36 –
0.67; VE: 51%) for the fully adjusted model. In the
adjusted model for the P&I outcome, a protective effect
was also demonstrated among partially vaccinated
members (HRR: 0.77; 95% CI: 0.62– 0.95; VE: 23%).
Age was inversely associated with both the ILI and
P&I outcomes: patients 6 to 11 months of age were 4
to 5 times more likely to present with an ILI, compared with 7- and 8-year-old patients. Asthma, allergic rhinitis, and a history of receiving a prescription
for a gastroprotective agent all had HRR values of
1 and were statistically significant for the broad ILI
outcome. These findings suggested that patients with
a history of these conditions were more likely to
present with an ILI outcome.
VE model estimates for children 6 to 23 months of
age are shown in Table 3. The less-specific ILI uniTABLE 1. Distribution of Vaccination Status, Gender, and Prevalence of Chronic Conditions

variate model showed a significant protective VE of
34% (HRR: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.50 – 0.88). The adjusted
HRR estimate, although similar in magnitude to the
all-age model, did not reach statistical significance in
this smaller sample (HRR: 0.75; 95% CI: 0.56 –1.00). A
significant protective effect against P&I for fully vaccinated patients was found in both unadjusted (HRR:
0.53; 95% CI: 0.30 – 0.93; VE: 47%) and adjusted (HRR:
0.51; 95% CI: 0.29 – 0.91; VE: 49%) models. For the
less-specific ILI outcome, both age (in months) and
the presence of a gastrointestinal comorbidity were
associated significantly with an ILI visit. Patients at
younger ages (HRR: 0.66) and those with a history of
receiving a prescription for a gastrointestinal illness
(HRR: 1.39) were more likely to have an ambulatory
encounter for ILI. None of the chronic condition
variables was found to be associated statistically
with a medically attended P&I.
A subanalysis was performed with a sample of
2229 children 6 months to 8 years of age who were
identified in the asthma registry. Two hundred (9%)
experienced an ILI event and 70 (3%) experienced a
P&I event; 28% were fully vaccinated and 18% were
partially vaccinated by December 7, 2003. Estimates
derived from univariate and multivariate adjusted
models for fully vaccinated children did not demonstrate a protective effect of vaccination against ILI
(unadjusted HRR: 0.93; 95% CI: 0.67–1.30; adjusted
HRR: 0.95; 95% CI: 0.68 –1.33). However, a significant
protective effect against P&I for fully vaccinated patients was found in both unadjusted (HRR: 0.30; 95%
CI: 0.13– 0.69) and adjusted (HRR: 0.32; 95% CI: 0.14 –
0.74) models, with VE estimated to be 70% and 68%,
respectively. No protective effect of partial vaccination was found (adjusted HRR: 1.02; 95% CI: 0.55–
1.89).
DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this study is the largest study
evaluating the effectiveness of influenza vaccine
among children 6 to 23 months of age and the effectiveness of 1 vs 2 doses among children 6 months to
8 years of age. Our findings suggest that both doses
are needed for previously unvaccinated children 6

months to 8 years of age, to provide maximal protection against influenza. In addition, despite the
suboptimal antigenic match between the influenza
vaccine and the circulating virus strain in the autumn of 2003, influenza vaccination was found to be
effective in preventing medically attended ILIs
among children 6 to 23 months of age, as well as all
children 6 months to 8 years of age.
The estimates found in this study are consistent
with the findings of other studies of influenza VE
against medically attended ILI among children.
Many of the previously published estimates of the
efficacy of inactivated trivalent influenza vaccine
among young children were based on randomized
control trials with an end point of laboratory-confirmed influenza.10,20,24–27 In a recent review article,
Zangwill and Belshe27 identified 7 studies, all randomized controlled trials, that reported efficacy data
associated with the trivalent inactivated influenza
vaccine for children 9 years of age. The authors
pooled data from 5 of the studies that included children 9 years of age and estimated efficacy to be
63%. However, for studies with children 5 years
of age, reported efficacies ranged from 12% to 83%.
In a study evaluating data for children 6 to 23
months of age by Hoberman et al,10 efficacy ranged
from 66% in the first year, when the attack rate was
high, to 7% (not statistically significant) in the second study year, when the attack rate was low. In a
study assessing the 1996 –1997 trivalent inactivated
influenza vaccine among children attending day
care, Hurwitz et al11 found VE estimates of 45%
associated with the reduction in laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza A and 31% for influenza B.
Several smaller studies demonstrated VE in the presence of a suboptimal match between the circulating
influenza virus strain and the vaccine strain. In an
examination of 137 patients with moderate/severe
asthma during the 1992–1993 influenza season, when a
drifted strain predominated, Sugaya et al28 found VE
estimates of 67.5%. Three other studies24,25,29 also reviewed by Zangwill and Belshe27 demonstrated reduced protection against heterotypic influenza strains,
although the VE estimates overlapped with those from
studies conducted during years in which the circulating and virus strains were well matched.
This study showed relatively high vaccination rates
and demonstrated the effect of proactive recommendations for influenza vaccinations for all children 9
years of age. Although ACIP’s explicit recommendations do not include vaccination for all children 2
years of age, studies suggested that the vaccination of
school-aged children can reduce the spread of influenza in the community.30,31 Given the recent influenza
vaccine shortages, and before broader recommendations are made, findings from vaccination studies with
school-aged children, like the one currently underway
in Texas, and benefits of the universal vaccination program in Ontario, Canada, should be evaluated to inform policymakers regarding to the societal benefits of
vaccinating all school-aged children.32
Our study found that a large proportion of young
children had been given a gastroprotective agent (5.5%)
and use of such medications was associated significantly with an ILI visit. Reflux is more common among
infants with a history of prematurity, a condition that
was not controlled for directly in our analyses and that
is associated with increased health services utilization.
Although little research is available describing the direct association between medical visits for ILI and use
of gastroprotective agents, some children diagnosed as
having chronic cough or asthma might have reflux and
intermittent aspiration.33 A recently published study
examining the association between the use of acidsuppressing drugs and the occurrence of communityacquired pneumonia among adults found that the current use of gastric acid-suppressing therapy was
associated with an increased risk of community-acquired pneumonia.34 Additional research is needed to
understand more clearly whether reflux or the use of
acid-suppressing therapy is associated with an increased risk of medically attended respiratory illness
among young children.
Asthma was the predominant childhood disease in
this sample, and influenza vaccination had been recommended for asthmatic children by the ACIP for
many years. For children identified in KPCO’s
asthma registry, our study found a large, significant,
protective effect for the P&I outcome and a small
nonsignificant estimate of a protective effect for the
broader ILI outcome. Children were identified in
KPCO’s asthma disease registry if they had either 1
prescription for a -receptor agonist (eg, albuterol or
salmeterol) or 1 inpatient or outpatient diagnosis of
asthma (ICD-9 code 493). No adjustment for asthma
severity was made. This is particularly important
because children with severe asthma are more likely
to be vaccinated against influenza and they are more
likely to have respiratory illness episodes than are
children with mild asthma.15,16 Therefore, any study
using non–influenza laboratory-confirmed outcomes
among asthmatic children is likely to underestimate
the true VE. Our non–laboratory-confirmed outcomes might have had more misclassification among
asthmatic patients than among otherwise healthy
children because of other causes of respiratory symptoms in this subgroup. This misclassification might
have been worse for the broad ILI outcome, which
would explain in part the lack of a significant protective effect for this outcome. However, we cannot
rule out coding bias related to physician knowledge
of vaccination status, which might have strengthened the protective effect for the P&I outcome. In the
literature, results remain mixed for studies examining influenza VE in preventing ILI among asthmatics.35–38 Despite the current need for additional studies, the safety of the vaccine among asthmatic
patients, the evidence that influenza infection leads
to asthma exacerbation, and the results of our study
all support vaccination for this group.
Our findings confirm the advantage of full (2 shots)
versus partial (1 shot) vaccination in protecting against
influenza among previously unvaccinated children 9
years of age and particularly among children 6 to 23
months of age. It is possible that the protective effect of
partial vaccination for all children 6 months to 8 years
of age found in the P&I outcome model is subject to
limitations in interpretation, because vaccination status

data were captured only over a 2-year period. Specifically, a child 2 years of age who received an influenza
vaccination in 2003 but not 2002 was denoted as partially vaccinated. Some subset of these children might
have received an influenza vaccination in 2001 or earlier and therefore should have been assigned the status
of fully vaccinated. However, it is very unlikely that
this type of misclassification is an issue for children 6 to
23 months of age, as included in these analyses. This
misclassification, if it occurred, would have overestimated the effect among older, partially vaccinated children by including fully vaccinated patients in the same
group and, if corrected, could only strengthen the recommendation that 2 shots are needed for VE.
This study has several limitations. It relied on administrative data, and the respiratory outcomes were
not laboratory confirmed. We used a very short observation period of only 19 days. However, the lack
of substantial overlap in RSV and influenza activity
during the study period minimized the misclassification of illness. Also, because this was an observational study, vaccination status was not randomized.
Therefore, irrespective of the adjustment variables
used, selection bias may exist with respect to which
patients obtained vaccination. However, the size of
the population, the ability to adjust for the presence
of underlying illness, and supporting virologic surveillance data to define precisely the period of peak
influenza activity are important strengths of this
study. In addition, there is a very low likelihood that
we did not record all sources of utilization associated
with KPCO children seeking care for ILI. Data used
in these analyses included all utilization derived
from KPCO medical office encounters, including all
after-hours and urgent care visits, as well as all utilization that took place in emergency departments,
including TCH (the only children’s hospital in the
Denver metropolitan area). In addition, the recording of emergency department cases should account
for the majority of patients admitted subsequently as
inpatients for treatment for more severe disease.
The early occurrence of the 2003–2004 influenza
season, coupled with intense media coverage of pediatric morbidity and death in the later weeks of the
outbreak, could have generated significant variation
in the coding of cases by KPCO physicians. For example, physicians might be more likely to code influenza in the later weeks of the outbreak and viral
infection not otherwise specified, fever, or cough in
the earlier weeks. We limited our study to a 19-day
period that represented the peak weeks of influenza
activity; influenza first appeared in early November
and abated in early January 2004.13 Limiting our
analysis to the peak weeks would minimize the coding misclassification by clinicians that could be expected during the first and last days of the seasonal
influenza epidemic. Finally, it is possible that physicians assigning visit diagnoses might have been less
likely to code influenza for vaccinated children, although the widespread publicity regarding the suboptimal antigenic match and vaccine failures likely
would have lessened this potential coding bias.
However, it is unlikely that a child presenting with
fever, cough, or other upper respiratory tract illness
symptoms would have an ICD-9 diagnosis code
other than those used for defining an ILI (Appendix
1) and therefore would not be identified in our study.
CONCLUSIONS
Influenza vaccine was shown to prevent medically
attended ILI among children 6 to 23 months of age, as
well as older children, even with a suboptimal match.
This study provides supportive data regarding the benefits of vaccination for children and the need for 2 doses
among previously unvaccinated young children 9
years of age. The logistics of instituting the influenza
vaccine recommendations for young children pose a
formidable challenge to private and public health care
systems. Additional strategies for fully vaccinating children before the onset of influenza activity should be
evaluated.
