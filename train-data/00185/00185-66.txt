Objective To assess the clinical effectiveness of influenza vaccine in preventing influenza-like illness (ILI) office visits.
Study design We analyzed billing and immunization registry data for healthy 6- to 21-month-olds from 5 Denver, Colorado
pediatric practices (n  5193). ILI and pneumonia/influenza (a subset of ILI) were defined from International Classification
of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes for office visits occurring during peak influenza season. Partially
vaccinated (PV) and fully vaccinated (FV) patients were defined as having 1 shot and 2 shots, respectively, more than 14 days
before the first ILI visit. The likelihood of an ILI visit was determined using a Cox proportional hazards model accounting for
patient characteristics, practice site, and immunization status.
Results A total of 28% of the patients had an ILI office visit, and 5% had a pneumonia/influenza visit. Hazard ratios (HRs)
for FV versus UV were 0.31 (95% confidence interval [CI]  0.3 to 0.4) for ILI and 0.13 (95% CI  0.1 to 0.2) for
pneumonia/influenza, corresponding to a vaccine effectiveness (1 – HR  100) of 69% for ILI and 87% for pneumonia/
influenza. The corresponding HRs for PV versus UV were 1.0 (95% CI  0.9 to 1.2) and 1.1 (95% CI  0.8 to 1.5).
Conclusions Although 2 doses of vaccine were 69% effective against ILI office visits
and 87% effective against pneumonia/influenza office visits, 1 dose did not prevent office
visits during the 2003-2004 influenza season. (J Pediatr 2006;149:755-62)

nfluenza causes significant morbidity and mortality in children and places a substantial
burden on their families and the health care system every year. The burden of illness
due to influenza is highest for children with chronic health problems and young
children.1-4 For children under age 24 months, estimates of annual hospitalization rates
range from 0.6 to 4 per 1000.3,5-7 In children under age 5 years, illness due to influenza
leads to 6 to 15 extra outpatient visits and 3 to 9 extra courses of antibiotics per 100
children annually, with the highest rates in children under age 3 years.5 Based on the
impact of influenza in children under age 24 months and the risk– benefit ratio of the
vaccine, in 2004 the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended universal vaccination against influenza for 6- to 23-month-old children,2 a
recommendation that was subsequently endorsed by the American Academy of Pediatrics.8 For previously unimmunized children under age 9 years, 2 doses of vaccine are
recommended to achieve adequate immune response.8
Although immunization of all healthy 6- to 23-month-old children is recommended, evidence is mixed regarding the efficacy and clinical effectiveness of the inactivated influenza vaccine in this age group. Immunogenicity is defined as the vaccine’s ability
to cause a rise in protective antibody titers. Vaccine efficacy describes the vaccine’s ability to
prevent laboratory-confirmed infection in a controlled setting. Vaccine effectiveness generally refers to a vaccine’s ability to prevent clinically significant illness. Although 2 doses of

inactivated influenza vaccine are known to be immunogenic in
6- to 23-month-old children based on the rise in antibody
titers after vaccine administration,9-12 few studies have assessed efficacy based on laboratory-confirmed infection.12-14
The data regarding clinical effectiveness in young children are
even more limited. Ritzwoller et al15 examined influenza
vaccine effectiveness in 6- to 23-month-old children based on
prevention of influenza-like illness (ILI).
Studies of influenza vaccine effectiveness are limited by
using ILI rather than laboratory-confirmed influenza as the
outcome. Because the clinical manifestations of influenza
infection are similar to the manifestations of other respiratory
pathogens, ILI may not measure infection specifically caused
by influenza if it is being measured at a time at which other
respiratory pathogens are common.16,17 Despite this limitation of effectiveness data, such studies are important, because
they evaluate the performance of the influenza vaccine in a
real-world setting and reflect the impact of influenza vaccination programs on the health care delivery system.
Because little is known about the clinical effectiveness
of the influenza vaccine in the youngest age group, particularly in non-health maintenance organization (HMO) settings, we assessed the effectiveness of the vaccine in preventing office visits for ILI during the 2003-2004 influenza season
in Colorado. The objectives of this study were to describe
influenza immunization rates and timing of immunizations in
healthy 6- to 21-month-old children and to assess the effectiveness of 1 and 2 doses of influenza vaccine in preventing
outpatient office visits for ILI.
METHODS
Study Setting and Population
The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the
Colorado Multiple Institutional Review Board and the Institutional Review Board of the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC). This study was conducted as part of a
randomized controlled trial of registry-based reminder recall
in 5 private pediatric practices in Denver, Colorado from
September 1, 2003 through February 29, 2004.18 All practices
encouraged influenza immunization for all healthy 6- to 23-
month-old children during the 2003-2004 season, but
roughly half of the children received a recall letter as part of
the randomized controlled trial. The practices use a regional
immunization registry and share a common computerized
billing system, as described by Kempe et al.18
The study population comprised all children age 6 to
21 months as of September 1, 2003 who were regular
patients in the 5 practices, based on having had an office
visit in the previous 18 months and having a record in the
registry and billing database. Children 22 and 23 months
old were excluded at the practices’ request, because those
children would have been older than 23 months during the
influenza season, and the practices were concerned that
insurers would not reimburse for the vaccination of children older than 23 months. In light of the new ACIP
recommendation to vaccinate healthy 6- to 23-montholds,2 we specifically focused on healthy children by excluding children with a chronic medical condition that
would increase the risk of experiencing clinically significant
illness due to influenza. International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM)
codes19 obtained from office billing data before the study
period were used to identify and exclude children with
chronic conditions, as described previously.20 Children
were also excluded if their families were known to have
moved to a different practice not participating in the study.
If more than 1 child per family was in the 6-to 21-month
age group, then a single child per family was randomly
selected for the study.
Data Sources
The primary data sources were a computerized billing
database and an internet-based immunization registry used to
determine outpatient office visits and immunization status.
The billing database includes sex, age, and dates of office visits
with associated ICD-9-CM codes and Current Procedural
Terminology (CPT) codes.21 Staff members at the 5 pediatric
practices are advised to enter immunization information into
the registry within 24 hours of vaccine administration. As
described previously, a quality assessment review of the registry at the 5 pediatric practices showed a completeness rate of
97.4% (percent of children in the practices included in the
registry) and an error rate of 7.2% (immunization not recorded or recorded incorrectly in the registry).18 Immunization status was determined using data in the registry and the
billing database. Information regarding the study population’s
demographic characteristics was collected through telephone
surveys conducted as part of another study, the methodology
of which has been described previously.18
Definitions
TIMING OF THE RESPIRATORY ILLNESS SEASON. The timing
of the influenza season was determined using data from the
Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment
(CDPHE) supplemented by data from the Department of
Epidemiology at Children’s Hospital, Denver. Laboratoryconfirmed influenza cases reported to the CDPHE increased
rapidly from 0 beginning on approximately November 1,
2003, peaked at almost 3000 cases during the first week of
December 2003, and decreased to fewer than 500 cases during
the first week of January 2004.22 Therefore, we defined the
study period for influenza season as November 1, 2003 to
December 31, 2003. This period corresponds to the time
during which influenza A was the primary pathogen found
among all positive laboratory studies for respiratory illness at
Children’s Hospital, Denver.23
The timing of the respiratory synctial virus (RSV) season
was determined using surveillance data from the CDC and
Children’s Hospital, Denver. According to the CDC, RSV
activity in the western United States began on December 27,
756 Allison et al The Journal of Pediatrics • December 2006
2003 and continued through April 3, 2004.24 Children’s
Hospital laboratory data show that confirmed cases of RSV
were slightly more common than confirmed cases of influenza
(21 cases of RSV vs 16 cases of influenza) during the week of
December 27, 2003.23 Because the RSV and influenza seasons began to overlap at the end of December, we chose
December 31, 2003 as the end date for the influenza season.
OUTCOME MEASURES. The primary outcome measure was
incidence of outpatient visits for ILI or pneumonia and influenza, a subset of ILI, during the influenza season of November 1, 2003 to December 31, 2003. The diagnoses and
associated ICD-9-CM codes used to define ILI and pneumonia/influenza are given in the Appendix (available at
www.jpeds.com). These diagnoses were similar to those used
to define ILI in previous clinical studies.1,7,15,25 Because a
child can contract influenza A only once during a season, if a
child had more than 1 office visit for ILI or pneumonia/
influenza during the study period, then only the first visit was
included in the analysis. Using the first office visit presumes
that the first visit was for illness due to influenza A and that
subsequent visits were for follow-up or for illnesses caused by
other pathogens.
IMMUNIZATION STATUS. Immunization data from the 2002-
2003 and 2003-2004 seasons were used to define immunization status. Children were unvaccinated (UV) if they had not
received at least 1 vaccine dose during the 2003-2004 season
more than 14 days before their first office visit for ILI.
Because immunity wanes in the year after vaccination, the
ACIP recommends annual vaccination with the current influenza vaccine;2,26,27 therefore, a child who had received 1 or
more doses during the 2002-2003 vaccine season but no dose
during the 2003-2004 season more than 14 days before his or
her first office visit for ILI was considered to be UV. A child
was partially vaccinated (PV) if he or she had received only 1
dose during the 2003-2004 season (and none during the
previous season) more than 14 days before their first ILI visit.
Children were fully vaccinated (FV) if they had received 2
doses (with at least 1 of the doses during the current season)
more than 14 days before the first ILI visit. In this case, a dose
received in 2002-2003 counted toward being FV, based on
evidence that a dose given during the previous season could
prime for an adequate immune response after another dose in
the current season.10 Because vaccinations could be received
during the study period of November 1, 2003 to December
31, 2003, an individual child’s immunization status could
change from UV to PV to FV for this analysis.
Data Analysis
Rates and timing of immunization were reported using
descriptive statistics. Office visit data from September 1, 2003
to October 31, 2003 and from January 1, 2004 to February 29,
2004, outside the influenza season, were used to define children’s office utilization patterns. Children with 3 or more
visits (75th percentile or above) were denoted as “high utilizers.” Bivariate analysis was used to determine whether the
incidence of ILI differed by utilization pattern, practice site,
or receipt of a recall letter (as part of the randomized controlled trial). Variables found to be associated with ILI in the
bivariate analysis were included in the Cox proportional hazards model. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to
calculate hazard ratios (HRs), a type of rate ratio estimate,
and to test for the association between immunization status
and occurrence of ILI or pneumonia/influenza while controlling for possible confounders, including age and sex.28 Immunization status was a time-varying covariate, because an
individual child’s immunization status could change during
the study period. The first office visit for ILI or pneumonia/
influenza occurring between November 1, 2003 and December 31, 2003 was the outcome variable or event. For each day
on which an event occurred, this time-dependent model compared the immunization status of children who experienced
an event that day with the immunization status of children
who had not experienced an event to date. Vaccine effectiveness was defined as 1 - HR. Log-log survivor functions were
plotted to ensure that the proportional hazards assumptions
were met.
We examined whether vaccine effectiveness against office visits for ILI differed between FV children who had
received both vaccine doses during the 2003-2004 season and
FV children who had received 1 of their doses the previous
(2002-2003) season, by repeating the Cox proportional hazards model analysis stratified by receipt of a vaccine dose the
previous season. One model included children who had received a vaccine dose during the 2002-2003 season, and
another model included children who had not received a
vaccine dose during the 2002-2003 season.
To test the plausibility of our vaccine effectiveness results, we repeated our analysis using office visit data from
January 1, 2004 through February 29, 2004. We hypothesized
that the influenza vaccine would not be effective (ie, the HR
comparing FV children with UV children would be close to
1), because the illnesses occurring this period were much more
likely to be caused by such pathogens as RSV than by influenza. The repeat vaccine effectiveness analysis used the same
Cox model as the original analysis, except the outcome variable was an office visit for ILI or pneumonia/influenza occurring between November 1, 2004 and February 29, 2004
rather than between November 1, 2003 and December 31,
2003. The SAS system for Windows, version 9.1 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC), was used for all data analyses.
RESULTS
Subject Characteristics
Of the total study population (n  5193), 50% were
male, with a mean age of 15.5 months as of November 1,
2003; 28% had an office visit for ILI and 5% had an office visit
for pneumonia/influenza between November 1, 2003 and
December 31, 2003. For the repeat analysis during RSV
season, 23% had an office visit for ILI and 1% had an office

visit for pneumonia/influenza between January 1, 2004 and
February 29, 2004. As described previously, most children
were white non-Hispanic (76%) and privately insured (87%),
with well-educated (83% with at least some college) and
married (87%) parents.18
Timing of the Influenza Season
The Figure shows the onset and peak of the 2003-2004
influenza season in Colorado based on laboratory-confirmed
cases reported to the CDPHE. The Figure also shows the
number of office visits for ILI in the study population during
the same time period. The first peak corresponds with our
definition of the influenza season as extending from November 1, 2003 through December 31, 2003. The timing of
influenza in the study population mirrors the pattern for the
state, with the number of cases increasing beginning on
November 1, peaking by December 1 through December 6,
and decreasing to baseline by December 31, 2003. The second, smaller peak shown in the Figure corresponds to the
RSV season.
Immunization Rates and Timing of Immunization
The influenza vaccine was available at all 5 study practices by the beginning of October 2003. Fifteen percent of the
study population (n  773) had received at least 1 vaccine
dose during the previous season. By March 1, 2004, 40% (n 
2087) had received 2 doses of vaccine or were FV. (This could
include 1 dose from the previous season.) Twenty percent (n
 1040) had received only 1 dose of vaccine during the
2003-2004 season (and none during the previous season) or
were PV. Forty percent (n  2066) had not received any doses
during the 2003-2004 season or were UV. The UV group
included 178 children (8.6%) who had received a vaccine the
previous season. Most immunizations were received between
November 1, 2003 and January 1, 2004. Only 5.8% (n  303)
of the children were FV before November 1, 2003, whereas
36.3% (n  1884) were FV by January 1, 2004.
Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness
BIVARIATE ANALYSIS. Because high utilizers and practice site
were associated with the incidence of ILI (P  .0001), these
variables were included in the Cox proportional hazards
model. Receipt of a recall letter was not related to ILI (P 
.3) and so was not included in the model.
COX PROPORTIONAL HAZARDS MODEL. Table I shows the
HRs for having an office visit for ILI or pneumonia/influenza
for each of the explanatory variables while controlling for the
other explanatory variables. Age was not associated with ILI,
although males were slightly more likely to have an office visit
for ILI than females. Children at sites 2 and 5 were more
likely to have an office visit resulting in an ILI diagnosis than
children at sites 1, 3, and 4. High utilizers were much more
likely to have an office visit for ILI than non– high utilizers.
The HR comparing FV children with UV children was 0.31
(95% confidence interval [CI]  0.26 to 0.36), indicating that
the FV children were much less likely to have an office visit
for ILI. This HR corresponds with a vaccine effectiveness of
69%. PV children were equally as likely to have an office visit
for ILI as UV children (HR  1.03; 95% CI  0.91 to 1.17).
Age was not associated with pneumonia/influenza, although
males were slightly more likely to have a visit for pneumonia/
influenza than females. Children at site 2 were least likely to
have a visit resulting in a pneumonia/influenza diagnosis, and
children at sites 3, 4, and 5 were more likely to have a
pneumonia/influenza diagnosis than children at the other
sites. High utilizers were much more likely to have an office
visit for pneumonia/influenza than non– high utilizers. The
HR comparing FV children with UV children was 0.13 (95%
CI  0.08 to 0.22), indicating that the FV children were
much less likely to have an office visit for pneumonia/influenza. This HR corresponds with a vaccine effectiveness of
87%. PV children were equally as likely as UV children to
have an office visit for pneumonia/influenza (HR  1.10;
95% CI  0.82 to 1.47).
The stratified analysis revealed that for those children
who had received 1 of their vaccine doses during the previous
season, the HR for ILI comparing FV and UV was 0.38 (95%
CI  0.28 to 0.51). For children who had not received a
vaccine dose during the previous season, the HR for ILI

comparing FV and UV was 0.18 (95% CI  0.14 to 0.23).
These HRs correspond with a vaccine effectiveness of 62% for
FV children who had received 1 of their vaccine doses during
the previous season and 82% for FV children who had received both of their vaccine doses during the 2003-2004
season.
REPEAT ANALYSIS DURING RSV SEASON. Table II gives the
results of the repeat analysis. The HR comparing FV children
and UV children was 1.93 (95% CI  1.65 to 2.26), indicating that FV children were more likely than UV children to
have an office visit for ILI between January 1, 2004 and
February 29, 2004.
DISCUSSION
Immunization with 2 doses of influenza vaccine is recommended for all 6- to 23-month-old children;2,8 however,
more data are needed regarding the efficacy and clinical
effectiveness of the vaccine in this population.7,14 This study
evaluated the clinical effectiveness of the influenza vaccine
specifically in the 6- to 21-month-old population. We found
that 2 doses of vaccine were 69% effective in preventing office
visits for ILI and 87% effective in preventing office visits for
pneumonia/influenza, a subset of ILI. One dose of vaccine
was not effective in preventing office visits for ILI or pneumonia/influenza.
The inactivated influenza vaccine’s efficacy based on
reduction of laboratory-confirmed influenza cases has been
assessed and yielded a broad range of results depending on
the study design and the influenza season. From a 5-year
randomized controlled trial studying 1 dose of vaccine in 1-
to 16-year-old children, Neuzil et al29,30 reported an overall efficacy of 77% (95% CI  20% to 93%) to 91% (95%
CI  64% to 98%) in preventing culture-positive illness
depending on the year and virus strain. Only a randomized
controlled trial by Hoberman et al12 specifically studied 6-
to 23-month-olds and found an efficacy of 66% (95% CI 
34% to 82%) for 2 doses during an epidemic year; however,
the efficacy was –7% (95% CI  –247% to 67%)in a
nonepidemic year.
The clinical effectiveness of the influenza vaccine based
on reduction of ILI has been evaluated previously in children
age 0 to 15 years also with mixed results depending on the
patient population, number of vaccine doses, influenza season,
method of ascertaining cases, and definition of ILI. Estimates
of effectiveness ranged from not effective to approximately
85% effective.15,31-33 Only 2 studies included a sufficient
number of young children to permit a separate analysis. Kawai
et al32 found that 2 doses of vaccine were 78.5% (P  .01)
effective against ILI in children under age 3 years. In a
retrospective cohort study conducted within a single large
HMO during the 2003-2004 season in Colorado, Ritzwoller
et al15 found that 2 doses of vaccine had an effectiveness of
25% against ILI and 49% against pneumonia and influenza
and that 1 dose of vaccine was not effective (3% against ILI
and 22% against pneumonia/influenza, with both 95% CIs
crossing 1).

Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness In Healthy 6- to 21-Month-Old Children During The 2003-2004 Season 759
The substantial variation in the results of clinical effectiveness studies may be explained by several factors, particularly the specificity of the case definition. The specificity of
ILI for influenza has been assessed in studies of mostly adult
subjects. Estimates of specificity ranged from 35% to 71% in
these studies comparing the clinical definition of fever and
cough with viral culture during different influenza seasons.34-36 The specificity of ILI for influenza is affected by the
severity and timing of the season and whether other pathogens, such as RSV, are circulating at the same
time.12,15,30,37,38 For seasons in which there is substantial
separation of influenza and RSV, assessing clinical effectiveness using encounter data is much more likely to yield meaningful results. Because ILI is more likely to represent illness
due to influenza during early and severe influenza seasons, the
unique 2003-2004 influenza season allowed us to examine
how immunization with the influenza vaccine affected health
care utilization without the problem of interference from
other respiratory pathogens.
The study of Ritzwoller et al15 is similar in design to
our study, yet their results suggest lower vaccine effectiveness. We used the same diagnostic codes; however, we
counted ILI from November 1, 2003 to December 31,
2003, and Ritzwoller et al counted illness from November
19, 2003 through December 7, 2003. The longer time
period allowed us to examine more cases of ILI and pneumonia/influenza, but these cases may be less specific for
influenza. Lower specificity for influenza would be expected to decrease vaccine effectiveness, so this difference
does not appear to explain our higher effectiveness estimates. Although their analysis controlled for chronic illness, their inclusion of children with chronic illness may
have lowered their effectiveness estimates compared with
ours, because children with chronic illness may be more
likely to seek care for any respiratory illness and thus may
have been more likely to receive an ILI diagnosis. In our
study, ILI was defined based only on office visits; Ritzwoller et al included hospital emergency department visits
as well as office visits. This would bias our results only if
immunized children are more likely than unimmunized
children to visit an emergency department rather than their
primary care physician for ILI. Finally, because the outcome in both studies was health care encounters rather
than laboratory-confirmed influenza, the estimates of vaccine effectiveness depend on the health care–seeking behavior of the patient population, which may have differed
between our patient population using private practices and
the Ritzwoller et al population enrolled in a HMO.
The results of the repeat analysis from January 1, 2004
to February 29, 2004 suggest that our estimate of vaccine
effectiveness during influenza season is plausible; however,
the finding that vaccination appeared to be a risk factor for
office visits after influenza season raises more questions. We
suspect that this latter finding may be related to differences in
parental behavior. Parents who ensure that their children are
immunized may be more likely to use the health care system.
If the vaccine was effective against influenza, then these
children may not have needed care during the influenza
season, but their parents may have been more likely to seek
care for noninfluenza illness, including RSV, occurring later.
Although we attempted to control for utilization behavior in
our analysis, our definition of utilization may not have adequately captured all differences in health care–seeking behaviors between groups.
Our study has several limitations. Most importantly,
billing codes were used to define cases, and we do not have
laboratory data to confirm that these were cases of influenza
rather than another respiratory or febrile illness. As described
earlier, using ILI to represent influenza infection has limitations that are partially mitigated by the characteristics of the
respiratory season in this study. In addition, the study population comprised children with a moderate to high socioeconomic status, which may limit generalizability to other
populations.
Our study has some important strengths. A large sample size with sufficient immunization rates allowed us to
adequately assess differences in effectiveness between 0, 1,
and 2 doses of vaccine. We used data from a single season, the
2003-2004 season, which was unique because it was earlier
and more severe than usual. Previous studies have demonstrated that estimates of vaccine efficacy and effectiveness are
more precise in severe seasons because of higher attack
rate.12,29 The early season increased the specificity of the
clinical outcome of ILI for influenza because influenza and
RSV overlapped only slightly.
Our data have important implications for practitioners. Our finding that 1 dose of vaccine does not appear to
be effective suggests that efforts to immunize 6- to 23-
month-old children should start early, because most children in this age group will require 2 doses of vaccine to
achieve full immunity. Health care providers must have
systems in place to ensure delivery of 2 doses; for example,
providers who are arranging immunization clinics should
plan to have at least 2 clinics 1 month apart before November. Providers could also use a system that would
automatically reschedule the second dose at the time of the
first dose or use a recall system for those who fail to return
for the second dose.
Given the logistical difficulty of immunizing 6- to 23-
month-old children with 2 doses of vaccine before the onset
of the influenza season, researchers have examined whether
young children could be given their first dose of influenza
vaccine in the spring. Englund et al10 recently reported that
previously unimmunized 6- to 23-month-old children who
were given their first dose of inactivated influenza vaccine in
the spring and their second dose in the fall had a similar
antibody response as children who were given both influenza
vaccine doses in the fall. As in our study, the study of Englund
et al was conducted during the 2003-2004 season, in which
the vaccine components were the same as the previous (2002-
2003) season. Although we found that 2 doses given in
separate seasons appeared to be less effective than 2 doses
760 Allison et al The Journal of Pediatrics • December 2006
given in the same season, both our study and the study of
Englund et al found that a single dose of vaccine does not
provide adequate protection against influenza in previously
unimmunized children. These data suggest that further evaluation of a spring–fall influenza vaccination schedule for
young children is warranted.
Our data demonstrate that 2 doses of influenza vaccine reduce health care utilization due to ILI, and our
effectiveness estimate for 2 doses of vaccine is comparable
with the effectiveness of influenza vaccine in adults as well
as the effectiveness of other recommended childhood vaccines.2,39,40 These data lend support to the recommendation for universal immunization against influenza in 6- to
23-month-old children.

THE RELATIONSHIP OF PARANATAL EXPERIENCES TO OXYGEN SATURATION IN NEWBORN INFANTS.
Pennoyer MM, Graham FJ, Hartmann AF, Jones B, Mccoy EL, Swarm PA, et al. J Pediatr 1956;49:685-98
This study evaluated the effects of obstetrical variables on oxygen saturation at delivery and at 10, 30, and 60 minutes
of life. The methodology involved the then newly developed spectrophotometric determination of oxygen saturation
using cord and then capillary blood samples. The researchers compared duration and depth of anesthesia, and fetal and
delivery complications, and they reported that cord saturations were higher in infants delivered following pudendal blocks
compared with inhalation or caudal blocks. The cord oxygen saturation varied from 10% to 90% with the most frequent
values between 60% and 69%, and capillary values between 80% and 90% at 10 minutes in their 232 vaginally delivered
infants. Their cord blood gas saturations were 61% (46%-70%) in their uncomplicated deliveries including those with
prenatal complications, compared with 54% in the infants with delivery complications, including the use of fundal
pressure, breech presentation, and prematurity. The mean saturation at 10 minutes was approximately 81%, and they also
reported that 29% of their prenatal complicated infants and 37% of the delivery complicated infants failed to achieve
saturations of 90% by 1 hour compared with 21% of the uncomplicated group. They noted that the presence of prenatal
complications alone did not lower the oxygen saturations at birth.
Fifty years later, we are still trying to determine the normal values for oxygen saturation at delivery and within the first
10 minutes of life, albeit using pulse oximeters. It is indeed impressive that Pennoyer et al using their techniques reported
values on more infants than any of the most recent studies using oximeter values following delivery. Recent studies have
reported that the oxygen saturation determined by pulse oximetry (SpO2) at 1 minute was 63% to 70% with a gradual
increase to 90% by 8 to 15 minutes.
We are now in the midst of the debate as to whether we should use oxygen, room air, or some blended value in
between for the resuscitation of newborn infants with difficulty at birth. It is important to remember that cord SpO2
values are normally approximately 50% to 55% in the noncompromised infant and increase to 90% by approximately 10
minutes of age. The best available current information indicates that the majority of term infants with asphyxia can be
safely and effectively initially resuscitated with room air, and that such an approach is associated with higher Apgar
scores, a shorter interval to initiate sustained breathing, and a lower mortality. The observations of Pennoyer et al
combined with those of more recent studies provide potential guidelines for the use of oxygen during resuscitation for
those infants whose oxygen saturations are significantly below the established limits of SpO2 during the first 10 to 15
minutes of life. It is astonishing how relevant and useful these observations remain 50 years later.
