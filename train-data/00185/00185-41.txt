Forty-three school children from 8 to 11 years old were vaccinated intranasaUy with two doses of a
paediatric attenuated influenza vaccine developed by reassortment between cold-adapted
A/Leningrad/134/57(H2N2) and an A/Brazil/11/78(HIN1)-like strain. Two vaccine doses were
administered I month apart in a randomized, blind, placebo-controlled study. Although the first
vaccine dose had a low infectivity titre, overall 65% of children who received two doses of vaccine
showed serological evidence of infection by HI tests. Serum IgA antibody responses against the
vaccine strain were detected in nearly 50 % of the vaccinees and serum lgG antibody responses were
detected in -~40% by an enzyme immunoassay.

Introduction
Live attenuated vaccines have been studied for many
years as an alternative to inactivated vaccines for
immunoprophylaxis of influenza. Most emphasis has
been placed on live vaccines prepared by genetic reassortment between contemporary wild-type strains and
so-called 'master strains' of type A(H2N2) influenza
that have been previously attenuated by adaptation to
replication at normally suboptimal temperatures 1-5. In
the USSR where cold-adapted influenza A live vaccines
have been widely used for a number of years in working-aged adults, a more highly attenuated version of the
vaccine has been developed for use in children 4'6-9.

In the United States, determining the class-specific
antibody responses in serum and nasal secretions of
volunteers infected with cold-adapted live influenza
vaccines has recently been emphasized l°m. However,
in the USSR the only data so far available about the
immunogenicity of the cold-adapted live vaccines have
been obtained by conventional serum haemagglutination-inhibition and neuraminidase-inhibition antibody
assays. This study was, therefore, organized to evaluate
whether class-specific IgG or IgA immunoassays using
purified haemagglutinin from the vaccine strain as antigen would provide new information about the efficacy
of the paediatric live-attenuated vaccine developed in
the USSR.
Materials and methods
Vaccine, dosage, administration
Live influenza vaccine strain A/47/251l(H1N1) was
prepared at the Institute of Experimental Medicine of
the Academy of Sciences, Leningrad, USSR by
recombination of the cold-adapted attenuated strain
A/Leningrad/134/47/57(H2N2) with the wild-type strain
A/Leningrad/322/79(H1N1), a virus strain similar to
A/Brazil/ll/78(H1N1) 6'7. The vaccine was prepared in
embryonated chicken eggs at the Institute for the Production of Microbiological Preparations, in Odessa.

Schoo/ children vaccinated with recombinant influenza virus: A.N. S/epushkin et al.
Before use, the lyophilized vaccine was diluted 1:2 with
distilled water as specified by the Production Institute
and 0.5 ml was administered intranasally to each child
using a Smirnoff's aerosol generator (Figure 1). The
droplet size was too large to pass into the lungs.
Distilled water (0.5 ml) was administered intranasally
as placebo to the control group of children. Vaccine
and placebo solutions were coded to preclude knowledge of the preparation given to each participant.
Differences in colour were, however, observable
between vaccine and placebo. Two doses of vaccine
were given 28 days apart. After the completion of
immunization, the infectivity of the vaccine was titrated
by inoculation of the allantoic cavity of chick embryos.
Study group
The study was conducted in September to December
1984 in a boarding school in Moscow. There were 107
healthy children 8 to 11 years old participating. Only
children without a history of current illness as judged by
clinical examination, including measurement of body
temperature, were enrolled. Consent to participate in
the study was obtained from guardians of children after
the protocol of the trial was reviewed and approved by
the Ministry of Public Health of the USSR, Public
Health Department of Moscow City Municipality, and
Public Health and Education Departments of the District of Moscow where the school was located.
The children of each class were randomly divided
into groups receiving vaccine or placebo. During the
first visit, 58 children received vaccine and 49 received
placebo. Of the 58 vaccinated children, 43 received
their second dose of vaccine, and 39 of 49 children
received their second dose of placebo.
All participants were bled three times by finger stick,
first before they received vaccine or placebo, then 28
days after they received the first and the second dose of
either the vaccine or placebo. Separated serum was
stored at -20°C.
Clinical observations
The reactogenicity of the vaccine or placebo was
studied by observing all children for 5 days after each
vaccination. Axillary body temperature was measured
once each day and the children were interviewed about
their subjective complaints. Children with complaints
or increased temperature were examined by a paediatrician who was unaware of the preparation administered to each child. Children absent from school were
visited at home to ascertain the reason for their absence
and to examine them if they were ill. Nasal secretions
collected from all children with an axillary temperature
higher than 37°C were tested by immunofluorescence
(IF) microscopy for antigens reactive with antisera
specific for influenza types A and B, adenovirus, parainfluenza type 1, 2, 3 and respiratory syncytial virus.
Serological tests
Haemagglutination inhibition (HI) tests were performed independently with separate coded aliquots of
the same sera in laboratories in Moscow and Atlanta.
Standard procedures were used after treatment of
serum samples with receptor-destroying enzyme.
A/Brazil/ll/78(H1N1) whole virus was used as test
antigen. In Atlanta class-specific immunoassays to measure serum IgG and IgA antibodies were also performed using enzyme immunoassay (EIA) methods
similar to those previously described a2. Wells of microtitre plates were coated with purified haemagglutinin
antigen from a high growth recombinant of A/Brazil/11/
78 virus (X71). The purified antigen was kindly donated
by Dr Patrick McVerry (Connaught Laboratories,
Swiftwater, PA). Monoclonal class-specific antibodies
HP6043 (IgG-specific) and HP6104/6107 (IgA-specific) 13 were used to detect human antibody bound to the
antigen in the plates 14. Endpoints in immunoassays
were defined as the highest serum dilution that gave a
positive over negative (P/N) ratio >2 and an absorbance of at least 0.1 in the positive well. For calculation
of theP/N ratio, the absorbance of a serum dilution in
the antigen-containing well (positive) was divided by
the absorbance of the same dilution of serum in the
blank, control well (negative). A fourfold increase, or
an increase of at least two dilutions over the starting
dilution, was considered significant for both HI and
EIA antibody titres.

Results
Infectivity titre of vaccines
The vaccine used for primary immunizations was
stored refrigerated for several months before use. After

reconstitution and use for vaccination in this study, it
was found to have a titre of about 102 EIDso m1-1.
Because of the unexpectedly low titre of this vaccine, a
second batch of the same lot was obtained directly from
the Production Institute for the second dose. The titre
of this batch was 107 EIDso m1-1.
Reactogenicity of vaccine
The number of children with general or local reactions, or increased temperature, after receiving either
the vaccine or placebo was low (Table 1). The respiratory symptoms occurred only in children from three of
the five classrooms but with equal frequency whether
they received vaccine or placebo. This suggested that
'reactions' were likely to be symptoms of coincidental
infections and not manifestations of the reactogenicity
of the vaccine. To confirm this, nasal aspirates were
collected from 10 children with postvaccination symptoms. In five of these, adenovirus was identified.
Another child had symptoms of bacterial tonsilitis.
After excluding these six patients from analysis, there
was no increase in potential reactions among children
who received vaccine compared with children who
received placebo. After the second dose, the children
receiving either vaccine or placebo exhibited the same
small number of reactions. Observed reaction rates
were not significantly different between vaccine or
placebo groups (p > 0.05).
Immunogenicity of vaccine
Only five increases in titre (combining results of all
tests) were seen in sera of the 43 children who received
the first dose of vaccine. This was not different from the
total of two increases in 38 recipients of placebo
(/7 > 0.05). The most probable explanation for the lack
of significant effect of the first vaccination was low
infectivity of the vaccine (see above). In contrast, the
second vaccination with a new batch of vaccine was
associated with seroconversions in 24 (56%) of 43
children. Similar immunogenicity was observed if resuits were analysed after excluding the seven children
with preexisting HI antibody titres />20. The differences in immunogenicity of the two vaccine doses were
also evident when the antibody prevalence and geometric mean titres detected by class-specific immunoassay were compared (Table 2).
Using a class-specific EIA, ~50% of the vaccinated
children had an influenza-specific IgA serological response and =40% had an IgG response. These rates
were not significantly different from each other, but all
were significantly greater (p < 0.05) than the seroconversion rates in the placebo group. The low seroconversion rates (=3-10%) among the placebo group probably represent the background level of error in the
laboratory tests. Cumulatively, antibody titre increases
to the influenza vaccine strain were detected in about
two-thirds of the vaccinated children by one or more of
the assay procedures. In contrast ~10% of the placebo
group showed significant seroconversion by one or
more tests. The HI data obtained in laboratories in
Atlanta and Moscow were similar and detected more
rises overall than the class-specific EIAs.
Discussion
This study confirms previous reports that cold-adapted
recombinant live influenza virus vaccine prepared from
the A/Leningrad/134/47/57 master strain is acceptably
attenuated for school children, as judged by the low

aResults are given as number positive/total number with the percentage in parentheses
Op < 0.05, compared to placebo group
ful vaccination. The results also show that the vaccine
should have an adequate infectivity titre for satisfactory
seroconversions. Because of the low infectivity titre of
the first vaccine dose, it is difficult to assess whether
two doses of vaccine are needed. Hence further evaluations will be required to establish the relative costbenefit of using two doses of live vaccine 1 month apart
rather than one dose of adequate infectivity.
Independent HI results in both participating laboratories agreed that after the second vaccine dose more
than half of the vaccinated children (56%) had been
infected by vaccine and seroconverted. This rate was
marginally higher (~-62%) in the children with an HI
titre ~<20 before vaccination. Immunoassay, using purified haemagglutinin as antigen, detected a few additional seroconversions to one or both immunoglobulin isotypes, usually in cases when only a twofold
increase in HI antibody was detected. Therefore, combining all results of three laboratory assays, a seroconversion rate of ~67% was detected in all children.
However, immunoassay was not by itself more sensitive
than HI. Most (80%) of those who were successfully
vaccinated, as measured by HI, had a fourfold or
greater increase in serum IgA antibody, whereas only
~58% of those successfully vaccinated had increases in
IgG antibody. The high levels of serum IgA may result
iri better protection from reinfection than serum IgG 15.
However, the relative benefit of IgA versus IgG antibody may decrease with time after vaccination 1° and
should be studied further. Nevertheless, the high percentage of IgA seroconversion levels induced by the live,
attenuated vaccine are consistent with results reported
by Wright et al. 11 who has also noted that inactivated
influenza vaccines rarely induce a serum IgA antibody
response. The serum IgA antibody levels may in fact
provide indirect evidence for the presence of secretory
antibody levels that are adequate for preventing virus
shedding 1°'15 and conferring maximum protection from
infection with wild-type virus.
