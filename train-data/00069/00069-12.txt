Abstract
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate postoperative morbidity with non-closure of the visceral and parietal peritoneum during caesarean section. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective randomized study of 170 patients. Operative time, postoperative pain, postoperative morbidity (febrile morbidity, wound haematoma, wound infection, postoperative ileus) and length of hospital stay were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: Duration of operation was significantly shorter without peritoneal closure (38.89 vs 42.00 minutes; P<0.05). Wound haematoma were more frequent when peritoneum was closed (P<0.029). There were no significant difference between the two groups for postoperative ileus, length of hospital stay, postoperative pain and other complications. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: We report the first French study on this subject. In this study, non-closure of both visceral and parietal peritoneum is associated with shorter operation duration and seems to reduce immediate complications. A long-term evaluation of morbidity, regarding adhesions is necessary.
