OBJECTIVE: To identify factors predicting failure of operative vaginal
delivery.
STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study of all women who underwent
a trial of operative vaginal delivery between 1993 and 2006. Vacuum extraction
or low forceps delivery were initially employed by physician´s preference, and in
cases of failed vacuum extraction either a cesarean section or a trial of forceps
delivery were performed.
RESULTS: 1) Out of 83,351 deliveries, the rate of operative vaginal delivery
was 6.1% (5,120/83,351), and vacuum extraction (n=4299, 84.0%) was more
common as the initial procedure compared with forceps delivery (n=821,
16.0%). 2) Failed operative delivery occurred in 8.6% (n=443) of these cases,
and was significantly less common with forceps delivery than with vacuum
extraction (10.0% vs. 1.3% p!0.001). 3) When vacuum extraction failed, a
trial of forceps delivery was undertaken in 72.6% (n=314) of the cases with a
3.5% failure rate. 4) Failure of operative delivery was significantly more
common in the case of macrosomia (8.9% vs. 2.6%, p!0.0001), persistent
occipito-posterior (4.3% vs. 2.6%, p=0.03), and in the absence of analgesia
(4.9% vs. 2.5%, p!0.001). 5) When analgesia was provided, the use of
intravenous opiates was associated with a lower failure rate compared with
epidural (1.2% vs. 2.6%, p!0.05). 6) On multivariate logistic regression
analysis, the choice of forceps delivery rather than vacuum extraction
(OR=0.37, 95% CI=0.19-0.72), use of analgesia (OR=0.40, 95%
CI=0.26-0.63), persistent occipito-posterior (OR=1.80, 95% CI=1.09-
2.96), and macrosomia (OR=2.16, 95% CI=1.17-3.98) were significant and
independent predictors of failed operative delivery.
CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that fetal weight and fetal head position
should be included in the evaluation that precedes operative vaginal delivery.
The use of analgesia should be encouraged prior to operative delivery.

OBJECTIVE: Data are conflicting regarding the efficacy of therapeutic
cerclage. Our objective was to determine whether therapeutic cerclage is more
efficacious in women with cervical insufficiency following a term delivery when
compared to those without a prior term delivery.
STUDY DESIGN: Demographic and obstetrical data were gathered prospectively on patients receiving a therapeutic cerclage defined as midtrimester
presentation with a cervical length !2.5 cm (ultrasound-indicated) and prior
PTD or cervical dilatation with prolapsing membranes (physcial exam-indicated). Delivery outcomes based on cerclage type were compared between
women with vs. without a prior term birth. Excluded were patients with uterine
anomalies, connective tissue disease, higher order multiple gestation or those
experiencing an indicated preterm delivery.
RESULTS: Patients with a history of a term birth (N=29) were similiar to
those without (N=34) in regards to maternal age (P=0.1), BMI, (P=0.6),
ethnicity (P=0.3), rate of twins P=0.8), and cerclage type (physical exam /
ultrasound indicated (44.8 vs. 38.2%, P=0.2)). Women with a therapeutic
cerclage and a history of a prior term delivery were significantly more likely to
deliver after 35 weeks as opposed to women with no prior term delivery (86%
vs 57%, OR=11.0 (95% CI=2.9, 40.3)). Consequently, multiparas also
delivered significantly larger fetuses than women with no history of a term
delivery (2828 +/981 vs 2402 +/1071, P=0.08 and experienced fewer
NICU admissions and/or perinatal deaths (19 vs 71%, OR=0.1 (95%
CI=0.03-.38)), with over half of NICU admissions for sepsis evaluation.
CONCLUSION: Patients who develop CI after a term delivery and have a
therapeutic cerclage have improved perinatal outcomes compared to patients
without a history of term delivery before presentation with CI.

OBJECTIVE: Obesity is associated with a lower rate of spontaneous preterm
birth (Hendler et al, 2005) but an effect of the disease on cervical insufficiency
(CI) has not been described. Our objective was to study the relationship
between body mass index (BMI) and gestational age (GA) at delivery in
patients with CI undergoing cerclage.
STUDY DESIGN: We reviewed our comprehensive database of patients
undergoing cerclage (N=175) for a well-characterized history of cervical
insufficiency (prophylactic), shortened cervix !2.5 cm with a history of prior
preterm delivery (PTD) (ultrasound-indicated) or prolapse of membranes
through the external os (physical exam-indicated). Excluded were patients
experiencing indicated preterm deliveries (N=22) and those with uterine
anomalies (N=5). Stepwise multivariate linear regression analysis was
performed to determine the relationship between prepregnancy BMI and
GA at delivery and univariate analysis was used to compare obese (BMI O30)
to normal weight (BMI!25) patients for outcomes of PTD!35 weeks and
GA at delivery.
RESULTS: After controlling for GA and cervical length at cerclage placement, cerclage type and indication, race, parity, and vaginal infections, BMI
remained significantly predictive of prematurity (coefficient:0.14, standard
error: 0.07, adjusted R2 = 0.18), such that every additional 1 kg/m2 of BMI
was associated with a 1 day reduction in GA at delivery (P!0.001). Rates
of PTD !35 weeks in obese vs. normal weight patients were significantly
higher (37.2 vs. 17.1%, OR=2.9 (95% CI: 1.2, 6.9) with lower mean GA at
delivery (33.0 C/9.2 vs 37.9 C/1.6 weeks, P=0.02).
CONCLUSION: There is an inverse correlation between BMI and GA at
delivery in patients with CI receiving cerclage that remains after controlling for
confounders. The findings are even more striking given the protective effect of
obesity on the risk of spontaneous prematurity.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the short term effects of peritoneal closure versus
non closure in patients undergoing primary Cesarean section (CS).
STUDY DESIGN: Prospective randomized double blind controlled trial
of women undergoing primary CS. Main outcome measures include operating
time, post operative febrile morbidity, wound infection and analgesic
requirements.
RESULTS: 389 women were enrolled in the study. 192 where allocated to
closure, and 187 to non-closure of the peritoneum. There were no significant
differences between the closure and the non-closure groups in regard to
duration of operation (42.4C/- 11.6 vs. 41.6C/5.6 minutes, p=0.51), wound
infection rate (10.4% vs. 7.4%, p=0.31), narcotic (1.3C/1.0 vs. 1.4, p=0.38)
and non narcotic (4.6C/- 2.8 vs. 4.5C/- 2.5, p=0.81) administrations, as well
as hospitalization days (4.1C/0.7 vs. 4.2C/0.8, p=0.75). Febrile morbidity
tended to occur less often in the closure versus the non-closure group (0.04%
vs. 0.08%, p=0.07).
CONCLUSION: Non closure of the peritoneum during CS had no significant
effect on operative and short term post operative outcome.
