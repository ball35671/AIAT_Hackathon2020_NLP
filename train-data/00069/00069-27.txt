Our purpose was to evaluate postoperativeopioid requirementsin the closure or nonclosure of
peritoneum at cesarean section. Eighty patients who were to undergo cesarean delivery were
randomly assigned to two groups. The operative technique was randomized to include either
nonclosure of both visceral and parietal peritoneum (study group) or closure of both layers
(control group). Operating time and duration of general anesthesia was recorded. The pain was evaluated at rest in the  rst 12, 24 and 36 h after operation. The amount of morphine used was recorded at the same hours. The mean operating and anesthesia time were signi cantly
longer in the control group than in the study group. Visual analogue scale (VAS) showed
no difference in postoperative pain comparing closure to nonclosure of the peritoneum but
patients of the control group required signi cantly more postoperative opioids. In conclusion,
nonclosure of the visceral and parietal peritoneum reduces operating time and postoperative
opioid medication.

Key words: Closure of peritoneum; nonclosure of peritoneum; postoperative pain; cesarean

introduction The adequate treatment of pain in the postoperative period is important not
only for humanitarian but also for physiological reasons. Pain has several
detrimental effects, and good pain relief may help to decrease postoperative
morbidity.1 Cesarean delivery is the most common intraperitoneal surgical
procedure in obstetrics and gynecology.2 Although the recent Royal College
of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) guidelines recommend nonclosure of peritoneum in many obstetric and gynecological operations, some
textbooks advocate closure of parietal peritoneum in vertical and transverse
incisions using delayed absorbable sutures.3 Nonclosure of the peritoneum
reduces operating time with possible bene ts including less exposure of
the operative  eld to exogenous micro-organisms and time saving in the
operating room. Moreover, the procedure is simpler than closure of the
peritoneum.4
According to Hojberg et al.5
the peritoneum is sensitive to pain and,

cesarean section.
methods After ethical approval and informed consent, 80 women undergoing elective
cesarean delivery were studied. The patients were randomized into two equal
groups. Before the operation the patients were instructed in the use of patient
controlled analgesia (PCA) pump (Abbott Pain Manager, Abbott Laboratries,
Chicago, IL; Provider TM) and visual analogue scale (VAS: 0 D no pain,
10 D worst pain).
After standardized general anesthesia, all surgical procedures were lower
segment transverse uterine cesareans and were done by the same surgeon.
The operative technique was randomized to include either nonclosure of both
visceral and parietal peritoneum (study group, n D 40) or closure of both
layers (control group, n D 40). The groups were matched for age, weight
and gestational age (Table I). Closure of the peritoneum was performed in a
uniform manner with continuous absorbable sutures. Operating time (from
incision to closure of the skin) and duration of general anesthesia (from the
 rst intravenous anesthetic administration to extubation) were recorded. In
the recovery room, intravenous PCA was applied (2 mg morphine loading
dose C 1 mg bolus dose C 10 min lock-out time) in all patients. The day
of cesarean section was considered as day 0. The VAS was measured 12,
24, and 36 h after operation. The amounts of morphine used were recorded
at the same hours. Hospitalization was de ned as the period from the day
of cesarean section to the day of discharge. Days of hospitalization were
recorded. All postoperative assessments were made by the same doctor who
did not know about the patients’ grouping. Statistical analysis was done with
the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). Data are presented as
mean § SD. The results were statistically compared by the Mann–Whitney
U-test and the student’s t-test; a p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically

results Table II shows the operative and postoperative course. The mean operating
time was signi cantly greater in the closed group (25:05 § 4:94 min) than
in the open group (19:05 § 3:13 min) (p < 0:05). Anesthesia duration was
signi cantly longer in the closed group (33:08 § 4:20 min) than in the open
group (26:48 § 2:83 min) (p < 0:05).
The VAS showed no difference in postoperative pain between closure and
nonclosure of the peritoneum. The use of opioids was about the same in the
 rst 12-hour period, but 24 h and 36 h after the intervention the nonclosure
group needed less opioids.

discussion This study examines the effects of the closure or nonclosure of the visceral
and parietal peritoneum at cesarean section. Postoperative opioid requirements was compared in the two groups. Our  ndings indicate that cesarean
section without suture reapproximation of the peritoneal cut edges provides
advantages. Pain medication requirements were lower in the nonclosure
group; operation and anesthesia times were signi cantly longer in the closure group than in the nonclosure group.
Postoperative pain is an important clinical problem that deserves great
attention by members of the surgical team. A number of postoperative
dysfunctions are related directly or indirectly to postoperative pain. The most
important of these are pulmonary, circulatory, gastrointestinal, and urinary
dysfunctions and thromboembolic events. The most important factors that
in uence the occurrence, intensity, quality, and duration of postoperative pain
are the site, nature, and duration of operation, the type of incision and the
amount of intraoperative trauma. Optimal surgical care also helps to decrease
the severity of the pain. Skillful and gentle handling of tissues, carrying
out the operation with dispatch, and observance of other surgical principles
minimize trauma.6
In this study, standard general anesthesia was administered to the patients.
All surgical procedures were lower segment transverse uterine cesareans the
only difference being closure or nonclosure of the peritoneum.
Closure of peritoneal defects after laparatomy has long been considered
a standard surgical procedure. Is peritoneal closure necessary? The arguments supporting peritoneal closure include the following: (a) restoration
of anatomy and approximation of tissues for healing, (b) re-establishment
of the peritoneal barrier to reduce the risk of infection, (c) reduction of the
risk of wound herniation or dehiscence, and (d) minimization of adhesion
formation. The arguments against peritoneal closure involve the following:
(a) nonclosure is not detrimental, (b) without re-approximation, peritoneum
heals rapidly, while suture and additional tissue handling may contribute to
adhesion formation and (c) reduced operating time and anesthesia is bene cial to the patient.7 Joure et al.8 said that nonclosure of the peritoneum
does not provoke more adhesion and may even be bene cial. Peritoneum is a Downloaded by [UQ Library] at 11:34 10 May 2016

mesothelial organ, and in contrast to epidermal repair, where healing occurs
gradually from wound borders, peritoneum heals simultaneously throughout
the wound, because mesothelial cells initiate multiple sites of repair.7
If the
peritoneum is left open, experimental studies have shown that a spontaneous
reperitonealization will appear within 48 to 72 hours after injuring the peritoneum with a complete healing after 5 to 6 days.5 Also, Gul et al.9 showed
that nonclosure of all layers of the uterus results in signi cantly less muscular
necrosis and endometrosis than closure in ewes.
Many studies on this argument have been carried out in humans. In the
study of Pietrantoni et al.10 only the parietal peritoneum and in the study of
Nagele et al.11 only the visceral peritoneum were left open, whereas Hull
and Varner,12 and Grundsell et al.,4
left both visceral and parietal peritoneum
unsutured, as in this study. Opioid requirements and postoperative pain in nonclosure and closure
groups were compared. Irõon et al.13 and Chanrachakul et al.14 reported
that no differences were found in the level of post-operative pain. Hull and
Varner12 found that pain medication requirements were higher in the closure
group. Nagele et al.11 suggested that nonclosure may be associated with
less postoperative abdominal pain, as they found that the need for opioids
was signi cantly greater when the peritoneum was closed. Hojberg et al.5
reported that the VAS scales showed no difference in postoperative pain
comparing closure to nonclosure of the parietal peritoneum but the use of
analgesics was lower in the nonclosure group. In this study it was found that
pain medication requirements were higher in the closure group, but the VAS
scales showed no difference between the two groups. It is not clear why the
postoperative analgesic need is less in nonclosed patients.
Operative times in nonclosure and closure groups were compared. Chanrachakul et al.14 reported no difference in the two groups. In agreement with
our  ndings, other studies reported a decrease in operating time in the open
group. Pietrantoni et al.10 noted a 5 min reduction in surgical time. Hull and
Varner12 noted an 8 min reduction in surgical time. Irõon et al.13 found a 6
min reduction in surgical time. Bhide3 said that this reduction may be statistically signi cant but is it clinically signi cant as well? We think that decrease
of the operation time is also clinically signi cant. Some studies have shown
that there was no difference in infectious morbidity in the closure and nonclosure groups.10,12 Also, according to these studies, the incidence of early
postoperative complications such as wound hematoma, wound dehiscence,
urinary tract infection and return of bowel function was similar in the closure
and nonclosure groups.10,14
Grundsell et al.4 suggest that economic bene ts amongst nonclosure subjects included shorter hospitalization period, less anesthesia, lower suture
costs and reduction of other expenses as a result of shorter operating time.
In summary, the results of our study indicate that nonclosure of the visceral
and parietal peritoneum might not only reduce operating time and anesthesia
exposure but also decrease the amount of postoperative opioids. The use of
less opioids in the open group in spite of the postoperative pain intensity
demonstrates that the use of opioids and probably of other analgesics is
determined not only by the intensity of the pain but also by other factors
such as stress, cognitive and emotional attitudes. With regard to our study, we may suppose that the longer operation time in the closed than in the
open group may also be more stressful. The closed patients therefore needed
more opioids 24 and 36 h after the intervention, when they were completely
conscious.
