OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine the effect of nonclosure of the visceral and parietal peritoneum during cesarean section on the formation
of adhesions.
STUDY DESIGN: This was a prospective randomized trial of 533
women undergoing primary cesarean section; in 256 the peritoneum
was left open and in 277 it was closed. Fifty women in the nonclosure
group and 47 women in the closure group were subsequently evaluated
intraoperatively at a repeat cesarean. The presence of adhesions and
their severity were evaluated at several sites.
RESULTS: The nonclosure and closure groups were comparable with
regard to the proportion of patients with adhesions at any site (60% vs
51%, respectively; P  .31). Time from incision to delivery was comparable in the nonclosure and closure groups (8.98  4.7 vs 9.32  5.2
minutes, respectively; P  .84).
CONCLUSION: Closure or nonclosure of the peritoneum at cesarean
section did not lead to large differences in the adhesion rate.
Key words: adhesions, cesarean section, peritoneum

Cesarean section is one of the most
frequently performed major surgical procedures worldwide. The surgical
approach of lower segment cesarean section has traditionally included closure of
the visceral and parietal peritoneum.1
Cited reasons for closure of the peritoneum include restoration of anatomy and
reapproximation of tissues, reduction of
infection by reestablishing an anatomical
barrier, reduction of wound dehiscence,
reducing hemorrhage, minimization of
adhesions, and continuation of what was
thought as standard.2,3 In contrast, peritoneal nonclosure is associated with reduced
operative time.4
The short-term effects of closure vs
nonclosure of the peritoneum were subject to several randomized prospective
studies. Analyzing the results of these
studies shows conflicting results regarding postoperative fever, wound infection, pain, and other important outcome
parameters.5-8
Gynecological surgery is associated
with a significant adhesion-related burden9 manifesting as chronic pain, female
infertility, and bowel obstruction. Postcesarean adhesions have been associated
with delayed delivery of infants at a repeat cesarean.10,11
The influence of closing the peritoneum in cesarean sections on the formation of adhesions is still not clear. Most
of the studies that were conducted provide conflicting results. Therefore, Cochrane reviewers determined that additional studies are required to determine
the influence of closing the peritoneum
on the later results of cesarean sections.12
The aim of our study was to assess the
effects of closure vs nonclosure of the
peritoneum on adhesion formations in a
prospective randomized trial.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The study was a randomized controlled
trial comparing the effect of closure with
nonclosure of the visceral and parietal
peritoneum on adhesion formation, as
assessed at a subsequent cesarean section. The study, conducted at Barzilai
Medical Center, Ashkelon, Israel, was
approved by the Ethics and Research
Committee, and written informed consent was obtained from all recruited
women. Prior to this study, our standard
technique did not include peritoneal closure. Of the 1150 women undergoing
primary cesarean section from May 2004
through May 2007, 533 consented to
participate and were randomly allocated
to closure or nonclosure (Figure). Reasons for exclusions were lack of consent by
the patient or an urgent cesarean not allowing time to elicit an informed consent,
previous pelvic or abdominal surgery, or
chorioamnionitis. The randomization sequence was computer generated, instructing the surgeon to leave the peritoneum
open or to close it.
Standard technique was performed in
all operations. The type of anesthesia was
chosen by the anesthesiologist without reference to the treatment group. Surgeries
were performed by an attending physician
with a resident, who were aware of the naFrom the Department of Obstetrics and

ture of the study. All surgeons were instructed to follow a standardized technique. The abdomen was opened by a
Pfannenstiel incision. A transverse lower
segment uterine incision was closed with 2
layers of continuous 1 polyglactin suture.
In the study group both the visceral and
parietal peritoneum were closed using a
continuous absorbable suture (polyglactin
2-0), while in the nonclosure group both
layers remained unsutured. Rectus muscleswere not closed. The use ofinterrupted
subcutaneous absorbable sutures (polyglactin 2-0) was left to the discretion of the
surgeon. The skinwas approximated using
staples. All patients received intraoperative prophylactic intravenous cefazolin (1 g).
Women subsequently returning for a
repeat cesarean (elective or emergency)
were evaluated intraoperatively for the
presence of adhesions by the attending
surgeon. Accrual continued until May
2010, when the predefined sample size
was reached. The surgeon was not
knowledgeable (blinded) as to the patient allocation. The presence of adhesions was evaluated at several sites: between the layers of the abdominal wall,
between the bladder and the abdominal
wall, between the bladder and the uterus,
between the uterus and the abdominal
wall, and between the bowels and the
pelvic organs. A score sheet was used. A
point of 0 was given if no adhesions were
present. Adhesions at any site were given
1 point (mild adhesions) if they could be
separated bluntly and 2 points (severe
adhesions) if sharp dissection (scissors)
was employed. If a single adhesion had
both a mild and severe component, it
was regarded as severe. An arithmetic
sum of all points at all sites was named
the “adhesion score.” Time from skin incision delivery was noted. The uterus was
routinely lifted through the abdominal
wall incision to facilitate its suture, and if
this was not feasible, due to adhesions, it
was recorded. The 2 study arms were
compared with regard to the presence of
adhesions at each site, the mean sum of
the adhesion score, the presence of difficulty in extraction of the uterus, and
time from incision to delivery.
Sample size was calculated based on
the primary outcome measure that was
the presence of adhesions. Assuming an
adhesion rate of 60% in the nonclosure
group, sample size was calculated for a
50% reduction of the adhesion rate, with
an alpha of 0.05 and a power of 80. Given
this calculation, the minimum size was
42 cases in each group. For statistical
analysis Student t test, Mann-Whitney
U, Pearson 2

gov (NCT01183000).
RESULTS
Of the 533 women randomized, 277
(52%) women underwent peritoneal
closure, and in 256 (48%) women the
peritoneum was not closed. The closure
and the nonclosure groups were comparable with regard to baseline characteristics (Table 1).
In all, 97 women, 50 in the nonclosure
group and 47 in the closure group, were
subsequently evaluated intraoperatively
at a repeat cesarean. Thus, only 18.2% of
the women were evaluable at a repeat cesarean during the study period; the other
women either delivered vaginally or had
no other deliveries.
The nonclosure and closure groups
were comparable with regard to the proportion of patients with adhesions at any
site (60% vs 51%, respectively; P  .31)
and the mean adhesion score (1.1  1.8
vs 1.5  1.9, respectively; P  .17). Time
from incision to delivery was comparable in the nonclosure and closure groups
(8.98  4.7 vs 9.32  5.2 minutes, respectively; P  .84) (Table 2).
COMMENT
In the current randomized prospective
study, there was no significant difference
in the prevalence of adhesions encountered at a repeat cesarean between women
who underwent closure of the peritoneum
during their first cesarean and those in
whom the peritoneum was left open. We
did not find a difference in either the grade
or location of adhesions. Time to delivery,
a corollary of difficult surgery, was similar
in the 2 groups.
Recently, a metaanalysis addressed the
issue of peritoneal closure at cesarean
and adhesion formation.13 Of the 11
studies, 3 satisfied the inclusion criteria
and were included; 2 studies were randomized trials;14,15 and 1 was not randomized.16 It is important to note that
most of the women were recruited from
the nonrandomized study (173 of 249).
Of 249 women included in the analysis,
110 had peritoneal closure during cesarean section, whereas the other 139 did
not have peritoneal closure. Metaanalysis was performed using the 2 randomized studies plus: (1) the unadjusted estimate from the nonrandomized study
and (2) the reported adjusted estimate,
adjusted for baseline differences in the
groups. Nonclosure of the peritoneum
during cesarean section resulted in a significantly increased likelihood of adhesion formation in both metaanalyses:

interval, 1.48 – 4.56; and [2], odds ratio,
4.23; 95% confidence interval, 2.06 –
8.69).13 Eight studies were excluded
from the metaanalysis due to their retrospective nature, lack of randomization,
lack of adequate scoring system, or additional adhesion-reducing intervention.
These excluded studies showed conflicting results in terms of the association between peritoneal closure or nonclosure
and adhesion formation.17-24
Peritoneal healing differs from that of
other epithelial tissues. In the healing process, the reepithelialization of peritoneal
surfaces occurs simultaneously throughout the surgical site, because mesothelial
cells migrate into supportive matrix and
initiate multiple sites of repair.2 This is in
contrast to epidermal repair, which gradually heals from wound borders. Mesothelial covering of defects occurs in approximately 3 days and complete surface repair
of the peritoneum is usually completed in
5-8 days. Adhesion formation is related to
suture material, tissue devascularization,
ischemia, infection, amount of manipulation, and degree of aseptic technique.25,26
The normal reparative process is profoundly influenced by ischemia. As so
many factors are involved in this complex
process, the contribution of peritoneal closure or nonclosure to adhesion formation
may be insignificant.
The advantages of our study include
randomized prospective methodology,
the sample size, and the blinding of the
surgeon in the second surgery in regard
to the type of the first surgery.
The limitations of the study include
the participation of several surgeons and
the inherent subjective nature in assessing severity of the adhesions. The influence of that component is attenuated by
using a uniform assessment and scoring
system. It should be noted that this study
by design addressed the value of closure
of both layers of peritoneum; the merit
of closure of only 1 layer was not addressed. Specific data on some factors
that may be associated with wound healing, such as diabetes, were not provided.
Nevertheless, such confounding factors,
as well as others, are potentially controlled by the randomization process.
The study was powered to identify a large
(50%) difference in the adhesion rate. A
much smaller difference may exist, and
such a difference may be meaningful.
Our results do not support a pivotal
role of peritoneal closure or nonclosure
at cesarean in formation of adhesions.
The study did not identify a large difference in the adhesion rate. Other means
of preventing adhesions may have a
more profound influence on adhesion
formation. f
