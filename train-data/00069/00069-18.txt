Objective: To determine the effect of closure or non-closure of the visceral peritoneum at cesarean delivery on
uterine scar formation assessed at repeat cesarean delivery. Methods: Women undergoing initial cesarean
delivery were allocated into 2 groups: group 1 underwent visceral peritoneal closure, while in group 2 the
visceral peritoneum was not closed. At repeat cesarean delivery 4 specimens from the initial uterine scar
were collected and assessed by light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Results: In group 1, 57% of
women had adhesions compared with 20.6% in group 2 (Pb0.05). Light microscopy revealed reactive
mesothelial hyperplasia (51.8% vs 13.7%), submesothelial fibrosis (48.1% vs 6.8%), and neoangiogenesis of
mesothelial stroma (44.4% vs 12%) in group 1 and group 2 patients, respectively (Pb0.05). Scanning electron
microscopy showed more patients with pericytes on the surface of microvessels in group 1 compared with
group 2 (26.3± 1.4 vs 11.5± 1.1 patients; Pb0.05). Conclusion: Closure of the visceral peritoneum at cesarean
delivery may produce an inflammatory reaction and adhesions, evidenced by reactive and regenerative
mesothelial hyperplasia and submesothelial fibrosis.

1. Introduction
Cesarean delivery is the most common obstetric intraperitoneal
operation, and the number of cesarean deliveries is increasing worldwide.
Although visceral peritoneal suturing is performed in many
countries, it is no longer considered to be essential in abdominal
wound closure [1]. Cheong et al. [2] concluded that short-term
morbidity is not related to non-closure of the peritoneum. Studies
on the effects of closure or non-closure of the peritoneum during
cesarean delivery on adhesion formation have concluded that
insufficient data were available and that adequately powered and
designed trials were needed [3,4].
Limitations of studies on the effect of suturing the visceral
peritoneum at cesarean delivery on scar formation concern the
inclusion of both gynecologic and obstetric operations, not distinguishing between parietal and visceral peritoneum, combining results
from scheduled and emergency cesarean deliveries, and not clearly
differentiating between the short- and long-term effects of peritoneal
suturing [1–4].
The aim of the present study was to assess the long-term effect of
visceral peritoneal closure at cesarean delivery on adhesion formation
either between the parietal peritoneum and visceral peritoneum or
between the bladder and uterus. Adhesion formation was assessed at
the time of a scheduled repeat cesarean delivery.
2. Materials and methods
The study was conducted at Santa Maria Hospital, Bari, and Vito
Fazzi Hospital, Lecce, Italy, between September 2003 and September
2007. The study was approved by the institutions' local ethics
committees and consisted of 2 parts: the first part was enrollment
to undergo an initial cesarean delivery performed by 1 of 2 methods;
and the second part was to check the effects of visceral peritoneal
closure on scar formation assessed during a repeat cesarean delivery.
The inclusion criteria for women undergoing an initial cesarean
procedure, always after 37 weeks of pregnancy, were breech or other
malpresentations, post-term pregnancy in women of advanced age, or
cesarean delivery on request. The exclusion criteria for enrollment in
this part of the study were women with any previous general or

gynecologic abdominal surgery and any of the following experienced
during the pregnancy: macrosomia; infection; anticoagulation therapy; pre-eclampsia; HELLP syndrome; emergency cesarean delivery;
ruptured membranes for more than 36 hours; placenta previa, and
other placental pathologies.
A total of 129 women were eligible to participate and 112 women
provided informed consent and were enrolled in the study. They all
consented to undergo the first cesarean delivery and a repeat cesarean
delivery in a subsequent pregnancy, avoiding a vaginal delivery after
cesarean.
All women had negative vaginal swabs at 34–36 weeks (for Group
B streptococcus, chlamydia, mycoplasma, and fungi).
Patients undergoing the initial cesarean procedure were consecutively allocated into 2 groups by the clinicians: group 1 underwent
visceral peritoneal closure, while in group 2 the visceral peritoneum
was not closed. Both groups of women were operated on by the same
physician group either standardizing the surgical method for homogeneity or by alternating the patients consecutively.
Patients received combined spinal–epidural anesthesia, following
an infusion of 500 mL of a plasma expander and 5 mg of intravenous
ephedrine (to prevent the hypotension).
They also received a prophylactic antibiotic dose of 2 g of cefazoline
intravenously. The initial cesarean procedure was performed using the
Misgav Ladach method in all patients, with a Joel-Cohen laparotomy
(JC-L), and a low uterine segment (LUS) incision using the Munro Kerr
method, according to the following surgical description.
Anatomical forceps were used to grasp the visceral peritoneum
around the vesico–uterine peritoneal serosal fold; a scalpel was used
to make a small midline incision in the visceral peritoneum, and both
index fingers were used to stretch it, laterally, in both directions for
about 4 cm and caudally for 3 cm to detach it transversely by the
surface of the uterus. The bladder flap was pushed down using fingers
or Doyen valves. A small transverse incision (about 2 cm) was made at
the superior part of the LUS, and it was gently stretched, using index
fingers, laterally in both directions, sufficiently enough to deliver the
fetus and stopping before the lateral uterine blood vessels. No intraabdominal sponges, towels, or swabs were used to minimize future
adhesions.
The fetus was delivered and the placenta was removed after it
delivered spontaneously. The uterus was exteriorized for only a short
period and the myometrium of the LUS was sutured in a single layer
using extra-endometrial continuous absorbable stitches of polyglactin
910 (Vicryl 0; Ethicon, Somerville, NJ, USA).
Hemostasis was performed at the hysterotomy site in both
methods; the peritoneum was handled using anatomical forceps and
the closure was done with continuous polyglactin 910 (Vicryl 00;
Ethicon).
Hemostasis on the uterine scar was performed using single Vicryl
00 stitches, except in 7 patients (4 in group 1 and 3 in group 2) where
hemostasis was done by application of Bengolea forceps and single
Vicryl 00 threads on the visceral peritoneal flap, avoiding the use of an
electro-scalpel.
In all patients the parietal peritoneum was closed with Vicryl 000;
the abdominal wall was closed by suturing the fascia, without suturing
the abdominal muscles.
The 112 women who consented to participate in the study
subsequently became pregnant again and, based on their decision to
avoid a vaginal birth after cesarean delivery, all underwent repeat
cesarean delivery.
In the repeat cesarean delivery procedure, the JC-L was used for
103 patients and the Pfannenstiel incision was used in 9 patients
owing to previous abdominal–pelvic adhesions found at the first
cesarean delivery (even if the distance was far from the LUS).
In the majority of cases the laparotomy was made at the previous
scar; the cesarean delivery was performed using the Misgav Ladach
method, as described above. After opening the abdominal cavity and
lyses of intraperitoneal subtle and connecting adhesions, the bladder
flap was visualized, cut by scissors, and pushed down using fingers.
The severity of the adhesions observed at repeat cesarean was
assessed using the Adhesion Scoring Method of the American Fertility
Society [5]; adhesions were graded as: none, mild (a filmy vascular
adhesion), or severe (a dense organized cohesive vascular adhesion).
The visceral peritoneal detachment was carried out just on the LUS
to expose the previous uterine scar. The LUS incision was made
directly on the previous cesarean uterine scar for histologic and
morphologic analysis. Samples were taken by sterile scissors of 4
complete thickness sections (from serosa to mucosa) cutting superior
and inferior edges: 2 samples (of approximately 5 mm depth) were
obtained from the superior edge and 2 from the inferior edge. The
delivery and closure techniques were as above.
The tissue samples were placed in Bouin solution for 24 hours;
the specimens were prepared in successive preparations of alcohol
solutions starting at 70% and, once the samples were clear of water,
they were fixed in paraffin wax.
Sections of 5-µm thickness obtained for each sample were stained
with hematoxylin-eosin, 0.05% periodic acid solution (PAS), and Masson
trichromic solution. Different preparation and fixation methods were
used to prepare the tissues for scanning electron microscopy for a
quantitative analysis of images (QAI), which allows assessment of the
quantitative morphology of the uterine visceral peritoneal microvessels.
The samples were stored for 6–10 hours in a 2% glutaraldehyde
solution in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer at pH 7.35 and subsequently
washed in tap water for 2–3 hours, dehydrated and treated with the
critical point drying technique, gold coated by a Denton apparatus and
then observed and photographed under a scanning electron microscope (JSM-35; JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) [6].
Quantitative analysis of images was performed to evaluate the total
area of each sample and changes in these areas using a Quantimet
Analyzer (Leica, Cambridge, UK). Examinations were performed
separately for each slice, allowing for evaluation of the standard
error of the mean (SEM). The values given represent the surface of
microvessels for each sample and are expressed in conventional units
(CU) ± SEM. Other information on CU (reference values) are reported
elsewhere [7].
The visceral peritoneal specimens were analyzed to evaluate the
stromal relationship on 20 fields at ×200 magnification to detect
the presence of adhesions between the parietal peritoneum and the
visceral peritoneum, mesothelial hyperplasia, fibrosis involving the
mesothelial stroma, and neoangiogenesis of the mesothelial stroma.
The presence of pericytes around the microvessel walls, at ×2000
magnification, was assessed by scanning electron microscopy.
For the initial cesarean procedure, assessment was made of
intraoperative blood loss (measured using a sterile vacuum aspirator
connected to a graduated container), operative time, bladder injuries
during the procedure, postoperative urinary dysfunction, and postoperative pelvic pain. Postoperative pelvic pain was defined as a
patient request for analgesics, which was managed by intravenous
injection of 30 mg of kerotolac or 100 mg of tramadol.

were analyzed using the χ2 test, and comparison of quantitative
variables was carried out using the t test and the Welch t test modified
as the variances are significantly different between two groups or for
matched samples, as appropriate.
3. Results
Of a total of 129 women eligible and invited to participate in the
study, 112 provided consent and were enrolled. There were 54 women
allocated to group 1 and 58 women to group 2 for the first cesarean
delivery procedure. The clinical characteristics of the two groups of
patients were similar (Table 1). All patients were white.
Closure of the visceral peritoneum was associated with a
significant increase in adhesions between the parietal peritoneum
and visceral peritoneum and between the bladder and uterus: 31
(57.4%) in group 1 had adhesions compared with 12 (20.6%) women in
group 2 (Pb0.05).
For the 31 women with adhesions in group 1, severity was mild in
22 women (70.9%) and severe in 9 patients (29.0%); whereas for the
12 women with adhesions in group 2, the severity was mild in 9
patients (75%) and severe in 3 women (25%).
The histologic characteristics of the samples are shown in Table 2.
There was a significant difference in the presence of reactive mesothelial
hyperplasia between patients in group 1 and group 2 (Pb0.05). Fig. 1
shows reactive hyperplasia while Fig. 2 shows normal mesothelium. A
significant difference was observed in the presence of fibrosis involving
the mesothelial stroma between patients in group 1 and group 2
(Pb0.05). Fig. 3 shows increased fibrosis seem in a group 1 patient and
Fig. 4 shows a group 2 patient. There was also a significant difference in
the presence of neoangiogenesis in mesothelial stroma between
patients in group 1 and group 2 (Pb0.05).
Scanning electron microscopy of microvessels in the visceral
peritoneal samples showed pericytes around their walls in 26.3± 1.4
patients in group 1 compared with 11.5± 1.1 patients in group 2
(Pb0.05). Fig. 5 shows scanning electron microscopy of microvessels
in a group 1 patient, while Fig. 6 shows a group 2 patient.
Intraoperative assessment and postoperative follow-up after the first
cesarean delivery showed significant differences between groups 1
and 2 (Table 3). More complications and adverse outcomes were
observed in group 1 compared with group 2; these included
intraoperative blood loss (286 mL vs 205 mL), operative time (43 min
vs 34 min), bladder injuries during the procedure (3 vs 0 patients),
postoperative urinary dysfunction (5 vs 2 patients), and postoperative
pelvic pain (7 vs 1 patient), respectively. The intraoperative urinary
injuries occurred during bladder flap dissection and they were bladder
traumas with bladder opening (immediately sutured during cesarean
delivery).
Most patients were discharged from hospital on the fourth
postoperative day without major complications, except for 8 (7.1%)

were discharged on the seventh day.
4. Discussion
Inflammation of the peritoneum was found in more patients who
had visceral peritoneal closure (group 1) compared with those in
whom the visceral peritoneum was not closed (group 2). Reactive and
regenerative mesothelia hyperplasia and submesothelial fibrosis were
observed, which are important factors in postoperative adhesion
formation and are associated with an increase in complications and
adverse outcomes. In group 2 patients, an increase in submesothelial
connective tissue and a lower percentage of adhesions were
associated with fewer complications during recovery and an improved
repair and replacement process.
Many studies on peritoneal suturing do not distinguish between the
visceral and parietal peritoneum. In 1965, Ellis et al. [8] reported that the
closure or non-closure of both layers of the peritoneum influences
adhesion formation by effects on mesothelial repair. Recent studies in
animals showed the short-term benefit of not suturing the visceral
peritoneum [9,10] and other microscopic studies on peritoneal
regeneration showed new peritoneal cells deriving from the mesodermal cells of the underlying granulation tissue, and mesenchymal
multipotent cells are able to form fibroblast or mesothelial cells
depending on environment [11,12].
In rats, suturing of peritoneal wounds significantly increased
adhesions compared with non-closure and, in rabbits, adhesions occur
after visceral peritoneal closure more frequently than after parietal
peritoneal closure [9].
Torre et al. [10] showed that two different stimuli are necessary for
adhesion formation: a direct lesion of the mesothelial layers and a
solid substrate, such as a foreign body (stitches). The conclusion of
these experimental studies is that the repair process is improved
without peritoneal suturing owing to the lower inflammatory
reaction, less tissue necrosis, and the absence of stitches [12].
The short-term positive clinical effects of non-closure of the
visceral peritoneum, such as duration of operation, febrile morbidity,
bowel functioning, requirement for drugs, less postoperative pain, and
duration of hospital stay, have already been recorded [13–16]. Two
studies found that suturing the visceral peritoneum does not seem to
be an essential step in cesarean delivery [17,18], because closure
frequently creates small fluid collections in the upper part of the LUS
[19].
The incision and detachment of the bladder during cesarean
delivery leads to a space (or pocket) between the anterior uterine
wall and posterior bladder wall [20], which can contain fibrin, clots,
exudates, edema or serous fluids.
Suturing of the visceral peritoneum can lead to a closed pocket
known as a “bladder flap hematoma,” which is a common site for
collection of non-draining fluid and fibrosis of the submesothelial
stroma (both causes of inflammation), and a site for adhesion
development between the bladder and uterus [16], a cause of possible
bladder injuries [21] and a reason for neoangiogenesis [22].
Moreover, the neoangiogenesis of submesothelial stroma, evidenced at the repeat cesarean delivery, produces surgical bleeding and
trauma during the detachment of the bladder from the LUS [20,23].
The delayed discharge of 7.1% of patients because of fever was more
common in group 1 patients and was probably due to bladder flap
hematoma, filled by blood and wound secretions from the uterine
incision, which spontaneously drains in a few days [23].

Therefore, visceral peritoneal closure at cesarean delivery causes
tissue trauma resulting in regenerative mesothelial hyperplasia,
fibrosis of the submesothelial stroma, and adhesions between the
posterior bladder wall and the LUS [24]. In a repeat cesarean delivery,
these adhesions can cause surgical difficulties and complications [25].
In conclusion, the preliminary results of the present study support
the recommendation that the visceral peritoneum should be left open
at cesarean delivery because closure produces inflammatory reactions, based on submesothelial fibrosis and enhanced by foreign body
suture materials, with adhesions strengthened by regenerative
mesothelial hyperplasia after the peritoneal suture.
This investigation links histopathology to clinical outcomes,
supports a mesenchymal reaction as the basis for adhesion formation,
and is complementary to previous studies that have shown a shortterm benefit of non-closure of the visceral peritoneum at cesarean
delivery. Non-closure seems to be associated with less adhesion
development and neoangiogenesis at the hysterotomy site and fewer
intraoperative complications, which is associated with improved
postoperative outcome at repeat cesarean delivery.
