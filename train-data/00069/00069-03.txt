Objective In women undergoing delivery by caesarean section, do
the following alternative surgical techniques affect the risk of
adverse outcomes: single- versus double-layer closure of the
uterine incision; closure versus nonclosure of the pelvic
peritoneum; liberal versus restricted use of a subrectus sheath
drain?
Design Pragmatic, 2 · 2 · 2 factorial randomised controlled trial.
Setting Hospitals in the UK and Italy providing intrapartum care.
Population Women undergoing their first caesarean section.
Methods The interventions were alternative approaches to the
three aspects of the caesarean section operation. A telephone
randomisation service was used. Surgeons could not be masked
to allocation, but women were unaware of which allocations had
been used. The analysis was by intention-to-treat, with a
prespecified subgroup analysis for women ‘in labour’ or ‘not
in labour’ at the time of caesarean section.
Main outcome measures Maternal infectious morbidity.
Results A total of 3033 women were recruited. Overall, the risk of
maternal infectious morbidity was 17%. For each pair of
interventions, there were no differences between the arms of the
trial for the primary outcome: single- versus double-layer closure
of the uterine incision [relative risk (RR) = 1.00, 95% confidence
interval (95% CI) = 0.85–1.18]; closure versus nonclosure of the
pelvic peritoneum (RR = 0.92, 95% CI = 0.78–1.08); liberal
versus restricted use of a subrectus sheath drain (RR = 0.92,
95% CI = 0.78–1.09). There were no differences in any of the
secondary morbidity outcomes and no significant adverse effects
of any of the techniques used.
Conclusions These results have implications for clinical practice,
particularly in relation to current guidance on the closure of the
peritoneum, which suggests that nonclosure is preferable. The
potential effects of these different surgical techniques on longer
term outcomes, including the functional integrity of the uterine
scar during subsequent pregnancies, are now becoming
increasingly important for guiding clinical practice.

Introduction
Caesarean section is one of the most common operations
undertaken worldwide. In Latin America, the median rate
of caesarean delivery is 33%.1 The global rate of caesarean
section is not known, but, if it is 10%, 13 million caesarean
sections are performed each year, equivalent to 24 each
minute.
The surgical techniques used at caesarean section vary
between surgeons, and few of these techniques have been
evaluated in randomised controlled trials. The existing
trials have been reviewed and, of 44 technical aspects of the
operation, six had ‘good evidence’ and three had ‘fair
evidence’ to make clear recommendations about their use.2
A survey of practice in the UK in 1999 asked obstetricians to nominate aspects of the caesarean section operation that they would like to see evaluated in a randomised
trial.3 This report contains the outcome of this trial.
Methods
The CAESAR study was a pragmatic, 2 · 2 · 2 factorial,
multicentre, randomised controlled trial, designed to evaluate two alternative approaches to three aspects of the technique of caesarean section.

General obstetrics
The trial assessed the following null hypotheses. In
women undergoing delivery by caesarean section, no differences would be detected with respect to maternal infectious
morbidity when comparing the following three pairs of
alternative surgical techniques: single- versus double-layer
closure of the uterine incision; closure versus nonclosure
of the pelvic peritoneum; liberal versus restricted use of a
subrectus sheath drain.
Women were eligible if they were undergoing delivery by
their first caesarean section, this was planned to be performed through the lower uterine segment and there was
no clear indication for any particular technique to be used.
The only contraindication to participation was an age of
<16 years.
All women provided written informed consent. A telephone randomisation service was employed to allocate the
interventions using a minimisation algorithm to ensure
comparability between women with respect to three
prognostic factors: participating centre; ‘in labour’ or ‘not
in labour’; single or multiple pregnancy. Participants were
enrolled by the clinicians providing care for women about
to undergo their caesarean section. The allocation provided
by the randomisation service was made available to the
operating surgeon prior to the onset of surgery.
Details of the clinical management used are described
in the CAESAR study protocol (www.npeu.ox.ac.uk/trials/
CAESAR). In summary, the trial interventions were as
follows.
1 Single- versus double-layer uterine closure. Single-layer
closure involves bringing both edges of the uterine incision together with a single layer of sutures. In double-layer
closure, the uterine incision is closed with two layers of
sutures. The first layer opposes the endometrial aspect of
the uterine muscle layer and the second brings together
the serosal layer.
2 Closure of the peritoneum. This refers to closure of the
pelvic peritoneum (the layer of peritoneum overlying the
uterine incision).
3 Liberal versus restricted use of a subsheath drain. We
recognised that clinicians would feel uncomfortable
using a subsheath drain if the abdominal wound had
excellent haemostasis. Similarly, if the wound continued
to ooze following appropriate haemostatis procedures,
clinicians would use a drain. Hence, the intervention
was to liberal or restricted use of the drain.
All nonallocated surgical elements and all other aspects
of the caesarean section procedure were performed at the
discretion of the surgeon. In particular, there were no
restrictions on the type of suture material that could be
used, and standard measures to effect haemostasis were
employed regardless of the allocated intervention. Each
participating centre initiated and maintained a training and
accreditation programme which ensured that all personnel
involved in undertaking caesarean sections were competent
in the techniques being compared before they were able to
recruit women into the trial. During the training, it was
made clear that obstetricians should not vary other aspects
of their surgical approach depending on the allocation. For
example, regardless of whether the woman was allocated
single- or double-layer uterine closure, the suture material
used should be the same.
The following outcomes were collected from all women
participating in the trial up to the time of the 6-week
follow-up assessment after the caesarean section. The primary outcome was maternal infectious morbidity, defined
as having one or more of the following: (i) antibiotic use
for maternal febrile morbidity during the postnatal hospital
stay; (ii) endometritis; (iii) wound infection treated with
antibiotics. Although not all the trial interventions might be
expected to affect all components of the primary outcome
equally, factorial trials have largely used a single primary
outcome for all of the factorial components. It was anticipated that each of the trial interventions would be expected
to contribute to a substantial part of the composite primary
outcome, making it justifiable to have a composite consisting of these aspects of infectious morbidity. For example,
the use of a subsheath drain may be expected to make a
greater difference than single- versus double-layer closure of
the uterus to the risk of wound infection, but single- versus
double-layer closure of the uterus may be expected to make
a greater difference to the risk of endometritis.
Secondary outcomes included the individual components
of the primary outcome, as well as further operative procedures on the wound, pain, blood transfusion, breastfeeding
at hospital discharge and at 6 weeks, and other severe or
unexpected maternal morbidity.
Sample size
In a meta-analysis of 68 trials of antibiotic prophylaxis at
caesarean section involving over 10 000 women, the incidence of febrile morbidity/endometritis in the antibiotic
prophylaxis group was 13%.4 Prior to the start of the trial,
we therefore anticipated that the incidence of antibiotic use
for febrile morbidity would be approximately 12%. This
combined primary outcome of febrile morbidity/endometritis was defined as either any antibiotics prescribed as
treatment for maternal fever (temperature of >39C on any
occasion or >38C on two or more successive days. Antibiotics prescribed for prophylaxis, such as those given for
Group B streptococcus carriage, were not included), or any
clinical diagnosis of endometritis made in hospital, which
was treated with antibiotics within 6 weeks of the caesarean
section.
A sample size of 3500 women was therefore necessary
to demonstrate a change in the incidence of the primary

outcome between any pair of arms from 12% to 9%, with
80% power and a two-sided significance level of 5%. The
sample size estimation was based on the detection of differences in the main effects of the interventions and not the
interactions between them.
Data analysis
Data were collected from the hospital notes up to the time
of hospital discharge. Women were then sent a questionnaire to complete 6 weeks after the date of caesarean section. In this questionnaire, they were asked to record
whether antibiotics or additional painkillers had been prescribed during the postnatal period and, if so, to give the
reason. Responses were coded by two clinicians (PB and
EA), independently, without knowledge of the trial allocation.
Patients were analysed in the groups to which they were
assigned, regardless of deviation from the protocol or treatment received. Comparative statistical analysis entailed the
calculation of the relative risk (RR) plus the 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for the primary outcome and 99%
CI for the secondary outcomes to take account of multiple
comparisons. Pairwise interactions between the different
interventions were examined. Most of the results are presented using the numbers allocated to each pair of interventions including all those allocated, irrespective of
allocation to the other pairs of interventions (i.e. the six
margins of the 2 · 2 · 2 table).5,6 In addition, three prespecified subgroup analyses were intended, based on the
primary and key secondary outcomes, stratified by ‘in
labour’ or ‘not in labour’ caesarean section, single and
multiple pregnancy and compliance with the subsheath
drain comparison by quartile of compliance.
An independent Data Monitoring and Ethics Committee
(DMEC) monitored the effectiveness and safety on a regular
basis (at least annually). DMEC employed the Haybittle–Peto
approach for interim analyses using three standard errors as
the cut-off for early cessation, preserving the type I error rate
across the trial.7
Research ethics committee approval
The trial sponsor was the University of Oxford. Multicentre
Research Ethics Committee approval for the trial was given
by the Eastern MREC (99/5/62), and all participants gave
informed consent to participate. The trial was registered
(ISRCTN number 11849611).
Role of the funding source
The trial was funded by the NHS South East Region
Research and Development Office. The funding source had

Results
Between November 2000 and June 2006, 3033 women were
randomised into the study in 45 UK and two Italian centres. Two centres elected to participate in two rather than
all three of the pairs of alternative interventions; hence, the
denominator for the pairs of interventions varies slightly.
The total population recruited was less than originally
anticipated. The recruitment period lasted for 5 years and
7 months. This lower than anticipated recruitment rate was
a consequence of the training and accreditation programme. The recruitment period was 32 months longer
than planned and the combination of a lack of funding
and trial fatigue led the Trial Steering Committee (TSC) to
recommend premature closure at approximately 3000
women. Assuming that the primary outcome would be
observed in 12% of women, a trial of 3000 women would
allow us to detect an RR reduction of 27% with 80%

power (rather than an RR reduction of 25% as originally
planned).
Following the first meeting of DMEC when data from 600
women were reviewed, DMEC informed TSC that, instead
of a primary event rate of around 12%, the event rate was
closer to 1%. TSC recommended changing the primary
outcome from the original composite of febrile morbidity/
endometritis to include all infectious morbidity into a combined primary outcome, i.e. the original primary outcome
of febrile morbidity/endometritis plus wound infection.
This would produce a revised event rate of approximately
12%. This amendment to the trial protocol was agreed by
the funding source, the sponsor and the research ethics
committee.
After randomisation, but prior to caesarean section, two
women withdrew consent and 30 women had a vaginal
delivery. These women were evenly distributed amongst the
trial arms, and these 32 women (1%) were excluded from
the analysis. Trial entry and discharge data were available
on over 99% of women and 6-week data on up to 90% of
women (Figure 1).8
The characteristics of the women at trial entry are
broadly similar (Table 1). The mean age of the women was
31 years, two-thirds were primiparous, about one-third
underwent an ‘in labour’ caesarean section and about 95%
had a singleton pregnancy.
Compliance with the single- versus double-layer uterine
closure and closure versus nonclosure of the pelvic peritoneum was high (at least 93%). Compliance was poorer for
the liberal use of a subrectus sheath drain, for which a
drain was used in 63% of women allocated to liberal use
(Table 2). The main reasons for noncompliance with the
liberal use of a subrectus sheath drain were clinical, mainly
because there was good haemostasis (n = 374, 75% of those
noncompliant).
The nonallocated clinical aspects of the caesarean section
were compared between the arms of the study in order to
assess whether the allocated interventions had an effect on
other aspects of the surgical procedures used. There was a
difference in relation to closure of the parietal peritoneum
within the pelvic peritoneum comparison. For women allocated to closure of the pelvic peritoneum, more operators
also closed the parietal peritoneum (23%) than if they were
allocated to nonclosure of the pelvic peritoneum (7%)
(Table 3).
The risk of maternal infectious morbidity varied only
slightly (between 16% and 18%) according to the trial arm.
For each pair of interventions, there were no differences
between the arms of the trial for the primary outcome or any
of the secondary outcomes (Table 4). There was evidence of
a strong positive (multiplicative) interaction (P = 0.006)
between closure of the peritoneum and use of a subrectus
sheath drain on the primary outcome, such that, in women
allocated liberal use of a subsheath drain, there was a higher
risk of the primary outcome associated with nonclosure of
the pelvic peritoneum (20.8% versus 14.8%), whereas, in
women allocated to restricted use of a subsheath drain, there
was a lower risk of the primary outcome associated with
nonclosure of the pelvic peritoneum (15.6% versus 17.7%).
This interaction was also apparent for the outcome of wound
infection treated with antibiotics (P = 0.01) and duration of
the caesarean section (P = 0.005) (see Tables S1 and S2).
When the effect of varying levels of compliance with the allocation of subsheath drain between centres was explored,

there was no evidence that increasing compliance increased
the difference between the two groups.
For the pelvic peritoneum comparison, the effect of differential closure of the parietal peritoneum on the outcomes
was adjusted for in the analysis, and the Mantel–Haensel
risk ratio for the primary outcome was 0.95 (95% CI = 0.78–
1.15), which is similar to the crude risk ratio of 0.92 (95%
CI = 0.76–1.10). Similarly, this adjusted analysis produced
no differences in the estimate of effect for any of the secondary outcomes (Table 4).
Twelve serious adverse events were reported, and these
occurred equally in all arms. These included three women
who required hysterectomy to control bleeding and three
additional women who required blood transfusions of >4
units.
When the study outcomes were analysed according to the
eight randomised groups, there were no significant differences between the groups for any outcomes (data not
shown). A prespecified subgroup analysis was performed for
the comparison of liberal versus restricted use of a subsheath
drain. In this analysis, centres were divided into quartiles of
compliance (0–65.5%, >65.5% to <83.3%, 83.3% to <94.4%,
>94.4%). There was no evidence of any effect on the primary
outcome or the secondary outcomes by compliance. Finally,
the effect of each intervention on the study outcomes did not
vary according to whether the caesarean was ‘in labour’ or
‘not in labour’, and there was no evidence of an interaction.
A prespecified subgroup analysis by singleton versus multiple
pregnancy was not performed owing to the small number of
multiple pregnancies (155, 5%).
Discussion
CAESAR is the largest randomised trial of caesarean section
surgical techniques undertaken to date, and provides
important evidence to guide clinical practice. Mounting
such a large surgical trial presented a number of challenges,
including the need to ensure adequate competency of the
operators in surgical techniques which may have been
unfamiliar, particularly single-layer uterine closure. This
step was important to limit concerns that the comparisons
between groups may have been affected by operator experience or competence,9 but it did introduce a substantial
delay in the recruitment of operators, and therefore the
recruitment of women.
Despite lower than anticipated recruitment, the event
rate for the primary outcome was higher than that used in
the estimation of the sample size, and so the power for

detecting the main effects of the arms of the trial should
not have been adversely affected. For most of the comparisons, there was no statistically significant interaction
between the trial arms, although it should be noted that
the trial had relatively low power to detect interactions.
Although there were no differences detected between the
randomised interventions, the results of CAESAR do have
implications for clinical practice, particularly in relation to
current guidance about closure of the peritoneum at the
time of caesarean section repair. Guidance in the UK10 recommends that both layers of the peritoneum should not be
closed, as this is associated with a lower risk of morbidity
based on existing evidence.11 The data from CAESAR demonstrate that there are no differences in any of the shortterm morbidity outcomes associated with closure versus
nonclosure of the pelvic peritoneum at caesarean section,
although there is a difference in the duration of surgery
(mean difference, 2.4 minutes; 95% CI, 1.3–3.6 minutes),
favouring nonclosure. However, the duration of surgery is
a poor surrogate for morbidity, as there will be a lower
threshold below which duration is associated with greater
morbidity.
As there were no apparent differences in any of the
short-term outcomes, the potential effects of these surgical
techniques on longer term outcomes, such as the functional
integrity of the uterine scar during subsequent pregnancies
and effects such as chronic pelvic pain, infertility, peritoneal adhesions and obstruction, become of increasing
importance for guiding clinical practice. Long-term outcomes, even if uncommon, are likely to have a substantial
impact on morbidity, and can occasionally result in lifethreatening events or even death. There have been three
follow-up studies of existing trials of caesarean section
techniques.12–14 The sample sizes of these studies are small,
and included only 18% of the women randomised into the
original trials for two studies,12,13 and 51% for the third.14
In the only study comparing single- versus double-layer
uterine closure, no differences were found in interpregnancy interval, vaginal delivery, length of hospital stay, preterm
delivery, amnionitis, postpartum endometritis, placental
abruption, postpartum haemorrhage, blood transfusion or
uterine dehiscence. This was based on a sample size of 145
women of the 906 randomised in the original trial.13 From
the two follow-up studies of trials comparing closure versus
nonclosure of the peritoneum (209 women in total), no
differences were observed in terms of intra-abdominal
adhesions, abdominal pain, dyspareunia, constipation, urinary symptoms and infertility.14
Given the relatively low incidence of uterine rupture
(0.4–0.6% for women undergoing a trial of labour versus
0.2% for those having elective repeat caesarean) and dehiscence (1.1%),15–17 attempts to detect differences in these
outcomes between different surgical techniques with adequate power is challenging. One large observational study
has looked at this outcome and found an association with
previous single-layer uterine closure.18

This lack of adequate long-term follow-up and the
absence of short-term effects of these techniques raise
important issues about current clinical guidance. The lack
of differences between the interventions in the short term
may suggest that any one of the three pairs of approaches is
acceptable. However, there have been suggestions that nonclosure of the peritoneum may be harmful in the longer
term. It is possible, therefore, that clinical guidance may
dictate19 a course of action, such as continued recommendation for nonclosure of the peritoneum, which may be
harmful in the longer term, and this information will not
be available until follow-up of trials, such as CAESAR, are
completed. In the meantime, there are difficult decisions to
be made if clinical guidance is to be provided to clinicians
about the surgical techniques used at caesarean section.
Conclusions
These results have implications for clinical practice, particularly in relation to current guidance about closure of the
peritoneum, which suggests that nonclosure is preferable.
The potential effects of these different surgical techniques on
longer term outcomes, including the functional integrity of
the uterine scar during subsequent pregnancies, are becoming increasingly important for guiding clinical practice.
