Abstract
OBJECTIVES: To study types of new mode cesarean section (CS) and its clinical value. METHODS: Four hundred and sixty-eight pregnant women with operative indications were randomly divided into three groups: the new mode CS group whose peritoneum was not sewed, the new mode CS group whose peritoneum was sewed, and the lower segmental CS group. The duration of operation, bleeding volume, morbidity after operation, and B type ultrasound for examining the incision were observed. RESULTS: There were significant difference in the duration of operation, bleeding volume, and morbidity after operation between the lower segmental CS and the two types of the new mode CS (P < 0.05). There was no significant differences in the bleeding volume and morbidity after operation between the two types of the new mode CS (P > 0.05), but there were significant difference in the duration of operation and the incision examined by B type ultrasound (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The new mode CS has shorter operative period, less bleeding, weak pain, faster recovery of peristalsis, and lower incidence of post-operative morbidity.
