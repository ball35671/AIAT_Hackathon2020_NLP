OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to determine whether nonclosure of the visceral peritoneum at low
transverse cesarean delivery has advantages over suture peritonization with regard to postoperative
morbidity.
STUDY DESIGN: A prospective randomized trial of 549 women undergoing cesarean section was carried
out; 262 were randomized to nonclosure and 287 to closure of the visceral peritoneum. Perioperative,
intraoperative, and postoperative management decisions were made without reference to treatment
groups. Statistical analysis compared intraoperative and postoperative outcome between the two groups.
RESULTS: Operating and anesthesia times were significantly shorter in patients receiving nonclosure.
The incidence of febrile morbidity and cystitis and the need for antibiotics and narcotics were all
significantly greater when the peritoneum was closed. Hospital stay was significantly shorter after
nonclosure.
CONCLUSION: Nonclosure of the visceral peritoneum is associated with lower febrile and infectious
morbidity. Routine closure of the visceral peritoneum should be abandoned at cesarean delivery. (AM J
OBSTET GYNECOL 1996;174:1366-70.)
Key words: Cesarean delivery, peritoneal closure, postoperative morbidity
Cesarean delivery is the most common intraperitoneal
surgical procedure in obstetrics and gynecology. 1 Reapproximation of the visceral peritoneum after closure of
the low transverse uterine incision has been widely performed on a routine basis, the theory being that suture
peritonization is an important measure to separate the
bowel from the wound cavity, thereby preventing adhesion formation. However, the advantages of this technique have not yet been proved by prospective randomized trials. In fact, prior animal experiments and general
surgery reports have shown that suture peritonization
tends to cause tissue ischemia, necrosis, inflammation,
and foreign body reactions to the suture material. These
factors may slow down the healing process and are considered important precursors for adhesion formation. By
contrast, clean excision of peritoneal surfaces without
suturing the cut edges provides for more rapid peritoneal
repair and does not lead to tissue ischemia and infection,
decreasing the risk for development of adhesion formation. 2-5

On the basis of the observation that postoperative recovery after abdominal hysterectomy without visceral suture peritonization was conspicuously uneventful, 6 we
conducted this prospective randomized study in women
undergoing cesarean delivery. Our goal was to evaluate
whether nonclosure of the visceral peritoneum has benefits over routine closure with regard to the intraoperative and postoperative clinical course; anesthesia and operating times were measured and postoperative complications and febrile morbidity were analyzed.
Material and methods
Between January 1993 and June 1994, 549 patients who
underwent cesarean delivery in three obstetrics departments were included in this study (University Hospital of
Vienna, n = 247; General Hospital of Salzburg, n= 213;
General Hospital of Vienna-Hanusch, n= 89). All patients who underwent cesarean section within this period
were randomized to one of two groups irrespective of the
surgical preference of the delivering obstetrician. After
patients gave informed consent, randomization occurred
on the day of cesarean delivery with group assignment
based on calendar days. On odd-numbered days the visceral peritoneum was left unsutured, and on even-numbered days the peritoneum was closed with a continuous
absorbable 2-0 polyglactin suture. Also, closure of the
parietal peritoneum was performed in a uniform manner
with continuous polyglactin sutures No. 0 (all suture material by Ethicon, Peterborough, Ontario, Canada). Sub1366

jects with low vertical hysterotomy (n = 2) or additional
surgical procedures (ovarian cysts n = 4; cesarean hysterectomy, n=2; myoma enucleation, n= 1) and women
having received antibiotic treatment within 1 week before
admission (n = 7) were excluded. A total of 287 women
were randomized to the closed group and 262 to the
open group.
The type of anesthesia was chosen by the anesthesiologist without reference to treatment group. All surgical
procedures were low transverse uterine cesareans and
were done by the resident staff. When indicated, sterilization was performed by tubal coagulation and transection,
the Pomeroy procedure, or Filshie clips. The decision
regarding prophylactic antibiotics, defined as administration on the day of surgery or the first postoperative day,
was up to the policy of the individual departments and
independent of treatment group. Therapeutic antibiotic
treatment was defined as administration of up to 2 days
postoperatively. Also, postoperative treatment decisions
were made without reference to treatment group and
included a single analgesic dose within 24 hours postoperatively (15 mg of piritramide subcutaneously or 100 mg
of tramadol hydrochloride intramuscularly or a 500 ml
infusion containing 4 gm of metamizole plus orphenadrine citrate) and a single dose of bowel stimulants
on the second day (16 ml of sodium picosulfate orally or
four doses of 12 mg of sennoside A plus B orally plus, in
some cases, saline solution enema on the same day).
Moreover, bowel stimulants were used in any patient with
postoperative gas pains and constipation and no radiologic signs of ileus.
During hospitalization tile following parameters were
evaluated: duration of general anesthesia (from the first
intravenous narcotic administration to extubation), total
operating time (from incision to closure of the skin),
number of patients receiving prophylactic and therapeutic antibiotics, number of patients requiring additional
narcotic or bowel stimulant doses postoperatively (oral
and parenteral), and febrile morbidity (defined both by
number of patients with temperature >38 ~ C for >2 days
postoperatively and by daily average temperature values
during the first postoperative week per group). Other
variables recorded were chorioamnionitis (defined by
maternal fever >37.5 ~ C and one or more of the following
criteria: maternal tachycardia, fetal tachycardia, purulent
vaginal discharge, foul-smelling amniotic fluid, maternal
leukocytosis, uterine tenderness, and absence of other
sources of infection), urinary tract infections and cystitis
diagnosed by bacterial growth on a three-agar medium
(Uricult plus, Orion Diagnostica, Espoo, Finland; results
of >107 bacteria/ml were regarded as positive), endometritis (indicated by purulent vaginal discharge or
uterine tenderness and fever), and wound problems (indicated by serous or purulent drainage from the skin
incision or erythema or induration, with and without
fever). Hospitalization was defined as the period from the
day of cesarean section to the day of discharge from the
hospital, All patients were evaluated each day they were
hospitalized; the nursing staff was not aware of the patients' treatment groups. At discharge all patients were
instructed to immediately contact the department at
which they underwent operation in case they had any
complaints or late complications.
Statistical analysis was done with the Statistical Package
for Social Sciences (SPSS/PC+, SPSS, Inc., Chicago).
Analytic comparisons used the g2 test, Mantel-Haenszel
test, Mann-Whitney U test, Fisher's exact test, and binomial test, with p < 0.05 considered significant.
Results
Statistical analysis compared the characteristics and
variables of 262 patients in whom the visceral peritoneum
was left open with those of 287 patients with classical
suture peritonization. Table I lists patient characteristics,
anesthetic data, type of cesarean delivery, and further
surgical details such as the method of uterine incision
closure and the number of patients undergoing tubal
ligation. The indications for cesarean delivery are shown
in Table II. Significant differences between the groups
were noted only with regard to the type of anesthesia: for
no apparent reason a significantly greater proportion of
patients in the closure group received general anesthesia,
whereas a significantly greater percentage of patients in
the nonclosure group were given spinal anesthesia.
Administration of antibiotics, postoperative narcotics,
and bowel stimulants and perioperative and postoperative complications are outlined in Table III. Although
there was no significant difference in the number of
patients receiving prophylactic antibiotics, therapeutic
antibiotic requirements were significantly higher in patients in the closure group. Statistical analysis showed that
the greater use of general anesthesia in the closed group
did not account for the difference in antibiotic usage or
fever between the open and closed groups. Patients in the
closure group also required significantly more postoperative narcotics (oral or parenteral). Among the patients
who required additional postoperative analgesia and who
had previously received either general or spinal anesthesia, no differences were noted between the open and
closed groups (general anesthesia: open group, n = 17, vs
closed group, n= 58; spinal anesthesia: open group,
n = 0, vs closed group, n = 4; ~2 = 1.16, Fisher's exact test:
p=0.57). We therefore believe that the significantly
higher pain medication requirements in the closed group
are in no way related to the difference regarding the
method of anesthesia used in the two groups. No significant difference was noted between the groups in the use
of bowel stimulants, but cystitis was seen significantly
more frequently with closure than without. Both temperature >38 ~ C for >2 postoperative days and the daily

average temperature values during the first postoperative
week were significantly higher with closure of the peritoneum (p< 0.001). Also, endometritis and wound infections tended to be more common in the dosed group; the
differences between groups did not achieve significance.
During hospitalization serious complications occurred
in two patients. One 38-year-old patient (case 486, open
group) underwent repeat laparotomy on the first postoperative day because of a secondary hemorrhage. A hematoma in the abdominal wall was removed, and a small
bleeding vessel at the uterine incision was ligated. The
second case was a 15-year-old patient (case 526, closed
group) in whom a large hematoma in the abdominal wall
necessitated reoperation on the third postoperative day.
Finally, there was a single case of readmission (a 30-yearold woman, case 75, open group) 17 days after the patient's discharge. Her complaints were abdominal pain
and diarrhea, and enteritis was diagnosed by means of
stool cultures. She was treated in the usual manner and
discharged 5 days later. No patients in either group had
peMc abscess or peritonitis, and none required reoperation because of ileus.
The mean operating time (_+SD) was significantly
greater in the closed group (56.9 _+ 17.9 minutes, range 13
to 115 minutes) than in the open group (50.6 + t6.8 minutes, range 14 to 105 minutes) (p < 0.001). Comparison of
the operating times in patients in whom cesarean section
and tubal sterilization were performed revealed no signit:

anesthesia time was significantly longer in the closed

in the open group (62.6 + 17.6 minutes, range 17 to 110

range 2 to 14 days) (p < 0.001).

Comment
This study examines the question of the closure or
nonclosure of the visceral peritoneum at cesarean delivery from a critical-clinical point of view and compares the
perioperative, intraoperative, and postoperative course
in the two treatment groups. The most important aspects
reviewed were operative and anesthesia times; antibiotic,
bowel stimulant, and narcotic requirements; febrile
morbidity; and postoperative complications.
Our findings indicate that cesarean section without
suture reapproximation of the peritoneal cut edges provides a number of significant advantages. One is the possible decrease in operative time, which in turn is associated with shorter anesthesia exposure and diminished
intraoperative anesthetic requirements. Of interest, pain
medication requirements were lower in the open group,
suggesting that nonclosure may be associated with less
postoperative abdominal pain, possibly because no tension is placed on the peritoneal wound edges. Antibiotic
requirements were also lower in the nonclosure group,
which is most likely related to the lower febrile and infectious morbidity in this group. In theory, the higher rate of
clinically asymptomatic febrile cases in the closed group
might be due to the formation of subperitoneal pockets
resulting from the suture; these pockets could fill with
blood and wound secretions from the uterine incision
and serve as a nutrient media for bacteria. Urinary tract
infection and cystitis are common complications in obstetric and gynecologic surgery. Although the relationship between suture peritonization and the high incidence of cystitis in the closed group remains unclear, one
hypothesis is that surgical manipulation on the peritoneal
part of the bladder is more likely to lead to cystitis and
urinary tract infection.
One argument against nonclosure of the visceral peritoneum has been that it increases the risk of adhesion
formation. To reduce this risk, a variety of chemical additives 79 and, more recently, intraperitoneal barrier
therapylO, 11 have been used. However, the most important
factor in adhesion prevention is impeccable surgical technique, including minimal tissue traumatization and
avoidance of ischemia and inflammation by eliminating
crushing forceps pressure, stitch tension, and knot pressure.l~ These demands are best met by leaving the visceral
peritoneum open. Hubbard et al.~3 examined the process
of autologous reperitonization in animal experiments.
They observed that regeneration of peritoneal defects is
completed in 5 to 6 days. After showing that the entire
wound surface endothelializes simultaneously and not
gradually from the cut edges as in skin wounds, they
concluded that large peritoneal defects heal as fast as
small ones. According to Holtz ~4 and Elkins et al., 4 adhesion formation after peritoneal closure is primarily the
result of foreign body reactions to the suture material,
interruption of vascular supply, or ischemia, and tissue
inflammation. They found less tissue necrosis and inflammatory reactions in peritoneal cut edges that were not
closed primarily than in those that were, even when minimally reactive suture material was used. On the basis of
these and similar findings, we doubt that there is any
connection between nonclosure of the visceral peritoneum and postoperative adhesion formation. 15-17 Conversely, sutured peritoneal surfaces might cause adhesion
formation) s
To our knowledge, only two previous articles report on
the effects of peritoneal closure or nonclosure in women
undergoing cesarean delivery. In the study of Pietrantoni
et al. 19 only the parietal peritoneum was left open,
whereas Hull and Varner 2~ left both the visceral and parietal peritoneum unsutured. In agreement with our findings, both studies reported a significant decrease in operating time in the open group. Hull and Varner found
that pain medication requirements were higher in closure subjects, which is also consistent with our data. However, the closed group in their study required more bowel
stimulants, a finding contrasting with our investigation,

which showed that return to bowel flmction was similar in
both groups. Contrary to our findings, Hull and Varner
found no difference between the groups in the incidence
of febrile morbidity. One explanation for this discrepancy
may be found in the small series of patients used in their
study (closed group, n = 59, vs open group, n = 54). Furthermore, febrile morbidity was defined by just one parameter (temperature _>38 ~ C at least once during postoperative hospitalization), whereas we also included the
daily average temperature values of the first postoperative
week.
In summary, the results of our study indicate that nonclosure of the visceral peritoneum might not only reduce
operating time and anesthesia exposure but also offer
other significant benefits with regard to the postoperative
course, including a reduction in postoperative narcotics
and, most important, a lower febrile and infectious morbidity and therefore decreased antibiotic requirements.
Finally, these factors also explain why hospitalization was
shorter in the open group. We conclude that routine
closure of the visceral peritoneum be abandoned in
women undergoing cesarean delivery.
