Summary
A prospective randomised study of 54 patients undergoing caesarean section was carried out to determine if non-closure of
peritoneum at lower segment caesarean section has advantages over suture peritonisation with regard to postoperative
morbidity. A total of 27 women were randomised to closure and 27 to non-closure of peritoneum. Management decisions
were made without reference to treatment groups. Statistical analysis compared the outcome between the two groups.
The results revealed that anaesthesia and operating times were significantly shorter in patients that had the peritoneum left
open. The incidence of febrile morbidity, wound infection, duration of postoperative and duration of hospital stay were not
significantly different in both groups ( p 5 0.05). The study concludes that non-closure of peritoneum is associated with
significantly reduced operation and anaesthesia time with a non-significant difference in immediate postoperative outcome.
Non-closure of peritoneum should be adopted at caesarean delivery.
Introduction
As a result of improved safety, caesarean section rates have
increased significantly worldwide (Barros et al. 1991; Paul
and Miller 1995). Associated mortality has also reduced and
therefore emphasis has shifted to improving morbidity
(Cisse et al. 1995; Hillan 1992). Recent studies in the
developed world have focused mainly on different caesarean
section techniques and their effect on morbidity. One such
study is the effect of non-closure of peritoneum at caesarean
section on postoperative morbidity (Nagele et al. 1996;
Irion et al. 1996; Woyton et al. 2000; Duffy and diZerega
1994).
Although it is likely that variation in surgical technique
will produce relatively modest differences in outcome, the
operation is performed so frequently that any difference in
morbidity is likely to have a significant cost effect, especially
in poor settings like Nigeria with a great aversion for the
surgery (Lomas and Enkin 1989; Orji et al. 2003). No study
has been done in this environment to evaluate any of the
various surgical techniques of performing caesarean section.
A study to evaluate the benefits and disadvantages of nonclosure of peritoneum at caesarean section with regard to
immediate postoperative morbidity is therefore necessary
considering how commonly the operation is performed.
Methodology
The prospective randomised study was carried out at the
Obstetric unit of Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching
Hospital Complex Ile-Ife, Nigeria with an average of 2,150
deliveries per year and an average caesarean section rate of
21.6%. Inclusion criteria were women who presented at a
gestational age of 37 weeks to 542 weeks with a singleton
pregnancy who required caesarean delivery were recruited
into the study after counselling and obtaining consent from
the patient. Exclusion criteria were patients who presented
with obstructed labour, chorioamnionitis and previous
caesarean section. The primary outcome measure was the
duration of hospital stay, which from previous studies is
averaged at 7.5 days, in uncomplicated caesarean section
(Fasuba et al. 2000; Nagele et al. 1996). The study
intended to detect as significant a difference of 2 days in
duration of hospital stay. The sample size for the
comparison of independent mean was used (Gahlinger
and Abramson 1993).

gave a minimum sample of 22 patients for the control
group (closure of peritoneum) and 22 patients for the
intervention group (non-closure of peritoneum). For this
study, 27 patients were included in each group to make the
result statistically significant. Eligible patients were randomised into either group, using block randomisation
technique with a table of random numbers. The correct
number (54) of serially numbered opaque envelopes were
made available and after randomisation, using the above

method, half of the total number contained slips of paper
marked ‘NC’ meaning non-closure and the remaining half
contained slips of paper marked ‘CC’ meaning closure.
At presentation, the eligible patient picked the envelopes
serially. Whether to close the peritoneum or not was
disclosed to the surgeon at the time of surgery depending
on the slip contained in the envelope, irrespective of
surgical preference of the delivering obstetrician. The type
of anaesthesia was chosen by the anaesthesiologist without
reference to treatment group. All surgical procedures were
lower segment transverse caesarean section and done by
resident staff. The uterine muscles were sutured in two
layers with Vicryl size 1. For the non-closure group, the
visceral and parietal peritoneum were left unsutured and
for the closure group, the visceral and parietal peritoneum
were closed with continuous Vicryl 2-0 suture. The rectus
sheath was sutured with Nylon 1 suture material. Postoperative treatment decisions were made without reference
to the treatment group. All patients were administered
postoperative antibiotics for periods ranging between 24 h
and 7 days. The retained urethral catheter was removed
after 24 h. The post caesarean packed cell volume was
checked on postoperative day 2. The wound dressing was
routinely changed on the 3rd postoperative day. Intramuscular pentazocine 30 mg every 8 h was given in the first
24 h to relieve pain. Patients were evaluated each day while
still hospitalised. During hospitalisation, the following
parameters were evaluated: duration of general anaesthesia;
total operating time, febrile morbidity, wound problems
(indicated by serous or purulent drainage from the skin
incision or induration with and without fever), analgesic
requirement, time of commencement of oral intake and
period of hospitalisation.
Data analysis was done using computer software Epi Info
2002 and computer programs for epidemiological analysis
(CPEA) (Gahlinger and Abramson 1993). Continuous
variables were analysed using the t-test. Categorical
variables were analysed with the w2
-test. A table of
frequency was generated to present the data. Approval for
the study was obtained from the Institution’s Ethical
Committee. Informed consent was obtained from the
patients.
Results
A total of 54 patients were randomised into two groups to
have closure or non-closure of peritoneum at lower
segment caesarean section with 27 patients in each group.
Statistical analysis compared the characteristics of the
patients in which the peritoneum was left open with those
in which the visceral and parietal peritoneum was sutured.
Table I lists the patients’ characteristics. There was no
statistically significant difference in all the characteristics.
This implied that the two groups were comparable.
The indications for caesarean section are shown in
Table II. The majority were emergency caesarean sections.
Statistical analysis of the indication in either group did not
show any significant difference implying that the two
groups were comparable. The anaesthetic time, duration of
operation and type of skin incision used are outlined in
Table III. All the patients had general anaesthesia.
Significant differences between the groups were noted with
regard to the anaesthetic time. The time was longer in the
closed group (65.1 +7.2) compared with the open group
(55.2 +5.7) (p 50.05, t ¼ 5.7). A significant difference
was noted in the duration of operation being longer in the
closed group (63.5 + 6.0) compared with the open group
(50.5+ 4.5) (p5 0.05, t ¼ 9.0).
The types of skin incision used were either midline
subumbilical or Pfannenstiel incisions. The relative proportion of each type of incision was compared in both
groups. There was no significant statistical differences in
both groups among those who had midline incisions
(w2 ¼ 0.43, p ¼ 0.51) or in those who had Pfannenstiel
incisions (w2¼ 0.43, p ¼ 0.51). The majority of the patients
in both the open group (81.5%) and the closed group
(74.1%) had Pfannenstiel incisions.
The administration of antibiotics and analgesic and
postoperative complications are outlined in Table IV.
There was no significant difference in the number of
patients that received prophylactic antibiotics. Similarly,

therapeutic antibiotic requirements were not significantly
higher in either of the two groups. Patients that required
extra postoperative analgesia were more in the closed
group as compared with the open group, though this
difference was not statistically significant (p ¼ 0.23,
w2 ¼ 1.42). Fever, wound infection and longer duration
of ileus tended to be more common in the closed group,
though the differences between the groups did not achieve
any statistical significance. The mean duration of hospital
stay was longer in the closed group (w2 ¼ 8.9 +2.2)
compared with the open group (w2 ¼ 8.2 + 1.2). However,
the difference was not statistically significant (p ¼ 0.15,
t ¼ 1.48).
Discussion
This study showed that non-closure of peritoneum
provides a number of significant advantages over the
traditional method of suture peritonisation. One of these
is the decrease in operation time which was 50.5 + 4.5 min
in the open group, compared with the closed group’s
63.5+ 6.0 min (p5 0.05). This, in turn, was associated
with shorter exposure to anaesthesia and a reduction in
intraoperative anaesthetic requirements. This is also consistent with earlier studies (Wilkinson and Enkin 1998;
Nagele et al. 1996; Irion et al. 1996). The type of skin
incision may affect operation time. However, the skin
incisions were comparable in each of the groups and
therefore could not have affected the difference in the
operation time observed.
Analgesic requirements were lower in the open group,
although the difference was not significant. This suggests
that non-closure of peritoneum may be associated with less
postoperative abdominal pain, possibly because no tension
is placed on the peritoneal wound edges (Nagele et al.
1996). In another study where postoperative pain was
assessed by the Visual Analogue Scale, there was no
difference in post caesarean pain between closure and nonclosure of peritoneum (Chanrachakul et al. 2002). The
type of anaesthesia could affect postoperative pain (Nagele
et al. 1996; Wilkinson and Enkin 1998). However, in this
study the entire patient cohort had general anaesthesia.
Febrile morbidity and wound infection were not significantly different in either group. In theory, the higher rate of
clinically febrile cases in the closed group might be due to
the formation of subperitoneal pockets resulting from the
suture; these pockets could fill with blood and wound
secretions from the uterine incision and serve as a nutrient
media for bacteria (Nagele et al. 1996).
The maternal characteristic weight was comparable in
both groups, so interpretation of the result was not biased
by weight (since obesity could affect wound healing). Also
the types of skin incision were also comparable in both
groups and the assessment of wound healing was not
therefore biased by this variable. Period of postoperative
ileus was not significantly different in both groups. No
bowel stimulant was required in any of the cases. This is
similar to the findings in earlier studies (Nagele et al. 1996;
Wilkinson and Enkin 1998).
The duration of hospital stay was not significantly
different in either group. However, the mean duration of
stay was shorter in the open group: 8.2+ 1.2 days,
compared with closed group: 8.9 +2.7 days (p 40.05).
The non-significant shorter duration of hospital stay may
be as a result of improved immediate postoperative
outcome if the peritoneum was not closed and this may
translate to a marginal reduction in the cost of hospital stay,
which is beneficial to patients and also reduces the burden
on the healthcare service providers (Nagele et al. 1996;
Wilkinson and Enkin 1998; Galaal and Krolikowski 2000).
In conclusion non-closure of peritoneum significantly
reduced operation and anaesthetic time (p 50.05) with no
significant differences in postoperative fever, duration of
ileus, duration of hospital stay and wound infection.
Therefore, non-closure of peritoneum is recommended at
lower segment caesarean section in Nigeria.
