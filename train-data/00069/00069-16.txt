OBJECTIVE: Cesarean delivery is the most common intraperitoneal surgical
procedure. Nonclosure of the peritoneum at cesarean delivery has attained
widespread use. We conducted this study to evaluate the effect of nonclosure of
peritoneum at cesarean delivery on the interval to the next pregnancy.
STUDY DESIGN: Between 1995 and 2000, 123 women who were to undergo
cesarean delivery were randomized to one of two categories after informed
consent. Group assignment was based on the last digit of the patient’s medical
record. 123 women scheduled for low transverse cervical cesarean were
randomized to either closure of both the visceral and parietal peritoneum
with absorbable suture (N = 70) or no both peritoneal closure (N = 53).
RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the groups in
characteristics, such as maternal age, parity, gestational age, maternal body
weight, and neonatal weight. There was significant difference in the average
operating time (closure group; 41.7G6.9 min.; nonclosure group; 35.3G5.9
min.; p!0.001) and the number of analgesic doses after operation (closure
group; 2.4G1.1; nonclosure group; 2.0G0.9; p!0.05). There was no significant difference in the incidence of febrile morbidity, urinary tract infection
and cystitis, endometritis, wound problems, pneumonia, ileus, anemia, and
number of patients receiving therapeutic antibiotics. The time interval from
cesarean section to the next pregnancy in the nonclosure group was significantly shorter than that in the closure group.
CONCLUSION: We conclude that nonclosure of visceral and parietal peritoneum at cesarean delivery appears to have no adverse effect on immediate
postoperative recovery, decrease the number of analgesic doses and shorten
operating time and may be more likely to desire to achieve a next pregnancy.

OBJECTIVE: Conflicting opinions exist in the literature and clinical care on
the future role of operative vaginal delivery (OVD) and episiotomy in
obstetrical practice. The purpose of this study is to determine the impact of
these modalities, alone and in combination, on the rate of severe perineal
lacerations in nulliparas.
STUDY DESIGN: Using a prospectively collected computerized perinatal
database of a tertiary care institution, we examined maternal and obstetric
factors, including maternal age (MA), race, epidural anesthesia, birth weight
(BW), newborn head circumference (HC) and length, midline episiotomy,
OVD type, and forceps type (mid, low, outlet) for all singleton, term (R37
weeks), vertex nulliparous live vaginal births between 1/1996 and 1/2003. The
primary outcome measure was the development of severe perineal injury (3rd
or 4th ( perineal laceration). Data were analyzed with stepwise logistic
regression.
RESULTS: Over the 6-year study period, there were 12,063 deliveries
meeting inclusion criteria. 8.0% of women had a 3rd or 4th ( perineal laceration (n = 969). Controlling for MA, race, BW & HC, evaluation of the
main effects and interaction of episiotomy and delivery method revealed that
episiotomy and forceps consistently increased the rate of severe perineal
trauma.
CONCLUSION: Given the exceedingly high rate of severe perineal laceration
with any use of OVD and/or midline episiotomy and the reported substantial
long-term adverse consequences for anal function, one must wonder if these
techniques may be approaching obsolescence for nulliparous delivery.
Delivery method Rate of severe lacerations OR 95% CI
SVD 3.0% (260/8628) 1.0
SVD with episiotomy 14.7% (283/1929) 4.6 3.8-5.6
Vacuum 10.2% (26/256) 3.1 1.9-4.8
Vacuum with episiotomy 34.6% (92/266) 13.7 10.1-18.6
Forceps 21.4% (95/444) 8.6 6.5-11.4
Forceps with episiotomy 42.7% (213/499) 21.1 16.7-26.8

OBJECTIVE: To assess maternal intra- and post-operative morbidities in
women with multifetal gestations undergoing a primary prelabor cesarean.
STUDY DESIGN: Between January 1, 1999 and December 31, 2000, a
prospective observational study of all primary cesarean deliveries was
conducted at thirteen university centers. For this secondary analysis, maternal
intra- and post-operative morbidities were compared among women with
singletons, twins, and triplets who underwent a primary prelabor cesarean.
RESULTS: 5142 women, of which 87.6% had singletons, 11.0% twins and
1.4% triplets, underwent a primary cesarean prior to labor. Except for atony
requiring medical treatment, which increased with increasing fetal number
(Table), other intra- (cystotomy, ureteral or bowel injury, hysterectomy) and
post-operative complications (transfusion, thromboembolism, ileus, wound
complications) were similar between women with singletons and multiples. In a
logistic regression, which controlled for demographic characteristics associated
with mutifetal pregnancies (gestational age at delivery, maternal age, smoking
status, race) and the medical indications for primary cesarean, medically
treated atony (p!0.0001) remained associated with increasing fetal number.

Postpartum endometritis 4.8% 5.7% 2.7% 0.80

CONCLUSION: As the number of fetuses increases, the rate of medically
treated uterine atony increases. Other intra- and post-operative complications
are not significantly increased with increasing fetal number.

CESAREAN IN OBESE GRAVIDAS MONIQUE LIN (F)1

for the NICHD MFMU
Network, Bethesda, Maryland
OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of body mass index (BMI, kg/m2
) on the
maternal intra- and postoperative morbidities in women undergoing primary
pre-labor cesarean.
STUDY DESIGN: Between January 1, 1999 and December 31, 2000, a
prospective observational study of all primary cesarean deliveries was
conducted at thirteen university centers. For this secondary analysis, maternal
intra- and postoperative morbidities were compared among women with
singletons that were normal weight (BMI R18 to !25), overweight (BMI R
25 to !30), obese (BMI R30 to !40) and morbidly obese (BMIR40)
undergoing a primary prelabor cesarean. BMI was assessed perioperatively.
RESULTS: Of the 4258 women with a primary prelabor cesarean, 13.4%
were normal weight, 33.3% overweight, 40.9% obese and 12.4% morbidly
obese. Except for vertical hysterotomy and wound infection, which increased
with increasing BMI, and postpartum transfusion, which decreased with
increasing BMI (Table), the incidence of other intra- (i.e. transfusion,
cystotomy, ureteral or bowel injury, hysterectomy) and post-operative complications (i.e. thromboembolism, ileus, other wound complications) did not
differ by BMI. In a logistic regression, which controlled for demographic
characteristics associated with obesity and the outcome of interest, wound
infection (p!0.0001), vertical hysterotomy (p!0.0001) and postpartum
transfusion (p=0.007) remained associated with BMI.
Complication

n = 1417
Obese
n = 1742
Morbidly
obese
n = 527 p value
Vertical hysterotomy 8.2% 7.0% 7.7% 11.8% 0.01
Wound infection 0.2% 0.4% 1.0% 1.5% 0.001
Postpartum transfusion 3.7% 2.8% 2.8% 1.1% 0.02
Uterine atony 3.7% 4.4% 4.1% 2.9% 0.39
Postpartum endometritis 5.8% 3.5% 4.4% 6.6% 0.19
CONCLUSION: As BMI increases, vertical hysterotomy and wound infection
rates increase, while the rate of postpartum transfusion decreases. Other intraand post-operative complications are not affected by perioperative BMI.
