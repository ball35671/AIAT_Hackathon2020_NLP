An assessment study of maternal morbidity and mortality
statistics based on five year community based data from lady
health workers in ten rural districts of Pakistan
G. Shabbir, M. Malik. United Nations Population Fund Pakistan
Objectives: To appraise maternal morbidity and mortality statistics
during years 2004 to 2008 in LHW covered population in ten UNFPA
supported districts of Pakistan.
Material and Methods: Program interventions included strengthening of EmOC/FP services at 65 health facilities, skill development
of 6197 LHWs in interpersonal communication, counseling skills
and screening for complications and referrals. District level
supervisors were trained to conduct verification of maternal deaths
through verbal autopsy on structured pretested questionnaire. This
was a quantitative retrospective cross sectional study for the period
(2004–2008) conducted in ten districts of Pakistan. Secondary data
from existing district LHW-MIS (2004–2008) was analyzed in MS
Excel.
Results: Deliveries by SBAs increased from 24% to 40% (n = 30036,
69011) of expected pregnancies, modern method contraceptive
prevalence rate increased from 31% to 37%. Referral of women
for skilled birth attendance increased from 14% to 24% (n = 190047,
247799) of expected women in reproductive age. In 2004, number
of verified maternal deaths in 4.1 million LHW covered population
was n = 110 and total live births were reported n = 44891 (estimate
of maternal mortality ratio=245 per 100,000 live births). In 2008,
number of verified maternal deaths in 6.4 million LHW covered
population was n = 215 while total live births were reported
n = 102,170 (estimate of maternal mortality ratio =210 per 100,000
live births).
Conclusion: Strengthening of emergency obstetric care at health
facilities including MIS, provision of skill based trainings to lady
health workers and regular IEC activities for communities enhanced
skilled birth attendance, contraceptive prevalence and referral to
health facilities, and effectively contributed towards reduction in
maternal mortality.

Influence of maternal birth status on her offspring:
A systematic review and meta-analyses
P. Shah, V. Shah. Department of Pediatrics, Mount Sinai Hospital and
University of Toronto, Toronto
Background: Maternal low birth weight (LBW), preterm (PTB) and
small for gestational age (SGA) birth status have been suggested as
precursor for infant being born LBW, PTB or SGA.
Objective: To systematically review the risks of infant being born
low birth weight (LBW)/preterm (PTB)/small for gestational age
(SGA) among mothers who were LBW/PTB/SGA at birth.
Methods: Medline, Embase, CINAHL (from inception till December
2008) and bibliographies of identified articles were searched for
English language studies reporting on maternal LBW/PTB/SGA
births and their association with either infant’s LBW, PTB or
SGA. Data were extracted by two authors independently and
discrepancies resolved by consensus. Study qualities were assessed
for sample selection, exposure assessment, outcome assessment,
confounder adjustment, attrition, and analytical biases. Random
effect model was used for meta-analyses and Peto’s odds ratio
(with 95% confidence intervals) and population attributable risks
(PAR) were calculated.
Results: Twenty two studies of low to moderate risk of biases
were included. Maternal LBW was associated with infant being
born LBW [12 studies, 525706 participants, odds ratio (OR) 2.23,
95% confidence interval (CI) 2.11, 2.35, PAR 7.1%], PTB (6 studies,
331121 participants OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.43, 1.71, PAR 4.3%) and SGA (3
studies, 324357 participants, OR 1.83, 95% CI 1.43, 2.33, PAR 6.6%).
Maternal PTB was associated with infant’s PTB (7 studies, 282616
participants, OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.26, 1.59, PAR 6.2%), and SGA (3
studies, 41590 participants, OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.08, 1.64, PAR 3.6%)
births. Maternal SGA status was associated with infant’s PTB (3
studies, 41614 participants, OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.06, 2.37, PAR 6.3%)
and SGA (3 studies, 41586 participants, OR 2.64, 95% CI 2.28, 3.05,
PAR 11.8%).
Conclusions: Maternal LBW/PTB/SGA status at birth was associated
with a significantly increased risk of LBW/PTB/SGA status in the
index child.

Role of anxiety during pregnancy in preterm delivery

Mazandaran University of Medical Science, Sari, Iran, 2Department of
Nursing, Mazandaran University of Medical Science, Sari, Iran
Background and Objective: Preterm delivery has considerable
social, economical and mental effects on neonate and related
family. Factors predisposing to, and preventing preterm delivery
are still not clearly recognized. However some studies have shown
psychological factors to play some role. This study was conducted
to evaluate the effect of anxiety in inducing preterm delivery.
Materials and Methods: In this cohort study conducted in sari
(2006–2007) in Iran a consecutive series of 282 pregnant women
with singleton pregnancies referred for routine prenatal care
were included. Anxiety was assessed using self-administered
Spielberger’s state-trait anxiety questionnaire. The 75th percentile
was used for anxiety scores.
Results: Mean score of state and trait anxiety of cases was
38.5±9.9 (20–74) and 41.2±9.2 (20–77) respectively. There was
a meaningful statistical relationship between state anxiety and
preterm delivery (P = 0.02, RR = 2.71) and trait anxiety and preterm
delivery (P = 0.009, RR = 1.59).
Conclusion: Further studies incorporating multiple psychosocial
domains, gaining information about women’s social environment,
life circumstances and possible biologic pathways through which
anxiety and stress operates may reinforce our understanding of the
role of stress in pregnancy.

Parietal peritoneal closure and postcesarean pain
A. Shahin1, A. Osman. 1Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology,
Women’s Health Centre, Assiut University
Objective: To assess the incidence of persistent pain after cesarean
delivery.
Methods: A total of 340 pregnant women with no history of
abdominal surgery were randomized to undergo or not undergo
parietal peritoneal closure following elective cesarean delivery. Pain
scores were recorded on the 1st and 15th postoperative day and
the women were followed up every 2 weeks up to 8 months after
surgery.
Results: Overall and epigastric abdominal pain were more frequent
in the closure than in the nonclosure group. Pain scores on the 1st
and 15th days and after 8 months were higher in the closure group,
in which the incidence of persistent postcesarean pain was 17.8%
after 8 months.
Conclusion: Parietal peritoneal closure after cesarean delivery
is associated with a higher incidence of early and persistent
postoperative pain. A high pain score on the 1st day is a predictor
of persistent pain.
