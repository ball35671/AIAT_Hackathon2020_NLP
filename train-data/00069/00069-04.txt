Abstract
Objective: To compare the intensity of postcesarean pain between closure and nonclosure of peritoneum in the women with a midline incision and one previous cesarean section. Study Design: The setting was an obstetrics unit of a university teaching hospital. A double-blind randomized trial was performed on 60 pregnant women with a midline incision and one previous cesarean section who underwent elective repeated cesarean section. Thirty women each were allocated to the “closure” group and the “nonclosure” group. The principal outcome measure was the postcesarean pain assessed by visual analog scale (VAS). Results: There was no difference in postoperative pain for closure and nonclosure of peritoneum groups in repeated cesarean patients; while resting (P=0.8), while moving in bed (P=0.94), and while walking (P=0.52). The use of opiate (P=0.27) and oral analgesics (P=0.37) also suggested no difference. No differences were found in duration of the operation, incidence of postoperative complications, time of returned bowel function, and length of the hospital stay. Conclusion: The VAS showed no difference in postcesarean pain between closure and nonclosure of peritoneum.
