Abstract
Aim: To determine the effect of non-closure of the visceral and parietal peritoneum during cesarean section on
short-term postoperative morbidity.
Methods: A prospective randomized trial was conducted of 533 women undergoing primary cesarean section;
277 were randomized to closure and 256 to non-closure of the peritoneum. Perioperative outcome measures,
such as analgesia dosage and morbidly measures were compared.
Results: There was no significant difference between the non-closure and closure groups in the mean number
of narcotic analgesia doses (1.09  1.2 vs 1.05  1.0, P = 0.63; respectively), mean number of non-narcotic
analgesia doses (4.69  2.7 vs 4.65  2.8, P = 0.89; respectively), number of women with postoperative fever
>38°C (18 vs 14, P = 0.37; respectively), number of women with wound infection (29 vs 35, P = 0.54; respectively) and mean number of hospitalization days (4.16  0.91 vs 4.14  0.71, P = 0.78; respectively).
Conclusion: Closure or non-closure of the peritoneum at cesarean sections has no significant impact on
postoperative analgesic usage and short-term morbidity.
Key words: cesarean section, morbidity, peritoneum.
Introduction
Caesarean section is one of the most frequently performed major surgical procedures worldwide. The
surgical approach of lower segment cesarean section
has traditionally included closure of the visceral and
parietal peritoneum.1 Cited reasons for closure of
the peritoneum include restoration of anatomy and
re-approximation of tissues, reduction of infection by
re-establishing an anatomical barrier, reduction of
wound dehiscence, reduction of hemorrhage, minimization of adhesions and continuation of what was
thought as standard.2,3 In contrast, peritoneal nonclosure is associated with reduced operative time.
The short-term effects of closure versus non-closure
of the peritoneum were subject to several randomized
prospective studies. Analyzing the results of these
studies shows conflicting results regarding postoperative fever, wound infection, pain, and other important
outcome parameters.4–7 A recent Cochrane meta- analysis suggested that there was an improved short-term
postoperative outcome if the peritoneum was not
closed.8
Given the preponderance of cesarean section, it is of
utmost importance to offer recommendations regarding its technique based on high quality evidence.
Therefore, additional data derived from high quality
randomized controlled trials is valuable. The aim of our

study was to analyze short-term results of closure
versus non-closure of the peritoneum in a large randomized controlled trial.
Methods
The study was a randomized controlled trial comparing the effect of closure with non-closure of the visceral
and parietal peritoneum on the short-term clinical
course following cesarean section. The study was
approved by the local Ethics and Research Committee
and written informed consent was obtained from all
recruited women. Of the 1150 women undergoing
primary cesarean section between May 2004 and May
2007, 533 consented to participate and were randomly
allocated to closure or non-closure. The randomization
sequence was computer generated, instructing the
surgeon to leave the peritoneum open or to close it.
A standard technique was performed in all operations. The type of anesthesia was chosen by the anesthesiologist without reference to the treatment group.
During the period of the study, 74–80% of the operations were performed under regional anesthesia. The
abdomen was open by a pfannenstiel incision. A transverse lower segment uterine incision was closed with
two layers of continuous 1 polyglactin suture. In the
control group, both the visceral and parietal peritoneum were closed using a continuous absorbable
suture (polyglactin 2-0), while in the non-closure group
both layers remained unsutured. The rectus sheath was
sutured using continuous absorbable suture (polyglactin 1). The skin was approximated using staples. The
use of interrupted subcutaneous absorbable sutures
(Polyglactin 2-0) was left to the discretion of the
surgeon. All patients received intraoperative prophylactic intravenous Cefazolin (1gr). The time of skin incision, delivery and end of surgery were recorded.
Patients were followed up in the hospital. The staff
was not aware of which study group the patients were
allocated. Clinical data retrieved from the charts
included postoperative analgesia usage by quantifying
narcotic and non-narcotic administration.
For the first 18–24 h following surgery the patients
received analgesia upon demand, intramuscular meperidine 75 mg with promethazine 25 mg, and on the
following days IM diclofen sodium 75 mg. Febrile morbidity was defined as a temperature of 38°C or more,
excluding the first 24 h.Wound infection was diagnosed
when erythema, induration or purulent discharge were
observed. Patients were routinely discharged on the
fourth post-delivery day; re-hospitalizations were
recorded.
Sample size was calculated based on the primary
outcome measure that was the administration of nonnarcotic analgesia. Pilot data on administration of nonnarcotic analgesic, without specification as to whether
or not the peritoneum was closed, showed a mean
number of four doses with a standard deviation of 2.8.
Sample size was calculated for a mean difference in
dose of 0.8 (20%) with a standard deviation of 2.8
doses, an alpha of 0.5, and a beta of 0.90. Given this
calculation the minimum sample size was 259 cases in
each group. For statistical analysis Student’s t-test and
the c2 test were used as appropriate; P < 0.05 was considered significant.
Results
Of the 533 women, 277 (52%) women were randomized
to peritoneal closure group, and 256 (48%) women
to peritoneal non-closure group. All women were
included in the analysis. Patients characteristics are
shown in Table 1: The groups were similar with respect
to age, weight, parity and proportion of urgent operations. The mean duration of the surgery was significantly shorter in the non-closure group. Table 2 details
the postoperative course of the women. There was no
difference in the use of narcotic or non-narcotic analgesia between the groups. In addition, no difference
was found in the rate of postoperative fever, wound

infection or duration of hospitalization. All patients
with fever or wound infections responded to antibiotic
treatment. None of the patients from either group was
subject to a re-laparotomy. Four patients in the nonclosure group and one in the closure group were
re-hospitalized. The indications for readmissions were
endometritis (two patients), wound infection (two
patients) and hematoma (one patient).
Discussion
Reports on short-term effects of non-closure of the
peritoneum have focused on several outcome measures, including duration of surgery, analgesic usage,
postoperative fever, endometritis and duration of hospital stay. The Cochrane review concluded that there
was an improved short-term postoperative outcome if
the peritoneum was not closed.8 In the current large
randomized trial, closure or non-closure of the peritoneum at cesarean section had no significant impact
on postoperative analgesic usage and short-term morbidity, warranting discussion.
Analgesic usage
Previous studies that analyzed the effect of leaving
both layers of the peritoneum open on pain and analgesia requirements have shown conflicting results. No
difference in postoperative pain between closure and
non-closure of the peritoneum was reported by several
investigators. Irion7 in a study of 280 patients found no
difference in postoperative pain as measured by visual
analogue scale or with respect to number of doses of
analgesics required. Hojberg et al.
9 analyzed postcesarean pain by visual analogue scales. The results
showed no statistically significant difference between
the groups.
Partial benefit of peritoneal non-closure was noted
by other researchers. Hull and Varner4 randomized 113
women to either closure or non-closure of both peritoneal layers. There was no difference in the number of
doses of postoperative parenteral narcotics, but less use
of oral narcotics when the peritoneum was not closed.
Rafique et al.
6 performed a double-blind randomized
study of 100 women. They analyzed post-cesarean pain
by visual analogue scales. The results showed no statistically significant difference between the groups. The
researchers used a standardized procedure for pain
relief. It included a spinal anesthetic, and later nonopioid analgesia. They found that non-closure of both
layers of the peritoneum was associated with a significant reduction in postoperative use of patient controlled analgesia pump morphine. They did not find a
statistically significant difference in the use of oral analgesia. They noted a significantly higher patient satisfaction at 24 h postoperatively in the non-closure group.
Nagele et al.
5 in a randomized trial of 549 women
reported less use of narcotic analgesia when the visceral peritoneum was not closed. It is important to note
that a significant greater proportion of patients in the
closure group received general anesthesia. In all participants the parietal peritoneum was closed. Hojberg
et al.
9 evaluated postoperative pain as the primary
outcome in 40 patients. The patients were randomized
to closure versus non-closure of the parietal peritoneum. In this study the non-closure group used significantly less oral analgesia. In the studies that reported a
beneficial effect of non-closure of the peritoneum a
statistical significant association was related to partial
and different aspects of pain. The Cochrane analysis
that included four studies involving 622 patients suggested a 20% reduction in analgesic doses required.8
The diverse results of the studies suggest that nonTable 2 Outcome measures of women randomized to closure and non-closure of the peritoneum

closure of the peritoneum has no clear effect on postcesarean section pain. Taken together we conclude that
leaving the peritoneum open does not significantly
affect postoperative pain.
Infectious morbidity
The majority of the investigators found no significant
differences between the closure and non-closure
groups. Pietrantoni10 randomized 248 women to closure
versus non-closure of the parietal peritoneum. He
found no difference in the rate of postoperative fever,
endometritis or wound infection between the groups.
Hull and Varner4 randomized 113 women to either
closure or non-closure of both peritoneal layers. There
was no difference in the rates of fever, endometritis,
wound infection or use of antibiotics. Irion et al. in a
study of 280 patients (both layers) found no difference in
the rate of febrile morbidity. Hull and Varner studied
113 women, and left both layers unsutured. They found
no difference between the groups in the rate of febrile
morbidity. Two investigators reported a decrease in
febrile morbidity in the non-closure group: Grundsell
et al.
11 studied 361 women who underwent cesarean
section and were randomized to peritoneal closure or
non-closure. They found a significant decrease in febrile
morbidity in the peritoneal non-closure versus the
closure group (7.8% vs 19.2%). Yet, there was no difference in the rate of endometritis (4.9% vs 5.0%), or
urinary tract infection (5.0 vs 4.9%). The increase in
febrile morbidity was attributed to increase wound
infection rate (3.2% vs 2.2%), and increase fever of
unknown origin (FUO, 3.8% vs 1.7%) in the peritoneal
closure group. Nagele et al. found increased rate of postoperative fever in the closure group, and a tendency
towards more endometritis or wound infection in the
closure group. These differences did not reach statistical
significance. In the Cochrane analysis, postoperative
fever was significantly reduced with non-closure, but
there was no difference in postoperative endometritis
and wound infection rates.8 The results of our study
support the conclusion that peritoneal closure has no
clinically significant effect on postoperative febrile morbidity or infection rate.
Operation time
It is logical that omitting a surgical step would
decrease duration of surgery. The magnitude of this
time however is variable. In the Cochrane review, nonclosure of the visceral and parietal peritoneum reduced
operating time by a mean of 6.05 min.8 This was found
when nine studies involving 1521 women were analyzed. In our series the shorter operative time in the
non-closure group was of lesser magnitude and
although statistically significant, the 2-min difference
lacks clinical importance.
Days to discharge
Duration of hospital stay may be partly clinical and
partly an administrative decision reflecting different
policies. In the Cochrane analysis, duration of hospitalization was assessed in eight studies including 1203
women. Duration of stay was significantly reduced in
the non-closure group.8 In the current study duration of
hospitalization was not found to be related to peritoneal closure. Again, it may suggest a marginal effect
that may be significant only while assessing a very
large number of patients.
Conclusion
The results of our large randomized trial of closure
versus non-closure of the peritoneum suggest that
there is no significant difference in short-term
outcome. A large clinical trial assessing the effect of
peritoneal closure at cesarean among other surgical
technique variations is currently ongoing.12 We believe
that our findings should direct the researchers to focus
on possible long-term effects of peritoneal closure,
such as adhesion formation.
