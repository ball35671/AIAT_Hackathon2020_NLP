raditionally both the parietal and visceral
peritoneum is closed during cesarean section.
The reasons are to restore the anatomy, to
approximate tissue for healing, and to reduce the risk
of herniation or dehiscence of abdominal wound.1
 It
was also thought that it helped reduce adhesion
formation.1,2 Few studies have shown that nonclosure of the peritoneum was associated with more
rapid healing. The absence of suture material and
the reduced tissue handling is thought to contribute
to less adhesion formation.2,3 The physiological
explanations for the better tissue healing and less
adhesions are, the deperitonelized surfaces which are
not traumatized heal without permanent adhesions
because they retain their ability to lyse fibrinous
adhesions before organization can occur.2-4 Tight

sutures may cause the peritoneum to become
ischemic and therefore it losses the ability to lyse
fibrin.3,4 There is evidence that if left unsutured,
peritoneal defects will have mesothelial integrity

formation in 5 days.3,5-8 Closure of the peritoneum

Methods: A randomized-controlled study of women
undergoing cesarean section in Sultan Qaboos University
Hospital Maternity Unit. After the decision is taken for
cesarean section, women were randomized to either repair
of peritoneum using standard technique or non-repair of
peritoneum. Duration of operation, maternal morbidity,
blood loss assessed by post-operative hemoglobin change
and requirement of transfusion, post operative infection,
thromboembolic disease, and length of hospital stay were
analyzed in 2 groups of patients. Sixty women were

statistically significant difference in the length of stay,

postoperative pyrexia, and wound infection rate between
the 2 groups.
Conclusions: Our study has confirmed the previous study
findings, and has shown that there are no advantages in
suturing of the peritoneum in terms of blood loss, blood

was associated with shorter operation duration (p<0.01

ward at Sultan Qaboos University Hospital. They
were randomized to one of 2 groups by numbered
envelope technique. Thirty to peritoneal closure and
30 to non-closure of peritoneum.
Group A. After closure of the uterus in the usual
manner, the parietal and visceral peritoneum was
closed using 2.0 vicryl sutures. Hemostasis is
checked as normally practiced. Abdominal wall is
closed in layers as standard practice.
Group B. The procedure is as for group A except
that both the parietal and visceral peritoneum is left
without closure. Again hemostasis is checked before
continuing to close the abdominal wall. All women
had primary cesarean section, and no previous
laparotomy. The Pfanennsteil incision was used for
all patients, and general anesthesia was used in both
groups. No patient received corticosteriods, pre
operative antibiotics or antihistamines.
All women under going cesarean section have a
sample of blood taken for hemoglobin estimation.
Post-operative hemoglobin specimens were taken 48
hours after the cesarean section. The hematocrit was
noted in each specimen, to allow accurate estimation
of the drop in Hb concentration, which reflects blood
loss. The doctors completed a questionnaire after the
procedure. The collected data was entered into a
database for analysis.
Results. All women who were asked to take part
in the study accepted. The mean age of the patients in
the group with peritoneal closure was 28 years, and
26 years in the group with peritoneal non-closure.
There were no significant differences in the 2
examined groups as far as parity, weight and
gestational age (Table 1). No case of deep venous
thrombosis or pulmonary embolism occurred in either
group. The duration of cesarean section performed
using non-closure was much shorter than these
performed by the standard technique. The difference
was statistically significant. There were no
differences in the length of stay, post operative
infection rate, and no significant difference between
the estimated blood loss, blood transfusion, and
operative duration between the 2 groups (Table 2).
Discussion. Closure of peritoneum was
addressed at 4 randomized-controlled trials; all these
trials were included in the Cochrane Systematic
Review. The review concludes that currently
available evidence questions the routine use of
peritoneal closure as conventional practice in routine
cesarean section.5
Recommendation from the Royal College of
Obstetricians and Gynecologists guideline No 15
states “the closure of peritoneal defects even with
minimally reactive suture materials, results in
increased tissue reaction and may result in adhesion
formation. Non-closure appears to have few risks and
may be recommended in many obstetric and
gynecology operations. Surgeons abandoning closure
should be no less meticulous in other aspects of their
craft”.

Peritoneal non-closure at cesarean section ... Galaal & Krolikowski
Our study has confirmed the previous studies
findings and has shown that there are no advantages
in suturing of the peritoneum in terms of blood loss,
blood transfusion, operation duration, post-operative
pyrexia and wound infection. In fact non-suturing of
the peritoneum was associated with shorter operation
duration (p<0.01 significant), reduced rate of postoperative pyrexia and wound infections (nonsignificant). Non-closure of the peritoneum would
be associated with reduced operative time and
therefore reduce the exposure to anesthesia and rate
of thromb-embolic complications. The shorter
operative time leads to more efficient use of the
theater time and therefore reduces cost. Another
aspect we have addressed in this study was the cost
of the suture materials. The suture used for closure
of the peritoneum is vicryl 0.0, and on average 2 of
these suture materials are used during cesarean
delivery. In the non-closure group R.O 1.013 was
saved for each procedure, i.e. in total = 30.39.
This study shows that non-closure of the
peritoneum at cesarean section is associated with
reduced operation time which in-turn reduces the
anesthetic exposure and complications. It has further
proven that non-closure of the peritoneum is not
associated with increased morbidity.
