Caesarean section surgical techniques (CORONIS): a fractional,
factorial, unmasked, randomised controlled trial
The CORONIS Collaborative Group*
Summary
Background Variations exist in the surgical techniques used for caesarean section and many have not been rigorously
assessed in randomised controlled trials. We aimed to assess whether any surgical techniques were associated with
improved outcomes for women and babies.
Methods CORONIS was a pragmatic international 2×2×2×2×2 non-regular fractional, factorial, unmasked, randomised
controlled trial that examined fi ve elements of the caesarean section technique in intervention pairs. CORONIS was
undertaken at 19 sites in Argentina, Chile, Ghana, India, Kenya, Pakistan, and Sudan. Each site was assigned to three
of the fi ve intervention pairs: blunt versus sharp abdominal entry; exteriorisation of the uterus for repair versus intraabdominal repair; single-layer versus double-layer closure of the uterus; closure versus non-closure of the peritoneum
(pelvic and parietal); and chromic catgut versus polyglactin-910 for uterine repair. Pregnant women were eligible if
they were to undergo their fi rst or second caesarean section through a planned transverse abdominal incision.
Women were randomly assigned by a secure web-based number allocation system to one intervention from each of
the three assigned pairs. All investigators, surgeons, and participants were unmasked to treatment allocation. The
primary outcome was the composite of death, maternal infectious morbidity, further operative procedures, or blood
transfusion (>1 unit) up to the 6-week follow-up visit. Women were analysed in the groups into which they were
allocated. The CORONIS Trial is registered with Current Controlled Trials: ISRCTN31089967.
Findings Between May 20, 2007, and Dec 31, 2010, 15 935 women were recruited. There were no statistically signifi cant
differences within any of the intervention pairs for the primary outcome: blunt versus sharp entry risk ratio 1·03 (95% CI
0·91–1·17), exterior versus intra-abdominal repair 0·96 (0·84–1·08), single-layer versus double-layer closure 0·96
(0·85–1·08), closure versus non-closure 1·06 (0·94–1·20), and chromic catgut versus polyglactin-910 0·90 (0·78–1·04).
144 serious adverse events were reported, of which 26 were possibly related to the intervention. Most of the reported
serious adverse events were known complications of surgery or complications of the reasons for the caesarean section.
Interpretation These fi ndings suggest that any of these surgical techniques is acceptable. However, longer-term
follow-up is needed to assess whether the absence of evidence of short-term eff ects will translate into an absence of
long-term eff ects.

Introduction
Caesarean section is one of the most commonly undertaken operations worldwide and accounts for up to 60%
of deliveries in some countries.1–3 Caesarean section
carries a risk of short-term postoperative morbidity, for
example, fever, pain, post-partum haemorrhage, damage
to the bladder or ureters, and thromboembolic disease.
Long-term clinical and obstetric problems include
chronic pain, infertility, bowel obstruction, abnormal
placen tation and its consequences, and uterine rupture.4–6
Caesarean section is not done in a standardised way, and
there are variations in the surgical techniques used.7,8
Many of the surgical techniques have not been rigorously
assessed in randomised controlled trials and so whether
any of them are associated with better outcomes for
women and babies is not known.7
 Because large numbers
of women undergo caesarean section, even small diff erences in postoperative morbidity between techniques
could mean improved health for a large number of women
and substantial savings for health services. Rigorous
random ised controlled trials are needed to establish the
eff ective ness of diff erent surgical techniques. We therefore
undertook the present trial to assess whether fi ve specifi c
approaches to the surgical techniques were associated
with improved outcomes for women and babies.
Methods
Study design and participants
After widespread interest from many countries to
participate in the UK trial of caesarean section surgical
techniques (CAESAR),9
 WHO funded a workshop in
Oxford, UK, to develop a proposal for a new trial to be
undertaken in these countries. At this workshop,
investigators reviewed all the available evidence for each
element of the caesarean section operation and produced,
through a formal consensus process, a ranked list of
candidate intervention pairs to include in the trial.
Eligibility for inclusion as a trial intervention was based
on a range of criteria including the clinical importance of
resolving the uncertainty for short-term and long-term

outcomes, the quality and quantity of available evidence,
and the feasibility of undertaking the interventions in the
participating countries.
Based on the fi ndings from the workshop, we undertook a multicentre, unmasked, randomised controlled
trial at 19 sites in Argentina, Chile, Ghana, India, Kenya,
Pakistan, and Sudan to assess two surgical techniques
(intervention pairs) for fi ve elements of the caesarean
section operation. The fi ve intervention pairs were as
follows: (1) blunt versus sharp abdominal entry; (2)
exteriorisation of the uterus for repair versus intraabdominal repair; (3) single-layer versus double-layer
closure of the uterus; (4) closure versus non-closure of
the peritoneum (pelvic and parietal); and (5) chromic
catgut versus polyglactin-910 for uterine repair. The
methods have been summarised previously.10
Pregnant women were eligible if they were to undergo
delivery by lower segment caesarean section through
a transverse abdominal incision, irrespective of fever in
labour, gestational age, or multiple pregnancies. Women
were not eligible if there was a clear indication for a
particular surgical technique or material to be used that
prevented any of the allocated interventions being used,
if they had more than one previous caesarean section, or
if they had already been recruited into the trial.
The National Perinatal Epidemiology Unit Clinical
Trials Unit (Oxford, UK) and each participating site
secured approval from their research ethics committee
or equivalent body. The trial was overseen by an
independent trial steering commit tee. An independent
data monitoring com mit tee monitored eff ectiveness and
safety annually. The data monitoring committee used the
Haybittle–Peto11,12 approach for interim analyses using
three standard errors as the cutoff for consideration of
early cessation, preserving the type-one error rate across
the trial.
Each participating site, advised by their research
ethics committee, decided how to provide trial
information to women and seek informed consent.
Information leafl ets were made available, in appropriate
languages, which explained the trial objectives, the
process of trial entry, and follow-up. The trial was
discussed with all eligible women and their partners
and relatives as appropriate. If the woman agreed to
participate, she signed a formal consent form or used
the method of recording consent permitted in that
setting (eg, a thumb print).
Randomisation and masking
Although there were fi ve intervention pairs, each site was
assigned only three to maximise compliance (appendix),
thereby making this a 2×2×2×2×2 fractional, factorial trial
(more correctly termed a non-regular fractional, factorial
trial).13 Women were randomly allocated to one intervention from each of the three assigned pairs. Randomisation was done using a bespoke secure web-based
system, with a 24-h automated telephone back-up.
The system allocated a number corresponding to a
unique allocation envelope held at participating sites.
The allocation numbers were generated by computer
implementation of a pseudo-random generating algorithm. Each envelope contained an allocation sheet
detailing the three allocated interventions for a woman,
as a reminder to the surgeon. In instances where there
was no internet or telephone connectivity, the recruiting
clinician selected the lowest sequentially numbered
allocation envelope. All randomisation data were held
centrally at the international coordinating centre (National
Perinatal Epidemiology Unit Clinical Trials Unit).
We used minimisation to ensure balance within sites,
within and between intervention pairs, and with respect to
in-labour and not in-labour caesarean section and fi rst or
second caesarean section. For sites where chromic catgut
versus polyglactin-910 was one of the assigned intervention
pairs, supplies of both suture materials were provided by
the international coordinating centre and were contained
in a specifi c trial box stored in the operating theatre.
All investigators, surgeons, and participants were unmasked to treatment allocation.
Procedures
Each regional coordinator (one per country, except India,
which was split into two regions) started and documented
a train ing programme that ensured that surgeons
operating within the trial were familiar with the techniques being compared before participating. To facilitate
this, the international coordinating centre gave a DVD of
the interventions tested to all study sites.
The procedures for blunt versus sharp abdominal
entry were as follows. For sharp entry, the abdomen was
entered using a scalpel to divide the abdominal skin.
Each subsequent layer of the abdomen was then
separately identifi ed and divided using either a scalpel or
scissors. In blunt entry, the abdomen was entered using
a scalpel to divide the abdominal skin. The scalpel was
then used to divide the fat and rectus sheath in the
midline and the rectus sheath incision extended
manually. The parietal peritoneum was then entered
digitally and the defect enlarged manually.
For exteriorisation of the uterus for repair versus intraabdominal repair, once the placenta had been delivered,
either the uterus was drawn from the pelvis to rest on the
anterior abdominal wall so that the uterine incision could
clearly be visualised or the uterus was repaired while in
the pelvis.
For the comparison of single-layer versus double-layer
closure of the uterus, the uterine incision was closed
with either one or two layers of sutures. Each layer could
be closed using any accepted technique. Haemostasis
of the incision could be done with additional sutures as
judged necessary by the surgeon regardless of the
method of closure undertaken.
For closure versus non-closure, the pelvic and parietal
peritoneum was either closed or not closed. For either

technique, haemostasis was achieved as usual, including,
where necessary, the use of haemostatic sutures.
Finally, for chromic catgut versus polyglactin-910 for
uterine repair, the uterus was repaired using either
number 1 chromic catgut (Medsurge, Philadelphia, PA,
USA) or number 1 polyglactin-910 (Ethicon, Livingston,
NJ, UK). This could be a continuous, continuous locking,
or an inter rupted layer of sutures. For sites where
chromic catgut versus polyglactin-910 was one of the
assigned intervention pairs, surgeons were asked to
restrict their use of the allocated suture material to repair
of the uterine incision and to use their usual suture
material for all other layers.
All non-allocated surgical elements and all other
aspects of the caesarean section procedure were
undertaken at the discretion of the surgeon. In particular,
there were no restrictions on the type of suture material
that could be used, and standard measures to achieve
haemostasis were employed regardless of the allocated
intervention.
The primary outcome was a composite of death,
maternal infectious morbidity, further operative procedures, or blood transfusion of more than 1 unit of
whole blood or packed cells up to the 6-week follow-up
visit. Maternal infectious morbidity was defi ned as one or
more of the following: antibiotic use for maternal febrile
morbidity during postnatal hospital stay or for endometritis, wound infection, or peritonitis up to the 6-week
follow-up visit. Blood transfusion as part of the composite
primary outcome was changed on June 14, 2010, from
any blood transfusion to transfusion of more than 1 unit
of blood when the data monitoring committee and
international coordinating centre became aware that one
site was transfusing 1 unit of blood routinely.
Secondary outcomes consisted of the individual
components of the primary outcome as well as pain,

haemorrhage, stillbirth after trial entry, other severe
maternal morbidity, Apgar score less than 3 at 5 min,
laceration of baby at time of caesarean section, and death
of the baby by 6 weeks of age. Secondary health service
utilisation outcomes consisted of the duration of the
operation, duration of hospital stay, admission to
intensive care and duration of stay, and readmission to
hospital within 6 weeks and duration of stay.
Data were collected at trial entry, immediately after
surgery, at hospital discharge (including hospital
transfer or death), and at about 6 weeks after delivery.
Women who did not return at 6 weeks were located and
interviewed by telephone or during a home visit.
Serious adverse events were assessed by the chief
investigator and data monitoring committee as soon as
they were reported to the international coordinating

Statistical analysis
A sample size of 15 000 women was needed, with at least
9000 women in each intervention pair, to have at least
80% power to detect a 15% relative risk reduction in the
primary outcome from a baseline incidence of 15%
(estimated from a pilot study of 855 consecutive women
who were to undergo a caesarean section [Brocklehurst P,
unpublished]), assuming 15% loss to follow-up.
A detailed statistical analysis plan was developed and
approved by the trial steering committee (appendix). For
the analysis of maternal outcomes, women were
analysed in the groups into which they were allocated;
for example, comparing women allocated to blunt
abdominal entry with those allocated to sharp abdominal
entry, regardless of what interventions they actually
received. For the analysis of neonatal outcomes,
neonates were analysed according to the groups
allocated to the women. Neonatal outcomes were only
analysed in the intervention pair blunt versus sharp
abdominal entry because these were the only
interventions that could have an eff ect on neonatal
outcomes. In the analysis of neonatal outcomes,
neonates from multiple births were treated as
independent, but the eff ect of adjusting for potential
clustering was also assessed.14
The focus of the primary analysis was the main eff ects
of the fi ve intervention pairs analysed separately. Pairwise
interactions were planned if the analyses showed any
statistically signifi cant main eff ects for the primary
outcome only. Subgroup analyses according to caesarean

the primary outcome and less than 0·01 for all secondary
outcomes and subgroup analyses.
An adjusted analysis was prespecifi ed for the primary
outcome to investigate the eff ect of minimisation factors:
in-labour versus not in-labour caesarean section and
number of previous caesarean sections. Several
sensitivity analyses of the primary outcome were also
prespecifi ed in the analysis plan. All analyses were
undertaken using Stata/SE (version 11.2).
The CORONIS trial is registered with Current
Controlled Trials, ISRCTN31089967.
Role of the funding source
The trial was funded by the UK Medical Research Council.
WHO contributed to the cost of the initial protocol
development meeting and site set-up costs in the fi rst
year. The sponsors of the study had no role in study
design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation,
or writing of the report. The corresponding author had
full access to all the data in the study and had fi nal
responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.
Results
Between May 20, 2007, and Dec 31, 2010, 15 935 women
were recruited at 19 sites in Argentina, Chile, Ghana,
India, Kenya, Pakistan, and Sudan (appendix). The
appendix describes the character istics of the participating
countries and sites.
After the second meeting of the data monitoring
committee on July 22, 2009, when data from 7972 women
were reviewed, the data monitoring committee informed
the trial steering committee that, instead of an expected
primary outcome incidence of around 15%, the incidence
was 4·7%. The investigators assessed this discrepancy,
masked to treatment allo cation, and found that the
overall incidence of the primary outcome varied substantially between sites and consequently an extensive
validation exercise was undertaken between Aug 13,
2009, and March 3, 2011 (appendix). Validation was done
by independent observers and included reviewing source
records and interviewing participating women. This
exercise resulted in an overall primary outcome
incidence of 9·3%. After considering many scenarios,

the trial steering committee recommended continuation
of recruitment until the end of 2010 (4 months later than
planned), when about 16 000 women would have been
enrolled. This would still give 80% power to detect a
relative risk reduction of 0·825 if the overall primary
outcome incidence was at least 9·0%. To ensure at least
9000 women were included in each intervention pair,
close monitoring of recruitment was done weekly by the
international coordinating centre. This led to three sites
switching intervention pairs in 2010 (appendix).
In accordance with the prespecifi ed analysis plan,
206 (1·3%) of the 15 935 women were excluded from the
analysis, of whom 143 (0·9%) had a vaginal delivery
(fi gure 1). These women were evenly distributed among
the intervention pairs and were excluded from the
analysis because they were not at risk of wound-related
problems. Trial entry and discharge data were available
for 15 913 (99·9%) of 15 935 women and 6-week data for
15 611 (98·0%) women (fi gure 1). Compliance with all
the allocated interventions was high, 87% overall
(fi gure 1). The diff erence in compliance between single
and double layer closure of the uterus (83% vs 98%,
respectively) was mostly explained by clinical decisions
during surgery.
Baseline characteristics were similar within and across
inter vention pairs (table 1; appendix). The mean age was
27·0 years (SD 5·4), almost half were nulliparous, about
a third were undergoing a second caesarean section, just
over half underwent caesarean section before the start of
labour, and 15% were less than 37 weeks gestation.
99% of women received prophylactic antibiotics and
prophylactic uterotonics and 7% received prophylactic
heparin (appendix).
The incidence of the primary outcome was 9·3%
overall and varied from 7·3% to 10·7% by intervention
pair (table 2). There were no statistically signifi cant
differences within any of the intervention pairs for the
primary outcome (table 2). As prespecifi ed in the analysis
plan, no tests for interaction were done because there
was no evidence of main eff ects for the primary outcome.
There was only one statistically signifi cant diff erence
in one component of the primary outcome, which
was for the intervention pair chromic catgut versus
polyglactin-910 for uterine repair and the outcome of

blood transfusion greater than 1  unit (risk ratio 0·53,
99% CI 0·30–0·93; table 2). On further assessment, this
result was robust when adjusted for in-labour versus not
in-labour caesarean section and suture material used as
standard in each site (data not shown).
There was no evidence of a diff erence within intervention pairs for any of the other secondary outcomes
(table 3). For the intervention of blunt versus sharp
abdominal entry, where the potential diff erence in the
time taken to enter the abdominal cavity might lead to
worse neonatal outcomes, there was no evidence of a
diff erence in the risk of stillbirth or low Apgar score
(table 4). These fi ndings did not change after allowing for
clustering for multiple births (table 4).
There was limited consistent and corroborated
evidence of a diff erential treatment eff ect between the
subgroups in the eff ect of the interventions on the
primary outcome (fi gures 2–6). We cannot explain the
diff erences for Argentina in the comparison of blunt
versus sharp abdominal entry and for Chile in the
comparison of chromic catgut versus polyglactin-910 and
assume that they are spurious associations because of
the large number of comparisons made. Not all the
prespecifi ed subgroup analyses were undertaken because
the size of some of the subgroups was too small. HIV
infection was present in only 2% of women and intrapartum fever in only 2% (table 1). The adjusted analyses
(appendix) and the sensitivity analyses (table 5) resulted
in no eff ect on the fi ndings for the primary outcome.
144 serious adverse events were reported, of which
26 were possibly related to the intervention (appendix).
Most of the reported serious adverse events were known
complications of surgery or complications of the reasons
for the caesarean section; for example, obstructed labour
is a risk factor for post-partum haemorrhage. The intraabdominal bleeding and uterine atony that occurred
might have been because of the surgical techniques being
used. For example, uterine atony might be caused or
exacerbated by the method of closure of the uterine
incision (exteriorisation or intra-abdominal repair),
single-layer or double-layer closure of the uterus, or the
use of chromic catgut or polyglactin-910 sutures. The
appendix shows the distribution of all the serious adverse
events and those thought to be possibly related to the
allocated intervention, by randomised intervention pairs.
There were no statistically signifi cant diff erences in the

incidence of serious adverse events. The serious adverse
events that were possibly related to the allocated
intervention were 18 haemorrhage (uterine atony or intraabdominal bleeding) and six serious infections. The
serious adverse events included 16 deaths, of which one
was possibly related to the intervention. This was a death
due to septicaemia secondary to peritonitis after presumed intestinal perfora tion. Four deaths were due to
hypertensive disease; two to aspiration pneumonitis; two
to obstetric haemor rhage; two to thromboembolic
disease; one each to renal failure, stroke, brain tumour,
and H1N1 variant infl uenza; and one unknown cause in a
woman with hepatitis C.
Discussion
CORONIS was a large randomised trial of caesarean
section surgical techniques and provides important
evidence to guide clinical practice (panel). There were no
statistically signifi cant differences within any of the
intervention pairs for the primary outcome. However,
there was a statistically signifi cant diff erence in one
component of the primary outcome: chromic catgut
versus polyglactin-910 for uterine repair.
This study has limitations. We were unable, for
practical reasons, to assess all aspects of the caesarean
section operation that could aff ect maternal morbidity.
Our choice was based on a consensus meeting of
investigators who prioritised aspects of the operation as
being those for which there was little evidence to support
either approach, or for which there was the potential for
important short-term or long-term implications, such as
single-layer versus double-layer uterine closure and
uterine rupture during a subsequent pregnancy. Compliance was generally very good; however, for mostly
clinical reasons, surgeons could not always comply with
the allocated intervention. This might weaken the
diff erences between randomised groups, but represents
the pragmatic nature of the trial, thus the fi ndings are
generalisable. For sites where chromic catgut versus
polyglactin-910 for uterine repair was one of the assigned
intervention pairs, surgeons did not always follow the
trial protocol and used the suture material allocated for
closing the uterine incision to close other layers
(appendix). However, adjusting for this non-compliance
made no diff erence to the risk ratio for the primary
outcome (appendix).

The incidence of the primary outcome was lower than
anticipated, as was maternal mortality. This fi nding is a
result of the nature of recruitment of participants to
randomised controlled trials who are potentially healthier
than the represented patient population. The pilot study
(Brocklehurst P, unpublished) assessed outcomes for
consecutive caesarean sections taking place in several of
the CORONIS participating sites. By introducing a process
of enrolment into a trial, women with the greatest risk of
an adverse outcome are less likely to be recruited; this
includes women who were to undergo a caesarean section
in labour but were judged to be unable to provide informed
consent. This factor might also explain the low maternal
mortality in this sample of women. Because of the lower
than expected frequency of the primary outcome, we
undertook an extensive validation exercise. Validation
revealed that follow-up personnel were sometimes
missing important outcomes, such as wound infections.
Review of source documents and re-interviewing women
(by independent staff ) identifi ed several unreported
outcomes; extensive additional training was initiated to
ensure accurate data capture of these outcomes at the
postnatal interview for the remainder of the trial.
Despite these potential limitations and the lower than
anticipated incidence of the primary outcome, this trial
had suffi cient power to identify modest diff erences in
short-term outcomes. The only intervention–outcome
combination for which there was statistical evidence of
an eff ect was blood transfusion of greater than 1 unit for
the chromic catgut versus polyglactin-910 compari son.
When we explored the reasons for the blood transfusion,
there was an increase in the number of women having a
blood transfusion for post-partum haemorrhage in the
polyglactin-910 arm compared with the chromic catgut
arm. The number of cases was small (36 vs 20), so the
fi ndings could have arisen by chance. However, there
is no suggestion, as was widely anticipated, that
polyglactin-910 was superior to chromic catgut.
CORONIS provides evidence, on the basis of shortterm outcomes, that clinicians can remain free to use
whichever surgical technique they prefer. Although
undertaken in low-income and middle-income countries,
these fi ndings are probably generalisable to other
settings. The complications of caesarean section are the
same in all settings, albeit with diff erent frequencies.

The primary outcome of death or maternal infectious morbidity or further operative procedures or blood transfusion (>1 unit of whole blood and packed cells only) was analysed by time to follow-up after
delivery. Maternal infectious morbidity defi ned as one or more of the following: antibiotic use for maternal febrile morbidity during post-partum stay (fever on at least two occasions); antibiotic use for
endometritis, wound infection, or peritonitis up to 6 weeks post partum. Includes any operative procedures on caesarean wound, curettage, laparotomy, artery ligation, brace suture, and hysterectomy. Excludes
women randomised in error, women who withdrew consent, data not received, and vaginal deliveries (n=206 [1%]). A woman can have more than one component but is included only once in the primary

Panel: Research in context
Systematic review
There are systematic reviews (including Cochrane reviews) for
all the intervention pairs included in the CORONIS trial. For the
comparison of sharp versus blunt abdominal entry at
caesarean section, a Cochrane review was published in 2008.15
This review included 11 randomised controlled trials (with a
total of 1740 women) that compared diff erent approaches to
abdominal entry, which are comparable to the comparison
blunt versus sharp abdominal entry in the CORONIS trial
(described as Joel-Cohen based versus Pfannenstiel). The
fi ndings from this review suggested that the blunt approach
to abdominal entry led to less blood loss, a shorter duration of
surgery (including a shorter duration from skin incision to
delivery of the baby), and less postoperative fever and pain.
More serious complications, including blood transfusion of
the mother, were too few to analyse. The main challenge of
interpreting these eponymous techniques is that, if done as
intended, they include prescribed techniques for uterine
incision closure and abdominal wound closure,16 making
interpretation of outcomes in relation solely to the method of
abdominal entry diffi cult.
Exteriorisation of the uterus for repair versus intra-abdominal
repair was the topic of a systematic review published in 2009,
which included 11 trials with 3183 women in total .17 The
investigators found no evidence that one approach was
superior to the other for several outcomes such as
intraoperative or postoperative complications including
endometritis, pain, and nausea and vomiting. There were no
diff erences in the duration of the operation or in the duration
of hospital stay. Since this study was published, a trial of
4925 women has been published.18 This trial found an excess
of uterine atony in the exteriorisation group (9·1% vs 3·8% in
the intra-abdominal repair group), although there was no
statistically significant difference in the incidence of blood
transfusion. The intra-abdominal repair group had a shorter
operating time and less postoperative pain and a lower
incidence of wound infection (4·6% vs 11·5% in the
exteriorisation group). This fi nding is in contrast to the
CORONIS trial, which found no diff erences in these outcomes
in 9795 women.
A Cochrane review of closure versus non-closure of the
peritoneum (visceral or parietal or both) was last updated in
2008.19 It incorporated 14 trials including 2908 women and
found that non-closure reduced operating time,
postoperative fever, use of pain relief, and hospital stay.
Since this review was published, a further fi ve trials have
been published.9,20–23 Four of these trials are moderate in size
(between 80 and 340 women per trial),20–23 whereas the
CAESAR trial included 2995 women in this comparison.9
Some of the smaller trials found similar fi ndings to the
Cochrane review, with shorter operating times and less
postoperative febrile morbidity in the non-closure group.
However, the CAESAR trial found no diff erences in any
outcomes of postoperative morbidity but did suggest that
non-closure of the pelvic peritoneum shortened the duration
of the operation by a mean of 2·3 min. In CORONIS, by
contrast, we found no diff erence in duration of surgery.
A Cochrane systematic review of surgical techniques involving
the uterus at the time of caesarean section included trials of
single-layer versus double-layer closure of the uterine incision
(ten trials with 2531 women in total).24 Two further trials that
compared single-layer and double-layer uterine closure
published since the Cochrane review was last updated have
been identifi ed, involving 208 women in one25 and
2979 women in the other.9
 None of the existing studies
suggest major diff erences in short-term outcomes between
single-layer and double-layer uterine closure. There was a
suggestion that single-layer closure might result in a
decreased estimated blood loss at the time of caesarean
section and shorter duration of the operative procedure, but
the addition of the data from the large CAESAR trial suggests
no diff erences in any of these outcomes. CORONIS, when
added to the existing evidence, confi rms this absence of
short-term diff erences in maternal morbidity.
There are no published or ongoing trials comparing
diff erent suture materials for this element of the caesarean
section operation.
Interpretation
The published trials of caesarean section surgical techniques are
mostly small and inconclusive, and pooled estimates show, for
some of the outcomes, substantial heterogeneity. With respect
to the fi ve pairs of interventions included in CORONIS, all the
available evidence suggests that blunt abdominal entry is
unlikely to off er any short-term benefi ts for postoperative
morbidity; non-closure of the peritoneum might decrease the
duration of the operation by a small amount, but this does not
translate into improvements in morbidity outcomes;
single-layer closure of the uterine incision does not improve
short-term morbidity outcomes; and the use of chromic catgut
might have moderate advantages over the use of
polyglactin-910. With respect to whether intra-abdominal
repair of the uterine incision improves outcome, the available
evidence is still uncertain. We found no evidence of improved
outcomes for women in this comparison pair, in contrast to the
fi ndings by Doganay and colleagues.18
The fi ndings of CORONIS, when combined with the existing
evidence, suggest that clinicians are free to carry on with their
existing practices, at least with respect to their eff ect on
short-term postoperative morbidity. However, particularly for
interventions that involve closure of the uterine incision
(single-layer versus double-layer closure or use of diff erent
suture materials) as well as closure or non-closure of the
peritoneum, longer-term outcomes are needed to enable
clinicians to make fully informed decisions about what surgical
approaches to take.

tested intervention pairs in these settings is therefore
likely to also apply to caesarean sections undertaken in
high-income countries.
The potential eff ects of these surgical techniques on
longer-term outcomes, such as the functional integrity of
the uterine scar during subsequent pregnancies, is of
increasing importance for guiding clinical practice. Longterm outcomes, even if uncommon, are likely to have a
substantial eff ect on morbidity and can occasion ally result
in life-threatening events or even death. There have been
few follow-up studies of existing trials of caesarean
section techniques and these studies are small (a total of
just over 350 women).26–28 For important outcomes such
as uterine rupture (incidence 0·4–0·6%) and dehiscence
(1·1%),29–31 detection of diff er ences between alternative
surgical techniques with adequate power is challenging.
This absence of long-term follow-up data and the absence
of short-term eff ects of these techniques raise important
issues about present clinical guidance.
The short-term outcomes of the CORONIS trial
might suggest that any of the fi ve pairs of surgical
techniques is acceptable. However, until we have
information from the ongoing CORONIS follow-up
study, which is assessing women’s health at least
3 years after the CORONIS caesarean section, we
cannot assume that the absence of evidence of shortterm eff ects will translate into an absence of evidence
of long-term eff ects.
