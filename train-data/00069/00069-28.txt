Objective : To determine whether non-closure of visceral and parietal peritoneum at LSCS has advantages
over peritoneal closure with regard to postoperative complication and adhesions.
Study design : Prospective randomized controlled trial.
Setting : Paholpolpayuhasena Hospital, Kanchanaburi province, Thailand.
Subjects and Method : Three hundred and sixty full-term pregnant women undergoing first cesarean section
were divided into 3 groups (N = 120). Group A: non-closure of both visceral and parietal peritoneum. Group
B: non-closure of only visceral peritoneum. Group C: closure of both visceral and parietal peritoneum.
Postoperative complications were compared. Adhesions were evaluated in 65 patients returning for a second
LSCS and compared for severity of adhesions. The three groups were compared using statistical analysis.
Result : There was no significant statistical difference between group A and C , group B and C for postoperative
complications or number of adhesion formation. However, adhesions in the closure group were more severe.
Conclusions : Closure of visceral and parietal peritoneum has no benefit over non-closure of visceral
peritoneum and non-closure of both visceral and parietal peritoneum at LSCS.
Keywords : Cesarean delivery, Non-closure peritoneum, Adhesion, 16 year study.

Closure of the peritoneum during lower
segment cesarean section (LSCS) has long been
considered a standard procedure to 1) restore the
normal anatomy and approximate the tissue for healing,
2) reestablish the peritoneal barrier to reduce the risk
of infection, 3) reduce the risk of wound herniation or
dehiscence, and 4) minimize adhesion formation.
Numerous human and animal studies have shown that
there are no disadvantages to non-closure of the
peritoneum. The arguments against peritoneal closure
involve the following. 1) Peritoneum has the innate
ability to rapidly heal itself. Being a mesothelial organ
with the capacity to initiate multiple sites of repair, the
peritoneum can simultaneously heal throughout the
wound. Experimental studies have shown that if the
peritoneum is left open, a spontaneous reperitonealization will appear within 48 to 72 hours with
complete healing after 5-6 days. 2) Studies have shown
that there is no difference in postoperative
complications between closure and non-closure. 3)
Non-closure of the peritoneum contributes to less
adhesion. When injured, the peritoneum responds
initially by producing a fibrin matrix and proceeds with
fibrinolysis to break down the fibrin. Reaproximation
of the peritoneal edges with suture material is
suspected to result in tissue ischemia, necrosis,
foreign body tissue reaction, suppression of
fibrinolysis and thus increased risk in adhesion
formation. Animal studies have shown that adhesion
formation is a common consequence of peritoneal
closure. 4) Non-closure of the peritoneum reduces the
amount of surgical intervention and saves on valuable
operating time and cost(1-12).
Peritoneal adhesions are of major medical
importance and are associated with clinical problems
such as chronic pain, infertility, and bowel obstructions. Therefore, it is important to design a study to
investigate ways to decrease the incidence of surgical
adhesions. The purpose of this study was to compare

the short and long-term postoperative effects of
closure versus non-closure of the visceral and/or
parietal peritoneum in LSCS, with the hypothesis that
non-closure of the peritoneum would reduce the
amount of postoperative complications and adhesion
formation.
Material and Method
The study approved by the hospital
review board for research, was conducted at
Paholpolpayuhasena Hospital, Kanchanaburi
province, Thailand. From September 1, 1987 to August
31, 1991; 360 full-term single fetus, primipara, being
women of Kanchanaburi province, delivered by LSCS,
were included in the study. Women with preoperative
diseases or infections, previous complications of
pregnancy, or previous laparotomy were excluded.
The women were controlled for age, indication for
LSCS and procedure (excluding visceral/parietal
peritoneal closure). One patient who had been found
to present adhesion at 1st LSCS was also excluded
from the study. All women underwent a low midline
abdominal incision under general anesthesia (same
anesthetic agent used throughout). All the staff who
recorded the operative data performed the procedures.
Each surgeon randomized and separated the women
by running number into 3 groups. The visceral and
parietal peritoneum were left unclosed in group A. The
parietal peritoneum was closed in Group B. Group C
was the control group whose visceral and parietal
peritoneum were closed routinely.
A standard technique for LSCS was
performed. The uterine incision was closed with 2
layers of continuous 1 chromid cat gut suture, the
peritoneum with a continuous 000 chromid cat gut,
and the fascia with a continuous 2 polyglactin suture.
The skin was approximated by interrupted 000 plain
cat gut subcutaneous sutures, then skin suture with
interrupted 000 mersilk sutures. A urinary catheter was
routinely inserted throughout the operation and was
removed after skin closure. Intermittent catheterization
was done if the patient could not void within 8 hours.
Prophylactic antibiotics were used with the discretion
of the surgeon. The postoperative care staff recorded
all postoperative data and were blinded to which
procedure was performed on each patient. During first
24 hour postoperative period, pain was released with
opioid injection q 4 hrs then changed to paracetamol
1,000 milligrams q 4 hrs on day 1 as the patient
requested when oral diet was started (the operative
day was day 0). The dry dressing wound was applied
on day 4 and stitches were removed on day 7 prior to
patient discharge. A postpartum examination was done
6 weeks after delivery by PV and PAP smear. All data
was collected systematically.
Febrile morbidity was defined as a nonspecific fever above 38o
c lasting for more than 24
hours. Endomyometritis was diagnosed from uterine
tenderness and offensive lochia with fever. Wound
infection was diagnosed by erythema, induration, or
purulent discharge. Cystitis was diagnosed by clinical
dysurination or frequent micturation, with wbc >10
cells/HF from microscopic examination of midstream
or catheterized urine.
The surgeon performing the second LSCS,
noted the operative findings concerning intraabdominal adhesion, including the site and degree of
adhesion. The surgeon was blinded to which
procedure had been done during the previous LSCS.
The women were classified into four groups; group I
no adhesion, group II mild adhesion (< 3 cm band),
group III moderate adhesion (> 3 – 5 cm band), group
IV severe adhesion (>5 cm band and or difficult to
lysis). Sixty-five of the 360 patients underwent a
second LSCS between September 1988 and December
2003 (20 patients in group A, 20 patients in group B,
and 25 patients in group C). All of them had no other
abdominal operations between the two LSCS. The
shortest interval period between the 2 operations was
1 year, the longest 11 years. Most of the patients
underwent the second LSCS within 3 to 5 years.
Chi-square test or Fisher exact test were used
for statistical analysis, with a p < 0.05 considered
significant.
Results
Postoperative complications at first LSCS are
shown in Table 1. There was no statistical significance
when comparing group A to group C and group B to
group C for postoperative complications. One patient
was readmitted 3 weeks postoperative from puerpural
sepsis. Prophylactic antibiotics were more often used
in group C, but no statistical significance was found.
Three patients (one of each group) had prolonged
hospitalization to day 8 due to infected wound and
secondary suture.
Table 2 presents the results of adhesion
formation at 2nd LSCS of the 65 patients. There was no
significant statistical difference between the groups,
however the authors did find more severe adhesion in
patients in group C. The details of the patients who
had intra-abdominal adhesion are shown in Table 3.
J Med Assoc Thai Vol. 87 No.9 2004 1009
The more serious the indication for LSCS in group A
and B resulted in more severe adhesion. One patient
from group A (A-1) who had severe adhesion, had
febrile morbidity with antibiotic use (F morbid + AB)
lasting for 5 days after first LSCS. Another patient
from group A (A-4) also had previous prolonged febrile
morbidity, but presented with mild adhesion. Three
cases from group C had only low grade fever with
prophylactic antibiotics, of the 2 cases (C-1, C-2) yet
resulted in severe adhesion. All of mild adhesions
appeared along the incision of the abdomen, always
involving the omentum. The more severe adhesions,
extended to the lower uterine segment and bladder
wall area. The mild and moderate adhesions in group
B also appeared on the abdominal wall along the
incision line. There were no other sites of adhesions
in the abdominal cavity. The authors did not find any
intra-abdominal infections, wound herniation, or
wound dehiscence. During the 16 year period. Five
patients safely had trans vaginal delivery. Two
patients suffered from endometriosis, and one patient
died from HIV infection in October 2000.
Discussion
The peritoneal defect is restored simultaneously by “metastasis” of nearby mesothelial lining
cells, and the duration of repair is independent of the
size of the peritoneal defects(1-7). Adhesion formation
is suspected to relate to tissue ischemia and necrosis,
infection, foreign body contamination and surgical
technique. From animal studies, closure of the parietal
peritoneum is associated with more adhesion formation
when compared to non-closure for spontaneous
healing(5-9). Therefore, suturing the peritoneum may
actually increase the risk of adhesion development.
In human subjects, many reports have
expressed different findings, comparing closure and

non-closure of the peritoneum. Studies have found
no difference in postoperative complications(10-14),
febrile morbidity(15,16), wound dehiscence(1,3,4,16-18),
return of bowel function(11,16,17), urinary tract infection
(16,17), postoperative pain and length of hospital stay(15).
On the other hand, peritoneal closure correlated with
a significantly higher incidence of febrile morbidity
and wound infection(17,18,
)
 cystitis(16), endometritis(18),
increased postoperative pain with more narcotics
use(10-12,18), prolonged hospital stay(11,17,18), and
antibiotic use(18). Tulandi, et al, performed second look
laparoscopy one year after reproductive surgery (N=
333). They confirmed that non-closure of the parietal
peritoneum (N = 57) did not increase adhesion
formation, when compared to the closure group (N =
63)(13). Roset E,et al, mentioned 29 patients of
subsequent abdominal surgery after LSCS (N = 144).
Fourteen patients presented with adhesion (8 in
closure and 6 in the non-closure group; P=0.47)(16).
From many studies, it has been concluded that routine
closure of visceral and or parietal peritoneum should
be omitted during cesarean delivery(1,2,10,11,17,18). Closure
of the peritoneum also plays no role in other
gynecologic surgery(13,19) and even radical abdominal
hysterectomy and nodal resection(20). However, today
peritoneal closure is used as a routine standard
procedure and is incorporated into the training
experience. It is probable that this procedure has been
used for a long time previously, since no definite
serious complications were found. The present study
compared primary LSCS among three groups; nonclosure of visceral and parietal peritoneum, only
visceral peritoneum non-closure, and both peritoneum
closure. It is the longest study (16 years) investigating
adhesion during second look operation at the second
LSCS.
By short-term evaluation of postoperative
and postpartum period of the first LSCS, the authors
found no significant statistical difference of
postoperative complications among the three groups.
By process of operation, it is clear that operating time,
anesthetic exposure, and operative cost were reduced
in the non-closure group, so it was not studied. One
puerperal sepsis patient (closure group) was admitted
on the 3rd week of postoperative period; there was no
other serious complication. Incision hernia and wound
dehiscence were not found in the present study.
Prophylactic antibiotics were frequently used in the
present study since all primary operations were
performed as emergency LSCS. Long term evaluation,
during second LSCS, showed no significant statistical
difference in the number of patients who had
adhesions. However, the adhesions were more severe
in the closure group.
When comparing closure and non-closure of
both visceral and parietal peritoneum, peritoneal
closure did not reduce the risks of infection, wound
herniation or dehiscence, nor did it minimize adhesion
formation. When the peritoneum was left unclosed,
tissue healing allowed for restoration of normal pelvic
anatomy. From the present study, it was suggested
that closure of visceral and parietal peritoneum may
be omitted in LSCS. Peritoneal closure did not
demonstrate any benefits to more adhesions than nonclosure. The limitation of this study was the small
sample size. However, the results of the study are
favorable on non-closure of both parietal and visceral
peritoneum. Further studies are suggested to confirm
this finding.
Conclusion
A prospective randomized controlled trial was
done for 16 years. The hypothesis tested was that
non-closure of the visceral and parietal peritoneum
might benefit the patients of fewer postoperative
complications and less adhesion formation. The
research rejected the hypothesis because postoperative complications between the three groups were not
statistically significant. Closure of visceral and parietal
peritoneum showed no benefit over non-closure.
However, adhesion formation was less severe in nonclosure patients.
