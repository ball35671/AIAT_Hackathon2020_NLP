A randomised controlled trial of the closure or non-closure of
peritoneum at caesarean section: effect on post-operative pain
Z. Rafique*, K.U. Shibli, I.F. Russell, S.W. Lindow
Objective To compare the analgesic requirement in the post-operative period after closure or non-closure of
the peritoneum at the caesarean delivery with a standardised anaesthetic and surgical technique.
Design A randomised double-blind controlled trial was performed on 100 women who underwent elective
caesarean delivery.
Main outcome measures Analgesic requirement assessed by morphine usage via patient controlled analgesia
pump over the first 24-hour period after surgery, oral analgesia used during the first four days, postoperative pain assessed by a visual analogue scale and a verbal rating scale, and patient satisfaction assessed
by verbal rating scale were the main outcome measures.
Results Pain scores at 24 hours were similar in both groups (43.5 in closure and 40.5 in non-closure) but
during the first 24 hours the non-closure group had used significantly less morphine than the closure group
(0.64mg/kg of body weight vs 0.82mg/kg, P ¼ 0.04). The patients in non-closure group had significantly
higher satisfaction scores after 24 hours than the closure group.
Conclusion Non-closure of both visceral and parietal peritoneum at the caesarean section produces a
significant reduction in the post-operative use of patient controlled analgesia pump morphine and
significantly higher patient satisfaction at 24 hours post-operatively.
INTRODUCTION
Kerr, in 1926, described the lower uterine segment
transverse incision, for the caesarean delivery1
. Since then
both visceral and parietal peritoneal layers have been
traditionally closed in separate layers. The proponents of
this technique claim that it helps re-establish anatomical
relations, reduces the risk of infection, prevents incisional
hernia, and prevents adhesion formation2
. However there is
no scientific evidence to substantiate these claims. In fact
both clinical and animal studies3–5 have shown many
advantages of leaving the peritoneum open after abdominal
surgery. Potential advantages claimed after non-closure of
the peritoneum at lower segment caesarean section include,
shorter surgical time, shorter hospital stay, lower incidence
of immediate post-operative morbidity including a reduced
post-operative infection rate, and a lower incidence of long
term morbidity with respect to adhesion formation and
intestinal obstruction6 – 11.
There is no agreement regarding the effect of leaving the
peritoneum open on post-operative pain. Some studies have
shown that leaving the peritoneum open at caesarean
section has beneficial effects on post-operative pain6,7,
while others have shown no benefit8
. These contradictory
results may be due to the fact that the above studies were not
designed specifically to assess post-operative pain. We have
tried to resolve this debate by conducting a randomisedcontrolled trial of peritoneal closure with a standardised
anaesthetic and surgical technique and post-operative conditions. Our goal was to evaluate whether non-closure of
peritoneum has any effect on post-operative pain.
METHODS
The study was a double-blind, randomised controlled
trial comparing the effect of closure with non-closure of
both visceral and parietal peritoneum on post-operative
pain following caesarean section. The study was approved
by the Local Ethics and Research Committee and written
informed consent was obtained from all recruited women
after discussing study aims, the use of rectal diclofenac,
patient controlled analgesia pump and the use of visual
analogue scale. One hundred women undergoing elective
caesarean section were randomly allocated to one of the
two groups with the use of opaque sealed numbered
envelopes.
The randomisation sequence was generated by computer
generated random numbers. Each continuous numbered
envelope contained a note instructing the surgeon to leave
the peritoneum open or to close it. The data recording form
and all the paperwork in the envelope had the same code.
The envelopes were opened in sequence in the operating
theatre just before the start of surgery and the note shown to
the surgeon. A Pfannenstiel incision was employed in all

the cases. In the control group both the visceral and parietal
peritoneum were closed using a continuous absorbable
suture [polyglactin 2.0] while in the experimental group
both peritoneal layers were left unsutured. The rectus
sheath was sutured using continuous absorbable sutures
[polyglactin 1.0], and the skin was sutured using subcutaneous polyglactin sutures. All patients received intravenous
antibiotoics (cefuroxime 750mg and metronidazole 500mg
or ampicillin 500mg) immediately after the delivery. The
time of skin incision, time of delivery and time at of end of
surgery were recorded.
All patients received a standard spinal anaesthetic using
a 25G pencil point needle and 2.5–3.0ml of 0.5% heavy
bupivacaine, injected in right lateral position, to achieve a
good sensory block with anaesthesia to at least T5. No
intrathecal opioids were used. No intravenous fluid preload was used but blood pressure was maintained by rapid
infusion of Ringer’s solution containing 60mg ephedrine
in 1000ml, as required. At the end of surgery 100mg
diclofenac per rectum and 50mg of cylclizine intramuscularly were given to all the patients. An intravenous
patient controlled analgesia pump containing 120mg of
morphine in 60ml of 0.9% saline was set up. The pump
was programmed to deliver a 2mg bolus of morphine at
the ‘stat’ setting with a five-minute lockout period. No
background infusion was used and no upper demand limit
was set. The end of surgery was taken as zero hours and
pain was assessed thereafter at one, two, three, four, six,
eight, twelve, and 24 hours by visual analogue scale
(0mm ¼ no pain, 100mm ¼ unbearable pain)14 and verbal
rating scale (0 ¼ no pain, 1 ¼ discomfort, 2 ¼ slight pain,
3 ¼ moderate pain, 4 ¼ severe pain, 5 ¼ excruciating
pain). Pain was measured both during rest and movement.
The patient controlled analgesia pump was disconnected
after 24 hours and the number of patient controlled
analgesia pump demands successful and failed (i.e.
demands during the five-minute lock out period), and
total dose of morphine used was recorded by midwives.
Rectal/oral analgesics (diclofenac 50mg or paracetamol
1000mg with codeine phosphate 60mg) were administered
as needed. The use of any rectal/oral analgesia was
recorded both during and after the use of patient controlled analgesia pump for four days post-operatively.
Patient satisfaction regarding pain relief was assessed by
verbal rating scale (0 ¼ poor, 1 ¼ fair, 2 ¼ adequate, 3 ¼
good, 4 ¼ very good, 5 ¼ excellent). Neither attending
midwives nor patients knew of the group allocation. Apart
from these main outcome measures we also recorded
surgical time, pre and post-operative haemoglobin levels,
number of days to discharge, incidence of post-operative
febrile morbidity, and visual analogue scale for itching
and sleepiness.
Sample size was calculated by a difference in visual
analogue scale of 1.0cm with a standard deviation of 1.5cm
and a ¼ 0.05, b ¼ 0.95. This gives a minimum size of 47 in
each group. Our groups comprised of 50 women each.

RESULTS
Between April 1997 and August 1999 one hundred
women undergoing elective caesarean section under spinal
anaesthetic were randomly allocated to one of the two
groups. Fifty women were allocated to the study group
(closure group) and 50 women were assigned to the
experimental group (non-closure group). No woman was
excluded from the analysis. The groups were similar with
respect to age, parity, gestational age and other general
characteristics (Table 1). Groups were also similar with
respect to the indication for surgery, type of anaesthetic,
and grade and experience of the surgeon. Two patients in
closure group and four in non-closure group had intraabdominal tubal ligations (Table 2).
The non-closure group used significantly less morphine
when compared with closure group during the first 24 hours
(0.64mg/kg vs 0.82mg/kg 95%, P ¼ 0.043). The number of
mean failed patient controlled analgesia pump demands,
was also significantly less for the non-closure group (7.0 vs
17, P ¼ 0.018). During the first 24-hour period both groups
received similar amount of oral/rectal analgesics but over
the ensuing 48-hour period non-closure group used less
rectal/oral analgesia than the closure group although this
was not statistically significant (Table 3).
There was no overall difference in visual analogue scale
between the two groups, although there was a tendency of
lower pain scores in the non-closure group (Table 4).
Verbal rating scale for patient satisfaction demonstrated
that patients in the non-closure group were more satisfied
(c2 11.2, P < 0.05) with their pain relief at the 24-hour
post-operative period compared with the closure group
(Table 5). Verbal rating scale for pain did not demonstrate any statistically significant difference between the
groups (Table 6). Visual analogue scale/verbal rating scale
scores were administered by the attending midwives and
there were a number of missing values in the data as
patients were not disturbed if they were sleeping in order
to complete the data sheet.
Operative time was significantly shorter (32.8 minutes)
in the non-closure group as compared with the closure
group (38.8 minutes) (Table 2). One patient in each group
developed wound infection which responded to antibiotics.
Two patients in the non-closure group required transfusion
because their post-operative haemoglobin dropped below
7g/dL while no patient in the closure group required
transfusion. None of the patients from either group had to
go back to theatre for any further surgery.
In summary, both groups of patients had equal availability of analgesia, but the women in the non-closure
group used significantly less morphine, had significantly
less failed patient controlled analgesia pump demands, and
significantly greater satisfaction score at 24 hours.

claims significant advantages for non-closure of the peritoneum at the caesarean section. These advantages include
a reduced operating time6 –13, fewer intra-abdominal adhesions4
, lower post-operative morbidity in the form of
reduced infection rate7 and earlier discharge from hospital7
.
Non-closure is also supported by the animal and clinical
data4,5, which demonstrate that peritoneum, being a mesothelial organ, heals differently to epithelial tissue. Mesothelial cells initiate multiple sites of repair and even large
peritoneal defects heal spontaneously, within 48 to 72
hours. The process of peritoneal repair after injury depends
upon an intact blood supply and is adversely influenced by
ischaemia. It has been suggested that approximation of the
peritoneal layers is not only unnecessary for wound healing
but may actually be harmful for the patient10.
Benefits of non-closure on post-operative pain remains
controversial. This controversy probably stems from the
fact that only one published study13 was designed specifically to look at this important outcome measure and all
the published studies failed to standardise the pre-operative,
operative and post-operative conditions6–8.
Hull et al.
6 in a study of 113 women and Nagele et al.
7
in a randomised trial of 549 women, reported less use of
post-operative analgesia when the peritoneum was not
sutured at caesarean section, but in both of these studies
pain was not the primary outcome measure. Furthermore
the anaesthetic technique was not standardised: some
patients received general anaesthesia and others either
epidural or spinal with or without neuroaxial opioids. In
both these studies importance was given to the number
of doses rather than the actual amount used and postoperatively pain was not assessed.
Similar criticism can be applied to a study by Irion et al.
8
which found no difference in the number of analgesic doses
required post-operatively in their study of 280 patients.
Again no standard anaesthetic technique was used and the
authors failed to mention the number of patients receiving
epidural opioids in each group although they do state that
‘‘epidural opioids were usually given to women with
epidural anaesthesia’’. Pain was measured only once a
day and no reference to the actual dose of the analgesics
was made. A study by Højberg et al.
13 is the only study
which evaluated post-operative pain as the primary outcome measure following closure or non-closure of the
peritoneum. In this most recent study of 40 patients no
statistically significant difference was found in postoperative pain scores between the two groups, but the
non-closure group used significantly less oral analgesia.
Our findings may be explained by the fact that peritoneum has a rich nerve supply and a poor blood supply and a
minor insult to this delicate structure may compromise its
vascular status and induces ischaemic pain. Our hypothesis
is that suturing the peritoneum causes greater postoperative pain because of the ischaemia produced in islands
of tissue by stretching of the peritoneum as a result of
approximation by sutures.
To test our hypothesis properly we attempted to standardise procedures as much as possible: all the patients had a
spinal anaesthetic in right lateral position14 without opioids
and had exactly the same analgesia administered. To reduce
the risk of any potential confounding factor arising from
pre-operative pain, only women undergoing elective surgery were selected. Most of the previous studies have
included patients undergoing both elective and emergency
caesarean section6–8. Pain was assessed at regular intervals
and not just on a single occasion. All the patients received
patient controlled analgesia pump analgesia as this is the
recognised gold standard for assessing analgesic requirement15. Without patient controlled analgesia pump there
are too many variables affecting the post-operative analgesic requirements, however the previous studies on caesarean sections have failed to utilise this important research
tool. Only one study12 has used patient controlled analgesia
pump to assess post-operative pain with respect to peritoneal repair, but that study was on abdominal hysterectomy
patients and found a non-significant reduction in morphine
use in the non-closure group.
In contrast to the study by Højberg et al.13 we found a
significant difference in the use of morphine during the first
24-hour post-operative period (closure group 0.82mg/kg
closure group vs 0.64mg/kg non-closure group). That the
closure group suffered more pain is further substantiated
by a significantly higher demand for analgesia by the
closure group, as evidenced the by number of failed
patient controlled analgesia pump demands (16.6 vs 7.0,
P < 0.01). The results of Højberg et al.13 are confounded
by an apparent large difference in oral analgesia use
between the two groups, the non-closure group received
more opioids in the first 24 hours but used less oral
analgesia making direct comparison between the two
groups very difficult.
In our study there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in the use of oral analgesia
but a trend could be seen that the non-closure group used
less oral analgesia on each of the four post-operative days.
Similar to the studies by Højberg et al.13 and Gupta et al.
12,
the overall visual analogue scales for pain were not significantly different between the two groups, although there
was a tendency to a lower score in the non-closure group.
Another interesting finding in our study is significantly
increased patient satisfaction in the non-closure group at 24
hours post-operatively. This could be a reflection of better
pain relief but it could also represent a generally better
post-operative outcome in the form of less nausea and
vomiting, less itching and drowsiness, and earlier mobility
which may be related to the decreased morphine usage.
None of the studies before ours has assessed satisfaction
when comparing closure versus non-closure of the peritoneum at caesarean section.
We found operative time to be significantly shorter in
the non-closure group as compared with the closure group.
A similar reduction of five to eight minutes was found by
CLOSURE OF THE PERITONEUM AT CAESAREAN SECTION 697
D RCOG 2002 Br J Obstet Gynaecol 109, pp. 694–698
previous studies6–9. We found no difference in the number
of days to the discharge between the two groups or any
difference in short term post-operative morbidity as claimed
by some authors7,9.
In conclusion greater patient satisfaction, less demand for
analgesia and lower requirement of morphine in the nonclosure group demonstrates that not suturing the peritoneum
at the caesarean section has beneficial effects on postoperative pain. It is possible that this is a chance finding
as pain scores were not significantly different at any single
time. However, this emphasises the adequacy of analgesia
in both groups, albeit with significantly less morphine
needed in the non-closure group. A recent review16 has
also emphasised the absence of short term morbidity when
the peritoneum is not sutured, therefore after consideration
of our new data we recommend non-closure of peritoneum
at caesarean section as the method of choice.
