Abstract
Objective: To evaluate short-term effects of closure versus non-closure of the parietal
peritoneum at caesarean section.
Methods: A randomized controlled study of women undergoing caesarean section was
conducted at the obstetrics department of a research and education hospital between October
2010 and May 2011. Patients were randomly assigned to have closure of parietal peritoneal
layer (Group I, n ¼ 55), and non-closure of parietal peritoneal layer (Control, Group II, n ¼ 55).
Intra-operative and post-operative outcomes were compared between the groups.
Results: Groups were similar for baseline characteristics. Although there was statistically
significant difference between Group 1 and Group 2 in terms of time to oral intake and
mobilization time [12 (8–12) versus 8 (8–10) h; p50.001; 12 (8–12) versus 8 (8–10) h; p50.001];
the other variables, such as drop in hemoglobin concentration, estimate of blood loss, intraoperative additional sutures, operating time and time to passage of flatus [1.13  0.86 versus
1.41  0.82 g/dL; 487.9  217.01 versus 544.87  237.64 mL; 0 (0–1) versus 0 (0–1); 30.8  7.63
versus 31.6  10.38 h; 18.2  6.04 versus 18.2  4.23 h, p40.05] were not statistically different
between Group 1 and Group 2.
Conclusions: Closure of the parietal peritoneum has no benefit over non-closure of parietal
peritoneum and non-closure is associated with rapid post-operative recovery.

Introduction
Caesarean section had become the most-preferred surgical
procedure in obstetrics by the end of the twentieth century in
order to lead to less maternal and fetal mortality. It has been
administered by many different operative techniques depending on several factors such as the preference of surgeon or the
patient’s condition. In fact, choice of the technique should be
based on an evidence. Therefore, various studies on surgical
techniques for caesarean section have been investigated to
improve safety and morbidity [1–3]. Since described by Kerr
in 1926, the closure of peritoneal layers has persisted by many
authors in various publications so as to re-establish anatomy
and to prevent from the risk of infection, hernia, wound
dehiscence, the formation of adhesions and to decrease
hemorrhage [4–6]. On the other hand, several studies have
demonstrated potential advantages of non-closure of the
peritoneum, such as shorter surgical time and hospital stay,
reduced post-operative infection rates, adhesion formation
and intestinal obstruction, febrile morbidity and return of
bowel functions [7–15]. In the light of above-mentioned data,
the primary aim of the present study was to assess the shortterm effects of parietal peritoneal closure versus non-closure
at caesarean delivery on intra-operative and post-operative
outcomes.
Methods
The study was designed as a prospective, randomized study
conducted at the Obstetric Department of a research and
education hospital between October 2010 and May 2011, to
evaluate the short-term effects of both closure with nonclosure of parietal peritoneum at caesarean section. A total of
110 women who underwent caesarean delivery for various
reasons including repeated caesarean delivery were enrolled
in the study. All patients were similar in groups with respect
to age and indications. Exclusion criteria were of the
following: (1) a history of severe medical conditions such as
diabetes mellitus or moderate-severe hypertension, (2) anticoagulation therapy, (3) a history of other major abdominal
surgery, (4) multiple gestations and (5) a history of any
thrombophilic disorders.
The institutional local ethics committee and Institutional
Education and Planning Committee approval was obtained
and each patient gave a signed informed consent for their
participation in the study. The patients were randomly
assigned to have closure of the parietal peritoneal layer

(Study Group 1, n ¼ 55) and non-closure of parietal peritoneal
layer (Control, Group 2, n ¼ 55). All patients were randomly
allocated to one of the two groups with the use of sealed
numbered envelopes containing the randomization number.
The surgeons opened the envelopes before start of the
operation and learnt which type they should have done. The
same expert team operated both groups of patients to provide
homogenous conditions.
All operations were performed under spinal anaesthesia
with a standard spinal anaesthetic using a 25G pencil point
needle with 15–20 mg of bupivacaine injected in a vertical
sitting position with the aim to achieve a sensory block under
level of T4. During the closure of the rectus sheath, 75 mg
diclofenac intramuscularly and 100 mg tramadol intravenously were applied. All patients received paracetamol 500 mg
at every 6 h of the first and second day as the standard postoperative analgesic drug and pain was evaluated by faces pain
rating scale (FPRS) on the 24th hours after the operation.
Patients chose a facial expression that best corresponded with
their pain (0 does not hurt, 2 hurts just a little bit, 4 hurts a
little more, 6 hurts even more, 8 hurts a whole lot, 10 hurts as
much as you can imagine).
All women had a low uterine segment caesarean delivery
as follows; the classical Pfannenstiel technique was carried
out for the skin incision and subcutaneous tissues were
opened. The fascia was incised transversely in the midline and
opened laterally with sharp dissection through scissors. Blunt
dissection was used to separate rectus muscles vertically and
laterally and open the peritoneum. The bladder was pushed
down inferiorly using index fingers and valves after the
visceral peritoneum was incised in both groups. A 2 cm
transverse incision was made at the superior part of the low
uterine segment and gently stretched enough to deliver the
baby. After the baby was delivered and the placenta was
removed spontaneously, the uterus was exteriorized and the
myometrium was closed with a single-layer locking continuous absorbable suture (polyglactin 910; Vicryl 1.0; Ethicon,
Somerville, NJ). Parietal peritoneal layer was closed using
continuous polyglactin 910 (Vicryl 00; Ethicon) in Group 1
and remained unsutured in Group 2. The abdominal wall
closure was done by suturing the fascia, without suturing the
muscles. The subcutaneous fat was not closed unless the
thickness of the tissue was more than 3 cm. Subcutaneous
continuous suture technique was assessed in order to close the
skin. All patients received 10 IU oxytocin and intraoperative
prophylactic intravenous antibiotics (Cefazolin 1 g) immediately after delivery of the baby and cord clamping. The groups
were compared in terms of blood loss assessed by changing
the hemoglobin concentration and estimate of blood loss
associated with the weight of compresses. The duration of the
operation, time to mobilization, time to passage of flatus, time
to oral intake (beginning at mobilization time in case without
nausea and vomiting) and post-operative pain with FRS were
also recorded and compared.
All patients were routinely discharged on the third postdelivery day as a routine policy of the hospital and
re-applications for any complaints were also recorded.
All data collected were analyzed with Statistical Package
for Social Sciences (SPSS, version 17; Chicago, IL). Sample
size and power analyses were calculated. This calculation
gave a minimum sample size of 50 in each group (alpha of 0.5
and a beta of 0.80). For statistical analyses of the data,
variables were tested with Kolmogorov–Smirnov test with
Lilliefor’s significance correction for normal distribution.
Normally distributed data were expressed as means  standard deviation and data that was non-normally distributed were
expressed as the median (interquartile range: IQR 25–75) for
descriptive statistics. To compare the groups; independent
sample t-test was used for normally distributed data while
Mann–Whitney U-test was utilized for non-normally distributed data. Statistical significance was defined as p50.05.
Results
A total of 124 women eligible to participate in the study, 110
were enrolled and 55 women were allocated to Group 1 and
55 women to Group 2. The women in the groups were similar
for demographic characteristics (Table 1).
Intra-operative assessment and post-operative follow-up
variables, such as drop in hemoglobin concentration, estimate
of blood loss, intra-operative additional sutures, operating
time and time to passage of flatus [(1.13  0.86 versus
1.41  0.82 h; 487 mL versus 544 mL; 0 (0–1) versus 0
(0–1); 30.8  7.63 versus 31.6  10.38 h; 18.2  6.04 versus
18.2  4.23 h, p40.05] were not statistically different between
Group 1 and Group 2 (Table 2). A statistically significant
difference between Group 1 and Group 2 in terms of time to
oral intake and mobilization time [(12 (8–12) versus 8
(8–10) h; p50.001; 12 (8–12) versus 8 (8–10) h; p50.001]
was found (Table 2).
Closure of the parietal peritoneum was not associated with
higher post-operative pain assessed with FPRS [2 (2–6)
versus 2 (2–4)]. No major intra-operative or post-operative
complications were seen in the groups. Most patients were
discharged on the third day of hospitalization except for 3
(5.5%) in Group 1 due to post-operative fever and for 4 (7.3%)
in Group 2 and were discharged on the fifth day of the
hospitalization. Wound infection was detected in two patients
in each group (p40.05) when they came for suture control
and the infection was controlled with antibiotic usage.
Discussion
Peritoneal closure is controversial among surgeons and
previous studies have pointed out conflicting results about
closure or non-closure of the peritoneum. Based on this

controversy, we aimed to evaluate whether closure or nonclosure of the parietal peritoneum has any effects on intraoperative and post-operative outcomes. While the short-term
effects, such as the change in hemoglobin concentration, any
beneficial effects on post-operative pain and time to passage
of the flatus were not found significantly different between
the groups, time to oral intake and mobilization time were
both determined significantly higher in the parietal peritoneal
closure group in this study. In fact, some limitations of the
present study need to be pointed currently; (1) indicating
short term effects, not the long term, (2) relatively small
sample size, (3) operations performed by the same team but
not by the same surgeon.
The Royal College of Obstetricians suggested non-closure
of the peritoneum as it was found to be associated with fewer
post-surgical complications [16]. According to Anteby et al.,
there is no significant difference between closure versus nonclosure of the peritoneum in short-term outcome, the authors
concluded that number of women with post-operative fever,
number of women with wound infection, duration of hospitalization, analgesic dosage did not differ between the groups
[17]. In the Cochrane review, the short-term results were
noted to improve if the peritoneum was not closed. Operating
time was reduced by a mean of 6.05 min in non-closure group.
Although post-operative endometritis and wound infection
rates did not differ, post-operative fever was reduced. The
same study did not mention long-term results as the data was
limited [18]. Another study that compared long-term morbidity of non-closure and closure of the peritoneum at
caesarean section revealed similar results in both groups [19].
In our study, shorter time to oral intake and shorter
mobilization time in the non-closure group were prominently
determined. It might be a result of better post-operative
period due to less vomiting, nausea and outcomes related to
less damage to the peritoneum.
Although both the Cochrane meta-analysis and the Royal
College of Obstetricians’ recommendations concur not to
close the peritoneum, traditional surgical training insists on
closure of both parietal and visceral peritoneum [1,20]. In the
recent studies, it has been detected that the repair process is
improved due to lower inflammatory reaction, the absence of
stitches (a solid substrate, such as a foreign body) and less
tissue necrosis [21]. Peritoneal healing is known to occur
spontaneously by migrating mesothelial cells with mesothelial
matrix formation at multiple sites of repair within 48–72 h
[10]. It is certainly known that when any injury occurs,
healing depends on an intact blood supply and ischemia plays
a major-negative role in this process. In one experimental
study, it was reported that adhesions were more frequently
detected after visceral peritoneal closure than after parietal
peritoneal closure [22]. As a result of inflammatory reactions,
based on submesothelial fibrosis, closure of the visceral
peritoneal layer seems to be associated with more adhesion
development, neoangiogenesis of mesothelial stroma and
mesothelial hyperplasia [23]. The same mechanism might
also be speculated for parietal peritoneum. These data may
explain the causal connection of procedures on short-term and
long-term outcomes.
On the other hand, in the current study, all patients
received the same intra-operative and post-operative analgesic
regimens and the patient satisfaction regarding pain relief in
two different techniques was aimed to measure. Pain was
evaluated on the 24th hour after the operation, VAS score
showed no statistically significant difference between the
groups as several investigators reported so [12,24]. Contrary
to this knowledge, peritoneal closure during caesarean
delivery was reported to contribute to a higher incidence of
early and persistent post-operative pain [25]. The patient
satisfaction is a subjective data sometime but if analgesia
requirement is noted, it then reflects objective data and
results. One limitation that should have been emphasized was
no analgesia pumps or additional analgesic dosages were
utilized in the current study. As a proof of this idea, in a study
by Rafique et al., while pain scores were similar between the
groups, post-operative use of patient-controlled analgesia
pump doses were also noted and highlighted as significantly
lower in the non-closure group [26].
In conclusion, to our knowledge the closure of the
peritoneum has no benefit over the closure process. Nonclosure of the peritoneum may be cost effective and
associated with rapid post-operative recovery.
