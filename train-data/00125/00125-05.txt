The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of olanzapine and risperidone for the acute treatment of
first-episode schizophrenia patients with cannabis use disorders. This secondary analysis of a previously
published study included 49 first-episode patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizophreniform
disorder, or schizoaffective disorder and a co-occurring lifetime diagnosis of cannabis use disorders randomly
assigned to treatment with either olanzapine (n= 28) or risperidone (n= 21) for 16 weeks. The olanzapine
group did not differ significantly from the risperidone group for initial response rates of positive symptoms,
and rates of cannabis use or alcohol use during the study. Positive symptoms and the Scale for Assessment of
Negative Symptoms (SANS) global asociality-anhedonia scores improved over time but did not differ between
study medications. In both groups, cannabis use during the study was higher in patients who used cannabis
within three months of the admission. Thus, our results suggest that olanzapine and risperidone had a similar
initial efficacy on psychotic symptoms and substance use in first-episode patients with co-occurring cannabis
use disorders. If clinicians are choosing between olanzapine versus risperidone treatment for this population,
their decision should be based upon factors other than symptom response and short-term substance misuse.

1. Introduction
Cannabis is the most common illicit drug used among individuals
presenting with a first episode of schizophrenia, with lifetime
prevalence ranging from 13% to 64% (Linszen et al., 1994; Hambrecht
and Hafner, 1996; Kovasznay et al., 1997; Cantwell et al., 1999; Sevy et
al., 2001; Buhler et al., 2002; Barnes et al., 2006; Wade et al., 2006;
Barnett et al., 2007). Despite the prevalence of cannabis use disorders
(abuse or dependence) among patients presenting for treatment of a
first episode of schizophrenia, there are little data to guide clinicians
about the choice of the initial antipsychotic for treating an acute
episode in these patients. To the best of our knowledge, previous
studies have focused on substance use outcomes in non-acute
patients. The only study (van Nimwegen et al., 2008) in the literature
examining second generation antipsychotic treatment with patients
with recent-onset schizophrenia and cannabis use is a randomized,
double-blind comparison of subjects treated with either olanzapine
(n= 63) or risperidone (n= 65). No differences between subjects
treated with olanzapine or risperidone on measures of subjective
well-being and craving for cannabis were found. However, the study
did not address several important issues for guiding clinicians about
initial medication choice for patients with first-episode schizophrenia
and cannabis use disorders: the study did not report clinical
outcomes, it only addressed very short-term outcomes (6 weeks); it
did not exclude subjects with substance-induced psychosis, and it did
not specify whether subjects had previous psychotic episodes and
antipsychotic treatment. Data from comparative trials with patients
with multi-episode schizophrenia and cannabis use disorders are also
limited. Green et al. (2003) reported that 31 patients with
schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder on clozapine were more
likely to be sober for alcohol and marijuana than eight patients on
risperidone after one year of treatment. Potvin et al. (2004) reported a
decrease in cannabis use after 6 months of treatment with quetiapine
in eight psychotic patients dependent on cannabis, but did not report
other clinical outcomes. Akerele and Levin (2007) conducted a
randomized, double-blind study comparing schizophrenia patients
with cocaine and/or cannabis use disorders treated with either
olanzapine (n= 14) or risperidone (n= 14) for 10 weeks. They
found a reduction in marijuana-positive urine drug screens for both

groups and a greater decrease in marijuana craving with olanzapine
compared to risperidone. They also report improved positive and
depressive symptoms over the course of the study, but no differences
between groups. The degree to which these limited data with multiepisode patients generalize to treatment with first-episode patients is
unknown.
Although the prevalence of schizophrenia is high, the incidence is
low. This makes recruitment of an adequate number of subjects for
comparative trials with first-episode patients challenging. Adding the
inclusion criteria of subjects with cannabis use disorders increases
recruitment difficulties. A dedicated definitive study with these
challenges would require large amounts of resources. In the absence
of such a trial, we report the results of a secondary analysis of data
from a previously published prospective study comparing olanzapine
and risperidone treatment for subjects with first-episode schizophrenia (Robinson et al., 2006). Although not designed to study subjects
specifically with cannabis use disorders, the study sample included 49
subjects with first-episode schizophrenia-spectrum disorders and a
history of cannabis use disorders that are the focus of this report. We
were particularly interested in examining the outcomes of these
subjects as previous studies suggest that the most promising atypical
antipsychotic for decreasing psychotic symptoms and substance use is
clozapine (McEvoy et al., 1995, 1999; Drake et al., 2000; Brunette et
al., 2006). Because olanzapine is closely related in chemical structure
to clozapine and shares many common receptor binding characteristics (binding affinities for D2, HT2a, HT2c, alpha2, M1 receptors)
(Bymaster et al., 1996), we hypothesized that olanzapine might be
better than risperidone as an antipsychotic treatment among the 49
subjects with first-episode schizophrenia and co-occurring cannabis
use disorders.
2. Methods
2.1. Overview
The present study is a secondary analysis of data from the acute treatment phase of
a prospective, randomized trial comparing risperidone and olanzapine for the
treatment of first-episode subjects with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizophreniform
disorder, or schizoaffective disorder. Details of the original study have previously been
described (Robinson et al., 2006). The original study consisted of an acute treatment
phase (lasting four months) followed by a longitudinal follow-up phase of 32 months. A
previous assessment indicated that first-episode subjects would be reluctant to take
blinded medication for a total of 3 years, so the study was designed as an open-label
treatment with masked assessment of psychopathology. The present study focused on
the first 16 weeks because it was an adequate timeframe to determine an acute
treatment response in a first-episode sample, and it was long enough to assess the
efficacy of the study medications.
The study was conducted under the guidelines of the Institutional Review Boards
(IRBs) of the North Shore - Long Island Jewish Health System (New York) and the
Bronx-Lebanon Hospital (Bronx, NY). It was carried out in accordance with the Code of
Ethics of the World Medical Association (Declaration of Helsinki) for experiments
involving humans.
2.2. Subjects
All new patients referred to psychiatric acute care at the Zucker Hillside Hospital
and Bronx-Lebanon Hospital were screened for this study. Adult subjects provided
written informed consent. For subjects less than 18 years old, written parental consent
and written subject assent were obtained. Eligible subjects were between the age of 16
and 40, had a current diagnosis of DSM-IV schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, or
schizoaffective disorder with less than 12 weeks of lifetime cumulative antipsychotic
medication treatment, and demonstrated either current positive or negative symptoms
as evidenced by a rating of four or more on the Schedule for Affective Disorders and
Schizophrenia—Change Version with psychosis and disorganization items (SADS-C+
PD) or on the affective flattening, alogia, avolition, or anhedonia global items of the
Hillside Clinical Trials version (Robinson et al., 2000) of the Scale for Assessment of
Negative Symptoms (SANS) (Andreasen, 1989). All subjects for this secondary analysis
also met DSM-IV criteria for a lifetime history of cannabis abuse or dependence.
Although these subjects met criteria for cannabis use disorders, they also met criteria
for schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, or schizoaffective disorder. Thus,
subjects whose psychotic symptoms occurred solely in the context of a substanceinduced psychotic disorder were not included in the parent study or this secondary
analysis.
2.3. Treatment protocol
In the original study subjects were stratified by sex, current (within the last month)
DSM-IV-defined substance abuse or dependence (excluding nicotine and caffeine), and
site. They were randomly assigned to the treatment conditions according to a computer
pre-generated block randomization list provided by the Department of Biostatistics and
only accessible to the biostatisticians and dedicated research coordinators. For the
current analysis, all subjects from the original study with lifetime DSM-IV diagnoses of
cannabis abuse or dependence were included.
The treatment goal of the original study was to find the lowest effective dose to
treat the initial acute psychotic episode. The initial daily dose was 2.5 mg for olanzapine
and 1 mg for risperidone. A slowly increasing titration schedule was used: after week 1,
dose increases occurred at intervals of 1–3 weeks until the subject improved or reached
a maximum daily dose of 20 mg of olanzapine or 6 mg of risperidone. Lorazepam was
given for agitation requiring pharmacological treatment. Subjects with persistent mood
symptoms unresponsive to antipsychotic treatment were prescribed sertraline for
depression or divalproex sodium for manic symptoms. Motor side effects were treated
with antipsychotic dose reduction or, if this was ineffective, benztropine for
extrapyramidal symptoms and lorazepam or propranolol for akathisia. Because of
concern about maintaining psychotic subjects for 16 weeks on an ineffective treatment,
subjects who did not achieve Clinical Global Impression (CGI) ratings of at least
minimal improvement of psychotic symptoms by 10 weeks were terminated from
controlled treatment. At each site, subjects were seen by a social worker who was
assigned to the project. All subjects received psychoeducation about schizophrenia, its
treatment and the importance of abstinence from cannabis and other substances of
abuse. Subjects were seen on a regular basis by the social workers during their entire
study participation. Subjects also had access to the ancillary treatment services
available from two large departments of psychiatry.
2.4. Measures
Diagnosis and psychopathology assessments were performed by masked (“blind”)
assessors. To increase uniformity of assessments, a central rating team performed the
masked assessments at both sites. The same raters performed assessments with
individual subjects throughout that subject's study participation. Subject diagnoses
were evaluated at study entry using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I
Disorders (SCID-I/P) (First et al., 1998). Assessments for psychopathology were done
weekly for the first 4 weeks, then bi-weekly. Psychopathology was assessed with the
SADS-C+ PD, CGI, and Hillside Clinical Trials version of the SANS. Since changes in body
weight have been well described for atypical antipsychotics (Lieberman et al., 2003;
Schooler et al., 2005), we also measured body weight and body mass index (BMI—
weight in kilograms/height in meters2
) throughout the study.
2.5. Substance use
Lifetime and current (the last 3 months) substance use was assessed at study entry
using the alcohol and substance abuse/dependence sections of the SCID interview.
Sources of information about substance use during the study included collateral
information from health care providers, case managers, family members, friends, and
housemates when available. Subjects were diagnosed conservatively with cannabis
abuse when the differentiation between cannabis abuse and dependence was unclear.
Psychometricians questioned subjects about substance use at each rating session. At
The Zucker Hillside Hospital site, a Substance Use Questionnaire (available on request)
was administered by a research nurse. Of note, the study design allowed subjects to
admit cannabis use without jeopardizing continued study participation. Urine drug
screens were done when the subject appeared intoxicated or when there was a strong
suspicion of substance use which the subject denied. These information sources were
used to make the best estimate of substance use since the last study visit. For some
subjects, the extent of substance use only became known after study entry. Thus,
substance use classifications for the present study are the best assessments of
substance use using all data sources at baseline and during follow-up.
2.6. Statistical analysis
We used two-sample t-tests to compare the treatment groups at baseline for
continuous variables and Chi-square or Fisher's exact tests for categorical variables.
The parent study defined a priori a positive symptom treatment response as 1) a
rating of mild or better on all the SADS-C+ PD items severity of delusions, severity of
hallucinations, impaired understandability, derailment, illogical thinking, and bizarre
behavior; and 2) a concurrent rating of very much improved or much improved on the
CGI. The response criteria required that substantial improvement be maintained for
two consecutive visits. Cumulative rates of response were computed and compared
using standard survival analysis methods, (i.e., Kaplan–Meier product-limit method
and the log-rank test). Time to treatment response was coded as the first of the two
visits meeting substantial improvement criteria. The relationships between the positive
and the negative symptom responses over time and the effect of treatment group were
explored with multivariate repeated measures analysis of covariance (RMANCOVA)
with site entered as a covariate. We first entered the time by group interaction term
into the analyses but since it was never significant, we report the results without the
interactions.
S. Sevy et al. / Psychiatry Research 188 (2011) 310–314 311
Analysis of data from the original study revealed that olanzapine compared with
risperidone treatment was associated with more weight gain (Robinson et al., 2006).
Hence, we wished to examine weight changes with treatment among the subjects in
the current subsample. Changes in BMI were examined using repeated measures
ANCOVA models with divalproex sodium treatment utilized as a covariate. Divalproex
was included in the model given its effects on weight gain that were revealed in
analyses of the parent study sample.
To examine cannabis and alcohol use during the study, we compared usage in the
olanzapine and risperidone groups during the last 8 weeks of the study, necessitating
the use of only treatment completers since dropouts did not have these data. This time
point was chosen because the vast majority of subjects were hospitalized for clinical
reasons at study entry and thus had no access to cannabis. We wished to examine
substance use during periods when subjects would have potential access to cannabis
and alcohol. We also compared substance use between subjects who met for current
(i.e., within 3 months of admission) cannabis abuse/dependence at the start of the
study and those who had stopped cannabis misuse earlier than three months before
randomization.
3. Results
3.1. Subject sample
Data for this report were collected from November 1998 to
November 2004. Subject flow for the parent study is described
elsewhere (Robinson et al., 2006). Briefly, 474 subjects were assessed
for eligibility. Of these, 282 did not meet inclusion criteria, 64 declined
study participation and 8 did not enter for miscellaneous reasons. One
hundred twenty subjects were randomly assigned to either olanzapine or risperidone, but eight of these subjects were not included in
the final parent study sample because 1) they refused all study
medication or assessments after randomization; or 2) it was detected
after randomization that a subject met a study exclusion criteria.
Forty-nine subjects (28 subjects randomized to olanzapine and 21
subjects randomized to risperidone) met DSM-IV criteria for cannabis
use disorders either prior to or at the time of study entry and compose
the sample for the current analyses. Among them, 19 subjects also met
lifetime criteria for alcohol use disorders (abuse n= 12, dependence
n= 7) and seven subjects had other lifetime substance use disorders
(cocaine n= 5, hallucinogens n= 2, opiates n= 1, inhalants n= 1).
At baseline, 17 (65%) subjects in the olanzapine group for the
current analysis and 12 (75%) subjects in the risperidone had been
using cannabis within three months of the admission. The other
subjects stopped using cannabis more than 3 months before
admission. There were no significant differences between current
and past users for demographic or clinical variables at the start of the
study, and no differences between current and past users for rates of
alcohol abuse or dependence.
Baseline demographic characteristics of the olanzapine and
risperidone groups are presented in Table 1. Both groups were mostly
male, had the onset of cannabis use disorders around age 17, and the
onset of positive symptoms about two years later. Subjects assigned to
olanzapine and risperidone did not differ on any socio-demographic
measure or on any measure of baseline symptoms (Table 2).
3.2. Treatment received
Rates of completion of the 16 weeks of acute treatment for subjects
assigned to olanzapine and risperidone did not differ (75% for
olanzapine and 76% for risperidone treated subjects, χ2= 0.02,
P=0.90). Subjects who did not complete 16 weeks either dropped
out from the study or were removed from controlled treatment earlier
than 16 weeks because they were too ill to continue for 16 weeks on
their randomized medication. The mean modal daily dose was 15 mg±
6 (S.D.) for olanzapine and 4 mg±2 (S.D.) for risperidone.
3.3. Treatment response
Results of the survival analyses indicated that response rates did
not differ between treatment groups. The median survival time until
achieving treatment response for the risperidone group was
14 weeks; the olanzapine group had not reached the median at the
end of the 16 weeks. The number of responders at 16 weeks were 13
(45%, 95% CI 25–65%) for the olanzapine group and 11 (54%, 95% CI
29–79%) for the risperidone group, which were not significantly
different (χ2= 0.17, P= 0.68).
Results of the MANCOVAs for positive and negative symptoms are
reported in Table 2. There were no significant differences between the
treatment groups for either the positive symptoms total or subscale
scores, or for negative symptoms. Both treatment groups improved
over time for scores on the positive symptoms total and subscale
scores. Among the negative symptoms, only Asociality–Anhedonia
improved over time.
3.4. Substance use
Among subjects who completed 16 weeks of treatment, data on
cannabis use were available for 21 subjects on olanzapine and 16
subjects on risperidone. Ten subjects (48%) on olanzapine and 6
subjects (38%) on risperidone used cannabis during weeks 8 to 16 of
the study. This was not statistically significant (χ2= 0.38, P= 0.54).
The rates of alcohol use during weeks 8 to 16 of the study were also
similar (11 (52%) in the olanzapine group and 6 (38%) in the
risperidone group; χ2= 0.81, P= 0.37). The majority (17 in the
olanzapine group and 13 in the risperidone group) was concordant for
alcohol and cannabis during the study. Among subjects who used
cannabis within 3 months of entering the study and completed the
study (11 in the olanzapine group and 9 in the risperidone group),
seven (64%) in the olanzapine group and five (56%) in the risperidone
group used cannabis during weeks 8 to 16. Among subjects who did
not use within 3 months of admission, three (30%) in the olanzapine
group and one (14%) in the risperidone group used during weeks 8 to
16. Combining the two medication groups, the Fisher's Exact
comparing current use at study entry and use during the study was
significant (χ2= 3.46, P= 0.049).
3.5. Weight gain
Baseline mean weight in the olanzapine and risperidone groups
(155 lbs.±29 (S.D.) and 140 lbs.±24, respectively) and BMI (23±4 and
22±4) were significantly increased at week 16 (weight: 180 lbs.±34 in
the olanzapine group vs. 151 lbs±41 in the risperidone group and BMI:
26±4 in the olanzapine group vs. 25±5 in the risperidone group). There
was a time main effect for weight and BMI (F=8.11; Pb0.001), but no

4. Discussion
Contrary to our original hypothesis, we did not find any indications
that olanzapine is superior to risperidone for the treatment of patients
with first-episode schizophrenia and co-occurring cannabis use
disorders. Both medications improved positive symptoms and some
negative symptoms (asociality–anhedonia). The improvement of
symptoms in the group with cannabis use disorders is similar to the
improvement of symptoms observed in the parent study that included
both subjects with and without substance use disorders (Robinson
et al., 2006).
We did not find statistically significant differences between
treatment groups for the proportion of subjects using alcohol or
cannabis during the study. However, the use of cannabis during the
study was substantial in both treatment groups and was higher in
subjects who used cannabis within 3 months of admission compared
with subjects who had stopped cannabis use earlier than 3 months
before study entry. Future studies will need to identify other risk
factors associated with increased substance use during treatment and
develop interventions targeting them.
The main limitation of this study is the small sample size and the
subsequent lack of statistical power. Because of the paucity of studies
comparing atypical antipsychotics in first-episode patients with
cannabis use disorders, we believe that it is important to report these
results even if the statistical power is low. This secondary analysis of a
prospective trial was a unique opportunity to compare the effectiveness
of two widely used antipsychotics with this patient group and to provide
information for future studies in this field. Other limitations include the
lack of accurate measures of the amount and frequency of substance use.
The parent study was not a substance abuse trial and it would require a
dedicated substance use study to quantify substance use adequately.
Likewise, we did not assess craving.
In conclusion, olanzapine and risperidone have a similar initial
efficacy on psychotic symptoms and substance use outcomes in firstepisode patients with a lifetime diagnosis of cannabis use disorders.
Our results suggest that if clinicians are choosing between olanzapine
versus risperidone treatment for this population the decision should
be based upon factors other than symptom response and short-term
substance misuse, for which the medications have equal efficacy.
