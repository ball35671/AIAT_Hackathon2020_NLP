Objective: To examine whether subjective well-being and craving for cannabis were
different in patients with schizophrenia or related disorders treated with either olanzapine
or risperidone.
Method: A 6-week, double-blind, randomized trial of olanzapine and risperidone was
carried out in 128 young adults with recent onset schizophrenia or related disorders.
Primary efficacy measures were the mean baseline-to-endpoint change in total scores on the
Subjective Well-Being under Neuroleptics scale, the Obsessive–Compulsive Drug Use
Scale, the Drug Desire Questionnaire, and the cannabis use self-report. An analysis of
covariance was used to test between-group differences.
Results: Estimated D2 receptor occupancy did not differ between olanzapine (n = 63) and
risperidone (n = 65). Similar improvements in subjective well-being were found in both
groups. In the comorbid cannabis-using group (n = 41, 32%), a similar decrease in craving
for cannabis was found in both treatment conditions.
Conclusions: Both olanzapine and risperidone were associated with improved subjective
well-being. No evidence was found for a differential effect of olanzapine or risperidone on
subjective experience or on craving for cannabis in dosages leading to comparable
dopamine D2 occupancy.
Clinical Trial Registration Number: ISRCTN46365995
Can J Psychiatry 2008;53(6):400–405
Clinical Implications
 Both olanzapine and risperidone are associated with improvements in subjective well-being in
adolescent patients with first psychosis.
 There is no preference for olanzapine or risperidone regarding improvement of subjective
well-being.
 There is no preference for olanzapine or risperidone regarding craving for cannabis.
Limitations
 Other antipsychotics might show similar results when prescribed in dosages with comparable
dopamine D2 receptor occupancy.
 The sample size of patients that used cannabis was small.
 Olanzapine and risperidone might have had a differential impact on craving for other
substances of abuse.
Key Words: schizophrenia, olanzapine, risperidone,
subjective well-being, cannabis
An estimated 50% of psychotic patients are noncompliant
with antipsychotic medication, and nonadherence is
strongly associated with psychotic relapse.1 Initial dysphoric
responses to antipsychotic medication2–4 and cannabis use5–7
are powerful predictors of nonadherence.
As subjective experiences are correlated with occupancy of
dopamine D2 receptors by the antipsychotic compound,8–10
and as olanzapine dissociates faster from the dopamine D2
receptor than risperidone, olanzapine is hypothesized to
induce less negative subjective experiences.10 Using the
SWN, patients receiving olanzapine treatment reported
higher levels of subjective well-being than patients treated
with either clozapine or risperidone.11
The use of cannabis (12% to 50%) is associated with low treatment adherence in schizophrenia,12–15 leading to more positive symptoms and psychotic episodes, and higher
rehospitalization rates,16–18 but also with a reduction of negative symptoms, anxiety, and depression.19–20 Typical
antipsychotic medications are thought to be associated with
the induction of negative subjective experiences, and craving
by antagonizing striatal dopaminergic D2 receptors,21–23
whereas atypical antipsychotics are suggested to reduce
smoking and substance use.24,25
The results concerning olanzapine and risperidone are inconsistent and reductions,26,27 increases,28–30 and no change in
craving31 have been reported.
We hypothesized that olanzapine (because of faster dissociation) would have a more favourable effect on subjective
well-being and craving for cannabis than risperidone. This
hypothesis can only be tested when dosages of antipsychotic
medication that lead to similar dopamine D2 receptor occupancy are compared.
This first double-blind RCT in young adults with recent onset
schizophrenia and related disorders was designed to examine
whether olanzapine and risperidone have a differential effect
on: subjective experiences, craving for cannabis, and continued use of cannabis.
Method
Subjects
Male and female in- and outpatients aged 18 to 30 years were
eligible for this 6-week, multicentre, double-blind RCT.
They had to meet DSM-IV-R criteria for schizophrenia,
schizoaffective disorder, or schizophreniform disorder based
on the Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition,
patient version. Exclusion criteria were: the concomitant use
of any other antipsychotic drug (not olanzapine or
risperidone), depot antipsychotic medications in the 3
months prior to inclusion, and current use of other
psychotropic medications other than oxazepam or biperiden.
The study was approved by each centre’s ethics committee
and written informed consent was obtained.
Patients were recruited from 4 mental health centres in the
Netherlands (Academic Medical Centre in Amsterdam; Erasmus Medical Centre in Rotterdam; Parnassia Psychomedical
Centre in the Hague; and Mediant in Enschede). Assessments
took place at baseline just before randomization, after one
week of treatment, and at the end of the 6 weeks treatment, or
when the patient discontinued randomized therapy
(last-observation-carried-forward approach).
Patients received flexible dosing of either olanzapine (5, 10,
15, or 20 mg/day) or risperidone (1.25, 2.5, 3.75, or
5 mg/day) in identical-looking capsules. The dosage ratio of
1:4 is estimated according to our goal to reach comparable
dopamine D2 receptor occupancy.10 In the first week, treating
physicians could adjust the daily dosage, to a fixed dosage for
the following 5 weeks. All patients (similar in both groups)
were treated with disease and stress management programs,
including psychoeducation about psychoses, substance
abuse, and social skills training.
Assessments
All patients were assessed with the SWN, short version, a
20-item, 6-point, Likert-type self-rating scale measuring the
subjective experience in the past 7 days, with robust
psychometric qualities.11,32,33 All patients rated the cannabis
use self-report—measuring cannabis use in the past month.
Self-reported data were affirmed by recent drug use urine
analysis. From the patients with self-reported cannabis use at
baseline, 2 craving questionnaires were obtained. The
OCDUS, a self-rating scale consisting of 11 items with a
5-point, Likert-type rating measuring drug craving in the past
7 days, and the DDQ,34 a self-rating scale measuring instantaneous craving.
Baseline characteristics were compared between treatments
with a chi-square test, or an independent t test. An ITT analysis of covariance was used to test between-group differences
outcome variables, including treatment, site, and baseline

Results
Among the 201 eligible patients, 128 (64%) received at least
one dose of olanzapine (n = 63) or risperidone (n = 65), had at
least one follow-up assessment, and were included in the ITT
analysis (Figure 1), with no significant differences in patients
that refused participation, compared with those who were
randomized.
Thirty-one patients (22 %) discontinued treatment because of
adverse events (n = 9), lack of efficacy (n = 8), patient decisions (n = 10), or a combination of factors (n = 4), and 3
patients (2%) were lost to follow-up. There were no significant differences between the 2 treatment groups about age (25
years), sex (80% male), or diagnosis. Among the 128 randomized patients, 41 (32%) were using cannabis at baseline: 20
(49%) in the olanzapine and 21 (51%) in the risperidone group
(P = 0.95). There were no significant differences in baseline
characteristics between the patients using cannabis in the 2
treatment conditions, except for the olanzapine group using
cannabis and having a significantly lower OCDUS score
(mean 19.3, SD 6.5) than the cannabis-using risperidone
group (mean 26.7, SD 10.3), P = 0.01.
Patients received a mean dosage of 9.8 mg olanzapine and
2.5 mg risperidone at 2 weeks, and 11.1 mg olanzapine and
3.0 mg risperidone at 6 weeks. There was no significant difference in estimated D2 receptor occupancy between the 2
groups.
After adjusting for SWN scores at baseline, there was no significant treatment by centre interaction effect (F3,119 = 1.5, P =
0.22), and also none of the main effects were statistically significant (centre: F3,119 = 1.35, P = 0.26; treatment: F1,119 =
0.037, P = 0.85). These results suggest there was no difference
between centres and treatment conditions. The largest
increase in SWN took place within the first week of the trial
(Table 1).
Within the group of patients using cannabis , after adjusting
for baseline scores, there were no significant group by centre
interaction effects on the OCDUS (F2,33 = 0.28, P = 0.76) and
the DDQ (F2,32 = 1.67, P = 0.21), and none of the main effects
were statistically significant for the OCDUS (centre: F3,33 =
1.50, P = 0.23; treatment: F1, 33 = 0.76, P = 0.39) and the DDQ
(centre: F3,32 = 1.50, P = 0.23; treatment: F1,32 = 0.93, P =
0.34). These results suggest there was no difference in effect
on craving between centres or between treatments. Within the
group of cannabis users, the reduction in the mean number of
joints per week was not significantly different for olanzapine
(mean 4.7, SD 9.8), compared with the risperidone group
(mean 4.3, SD 6.5), P = 0.16.
Discussion
In this first randomized, double-blind comparison of
olanzapine and risperidone with subjective well-being and
craving for cannabis as primary outcome measures, there
were no significant differences in SWN or in reduction of
craving for cannabis (OCDUS, DDQ), or in use of cannabis.
As most of the changes in SWN and OCDUS scores took
place within the first week of the trial, it seems unlikely that
differences would have been found if the trial had been
extended beyond 6 weeks.
A limitation of the study is that only 41 of the 128 patients
were using cannabis at baseline, resulting in limited statistical power for the detection of differences in changes in
craving and cannabis use. Another limitation isthat only 64%
of the eligible patients were willing to participate in the study,
possibly limiting the external validity of the study. However,
there were no significant differences in patients that refused
participation, compared with those who were randomized.
Similar to many other studies among adolescents and young
adults with recent onset schizophrenia, only 70% of the participating patients completed the 6-week treatment. Whether
receiving olanzapine or risperidone, patients reported
increased subjective well-being during the 6-week trial. The
highest increase of subjective well-being took place in the
first week, which is consistent with previous findings.4
An explanation for the absence of differential effects is that
our hypothesis was incorrect. Perhaps the difference in dopamine dissociation between olanzapine and risperidone is too
small to generate differences, or differences in dopamine dissociation rate are not related to differences in subjective
experience or craving for cannabis. In recent placebo controlled studies, risperidone showed decreases in craving.30,31,35 Olanzapine showed a decrease27,36–37 and an
increase in craving.28
More RCTs are needed to establish whether different types of
antipsychotics really differ in their effect on craving and drug
use behaviour of patients. In conclusion, in this double-blind
RCT, we found no evidence for a differential effect of
olanzapine and risperidone (in dosages that lead to comparable dopamine D2 occupancy) on subjective well-being or on
craving for cannabis.

Effect of Olanzapine and Risperidone on Subjective Well-Being and Craving for Cannabis in Patients With Schizophrenia or Related Disorders
Résumé : L’effet de l’olanzapine et de la rispéridone sur le bien-être subjectif et l’état
de manque de cannabis chez les patients souffrant de schizophrénie ou de troubles
connexes : un essai clinique aléatoire à double insu
Objectif : Examiner si le bien-être subjectif et l’état de manque de cannabis étaient différents chez
les patients souffrant de schizophrénie ou de troubles connexes traités à l’olanzapine ou à la
rispéridone.
Méthode : Un essai clinique aléatoire à double insu de 6 semaines d’olanzapine et de rispéridone a
été mené chez 128 jeunes adultes souffrant de schizophrénie ou de troubles connexes d’apparition
récente. Les mesures d’efficacité primaires étaient le changement moyen, de la ligne de départ au
point d’arrivée, des scores totaux à l’échelle du bien-être subjectif sous neuroleptique, l’échelle
d’utilisation obsessionnelle-compulsive de drogues, le questionnaire sur l’envie de drogues, et
l’autodéclaration d’utilisation du cannabis. Une analyse de covariance a servi à vérifier les
différences intergroupes.
Résultats : L’occupation du récepteur de dopamine D2 ne différait pas entre l’olanzapine (n = 63)
et la rispéridone (n = 65). Des améliorations semblables du bien-être subjectif ont été observées
dans les deux groupes. Dans le groupe comorbide utilisant du cannabis (n = 41,32 %), une
diminution semblable de l’état de manque de cannabis a été observée dans les deux conditions de
traitement.
Conclusions : L’olanzapine et la rispéridone étaient toutes deux associées au bien-être subjectif
amélioré. Aucune preuve n’a été constatée d’un effet différentiel de l’olanzapine ou de la
rispéridone sur l’expérience subjective ou sur l’état de manque du cannabis dans des dosages
menant à une occupation du récepteur de dopamine D2 comparable.
