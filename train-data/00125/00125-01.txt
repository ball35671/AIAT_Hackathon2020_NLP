A 14-week double blind study compared the efficacy of
olanzapine to risperidone in reducing marijuana=cocaine
craving and use in individuals with schizophrenia. The study
consisted of three phases: a two-week assessment phase, a
two-week cross-taper phase onto olanzapine=risperidone,
and a ten-week period of maintenance on olanzapine=risperidone. The proportion of cocaine-positive urines
decreases over time for both groups with a trend for a
greater reduction for the olanzapine group compared to risperidone group. In the last six weeks, marijuana craving was
more likely for the risperidone group compared to the olanzapine group, although there was no group difference in the
proportion of negative marijuana urines. The data suggest
some potential for the utility of olanzapine for the treatment
of cocaine dependence in individuals with schizophrenia.

INTRODUCTION
The Epidemiological Catchment Area (ECA) study
reported that lifetime substance use among individuals
with schizophrenia is as high as 50%,
1 with the primary
illicit drugs of abuse being marijuana (23%) and stimulants (13%). Individuals with schizophrenia were ten
times more likely to have used cocaine in the past thirty
days than those without schizophrenia.2 In a retrospective
study in emergency room settings3 between 1984 and
1996, marijuana use among schizophrenics increased
from 0% in 1984 to 27% in 1996. Furthermore, in
1996, 73% tested positive for cocaine. Cocaine and marijuana use disorders among individuals with schizophrenia have been associated with poor treatment
compliance, increased rates of relapse, and disruption of
role functioning.4–7 Despite severe adverse consequences,
the reinforcing effects may promote continued use of both
illicit substances.
The reinforcing effects of cocaine are believed to
be related primarily to its high affinity for blockading
the dopamine (DA) transporter,8 and its subsequent
increase in dopamine activity in the mesolimbic dopamine
system or cannabis is thought to modulate dopamine
transmission.9 Antipsychotics, being dopamine blockers,
should function as cocaine antagonists. However, some
studies suggest that chronic haloperidol may increase10
or attenuate11 the effects of cocaine. Due to the extrapyramidal effects produced by most DA antagonists,12 their
clinical utility may be limited. In contrast, atypical antipsychotics such as clozapine and olanzapine may be more
promising because of their better tolerability, fewer extrapyramidal effects, and reduction of dysphoric mood
states.13
Preclinical studies using olanzapine in rats14 have produced results that suggest a further evaluation of atypical
antipsychotics may be warranted. Olanzapine’s ability to
block the reinforcing effects of cocaine could result from
one or a combination of several pharmacological effects.
One likely candidate is the D1 receptor, in that specific
antagonists of this receptor15,16 have been shown to block
the reinforcing effects of cocaine-using drug self-administration17 and conditioned place preference18 paradigms. Data
suggest that olanzapine is useful in special nonpsychotic
populations such as methadone patients for the reduction
of cocaine use.19 In a double blind placebo-controlled trial
with 30 nonpsychotic individuals, Kampman et al.20 did
not find olanzapine useful for cocaine dependence; in fact,
they concluded that olanzapine might actually worsen the
prognosis for cocaine-dependent individuals.
Similarly, the results for risperidone are equivocal.
Some studies indicate it is useful in reducing cocaine
craving and relapse in cocaine-dependent individuals with

schizophrenia21 and those without psychotic illness,22,23
whereas other studies indicate that it does not reduce
cocaine use in non-psychotic cocaine-dependent individuals.24 Although risperidone has been studied in
cocaine-dependent individuals, preliminary results have
not been encouraging.25 It is not unreasonable to target
the use of both substances with one drug. For example,
topiramate has shown some promise for both alcohol
and cocaine. Similarly, naltrexone is efficacious for both
alcohol and opioid dependence.26,27
Other antipsychotics have also been studied for the
treatment of cocaine=cannabis use disorders. In a pilot
study with schizophrenic cocaine abusers, flupenthixol
was useful in reducing cocaine use.28 Albanese et al.29
suggest that clozapine is helpful in the reduction of substance use, including cocaine, in chronically psychotic
individuals. In a retrospective study of individuals with
schizophrenia, 8 on risperidone and 31 on clozapine,
Green et al.30 concluded that individuals on clozapine
were more likely to abstain from alcohol and marijuana
than those on risperidone. Among the atypicals, olanzapine seemed most promising. It has a similar binding
profile to clozapine31,32 less severe side effects,33 a
greater affinity than risperidone31,34 for the D1 receptor
(which is strongly implicated in the reduction of cocaine
subjective effects in humans35 and cocaine self-administration in rats36), and 5HT2a receptor antagonism.31,37
5HT antagonism is thought to increase DA in the prefrontal area and improve negative symptoms.38,39 Thus,
we proposed that olanzapine may be more effective than
risperidone in reducing cocaine=marijuana use in individuals with schizophrenia. As most patients with schizophrenia are currently treated with atypicals, this
comparison is likely to be informative. To date, there
appears to have been no double-blind controlled study
comparing olanzapine with ripseridone in individuals
with schizophrenia for the treatment of cocaine=
cannabis use disorders.
METHODS
Participants
Participants were recruited from Harlem Hospital’s
Community Support Services and Adult Continuing
Day Treatment Program, the Inwood Clinic, the
Schizophrenia Research Unit and Clinic, and the Substance Use Treatment and Research Services (STARS)
of the New York State Psychiatric Institute (NYSPI).
Staff members at the day programs referred patients with
diagnoses of schizophrenia=schizoaffective disorder and
co-morbid substance use problems.
Seventy-six individuals were screened for study participation, of which twenty-eight were entered and randomized into the trial (see Figure 1). All screening
participants underwent a detailed medical and psychiatric
assessment. The medical screening included a complete
history and physical examinations, an electrocardiogram,
and laboratory tests, which included hematology and
blood chemistry (including liver function) tests, and a
blood pregnancy test for females. The psychiatric
evaluation included the Structured Clinical Interview for
DSM-IV.40 Individuals were considered eligible for
participation if they:
1. met DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia or
schizoaffective disorder,
2. met DSM-IV criteria for current cocaine and=or
marijuana abuse or dependence, and
3. were using marijuana at least twice a week, or
cocaine at least once a week on average during the
three months prior to enrollment in the study.
Individuals were excluded if they:
1. were pregnant,
2. were currently physiologically dependent on alcohol
or other drugs such that they had experienced significant withdrawal symptoms in the past (nicotine and
caffeine dependence were acceptable),
3. had unstable psychiatric symptomatology,
4. had an unstable medical condition (eg, acute
hepatitis, uncontrolled hypertension),
5. had enzyme function tests greater than three times
the upper limit of normal,
6. had a history of seizures or neuroleptic malignant
syndrome,
7. had committed a violent crime within the past two
years,
8. had not responded to either olanzapine or
risperidone in the past, or
9. had a score >30 on the positive and negative subscales of the Positive and Negative Symptom
Scale.41
After complete description of the study to the subjects,
written informed consent was obtained for the screening
and study procedures. The study was approved by the
NYSPI Institutional Review Board.
Study Procedures
This study was a 14-week, double-blind, randomized
trial comparing olanzapine (5–20 mg each day) to risperidone (3–9 mg each day). The study length was separated
into three phases:
1. a two-week assessment phase when baseline data
were collected while participants were maintained
on their prescribed medication,
2. a two-week cross-taper phase, during which participants were tapered off their previously prescribed
medication and onto the study medication (either
olanzapine or risperidone), and
Akerele & Levin July–August 2007 261
3. a ten-week maintenance period, during which participants were maintained on either olanzapine or
risperidone.
Both olanzapine and risperidone were placed in gelatin capsules containing riboflavin. Randomization was not stratified, but was a 50=50 uniform distribution of groups of 4.
Gradual increases in doses occurred during phase 2, during
which participants were tapered off their regular oral=depot
and placed on the study medication according to strict
guidelines.42 Patients in the risperidone group received
3 mg=day for days 1–3, 6 mg=day for days 4–7 and
9 mg=day from day 8 until the end of the study. Patients
in the olanzapine group received 5 mg=day for days 1–3,
10 mg=day for days 4–7, 15 mg=day for days 8–12, and
20 mg=day from day 13 until the end of the study.
Doses were adjusted whenever participants showed
any signs of decompensation, such as Clinical Global
Impression Scale (CGI)43 > 4, a PANSS > 30 on the
positive or negative subscales, or akathisia. The emergence of suicidal ideation, increased auditory hallucinations, delusions, or decreased ability=motivation to
attend to basic hygiene relative to baseline, which are
unresponsive to treatment, resulted in the termination
of the tapering process, return to original medications,
and withdrawal from the study. Participants met with a
member of the research team three times a week throughout the entire 14 weeks of the study. At each of the three
weekly visits, patients were asked to provide a urine specimen, complete forms, and have their vital signs and side
effects assessed, and then they received medication.
Assessments of drug use and treatment compliance were
conducted on a weekly basis. Furthermore, all participants received psychotherapy on a weekly basis. Assessment of psychiatric symptom severity was conducted
bi-weekly. Participants were compensated $5.00 in cash
for transportation costs at each visit.
Participants were asked to designate a ‘‘significant
other’’ (eg, a friend or relative who was in close contact
with the patient) who would assist with attendance and
the follow-up of participants. Participants were terminated if they missed three consecutive appointments. At
the completion of the 10-week maintenance phase of the
study, participants were referred back to their primary

psychiatrist, who was notified by the New York State
Psychiatric Institute pharmacy of the patient’s medication. The patient and primary psychiatrist then decided
whether or not to continue with the study medication.
Assessments
Screening
The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID)
was administered by the research psychiatrist in order to
establish current diagnoses of both schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and cocaine and=or cannabis abuse
or dependence. Other assessments included the Addiction
Severity Index (ASI),44 Abnormal Involuntary Movements’ Scale,45 Simpson-Angus Extrapyramidal Side
Effects Scale,46 Hamilton Depression Scale,47 Positive
and Negative Scale (PANSS),41 for which excellent interrater and test-retest reliabilities have been demonstrated.48
Treatment Phase
Substance use=cravings measures. Assessments of
drug cravings were carried out using the Marijuana
Craving Report and the Cocaine Craving Report at
each of the three weekly visits.49 These measures assess
how many times per day the patient has craved
marijuana=cocaine since the last visit and the duration
of the craving. The patient is also asked to rate on a
scale of 1 to 100 how little or how much he=she has
wanted or needed marijuana=cocaine in the past 24
hours and since his=her last visit. Drug use assessments
included the Quantitative Substance Use Inventory, a
locally derived instrument that was administered
weekly. Drug use was also measured three times a
week by measuring the cocaine metabolite,
benzoylecgonine, and the marijuana metabolite, Delta9-Tetrahydrocannbinol (THC), in the urine. Urine
specimens were scored as positive or negative for
cocaine based on the standard 300 ng=ml cutoff, and a
standard cutoff of 100 ng =ml for marijuana metabolite.
Psychiatric and Side Effect Measures
The PANSS was administered bi-weekly to measure
any symptoms of decompensation. The HAM-D was
administered monthly to measure changes in depression
severity. CGI was administered weekly. AIMS, Simpson,
and weekly psychiatrist assessments were used to monitor
side effects.
Outcome Measures
The primary outcome measures in this study were drug
craving and drug use of cocaine, marijuana, or any drug
use. For the weekly urine data, each study week was
classified as either positive or negative based on
standard criteria. Urine samples were tested for cocaine
metabolites and marijuana. Urines were scored as positive
or negative for cocaine, and cutoff points of 300 ng=ml
for cocaine and 100 ng=ml for marijuana were used.
Although the NIDA cutoff for marijuana is 30 ng=ml, a
cutoff of 100 ng=ml was used because it is less likely to
produce a positive result when there is no new use.50,51
Budney et al. used this rationale based on earlier work
suggesting this is an acceptable research approach.50,51
If any of the thrice-weekly specimens were positive for
cocaine=marijuana, the week was classified as positive
for cocaine=marijuana use. Drug craving was assessed
using weekly, self-reported drug craving in the past 24
hours (‘‘How much did you want [drug] in the past 24
hours?’’). Psychiatric outcome over the course of the
study was assessed using the Ham-D scale (21 items)
and the PANSS positive and negative symptom count,
as well as its general psychopathology subscale. Retention
in treatment (number of study weeks completed) and percentage of study completers were also analyzed.
Data Analysis
Demographic variables and baseline clinical characteristics were compared between groups using a chi-square
test for categorical variables and independent t-test for
continuous variables. Time-to-dropout between the
groups was compared using Kaplan-Meier survival curves
and the log-rank test. Longitudinal analyses of the
cocaine use and craving outcome measures were performed using generalized estimating equations (GEE) as
implemented by SAS’s PROC GENMOD. Dichotomous
outcomes were modeled using logistic regression, and
continuous outcomes were modeled using normal linear
regression. For all outcome measures, the dependent variable was modeled as a function of time, treatment assignment, time  treatment interaction, and a baseline
(pretreatment) measure of the outcome variable. The
analyses of cocaine use also controlled for baseline
differences between the two groups in the number of
self-reported days using cocaine prior to study entry.
The main effect of ASI medical and years of education
on treatment outcome were also adjusted for, but were
found not to be significant and removed from the model.
RESULTS
Sample Description
Seventy-six patients were screened for study participation, of which twenty-eight were randomized to receive either
treatment with olanzapine or risperidone (n ¼ 14 per group).
The sample was predominantly male (89%) and had a mean
age of 36 years. Fifty-four percent were African American,
32% were Hispanic, and 14% were Caucasian.
Subjects in the olanzapine group had on average more
years of education, but the two groups did not differ in
the number of subjects who earned a high school degree
or higher education (olanzapine 10 [70%], risperidone 7
[50%]; v2 ¼ 1.35, df ¼ 2, p ¼ .25). The sample was predominantly cannabis abusing=dependent, with 26 subjects
Akerele & Levin July–August 2007 263
(13 olanzapine, 13 risperidone) having current cannabis
abuse=dependence and 20 subjects (11 olanzapine, 9 risperidone) having current cocaine dependence. Subjects
in the olanzapine group self-reported using cocaine on
significantly more days than the risperidone group in
the month prior to study entry (olanzapine 18 (SD 8), risperidone 5 (SD 5); t ¼ 3.75, df ¼ 19, p ¼ .001). However,
the risperidone group had more cocaine-positive urine
samples at baseline even though self-report was higher
in the olanzapine group. The groups did not differ
significantly at baseline on six out of seven subscales of
the ASI, except for the medical subscale. The olanzapine
group had a statistically significant higher medical severity score compared to risperidone (.29 [.24] vs. .11 [.19],
respectively). There were no other significant differences
between the groups with respect to demographic and
baseline clinical characteristics (see Table 1).
Study Retention
There were no significant differences in time-to-dropout
between the groups (mean weeks in treatment (SE) for
olanzapine 11 (SE 1.11), risperidone 11 (SE1.30); logrank ¼ .81, df ¼ 1, p ¼ .37). Sixteen subjects completed
the entire 14-week trial with no significant differences in

Of those who did not complete the study, 10 subjects
did not present for appointments, 1 subject was admitted
to the hospital for inpatient detoxification, and 1 subject
was admitted to an inpatient psychiatric unit and had
been noncompliant with medications.
Drug Use Outcome
Drug use outcome, as measured by weekly urine toxicology, was analyzed separately for the 20 subjects with
current cocaine dependence and separately for the 26 subjects with current marijuana abuse=dependence. Weekly
craving severity was also analyzed by type of drug used.
We also examined self-reported days of using ‘‘any’’ drug
for the whole sample.
Marijuana Use
The proportion of subjects with urine toxicology
marijuana-positive weeks decreased significantly over the
course of the study for both treatment groups
(Z ¼ 2.52, p ¼ .01), but there was no significant treatment main effect (Z ¼ .52, p ¼ .60) or treatment  time
interaction (Z ¼ .50, p ¼ .62; see Figure 2a) The proportion of marijuana-positive urine specimens during the
lead-in phase was positively correlated with the outcome
(p < .001). Analysis of weekly self-reported marijuana
craving revealed a significant treatment time interaction
(Z ¼ 2.06, p ¼ .04), indicating a decrease in mean marijuana craving severity for the risperidone group while the
olanzapine group showed virtually no change in craving
severity (see Figure 3a). Baseline marijuana severity was
positively correlated with outcome (Z ¼ 4.18, p < .0001).
Cocaine Use
For the subgroup of subjects with current cocaine
dependence, there was neither a significant decrease in
cocaine-positive weeks over time (Z ¼ 1.57, p ¼ .12)
nor a significant treatment  time effect (Z ¼ 18,
p ¼ .86), although there was a marginally significant treatment main effect (Z ¼ 1.77, p ¼ .08) indicating
that cocaine use during the study, on average, was lower
in the olanzapine group than the risperidone group (see
Figure 2b). Both the proportion of cocaine-positive urine
during the lead-in phase, as well as the number of days
using cocaine in the 30 days prior to study entry, were positively correlated with the outcome (p < .001). There were
no significant differences between the groups in terms of
cocaine craving over time (see Figure 3b).
Self-Reported Drug Use
We also examined weekly self-reported days of ‘‘any’’
drug use for all subjects. After adjusting for self-reported
days of use during the lead-in period, the olanzapine
group reported, on average, significantly fewer days of
use than the risperidone group (3 days vs. 4.3 days,

Akerele & Levin July–August 2007 265
respectively; Z ¼ 2.27, p ¼ .02). The two groups did not
differ significantly in their self-reported overall drug craving over the course of the study.
Psychiatric Outcome
Mean ratings of the PANSS positive and negative subscales over the course of the treatment were examined.
Severity decreased over time on the positive subscale for
both groups (Z ¼ 2.53, p ¼ .01) but there were no
significant between-group differences (Z ¼ .49, p ¼ .62).
For the negative subscale, severity did not decrease significantly over time (Z ¼ .34, p ¼ .73), although between
weeks 6 and 10, the olanzapine group had less negative
symptom count compared to risperidone (Z ¼ 1.80,
p ¼ .07). Ham-D scores were compared at baseline and
at the end of the study (using last observation for each
subject). Mean Ham-D scores at end of study were
approximately 7 points for both groups, and there was
no significant difference between the groups in the mean
change from baseline (olanzapine .14 [.91], risperidone
.03 [.70]; t ¼ .31, df ¼ 20, p ¼ .76).
Compliance
Compliance was measured by self-reported ingestion of
medication and riboflavin fluorescence. The proportion of
self-reported missed doses did not differ between the groups,
with the olanzapine group reporting missing about 7% of
the administered doses and the risperidone group reporting
missing 8% of the doses (t ¼ .48, df ¼ 24, p ¼ .64).
Side Effects
Using the AIMS, one of the individuals receiving risperidone had a worsening of abnormal movements,
which later returned to baseline, and four showed
improvement in abnormal movements. For the olanzapine group, three had improvement in abnormal movements. The average AIMS score for the entire sample
was 1.74 (4.1) at baseline and 0.69 (1.52) at the final
assessment. Using the Simpson-Angus Scale, the scores
remained essentially unchanged, with the risperidone
group having a mean baseline score of 10.23 (.44) and
an end rating score of 10.15 (.38) and the olanzapine
group having a mean baseline score of 10.64 (1.15)
and an end rating score of 10.23 (.44). The most common side effect reported by both the risperidone group
and olanzapine group was sedation (77% and 54%,
respectively). No patient was discontinued from the
study due to intolerable side effects.
DISCUSSION
Although there was no significant difference in cocaine
or marijuana use based on urine toxicologies, there was a
trend for subjects in the olanzapine group to have a lower
proportion of cocaine-positive weeks. Alternatively, the
risperidone group had a greater reduction in marijuana
craving compared to the olanzapine group, but this was
not reflected in the urine toxicology results. Clinical
symptoms continued to improve despite continued use.
This is not unusual, as similar findings have been reported
when treating comorbid depression in ongoing alcoholdependent individuals.52 In addition it is noteworthy that
the olanzapine group had greater improvement in
negative symptoms toward the end of the trial.
This study has a number of limitations, the primary of
which is the small sample size. However, it is not uncommon to use small sample sizes for pilot studies, particularly in this population, for the initial assessment of a
therapeutic modality.30,53–55 Other limitations include a
primarily male sample and that the subjects came from
numerous clinics. However, that the same core research
staff, consisting of the research psychiatrist and research
assistants, conducted the clinical assessments and ratings
at each of the sites in addition to the ongoing treatment at
the clinic may have mitigated this latter confound.
Although limited, some data supporting the use of olanzapine in the treatment of individuals with schizophrenia
and a history of substance abuse are available.56
Similarly, data exist supporting the use of risperidone in
substance abusers with schizophrenia.57 Risperidone was
also found to be useful in a six-week open label trial21
in reducing cue-elicited craving in individuals with
schizophrenia and cocaine dependence.
There seems to be only one double-blind, controlled
pharmacological trial comparing antipsychotic medications for individuals with both schizophrenia and a substance use disorder. In this study, Sayers et al.54
compared olanzapine to haloperidol in 24 schizophrenic
cocaine abusers and found that there were no significant
differences in the overall proportions of positive drug
screens; positive, negative or depressive symptoms; or
extrapyramidal symptoms. Surprisingly, cocaine craving
was rated significantly lower by patients treated with
haloperidol compared to olanzapine. The findings from
Sayer et al.’s study54 suggests that olanzapine may not
have a differential benefit compared to standard antipsychotic medications. However, the small sample size of our
trial may have limited our ability to detect changes,
particularly in cocaine use.
In addition to olanzapine and clozapine, other atypicals are worthy of investigation in schizophrenic populations with substance use disorders. For example, aripiprazole,
a partial D2 agonist, may enhance prefrontal DA via
mechanisms different from those postulated for olanzapine.58,59 In a recent open trial, Brown et al.60 found that
switching outpatients with bipolar or schizoaffective disorders and substance abuse from a prescribed antipsychotic
to aripiprazole led to a significant reduction in dollars
spent on alcohol and alcohol craving. Although there were
also reductions in cocaine craving, reductions in cocaine
use were not found. In this study, the majority of patients
were being treated with quetiapine alone or in combination
266 Comparison of Olanzapine to Risperidone July–August 2007
with another antipsychotic medication. Contrasting this,
quetiapine might have clinical utility due to its diversified
activity on several serotonergic and noradrenergic receptors along with its preferential action on the reward system.61 However, similar to aripiprazole, small pilot
studies suggest that quetiapine may reduce drug craving,
although reductions in drug use have not been found.62
Strikingly, despite the enormous morbidity associated with
comorbid substance use among individuals with schizophrenia, little empirical data are available to help guide
pharmacologic treatment in this population. Further work
is urgently needed to help clinicians make informed, safe
decisions in treating this patient population. Given the limitations of this study, our findings need to be replicated
with a larger, double-blind study. Furthermore, some of
the atypicals that have become available recently should
also be assessed for efficacy in treating this subset of substance abusers.
