Introduction
Cannabis use disorders (CUDs) are highly comorbid in patients
with schizophrenia (Machielsen et al., 2010; Regier et al., 1990)
and are associated with poor outcome (Dixon, 1999; Linszen
et al., 1994; Regier et al., 1990). It has been suggested that conventional antipsychotics may not reduce or may even increase
substance abuse in patients with schizophrenia, whereas the atypical antipsychotic clozapine may reduce substance abuse in these
patients. The evidence for clozapine’s superiority, however, is
scarce (Green et al., 2008; Machielsen and de Haan, 2009). In the
current study, we compare the effects of two different antipsychotics on two of the most important mechanisms responsible for
the development and persistence of substance abuse in patients
with schizophrenia and a comorbid CUD: attentional bias and the
related problem of craving (Field and Cox, 2008).
Attentional bias can be defined as the tendency to automatically and involuntarily allocate and maintain attention to conditioned drug cues (Field and Cox, 2008). Attentional bias is a
largely unconscious process which is thought to result from
acquired motivational and attention-grabbing properties of drug
cues due to sensitisation of dopamine systems in the brain
(Robinson and Berridge, 1993) and is associated with a phasic
increase of extracellular dopamine that shifts attention towards
motivationally significant stimuli (Franken, 2003). Associations
of attentional bias with the experience of craving (the subjective
urge to administer a drug), relapse rates and treatment outcome
have been reported (Carpenter et al., 2006; Cox et al., 2006;
Franken et al., 2003; Marissen et al., 2006; Waters et al., 2003).
Since reduction in attentional bias could help patients to reduce
or refrain from substance use, and because reduced substance
abuse may improve outcome in patients with schizophrenia,
attentional bias is thought to be an important treatment target.
Because dopamine is involved in attentional bias, effects of
dopamine antagonists can be expected. Studies among smokers
and heroin users showed that low doses of the dopamine D2
antagonist haloperidol suppressed attentional bias for substancerelated words and its related activation of the anterior cingulate
cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (Franken et al., 2004;
Luijten et al., 2012). However, no reduction in attentional bias
was found after amisulpride administration (another dopamine
D2 antagonist) in stimulant users (Ersche et al., 2010). A possible
explanation for these inconsistent findings could be that the
effect of dopamine D2 antagonists on attentional bias follows an

Abstract
Cannabis use disorders (CUDs) are highly comorbid in patients with schizophrenia and are associated with poor outcome. Clozapine has been put
forward as the first choice antipsychotic in this comorbid group. However, little is known about the mechanisms underlying the assumed superiority
of clozapine. We compared the effects of clozapine and risperidone on attentional bias, subjective craving and associated regional brain activity in
patients with schizophrenia and CUD. Overall, 36 patients with schizophrenia and 19 healthy controls were included. Patients were randomised to
antipsychotic treatment with clozapine or risperidone. At baseline and after 4 weeks of medication use, regional brain responses were measured during
a classical Stroop and a cannabis word Stroop using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Clozapine-treated CUD patients showed a larger reduction
in craving and in activation of the insula during the cannabis word Stroop, while risperidone-treated patients showed a larger decrease in activation
of the right anterior cingulate cortex during the classical Stroop. A significant association was found between decreases in subjective craving and
decreases in insula activation during the cannabis word Stroop. These findings strongly suggest that clozapine may be a better treatment choice in
patients with schizophrenia and CUD than risperidone.

inverted U-shaped curve, and therefore differences between
antipsychotics can be expected due to their differential affinity to
dopamine D2 receptor (Kuroki et al., 2008; Seeman, 2002).
Clozapine and risperidone show the largest difference in terms of
dopamine D2 occupancy rate, dissociation rate and in D1/D2
receptor occupancy ratio (Kuroki et al., 2008; Seeman, 2002;
Tauscher et al., 2004). Clozapine’s low D2 occupancy rate, higher
dissociation rate and higher D1/D2 receptor occupancy ratio
together with its complex pharmacological profile (Green et al.,
2008) could therefore result in a larger decrease in substancerelated attentional bias in patients treated with clozapine compared with patients treated with risperidone.
Attentional bias for substance-related stimuli is mostly measured using an addiction Stroop task (Cox et al., 2006) which is
derived from the classical Stroop task (Stroop, 1935). Participants
are asked to name the colour of words that are shown to them and
ignore the semantic content of the word itself. Attentional bias is
the degree to which participants are slower at naming the colour
of incongruent versus congruent words and of drug-related words
versus neutral words. Studies using addiction Stroop tasks or
other designs to measure attentional bias in patients with substance abuse have found increased activation of the anterior cingulate cortex, ventral striatum, inferior frontal gyrus, dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex, superior parietal cortex, insula, amygdala and
superior temporal cortex during the drug condition (Ersche et al.,
2010; Goldstein et al., 2007, 2009a; Hester and Garavan, 2009;
Janes et al., 2010; Luijten et al., 2011b, 2012; Nestor et al., 2011;
Vollstadt-Klein et al., 2012).
The current study measured attentional bias-related brain activation during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
scanning using a classical and a cannabis word Stroop task in
healthy controls and in schizophrenia patients before and after
treatment with either risperidone or clozapine in a priori-defined
regions of interest (ROIs). Patients were expected to have
decreased regional brain activation during the classical Stroop
compared with healthy controls due to the presence of general cognitive impairments in patients with schizophrenia (Wobrock et al.,
2013). We further hypothesised that patients with a comorbid CUD
have increased regional brain activation during the cannabis Stroop
compared with healthy controls and patients without a CUD, and
that this increased brain activation would be associated with subjective craving. Finally, and most importantly, we hypothesised
that clozapine treatment compared with risperidone treatment
would not result in differences in brain activation during the classical Stroop task, but would be associated with a larger reduction
of regional brain activation during cannabis-related words after 4
weeks of treatment in patients with a CUD. Moreover, we expected
that this larger reduction in regional brain activation would be
associated with a larger reduction in subjective craving.
Methods
The medical ethics committee of the Academic Medical Center
of the University of Amsterdam approved the study and all participants signed informed consent prior to participation.
Participants
A total of 46 patients with schizophrenia were recruited from
inpatient and outpatient treatment settings of the Early Onset
Psychosis Department of the Academic Medical centre between
April 2009 and June 2012. Of these, 35 had a diagnosis of CUD
(cannabis abuse or dependence) and 11 did not use cannabis and
had a negative history for substance use disorders except for
smoking (NCUD).
Inclusion criteria were male gender, age 18–30, DSM-IV
diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizophreniform or schizoaffective
disorder (for brevity this will be referred to as schizophrenia).
Exclusion criteria were previous unsuccessful treatment with or
contraindication for the use of risperidone or clozapine, using
depot antipsychotic medication 3 months prior to inclusion, treatment with psychotropic medication other than biperiden or benzodiazepines, and the presence of non-removable metal objects
as a contraindication for fMRI scanning.
In addition, 21 healthy controls (HCs) were recruited through
advertisements on schools and sport facilities. All HCs had a
negative history of neurologic or psychiatric diseases, including
lifetime substance use disorders. Participants in the control group
had used cannabis for a maximum of 50 times lifetime, the last
time at least 1 year prior to inclusion.
Study design
Patients were randomly allocated to receive either clozapine or
risperidone. Patients started with a standard dose titration scheme
directed at a dose of 3.5 mg risperidone or 350 mg clozapine. In
patients who already used antipsychotic medication, that medication was tapered in the week before the first assessment.
Concomitant psychotropic medication was restricted to benzodiazepines and biperiden. In case of lack of antipsychotic efficacy
or dose-related side effects, the dose was adjusted as clinically
applicable. During the study, all patients received supportive
treatment as usual.
Assessments (fMRI and questionnaires) took place twice: at
baseline before the first dose of the study medication and at the
end of 4 weeks of treatment. HCs were assessed only once.
All participants were asked to refrain from alcohol and drugs
24 h before testing, and patients did not smoke cigarettes at least
2 h before testing. In order to minimise (sub)acute pharmacological effects of cannabis, patients were instructed to refrain from
cannabis at least 3 days before testing. Urine samples were taken
3 days prior to the scan and the day of the scan. Using metabolite
quantifications, abstinence from cannabis could be confirmed for
all patients. In addition, urine screens for amphetamines, benzodiazepines, opioids and cocaine were performed prior to all
assessments. During the second assessment blood samples were
taken to test compliance to the study medication.
Questionnaires
The Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI)
(Robins et al., 1988) was used to assess current and lifetime substance use disorder. Craving during the past 7 days and current
craving were assessed with the cannabis version of the Obsessive
Compulsive Drug Use Scale (OCDUS) (Dekker et al., 2012) and
the short version of the Marijuana Craving Questionnaire (MCQ)
(Heishman et al., 2009), respectively. The Positive and Negative
Symptoms Scale (PANSS) was used to measure symptom severity (Kay et al., 1987). The subjective wellbeing under neuroleptics scale (SWN) was used to compare the change in subjective
wellbeing between medication groups (De Haan et al., 2002;
Naber, 1995).

Stroop task
A classical and a cannabis Stroop task were used to measure
divided attention performance and attentional bias to drug-related
stimuli, respectively. We used counting Stroop tasks (Bush et al.,
1998) because they are better suited for use in an fMRI environment (Bush et al., 2006). During these fMRI tasks, participants
viewed words which were congruent (e.g. ‘three’ was presented
three times), incongruent (e.g. ‘two’ was presented three times),
cannabis-related words (related to the smoking of cannabis) or
neutral words (related to transportation) (see online supplementary information S1). Cannabis and neutral words were matched
for word length, number of syllables and word frequency.
Participants indicated the number of times a word was displayed
as fast as possible using response boxes. Each word was presented for 3 s preceded by a fixation-cross for 1 s. A block design
was used to generate adequate power to study differences
between medication groups. Words were presented in a block
design consisting of 10 words of each category. Categories were
randomised in each block. In total four blocks were presented,
therefore each word category was shown four times. The number
of times a word was displayed (1–4) was random with a restriction of no more than two times the same number consecutively.
Between blocks, a low-level baseline (fixation-cross) was presented for 12 s. Total task duration was 11 min (Figure 1). Words
were projected on a screen which could be viewed through a mirror attached to the MRI head coil. Reaction times and task accuracy were measured and compared between incongruent/
congruent words and between cannabis-related/neutral words in
which larger differences indicated a larger attentional bias.
Imaging parameters and data pre-processing
A 3T MRI scanner (Intera, Philips Healthcare, Best, The
Netherlands) with a phased array SENSE RF eight-channel
receiver head coil was used for image acquisition. In the first
scanning session, a T1 structural image was acquired (TR 9.6 s,
TE 4.6 ms, voxel size 1×1×1.2 mm3, 182 slices, flip angle 8°).
During the Stroop task, blood oxygen level dependent signal was
measured with a T2* gradient-echo echo-planar imaging (EPI)
sequence (TR 2.3 s, TE 28 ms, voxel size 2.3×2.3×3 mm3, 35
slices, flip angle 80°). Data pre-processing and analysis was conducted with SPM8 (Statistical Parametric Mapping; Wellcome
Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, London, UK). Images were manually reoriented to MNI space, slice-time corrected, realigned
and unwarped, coregistered with the structural MRI scan, segmented and normalised to MNI space and spatially smoothed
with an 8 mm full-with-half-maximum Gaussian kernel.
Statistical analysis
Demographics were compared between groups with standard
univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA) for continuous variables and chi-squared tests for dichotomous variables using SPSS
17.0 (SPSS, Chicago, Illinois). Differences between first and second measurements of the OCDUS and MCQ were compared
between medication groups using repeated-measures ANOVAs.
Repeated-measures ANOVAs and t-tests were also used to
analyse reaction times and accuracy, with group (patients/controls) and treatment condition (clozapine/risperidone) as a
between-subject factor and word type (congruent/incongruent
and cannabis/neutral) as a within-subject factors. All analyses
were performed using two-tailed significance testing at p<.05.
FMRI data were analysed in the context of the general linear
model, in which onsets of words were convolved with a canonical haemodynamic response function. Next, contrast images containing parameter estimates, for congruent versus incongruent
words and cannabis versus neutral words, were computed for
each subject and entered into second-level between-group
comparisons.
Given their role in attentional bias in previous studies, we a
priori selected the following ROIs: anterior cingulate cortex
(ACC), inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), superior parietal lobe (SPL), superior temporal
gyrus (STY), amygdala, insula and ventral striatum (VS)
(Goldstein et al., 2009b; Hester and Garavan, 2009; Luijten et al.,
2011b, 2012). ROIs were defined using the WFU PickAtlas Tool
v2.4 that incorporates the automatic anatomical labelling (AAL)
atlas (Tzourio-Mazoyer et al., 2002). As the VS is not included in
the AAL atlas, a 10 mm sphere with MNI coordinates 10 8 -4 was
created as a ROI (Nielsen et al., 2012).
Analyses were performed for each ROI separately. Within
specific ROIs, small volume corrections around the peak activation were performed with a Family Wise Error correction p<.05
at voxel level, across the search volume of 10 mm spheres (for
insula and amygdala) and 20 mm spheres (for ACC, IFG, DLPFC,

SPL and STY) (Friston et al., 1996; Worsley et al., 1996). To set
an optimal threshold for correction we calculated the correlation
between the dependent variables (activation in the peak voxels of
the seven ROIs for incongruent vs. congruent trials). To account
for the number of ROIs we used a Bonferroni correction adjusted
for correlations between our ROIs (http://www.quantiativeskills.
com/sisa/calculations/bonfer.htm) (Li et al., 2014). A mean correlation coefficient was found between ROIs of r=.19, leading to
an equivalent corrected alpha of .011.
Differences between CUD patients, NCUD patients and HCs
were assessed using one-way ANOVAs; differences between clozapine and risperidone were compared over sessions using twoway (Group × Time) ANOVAs.
To assess the relationship between subjective craving and
regional brain activation, linear regression analyses between
craving scores and brain response to during cannabis words versus neutral words were performed in CUD patients.
Results
Demographics
A total of 67 participants (46 patients and 21 HCs) signed
informed consent. Of these, two patients withdrew their informed
consents, four patients were too anxious to be scanned and follow-up data could not be obtained from one patient. Due to scanner errors and software problems, data of two HCs and two
patients were of poor quality and had to be excluded from analysis. Therefore, in the analysis we included a total of 36 patients
(28 CUD and 8 NCUD) and 19 HCs. Twenty patients were randomised to risperidone (16 CUD) and 16 to clozapine (12 CUD).
For demographics see Table 1. There were significantly more
smokers and patients with other substance use disorders in the CUD
group compared with the NCUD group and HCs. Of the patients
that were included in the study, 12 had not used antipsychotics
before, two used risperidone, 10 olanzapine, three quetiapine, six
haloperidol, two penfluridol and one used pimozide. No significant
differences were found in previous treatment with antipsychotics
between patients randomised to clozapine or risperidone.
Treatment compliance and study completion
Mean dosage of study medication on the day of the second
assessment was 3.80 mg (SD 0.92) for risperidone and 302.6 mg
(SD 75.9) for clozapine. Two risperidone-treated patients stopped
taking medication 2 days prior to the second assessment. For all
other patients compliance and treatment completion could be
confirmed. Seven patients (four risperidone, three clozapine)
were scanned earlier than originally planned (after 2–3 weeks
instead of 4 weeks of treatment with study medication) because
their clinicians decided to stop study medication due to side
effects or lack of effect. In case of side effects, dose titration
schemes were adjusted so that those patients were scanned later.
As a consequence, mean treatment duration with study medication was 28.3 days. No significant difference in duration was
found between risperidone (mean 27.1 days) and clozapine
(mean 29.4 days t=-1.17, df=37, p=0.25). Oxazepam was used by
15 patients (eight risperidone, seven clozapine) and biperiden
was used by only one risperidone-treated patient during the study.
A total of 18 of 28 patients continued their cannabis use during
the study (10 risperidone, eight clozapine).
Changes in cannabis craving, symptoms and
subjective wellbeing during treatment
Compared with patients treated with risperidone (n=16, MT1=23.9
SDT1=9.0; MT2=23.5, SDT2=7.0), patients treated with clozapine
(n=12, MT1=20.3, SDT1=9.2; MT2=16.5, SDT2=5.5) showed a significantly larger decrease in subjective craving as measured with
the MCQ [F(1,26)=4.71, p=.04, partial eta squared=.15]. A trend
for a difference in the same direction was observed for clozapine
(n=12, MT1=30.8, SDT1=17.3, MT2=20.6, SDT2=8.8) and risperidone (n=16, MT1=38.9, SDT1=15.3, MT2=34.8, SDT2=17.1) in craving as measured with the OCDUS [F(1,26)=3.88, p=.06, partial eta
squared=.13]. No significant differences were found in baseline and
follow-up PANSS positive, negative and general scores between
patients treated with risperidone and patients treated with clozapine (Table 2). For subjective wellbeing as measured with the SWN,
also no significant differences were found between patients treated
with risperidone and patients treated with clozapine (Table 2).
However, clozapine-treated subjects had a non-significant larger
decrease in PANSS total scores and an increase in subjective wellbeing compared with risperidone-treated subjects.
Behavioural performance Stroop task
Behavioural data were not complete for five patients; therefore
31 patients (24 CUD patients) were included in the analysis. As
expected, all participants showed longer reaction times and lower
accuracy rates during the incongruent versus congruent trials
(Table 3). However, no significant differences in behavioural
performance were found between cannabis and neutral trials in
CUD patients or in any of the other groups. Overall, HCs had
significantly shorter reaction times compared with both patient
groups [F(2,47)=7.36, p=.002] and were more accurate
[F(2,47)=3.19, p=.05]. No differences in behavioural performance were found between CUD and NCUD patients.
Between sessions, no group differences were found in overall
reaction times and accuracy. However, patients treated with clozapine had significantly shorter reaction times during the second
session (t=-2.40, df=29, p=.023) than the patients treated with
risperidone, but no differences in accuracy were found between
medication groups (Table 4).

patients in the left amygdala (peak voxel: x,y,z=-18,-10,-20,
T=2.79, pFWE=.046) and right amygdala (peak voxel: x,y,z=22,-
18,-16, T=2.78, pFWE=.047).
Differences between medication groups
Classical Stroop effect. CUD patients showed larger activations during the first measurement compared with the second
measurement in most ROIs (see online supplementary information S2).
Compared with clozapine-treated CUD patients (n=12),
patients treated with risperidone (n=16) showed a trend-wise larger
decrease in activation in the right ACC (peak voxel: x,y,z=12,28,18,
T=3.70, pFWE=.022) between first and second scan in response to
incongruent trials vs. congruent trials (Figure 2).
Cannabis Stroop effect. CUD patients (n=28) showed a
larger activation during the first measurement compared with
the second measurement in the left amygdala (peak voxel:
x,y,z=-16,-10,-20, T=3.71, pFWE=.005) and a trend-wise larger
activation in the left IFG (peak voxel: x,y,z=-34,28,-14, T=3.59,
pFWE=.028). Trend-wise smaller activations during the first
measurement compared with the second measurement were
found in the right DLPFC (peak voxel: x,y,z=22,44,22, T=3.42,
pFWE=.043).
Compared with risperidone-treated CUD patients (n=16), clozapine-treated patients (n=12) showed a larger decrease in activation in the left insula (peak voxel: x,y,z=-40,12,-10, T=3.48,
pFWE=.037) and a trend-wise larger decrease in the right insula
(peak voxel: x,y,z=36,24,-6, T=3.14, pFWE=.078) between first
and second scan in response to cannabis trials versus neutral trials
(Figure 3).
Association between regional brain
activation and subjective craving
No significant correlations were found between MCQ scores and
neural response to cannabis words versus neutral words during
both measurements. A trend-wise positive association between
reduction in current craving (MCQ scores) and reduction in brain
activation during cannabis trials versus neutral trials was found
in the right insula (peak voxel: x,y,z=34,8,10, T=3.19,
pFWE=.026) (Figure 4). Post-hoc analysis showed that this effect
was driven by the clozapine group.
Discussion
To the best of our knowledge this is the first randomised controlled trial examining differences in effect between clozapine
and risperidone on regional brain responses during an attentional
bias task in patients with schizophrenia (with and without a
comorbid CUD).
Medication effects
In line with our expectations, clozapine-treated patients
showed a larger decrease in activation of the bilateral insula

during the cannabis word Stroop task and a larger decrease in
subjective craving than risperidone-treated patients, and these
changes were positively correlated (especially in the clozapine-treated group). Similarly, Luijten et al. (2011a) found a
correlation between subjective craving and attentional biasrelated activation of the insula, further implicating this region
in attentional bias. The superior effect of clozapine on subjective craving and brain activation during the cannabis Stroop
may be explained by clozapine’s lower affinity to the dopamine D2 receptors. Possibly, a relatively mild reduction of
dopaminergic neurotransmission (clozapine) weakens formerly learned associations, without inducing dysphoria,
whereas a stronger attenuation (blockage) of dopaminergic
neurotransmission (risperidone) may induce dysphoria, which
could increase attentional bias associated relief craving
(Verheul et al., 1999; Voruganti and Awad, 2006) in response to
cannabis-related words. Also, clozapine’s complex pharmacological profile may normalise the activity of the dopaminergic
mesocorticolimbic system (Green et al., 2008). Possibly other,
more social, factors could also explain clozapine’s superiority
in the treatment of complex patient populations, including the
fact that treatment with clozapine involves a more regular
monitoring by, and thus more interactions with, clinicians than
treatment with risperidone.

We expected that affinity to the dopamine D2 receptor would
be less crucial for the classical Stroop, because the classical
Stroop task is primarily a test of executive functioning which is
not necessarily a dopamine D2-related process (Roesch-Ely et al.,
2005). Moreover, the prefrontal cortex, which is involved in
executive functioning, contains mostly D1 receptors instead of D2
receptors. However, while we found decreased activation of most
ROIs for both patient groups during antipsychotic treatment,
these decreases were larger in the risperidone than in the clozapine group in the anterior cingulate cortex, which is thought to be
one of the main regions involved in response selection and error
monitoring. Interestingly, risperidone-treated patients also
responded significantly more slowly and were slightly less accurate during the second session. Effects of sedation are more likely
to be expected in patients using clozapine. A more likely explanation for the slower reaction times of the risperidone-treated
patients could be risperidone’s strong affinity to the dopamine D2
receptor. It has previously been found that high doses of dopamine antagonists negatively affect reaction times in cognitively
demanding tasks (Knowles et al., 2010).
Sedation due to risperidone could be related to the slower
response and the decreased anterior cingulate activation during
the classical Stroop task in this patient group. While sedation
effects of clozapine could also be expected, faster responses during the second session in clozapine-treated patients compared
with risperidone-treated patients makes this unlikely.
Differences between patients and healthy
controls
Contrary to our expectations, trends for stronger brain activations
in frontal regions were found in patients compared with HCs during the classical Stroop task. Moreover, behavioural data showed
that HCs had significantly shorter reaction times compared with
patients and were more accurate. Together, it can be concluded
that our patient group seems to activate their frontal regions less
efficiently. However, in a meta-analysis, lower activation of frontal regions was found in patients with schizophrenia during cognitively demanding tasks such as the Stroop (Minzenberg et al.,
2009). A possible explanation for this discrepancy could be the
differences in task designs between studies. While other studies
used the colour word Stroop task (Minzenberg et al., 2009) we
used a counting Stroop task which reduces cognitive complexity
when used in an fMRI environment (Bush et al., 1998). It has
been hypothesised that patients with schizophrenia may show
larger activation of frontal regions compared with HCs when a
task is cognitively less demanding, while smaller activations in

patients are found when a task is more difficult to perform
(Bassett et al., 2009; Perlstein et al., 2001).
In line with our hypothesis we found increased brain activation during the cannabis word Stroop task in CUD patients compared with HCs and NCUD patients, although no significant
differences in behavioural performance were found. While we
were expecting a behaviour effect of attentional bias as well, it
has previously been suggested that imaging data are more sensitive in detecting differences between groups (Wilkinson and
Halligan, 2004). Differences in brain activation between patients
and controls were found in the VS and amygdala, which are
dopamine-innervated regions that have previously been described
to be involved in attentional bias for drug-related stimuli (Janes
et al., 2010; Vollstadt-Klein et al., 2012). Similar to some other
studies, we also found a significant association between attentional bias-related brain activation and subjective craving (Field
et al., 2009; Franken, 2003; Luijten et al., 2011b), a finding that
was, however, not replicated in another recent study (Luijten
et al., 2012), implying that the evidence for a correlation between
attentional bias for drug-related stimuli and subjective craving is
mixed.
Strengths and limitations
Some potential limitations must be taken into account. First, we
were able to include only a limited number of non-cannabisusing schizophrenia patients. We intended to include more noncannabis-using patients to evaluate the possibility that imaging
findings in the comorbid patients were a consequence of disease
and/or medication effects not necessarily related to the presence
of CUD. Because time and financial constraints precluded inclusion of more patients without a CUD, the analyses involving
patients without CUDs are underpowered, possibly inducing type
II errors. Although we included a small sample of NCUD patients,
we still found a significant difference in regional brain activation
during the cannabis Stroop between CUD and NCUD patients.
Second, due to feasibility and ethical considerations this was an
open label study over a relatively short period of time in which
dosage of medication could be adjusted in case of side effects or
lack of efficacy. In seven of the 36 patients (19%) clinicians
decided to stop the study medication due to side effects or lack of
effect before 4 weeks of treatment. This is a substantial but not
uncommon attrition rate in unstable patients with schizophrenia
and comorbid substance use disorder. However, the presence of a
significant difference between the medications on attentional
bias and craving even after a short treatment period with relatively low doses of study medication underlines the important
differential effects of clozapine and risperidone on these outcomes. Furthermore, the open label design of the study may have
affected the results. However, this is not a very likely explanation
for the differences in brain activation, since attentional bias is a
largely unconscious process. Third, because patients did not use
any substance of abuse or cigarettes before scanning, effects of
withdrawal cannot be ruled out. However, randomisation prevents systematic differences between medication groups.
Furthermore, almost all patients using cannabis also smoked
cigarettes, and antipsychotic medication may affect smoking
behaviour (De Haan et al., 2006). However, because smoking
behaviour was similar in both medication groups it is unlikely
that possible craving for cigarettes differentially influenced the
results. Future research should address the issue whether clozapine may decrease craving for nicotine as well as for cannabis.
Another limitation is that treatment groups differed in the
prevalence of comorbid alcohol abuse/dependence (risperidone
6/20 [30%], clozapine1/16 [6%]). To explore the possible confounding effects of a comorbid alcohol use disorder we compared
attentional bias of patients with a comorbid alcohol use disorder
(n=7) to the patients without a comorbid alcohol use disorder
(n=26) at baseline using a lenient significance level (p<0.10). In
this comparison, no significant differences were found. However,
because the subgroup with comorbid alcohol use disorder was
small, the possibility of a type II error cannot be completely ruled
out. Furthermore, the frequency of patients with a comorbid substance use disorder (alcohol, cocaine, ecstasy) was very similar
for both treatment groups (7 out of 16 risperidone [44%], 5 out of
12 clozapine [42%]). Although there are some drug-specific differences, overall the effects of the alcohol and other drugs on the
brain reward system appear to be very similar (Kuhn and Gallinat,
2011; Volkow et al., 2007). We therefore believe that the group
difference in the presence of comorbid alcohol abuse/dependence
is very limited, and that it does not affect our main conclusions.
Conclusion
This study found strong indications for differential effects of clozapine and risperidone on brain activation during a cannabis
word attentional bias task and subjective craving, with a larger
reduction in insula activation during the cannabis Stroop and an
associated larger reduction in craving in the clozapine versus the
risperidone-treated group. These findings strongly suggest that
clozapine or other atypical antipsychotics with a relatively low
D2 occupancy rate, a relatively high dissociation rate and a relatively high D1/D2 receptor occupancy ratio may be a better treatment choice in patients with schizophrenia and a comorbid CUD
than other atypical and classical antipsychotics with a relatively
high D2 occupancy rate, a relatively low dissociation rate and/or
a relatively low D1/D2 receptor occupancy ratio.
