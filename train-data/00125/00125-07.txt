Abstract
Objective: This double-blind study compared a second generation (atypical) antipsychotic drugs compared to a representative older
agent for patients with schizophrenia who use or avoid illicit substances.
Methods: Schizophrenic subjects were recruited at 57 U.S. sites and randomly assigned to olanzapine, perphenazine, quetiapine,
risperidone or ziprasidone for up to 18 months. The primary aim of this analysis was to delineate differences between the overall
effectiveness of these five treatments among patients who used or did not use illicit substances.
Results: There were no significant differences between treatment groups in time to all-cause treatment discontinuation among
patients who use illicit drugs (median 3.3 to 6.8 months). Among non-users time to treatment discontinuation was significantly
longer for patients treated with olanzapine (median 13.0 months) than perphenazine ( 5.9 months), risperidone (5.6 months), or
quetiapine (5.0 months); time to discontinuation for ziprasidone (4.3 months) was even shorter, although the latter difference was
not significant. The difference between risperidone and quetiapine, although small, was significant. All remaining differences were
non-significant. Similar results were found for discontinuation due to inefficacy. There were no differences between illicit users and
non-users in symptom reduction and global improvement, after adjustment for differential duration of treatment. Differences in

discontinuation results were attenuated by non-compliance, but the trends persisted after controlling for treatment compliance.
Conclusions: Among patients with chronic schizophrenia who avoid use of illicit drugs, olanzapine was more effective than other
antipsychotics as reflected by longer time to all-cause discontinuation, but illicit substance abuse attenuated this advantage,
reinforcing the need for concurrent substance abuse treatment.

1. Introduction
Substance abuse co-morbidity in schizophrenia is a
powerful risk factor for a wide range of poor outcomes
(Abram and Teplin, 1991; Cournos et al., 1991;
Goodman et al., 2001; Haywood et al., 1995; Rosenberg
et al., 2001; Swanson et al., 1997; Swartz et al., 1998;
Swofford et al., 1996). Estimates of the prevalence of
substance use co-morbidity range from a low of 10%–
70% depending on diagnostic assessment methods
(Blanchard et al., 2000; Cantor-Graae et al., 2001;
Dixon, 1999; Goswami et al., 2004; Kavanagh et al.,
2002; Kessler et al., 1997; McCreadie, 2002; Mueser
et al., 1998; Regier et al., 1990; Salyers and Mueser,
2001; Swartz et al., 2006a,b). Clinicians often assume
that any level of substance abuse is likely to lead to
adverse outcomes (Mueser et al., 1998), but receive little
guidance about preferred antipsychotic treatment in this
population. Several small-scale studies suggest second
generation antipsychotics may reduce illicit substance
use (Buckley, 1999; Drake et al., 2000; Green et al.,
1999; Green, 2005; Littrell et al., 2001; Petrakis et al.,
2006; Smelson et al., 2002; Tsuang et al., 2002), but
there are no large representative community-based
trials comparing treatment outcomes among users and
non-users.
This study employs data from the NIMH Clinical
Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness
(CATIE) project to compare the effects of olanzapine,
perphenazine, quetiapine, risperidone and ziprasidone
among users and non-users on time to treatment discontinuation (Davis et al., 2003; Keefe et al., 2003, 2006,
2007; Lieberman et al., 2005; McEvoy et al., 2006;
Rosenheck et al., 2006; Stroup et al., 2003, 2006; Swartz
et al., 2003). Reports on the outcomes from CATIE to
date, have found that patients in the initial randomization
(Phase 1) on olanzapine had longer time to treatment
discontinuation than some of the other drugs, but had
greater side effect burden related to weight gain and
related metabolic sequelae (Lieberman et al., 2005).
None of the other three second generation drugs showed
greater efficacy or tolerability than the first generation
drug, perphenazine. All of the antipsychotic treatment
groups had small but significant improvements in neurocognition and psychosocial functioning, but there was
no difference among them (Keefe et al., 2007; Swartz
et al., 2007).
The primary objective of the current study was to
examine the effect of illicit substance use on time to
treatment discontinuation across treatment groups.
Secondary objectives included examining subcategories
of treatment discontinuation and psychopathology
measures.
2. Experimental design and methods
2.1. Study design and measures
The CATIE study was initiated by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) to determine the comparative effectiveness of antipsychotic drugs. Its rationale, design and methods were previously described
(Davis et al., 2003; Keefe et al., 2003; Stroup et al.,
2003; Swartz et al., 2003) and treatment effects on discontinuation rates and symptoms have been reported
(Lieberman et al., 2005; McEvoy et al., 2006; Stroup
et al., 2006). The study was conducted between 1/01 and
12/04 at 57 U.S. clinical sites (16 university clinics, 10
state mental health agencies, 7 Veteran's Affairs Medical Centers, 6 private non-profit agencies, 4 private
practice sites, and 14 mixed system sites). Patients were
randomized to receive olanzapine, perphenazine, quetiapine, risperidone, or ziprasidone under double-blind
conditions and followed for up to 18 months or until
treatment was discontinued for any reason (Phase I).
Patients whose assigned treatment was discontinued
could receive other treatments in Phases Ib, II and III
(McEvoy et al., 2006; Stroup et al., 2003, 2006).
2.2. Participants
Eligible patients were 18 to 65 years of age; had
received a diagnosis of schizophrenia, as determined on
the basis of the Structured Clinical Interview of the
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,
fourth edition (First et al., 1996); and were able to take
40 M.S. Swartz et al. / Schizophrenia Research 100 (2008) 39–52
oral antipsychotic medication as determined by the
study doctor. Patients were excluded if they had diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder, mental retardation or
other cognitive disorders; had a history of serious adverse reactions to the proposed treatments; had had only
one schizophrenic episode; had a history of treatment
resistance, defined by persistence of severe symptoms
despite adequate trials of one of the proposed treatments
or prior treatment with clozapine; were pregnant or were
breast-feeding; or had a serious and unstable medical
condition.
The study was approved by the institutional review
board at each site, and written informed consent was
obtained from the patients or their legal guardians.
2.3. Interventions
Identical-appearing capsules contained olanzapine
(Zyprexa, Eli Lilly) (7.5 mg), quetiapine (Seroquel,
AstraZeneca) (200 mg), risperidone (Risperdal, Janssen
Pharmaceutica) (1.5 mg), or perphenazine (Trilafon,
Schering-Plough) (8 mg) or (after January 2002) ziprasidone (Geodon, Pfizer) (40 mg). Patients with current
tardive dyskinesia (TD) could enroll but a stratified
randomization scheme prevented their assignment to
treatment with perphenazine. The dose of the medications was flexible, ranging from one to four capsules
daily, based upon the study doctor's judgment. Concomitant medications were permitted throughout the trial,
except for additional antipsychotic agents. Patients had
monthly visits with study doctors.
2.4. Objectives and outcomes
Preliminary inspection of time to discontinuation for
any reason indicated that the time to discontinuation was
foreshortened among patients using illicit substances and
that the previously reported advantage of olanzapine on
this measure (Lieberman et al., 2005) was attenuated
among patients using illicit substances. In addition, relatively few patients were alcohol abusers only without
using illicit substances. Patients who used or abused
alcohol in many ways were more similar to non-substance users. On that basis, we sought to examine the
effects of illicit substance use, excluding those solely
using or abusing alcohol, on time to discontinuation
across treatment groups. Secondary outcomes included
three subcategories of time to discontinuation: discontinuation for inadequate therapeutic effects, intolerable
side effects, or patient decision, as well as psychopathology outcomes assessed on the Positive and Negative
Syndrome Scale (PANSS) (Kay et al., 1987), the clinical
global impression of severity (CGI-S) (Guy, 1976) and
episodes of hospitalization.
Illicit drug use (including use or abuse/dependence)
was assessed using multiple sources of information collected at the baseline visit and coded into two categories:
1) non-users — subjects with no evidence of any current
illicit drug use and 2) current illicit drug use (with or
without serious impairment). A small group of patients
who used only alcohol with no evidence of illicit substance use were included as illicit substance non-users.
Several measures were combined to make these determinations: diagnostic assessment using the SCID (First
et al., 1996); positive hair assay (RIAH) or positive
urine screen for illicit drug use, self-reported drug use,
clinician ratings of use on the initial screening inventory,
clinician rating from the Alcohol or Drug Use Scale
(Drake et al., 1990), and family report of a problem with
alcohol or illicit drugs (Swartz et al., 2006a,b). The most
common illicit drug used was marijuana, followed by
cocaine and opiates. Polysubstance use was common.
Additional measures include depressive symptoms
(Addington et al., 1992) and insight or awareness of
illness (McEvoy et al., 1989). Compliance with medication was computed by pill as the percent of the prescribed study drug taken at each visit; missing counts
were imputed by averaging the lowest previous ratings.
2.5. Statistical methods
The study sample included the intent-to-treat population of randomized patients who received at least one
dose of study medication (N= 1432). Analyses were
conducted as previously described (Lieberman et al.,
2005). Median time to discontinuation was estimated
using Kaplan–Meier survival curves: Treatment group
comparisons for time to discontinuation were carried out
using Cox regression adjusting for baseline clinical
exacerbation status, TD (where applicable) and treatment site. Sites with fewer than 15 respondents were
combined according to the type health care system they
represented. Due to the stratified study design, treatments were compared in a four-tiered approach, as follows: Two hundred thirty-one patients with tardive
dyskinesia were excluded from random assignment to
perphenzine, and ziprasidone was added after approximately 40% of the sample had been enrolled. Therefore,
comparisons involving perphenazine were restricted to
patients without TD, while ziprasidone comparisons
were restricted to subjects enrolled after the addition of
ziprasidone to the study. In the primary analysis step,
comparisons among olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone,
and perphenazine were evaluated for non-TD patients
M.S. Swartz et al. / Schizophrenia Research 100 (2008) 39–52 41
using a 3 degree of freedom (df) test. Following a significant result, pair-wise comparisons among the three
atypicals in an analysis which included TD patients
were evaluated using closed (step-down) testing requiring a significance level of 0.05 or less. Pair-wise comparisons of each of the three atypicals against perphenzine were evaluated using a Hochberg adjustment for
multiple comparisons. Ziprasidone was separately compared with the three atypicals and with perphenzine
(with TD patients excluded) in a series of pair-wise
comparisons, again using Hochberg adjustments (Hochberg, 1988) in analyses of patients enrolled after ziprasidone was added. To further explore the results of the
primary analyses, a number of non-tiered exploratory
analyses were restricted to bivariate comparisons contrasting olanzapine and the four remaining treatment
groups controlling for a diagnosis of tardive dyskinesia
(TD) and post-ziprasidone randomization.
The effect of illicit substance use was tested for its
association with time to discontinuation as a main effect,
and for its interaction with the treatment groups. For the
latter we investigated possible interactions between
illicit substance use and the antipsychotic treatment
groups using both a standard interaction model crossing
treatment group with illicit status and a stratified approach based on two subgroups divided on the basis of
use or non-use of illicit substances. The stratification
approach avoided difficult to interpret multivariable
interaction models.
Change from baseline in PANSS and CGI status at
end of phase visit were analyzed using analysis of
covariance (ANCOVA) procedure using cross-sectional
regression analyses for all intent-to-treat patients controlling for time-at-risk (duration of phase 1 treatment),
baseline history of clinical exacerbation in the previous
3 months, baseline level of the outcome measure, a
diagnosis of TD, and post-ziprasidone randomization.
An interaction term crossing treatment group (olanzapine versus other antipsychotic medications) with use of
illicit substances was estimated to test for a possible
differential effect of illicit substance use on clinical improvement among subjects randomized to olanzapine.
3. Results
3.1. Patient characteristics and dispositions
For the current study 1432 patients were available for
analysis. The baseline sociodemographic and clinical
characteristics of the illicit drug user (N= 643) and nonuser (N= 789) samples in are shown in Table 1 and demonstrate significant differences on a number of demographic and clinical factors. Patients using illicit drugs
were younger, more likely to be male and non-white
(primarily African-American), had lower levels of education, and were more than twice as likely to have experienced a recent episode of homelessness. Among the
illicit user group there were a few differences between
illicit users and abusers: abusers were somewhat younger, more likely to be male, had slightly higher PANSS
positive symptom scores, but there were no significant
differences in compliance ratings or racial composition.
Clinical histories reflected significantly less time in
treatment among substance-using subjects, consistent
with lower mean age, significantly more childhood
antisocial symptoms, and slightly higher odds of having
been diagnosed with major depression within the prior
5 years.
Baseline clinical status also indicated significantly
more depressive symptoms as measured by the Calgary
Depression Rating Scale (Addington et al., 1992) and a
significantly greater proportion had a recent clinical
exacerbation. The two groups did not differ on the
PANSS total scale score, general psychopathology scale,
or negative symptom scale, but substance-using patients
did exhibit significantly higher PANSS positive symptoms scores.
3.2. Treatment discontinuation
When examined as a main effect in Cox regression
models, illicit substance use was not a significant predictor of time to discontinuation (χ2
1= 0.578; p=
0.447), however, when an interaction term was added
for treatment group and illicit use, they jointly predicted
time to discontinuation (χ2
3= 10.762; p= 0.013). Visual
inspection of median time to discontinuation suggested
a stratified approach comparing illicit substance users
versus non-users across treatment groups would be more
interpretable and informative.
Fig. 1 depicts Kaplan–Meier survival curves for
treatment groups stratified by illicit substance non-use
versus use and demonstrates differences in time to discontinuation among non-users but little differences
among non-users. As seen in Tables 2A and B from the
stratified analyses, among non-users discontinuation rate
was lower and time to all-cause discontinuation was
significantly longer for olanzapine (discontinuation rate
56%, median time 13.02 months) compared to quetiapine
(discontinuation rate 81%, median time 5.02 months),
risperidone (discontinuation rate 69%, median time
5.57 months), perphenazine (discontinuation rate 74%,
median time 5.89 months) but not ziprasidone (discontinuation rate 77%, median time 4.34 months). Among
42 M.S. Swartz et al. / Schizophrenia Research 100 (2008) 39–52
non-users there were significant differences in odds of
discontinuation between olanzapine and quetiapine
(hazard ratio (HR = 0.52, CI 0.40, 0.67, pb0.001), risperidone (HR = 0.70, CI 0.53, 0.92, p= 0.01) and perphenazine (HR = 0.59, CI 0.56, 1.08, p=b0.001), but
not ziprasidone (HR = 0.78, CI 0.56, 1.08, p= 0.13).
Odds of discontinuation were also significantly higher
for subjects randomized to quetiapine relative to risperidone (HR = 1.35; CI 1.05, 1.73, p= 0.021). Rates of
medication compliance were higher for non-users, but
were not different across treatment groups.
However, among illicit substance users, discontinuation rate and time to all-cause discontinuation were
not different for olanzapine (discontinuation rate 74%,
median time 6.75 months) compared to quetiapine
(discontinuation rate 82% median time 4.36 months),
risperidone (discontinuation rate 79% median time
4.61 months), perphenazine (discontinuation rate 75%,
median time 5.25 months), and ziprasidone (discontinuation rate 82%, median time 3.29 months). Hazard
rates for olanzapine relative to the other four
antipsychotics drugs were: quetiapine (HR = 0.90, CI
0.67, 1.20, p= 0.47); risperidone (HR = 0.93, CI 0.70,
1.24, p= 0.63); perphenazine (HR = 1.16, CI 0.84,
1.60, p= 0.36); and ziprasidone (HR = 0.75, CI 0.53,
1.07, p= 0.11). The contrast between quetiapine and

risperidone also was not significant (HR = 1.04, CI
0.78, 1.37, p= 0.79).
In order to descriptively evaluate the odds of discontinuation due to inefficacy, tolerability or patient decision, odds of discontinuation for the olanzapine
treatment group versus the remaining combined treatment groups were evaluated. Among non-users of illicit
substances treated with olanzapine, hazard ratios were
significantly reduced for discontinuation due to inefficacy (HR 0.34, CI 0.22, 0.53, pb0.0001), and patient
decision (HR 0.54, CI 0.37, 0.78, pb0.001), but not for
intolerability (HR 1.17, CI 0.79, 1.73, p= 0.439).
Among users of illicit substances, the hazard ratio for
discontinuation due to inefficacy, although almost twice
the rate for non-users, was nonetheless, significantly
reduced (HR 0.60, CI 0.39, 0.94, pb0.0252). Hazard
ratios for discontinuation due to intolerability and
patient decision did not differ significantly by treatment
group among users.
Differences in discontinuation rates for olanzapine
versus other treatment groups combined are contrasted
graphically among substance non-users and users in
Fig. 2. Lower all-cause discontinuation rates are
evident for olanzapine in the non-user group. In
addition it appears that patient decision to discontinue
treatment is higher among all substance use treatment
groups and may also account for much of the increase
in discontinuation rates among olanzapine substance
users compared to non-users.
3.3. PANSS and CGI efficacy measures
In order to evaluate whether differences in time to
discontinuation were mirrored by PANSS and CGI
efficacy measures, Table 3 presents estimated changes in
PANSS (and its subscales) and CGI ratings from baseline
to the end of Phase 1, adjusted to duration of Phase 1
treatment. Many studies consider a 20% reduction in
PANSS total score to be clinically meaningful. The total
PANSS score decreased modestly (approximately 7
units, or roughly 10%), from baseline to the end of Phase
1 for subjects randomized to olanzapine relative to the
other treatment groups (generally a 0–3 unit decrease).
Overall there were no differences between olanzapine
substance users and non-users or between other treatment groups comparing substance users and non-user
subgroups for duration-adjusted change from baseline.
In particular, an ANCOVA test of interactions between
treatment group and illicit substance use was not significant (data not shown). Similarly olanzapine illicit use
and non-use treatment groups made greater improvements relative to other user and non-user treatment
groups on PANSS subscales. CGI severity measurements decreased significantly from baseline to the end of
Phase 1 among subjects randomized to olanzapine relative to other treatment groups, but as above, the decrease
was not affected by illicit substance use (see Table 3).
Together these findings suggest that psychopathology measures improved more for olanzapine treatment

groups, but comparably for substance users and nonusers, and that treatment discontinuation may have not
been related to clinician-rated efficacy measures but
rather factors such as patient decision to discontinue
treatment.
3.4. Adverse events
In order to evaluate whether side effects and adverse
events might account for differences in rates of treatment discontinuation among substance users and nonusers within treatment groups, we examined these reports across treatment groups contrasting any moderate
or severe adverse events during treatment (data not
shown). We compared treatment groups according to the
presence or absence of substance use, using Poisson
regression procedures. Patients with illicit substance use
with few exceptions reported more side effects, but these
increases did not significantly differ across treatment
groups. In addition, neurological symptoms were not
significantly affected by either illicit use, treatment
group or by their interaction.
Illicit substance use had no effect on several
measures of weight gain, but as expected from
previous reports olanzapine-treated subjects–whether
using substances or not–had greater weight gain;
including 28.8–31.5% of olanzapine-treated patients
gaining greater than 7% of body weight or 6–7 lb
during treatment (Lieberman et al., 2005; Stroup et al.,
2006).
Two hundred thirty subjects experienced at least one
psychiatric hospitalization during Phase 1. Illicit substance users were more likely to be hospitalized (19.3%
versus 13.4%, χ2= 8.99; p= 0.003) differences did not
vary significantly across treatment groups and, as previously reported, olanzapine illicit substance users and
non-users reported fewer hospitalizations (11% versus
15–20%) (Lieberman et al., 2005).

3.5. Potential mediating factors
As previously seen in Table 1, several sociodemographic and clinical characteristics distinguished illicit
substance users from non-users and these differences
could account for differences in time to discontinuation
among patients randomized to olanzapine or other treatment groups. There were no differences in the distribution of illicit substance users across treatment groups
that might account for the larger differences in treatment
discontinuation between olanzapine and other treatment
groups across the substance use and non-use groups. To
test the possibility that other sociodemographic or clinical factors might account for differences in discontinuation rates across illicit substance user and non-user
groups, a series of multivariable interaction models were

estimated to evaluate possible confounding and/or mediating effects of these sociodemographic or clinical
factors. Time to discontinuation for all patients was regressed using Cox regression models examining the interaction between treatment groups and illicit substance
use; controlling for clinical exacerbation and TD at
baseline and ziprasidone cohort. Subjects randomized to
olanzapine and using illicit substances were 1.40 times
more likely to discontinue (HR = 1.400; 95%CI: 1.054–
1.859; χ1
2= 5.0402; p= 0.0201) relative to olanzapinetreated non-users. Each potential sociodemographic or
clinical mediator was then tested for its putative mediating effect on the olanzapine/illicit substance use interaction. Attenuation of the significance of the olanzapine/
substance use interaction term – a possible indicator of
mediation – occurred only after the addition medication
compliance ratings (HR = 1.154; 95% CI: 0.86–1.55;
χ1
2= 0.9064; p= 0.3411). The interaction was not substantively affected by the addition of any other covariate.
4. Discussion
Clinicians often need to attempt to optimize choice of
an antipsychotic for a patient with a history of illicit
substance use. Previous CATIE Phase 1 reports demonstrated that olanzapine had a longer time to all-cause
treatment discontinuation than quetiapine or risperidone, but not perphenazine or ziprasidone. It has not
been clear whether illicit drug use might affect these
discontinuation rates and the current study offers
evidence of a substantial effect. Somewhat surprisingly
among illicit substance users there are no differences in
time to all-cause discontinuation across treatment
groups. Olanzapine, followed by perphenazine has the
longest TTD (median of 6.7 and 5.3 months respectively) but neither is significantly longer than others
(quetiapine 4.4, risperidone 4.6, and ziprasidone
3.3 months). Among non-users, olanzapine's superiority in time to discontinuation is strengthened substantially and significantly for all but ziprasidone (olanzapine median 13.0 versus perphenazine 5.9, risperidone
5.6, quetiapine 5.0 and ziprasidone 4.3 months respectively). The difference in medians between non-users
and illicit drug users in the olanzapine group is
6.3 months, while for other treatment groups the difference is a month or less. In results not shown we omitted
illicit users without abuse and restricted the comparisons
to illicit substance abusers versus non-users and the
results were essentially unchanged.
Results from PANSS and CGI efficacy measures adjusting for duration of treatment show that patients were
making comparable gains whether they used illicit
substances or not, suggesting that illicit substance-using
patients were generally improving comparably to their
non-using counterparts, but were less treatment adherent
and discontinued treatment for idiosyncratic reasons.
For example, among olanzapine illicit substance users
versus non-users patient decision was a predominant
cause of discontinuation among users compared to nonusers. These were patients who were rated to have discontinued treatment for idiosyncratic reasons unrelated
to inefficacy or side effects in the opinion of the clinician, and these decisions may have also been related to
the lower medication compliance seen in this group.
This is also consistent with multivariable analyses that
suggested that compliance at least partially mediated
differences between illicit substance use and non-users
in time to discontinuation for olanzapine. In addition, as
a group substance users reported more side effects but
this was not reflected in causes of discontinuation related to intolerability. As expected, olanzapine substance users and non-users experienced more weight
gain than other treatment groups—suggesting that increased time to discontinuation with olanzapine still
came at the cost of weight gain and was the lead cause of
treatment discontinuation among the olanzapine treatment group overall (Lieberman et al., 2005).
Why did illicit substance use attenuate the apparent
superiority of olanzapine over the other treatments? Our
analyses suggest that illicit drug users differ at baseline in
many ways from non-users that may directly and indirectly affect treatment discontinuation: users were
sicker at baseline, had less illness course stability, lived
in more stressful social environments and during the
course of the study were less treatment adherent. Lower
treatment adherence appears to explain a significant
proportion of the shorter time to discontinuation among
illicit drug users, but these other characteristics no doubt
contributed to shorter time to discontinuation. It could
well be that these other attributes of users (living in
stressful neighborhoods, interacting in criminogenic
social networks, or other stressors) could also attenuate
the benefits of medications. Alcohol use and abuse in
the absence of illicit substance use had little effect on
time to discontinuation, likely because these patients in
the aggregate were older, more stable and more treatment compliant. Taken as a whole these results underscore the need for concurrent substance abuse treatment in order for patients to benefit from antipsychotic
treatment.
The differential impact of illicit use and non-use
across treatment groups is more puzzling; intuitively, we
expected to find uniform decreases in time to discontinuation among users compared to non-users, but the
M.S. Swartz et al. / Schizophrenia Research 100 (2008) 39–52 49
relative attenuation in time to discontinuation for olanzapine in users is far more substantial than for other
treatments. An imbalance in illicit drug users across
treatment groups could have been a partial explanation,
but, in analyses not shown, users were evenly distributed across treatment groups. It is reasonable to conclude that among non-users, olanzapine achieves a more
acceptable patient outcome for a longer period of time,
as judged by time to all-cause discontinuation than the
comparators at the dose ranges studied, but that illicit
substance use, including non-compliance attenuated
these differences. These results also suggest that the
many clinical trials that exclude substance users may
offer an incomplete picture of clinical effectiveness in
real world populations.
There are several limitations to these findings. We
did not quantify levels of illicit substance use at baseline
or follow-up so cannot assess the impact of levels of use.
Nor do we account for involvement in substance abuse
treatment over time, although too few patients in the trial
were actively engaged in substance abuse treatment for
this to have affected the results. It is also possible that
these outcomes were not directly attributable to illicit
substance use because substance use could serve as a
proxy for a host of negative predictors of clinical course
and outcome. A more definitive study of the effect of
substance use on treatment outcomes would require a
well powered randomized trial. Additional analyses
examining whether any of the CATIE medications
reduce substance use over time is forthcoming.
