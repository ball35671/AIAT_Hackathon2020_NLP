Individuals with severe mental illnesses such as schizophrenia,
bipolar disorder and major depression are more likely to
experience trauma over their lifetime than people in the general
population.1,2 This trauma exposure has been linked to a wide
range of negative outcomes, including more severe symptoms
and distress, more impaired functioning and higher utilisation
of acute care services.3,4 The high rate of trauma, and its
associated clinical correlates, has drawn attention to the need
for treatments to reduce the consequences of trauma in this
population. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a common
consequence of trauma exposure. Surveys indicate elevated rates
of PTSD in people with severe mental illness, with most studies
reporting current rates between 25 and 48%.1 These rates are
clearly higher than the average estimated prevalence of 3.5% for
past year PTSD in the general population.5 Effective interventions
have been established for PTSD in the general population, with
most research focusing on individuals exposed to specific types
of trauma (for example combat, sexual assault) or to the broader
range of traumatic events in community samples (such as
accidents).6 Less attention has been paid to tailoring treatments
to meet the unique needs of people with severe mental illness
and PTSD, such as high sensitivity to stress, psychotic symptoms
and cognitive limitations. As noted by Spinazzola et al,
7 ‘true
advancement of the field will require a deliberate process of
evaluation and adaptation of efficacious treatments with less
restricted, more clinically representative PTSD samples’. To
address this need, we developed an individual 12- to 16-session
cognitive–behavioural therapy (CBT) programme for PTSD in
people with severe mental illness, with simplified educational
and worksheet materials to facilitate learning in people with
cognitive and other challenges, and clinical guidelines to
accommodate a wide range of clinical symptoms (such as
psychosis, severe depression).8 The first three sessions of the
CBT programme involve teaching breathing retraining as a skill
for reducing anxiety, and education about PTSD – both common
components of PTSD treatment programmes in the general
population.9 The remaining 8–12 sessions focus on cognitive
restructuring (i.e. identifying, evaluating and changing inaccurate
and distressing thoughts, including trauma-related beliefs). We
chose to focus on cognitive restructuring as the main active
ingredient for the programme on the basis of research in the
general population showing that cognitive restructuring and
prolonged exposure therapy are of comparable efficacy with each
other and are more effective than other approaches,10–12 clinical
experience using cognitive restructuring in the treatment of severe
mental illness (such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, borderline
personality disorder),13–16 and because we anticipated it would be
more acceptable to patients and less stressful than exposure
therapy.
The feasibility and clinical benefits of the CBT for PTSD
programme have been supported in two open clinical pilot studies
and one randomised controlled trial (RCT) in participants with
severe mental illness. The open pilot studies were conducted in
rural New England, USA17 and in an urban region of the state
of New Jersey, USA,18 and showed high retention in treatment
and improvement in PTSD and other symptoms over time, which
were sustained at 3 months. The controlled trial compared the
CBT programme with usual services in participants receiving
comprehensive mental health treatment at four centres in rural
New England.19 Participants who received the CBT programme

Background
A cognitive–behavioural therapy (CBT) programme designed
for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in people with
severe mental illness, including breathing retraining,
education and cognitive restructuring, was shown to be
more effective than usual services.
Aims
To evaluate the incremental benefit of adding cognitive
restructuring to the breathing retraining and education
components of the CBT programme (trial registration:
clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT00494650).
Method
In all, 201 people with severe mental illness and PTSD
were randomised to 12- to 16-session CBT or a 3-session
brief treatment programme (breathing retraining and
education). The primary outcome was PTSD symptom
severity.
Secondary outcomes were PTSD diagnosis, other symptoms,
functioning and quality of life.
Results
There was greater improvement in PTSD symptoms and
functioning in the CBT group than in the brief treatment
group, with both groups improving on other outcomes and
effects maintained 1-year post-treatment.
Conclusions
Cognitive restructuring has a significant impact beyond
breathing retraining and education in the CBT programme,
reducing PTSD symptoms and improving functioning in
people with severe mental illness.

improved significantly more in PTSD symptoms, diagnosis and
knowledge, and in other symptoms than those who received
usual services, with benefits maintained 3- and 6-months posttreatment. These positive findings raise questions about which
specific components of the CBT programme are most critical to
changes in PTSD: education, breathing retraining or cognitive
restructuring. Our dismantling design was based on principles
explicated by such methodologists as Plante20 and Wampold.21
This approach to dismantling is used to evaluate the contribution
of specific elements of complex treatment programmes by
comparing variants of the programme that include or exclude
critical parts. Such research designs may or may not compare
different programme variants that are matched for duration
and intensity. Thus, not all dismantling research controls for
non-specific factors such as therapeutic alliance and expectation.
It may be useful, in many instances, to evaluate the utility of
adding one component in a complex intervention to other
components. Dismantling research that retains the integrity of
the original treatment components (including duration) can
have important implications for service delivery as it may lead
to the development of more efficient treatments by identifying
unnecessary components that do not contribute to improved
outcomes. In this study, we evaluated the effect of adding
cognitive restructuring to the CBT programme by comparing
the full 12- to 16-session programme to a brief, 3-session variant
containing only breathing retraining and education. This study
also addressed several other questions raised by previous research,
including: can the CBT programme be successfully implemented
by frontline (for example MA-level) clinicians, rather than by
academically trained PhD therapists as in the previous studies;
is the CBT programme effective when provided in urban settings
serving more diverse minority ethnic groups; beyond PTSD
symptoms, does the programme improve functioning and quality
of life?
Method
A RCT was conducted comparing the full 12- to 16-week CBT for
PTSD programme with a brief 3-session programme (including
only breathing retraining and education) in a treatment system
serving people with severe mental illness operated by the Rutgers
University Behavioral Health Care (RUBHC). The study took
place at five RUBHC sites in Northern and Central New Jersey,
including three partial hospital programmes and two out-patient
programmes. All study procedures were approved by the Rutgers
and Dartmouth Institutional Review Boards (trial registration:
clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT00494650).
Study participants
Inclusion criteria for study participants were:
(a) meets State of New Jersey definition of ‘severe mental illness’,
including: (i) DSM-IV diagnosis;22 (ii) significant functional
limitations in major life activities within the past 3–6
months because of the mental disorder; and (iii) during the
past 2 years, either two or more treatment episodes of
greater intensity than could be treated with out-patient
services or a single episode lasting 3 months or more, or
disruption in normal living situation to the point that
supportive services were required to maintain the patient in
that living situation or law enforcement officials intervened;
(b) diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, major
depression or bipolar disorder, based on the Structured
Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis-I Disorders (SCID);23
(c) diagnosis of severe PTSD, based on the Clinician Administered
PTSD Scale (CAPS) – schizophrenia version,24 with a
minimum CAPS total score of 65;25
(d) interested in receiving treatment for PTSD.
Individuals with borderline personality disorder were included
if they met the other study criteria. Exclusion criteria were: (a)
hospital admission or suicide attempt in the past 3 months and
(b) substance dependence within the past 3 months. A total of
201 participants provided informed consent, completed baseline
assessments, and were randomised to the CBT programme (CBT
group, n= 104) or the brief treatment programme (brief
group, n= 97). The CONSORT diagram illustrates the flow of
participants through the study (Fig. 1). The characteristics of
the two study groups are summarised in Table 1 (for a version that
also includes treatment site see online Table DS1).
Measures
Evaluations included clinical interviews and self-report measures.
Except as noted, assessments were conducted at baseline, posttreatment, and 6- and 12-months post-treatment. Assessments
evaluated PTSD and other psychiatric diagnoses and symptoms,
knowledge of PTSD, trauma-related cognitions, quality of life
and psychosocial functioning.
Screening
Potentially eligible patients were identified by administering selfreport screening instruments at each site, including a 16-item
abbreviated version of the Traumatic Life Events Questionnaire,26
followed by the PTSD Checklist (PCL) based on the most
upsetting traumatic event, with a total score of 545 on the PCL
used to indicate probable PTSD.27
Interview-based assessments
PTSD symptom severity, the primary study outcome, and PTSD
diagnosis were assessed with the CAPS (Schizophrenia Version).24
Other Axis I psychiatric diagnoses were evaluated at baseline only
with the SCID-I.23 Borderline personality disorder diagnosis was
assessed with the SCID-II.28 Psychiatric symptoms were assessed
with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS).29 The
Brief Quality of Life Interview (QOLI) was used to assess
subjective quality of life across different life domains.30 Overall
functioning was evaluated with the Global Assessment of
Functioning (GAF) scale.31
Self-report measures
Understanding of PTSD was assessed with the PTSD Knowledge
Test, which contains 15 multiple choice questions about PTSD
and has been previously shown to be sensitive to the effects of
education about trauma and PTSD in people with severe mental
illness.32 The Posttraumatic Cognitions Inventory (PTCI ) was
used to evaluate common negative beliefs about oneself, other
people and the world that are often related to traumatic
experiences.33 Depression and anxiety severity were evaluated with
the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II)34 and the Beck Anxiety
Inventory (BAI).35
Treatment programmes
All study participants continued to receive their usual psychiatric
services following randomisation to either the CBT or the brief
treatment programme.8,36 In the first session of each intervention,
the clinician provided a 15 min overview of the treatment
2
Mueser et al
Cognitive restructuring for post-traumatic stress disorder
programme, including the rationale for each topic and
expectations for participation (for example home assignments to
practise skills), followed by teaching breathing retraining and
beginning education. As this session reviewed critical information
about the programme to which the client had been assigned
and initiated teaching, treatment engagement was defined as
completion of at least one session of either programme.
CBT programme
This programme is based on cognitive models of PTSD that posit
that a key dimension of the disorder is the cognitive distortions
that result from the trauma exposure and subsequent attempts
to cope with associated negative affect. These distortions typically
include an elevated sense of danger and excessively negative
appraisals of traumatic events or their consequences for oneself,
other people or the world in general, which pose difficulties to
integrating the experience into one’s daily life and personal
narrative.37,38 The CBT programme is an individual intervention8,19 that includes 3 sessions teaching breathing retraining
for anxiety and education about trauma and PTSD, followed by
9–13 sessions of cognitive restructuring. Teaching methods and
materials (handouts, worksheets) are specially adapted to
accommodate the unique challenges of people with severe mental
illness, such as psychotic symptoms, cognitive impairment and
higher levels of stress vulnerability. Cognitive restructuring is
taught as a self-management skill for dealing with negative feelings
through the articulation of specific thoughts that underlie the
distressing feeling, and the objective evaluation of evidence
supporting those thoughts. Patients are taught how to modify
inaccurate thoughts that are not supported by the evidence (for
example ‘I am responsible for my sexual abuse’), and how to
develop ‘action plans’ to address situations in which distressing
thoughts are deemed to be accurate (for example ‘My new
boyfriend is becoming abusive and I am at risk of getting hurt’).
People initially learn cognitive restructuring to cope with any
distressing feelings, and as their skills develop they shift to
addressing trauma-related thoughts and beliefs that underlie
PTSD symptoms. Home assignments to practise breathing
retraining and cognitive restructuring skills are collaboratively
set each session. Trauma work is integrated into comprehensive
treatment by the therapist being a member of the individual’s
treatment team and through involvement of the case manager
or primary clinician in at least one CBT session. Treatment
exposure was a priori defined as completion of at least six
sessions.19
Brief treatment programme
This three-session programme was designed to provide the same
breathing retraining and educational components as the CBT
programme, but without the cognitive restructuring. It was
adapted from a programme we previously developed to educate
persons with severe mental illness about PTSD.32 In addition to

using the same handouts and worksheets on anxiety management
and PTSD as in the CBT programme, the brief programme uses a
video to initiate discussion between the patient and therapist
about the causes and nature of PTSD. Treatment exposure was
defined a priori as completion of at least two sessions.
Standard treatment
All study participants continued to receive pharmacological
treatment and case management, and had access to the range of
available services at their treatment setting. No interventions
specifically targeting PTSD were provided as a part of standard
treatment at any of the study sites. Patients in the partial hospital
programmes participated in a variety of education, skills or topic
groups. Participants in the out-patient programmes had access to
individual psychotherapy, vocational rehabilitation and limited
group therapy.
Clinician training and treatment adherence
monitoring
Both PTSD treatment programmes were provided by frontline
clinicians who were already employed by RUBHC. Prior to
treating study participants, 25 clinicians (95% MA-level, with
approximately 10 years (s.d. = 7.14) therapy – although not
necessarily CBT – experience) received training in the CBT
programme. This included a 2-day live training, followed by
weekly group supervision and treating one or two practise patients
with timely (for example weekly) feedback using a standardised
17-item, five-point (ranging from 1, poor to 5, excellent)
adherence measure based on review of audio-recorded sessions.
‘Certification’ in the CBT programme was defined as meeting a
pre-specified level of competence in sessions 4–16, which focus
on cognitive restructuring. Two clinicians dropped out of the
training, 21 clinicians were certified after completing one practise
case, and two clinicians were certified after completing a second
practise case. Further details about the training protocol are
provided elsewhere.39
Clinicians at each site met for weekly group supervision for
both programmes over the course of the study, and were joined
regularly by a study team expert consultant by phone. Following
the certification of clinicians, adherence ratings were conducted
on 5–10% of all sessions, which were provided to clinicians and
their supervisors for review and discussion.
Procedures
Recruitment
Following administration of the trauma and PTSD screening
instruments at the five clinic sites, patients were given information
about the PTSD study and they indicated whether they would be
interested in being contacted by the research team if they met
preliminary eligibility criteria for the study. Potentially eligible
and interested patients were contacted by a team member, who
described the study and obtained informed consent. The baseline

Cognitive restructuring for post-traumatic stress disorder
assessment was then conducted to confirm eligibility, with
individuals meeting all criteria randomised to either the CBT
or brief programme following completion of the interview.
Participants were paid for completing baseline assessments,
regardless of whether they enrolled in the study.
Randomisation and follow-up assessments
Participants were randomised to the CBT or brief groups via a
computer program operated by an off-site data manager, with no
study personnel aware of assignments in advance. Randomisation
was stratified by site (five sites) and primary diagnosis (three
categories: schizophrenia–schizoaffective without borderline personality disorder; major mood disorder without borderline personality
disorder; schizophrenia–schizoaffective or major mood disorder,
with borderline personality disorder). Within sites, assignment of
patients to clinicians was balanced so that each clinician treated
approximately equal numbers of participants in each intervention.
In order to avoid confounding the treatment programme
(CBT or brief) with the duration of time elapsed between the
baseline and subsequent assessments, the follow-up assessment
dates for the participants in the brief group were yoked to the
dates for the post-treatment and follow-up assessments of those
in the CBT group. All interviewers were masked to treatment
assignment. Participants were paid for completing assessments.
Statistical analyses
Based on our prior study comparing CBT with usual services,17 we
estimated power to detect a group (CBT v. brief) effect size on the
CAPS total score (the primary study outcome) of d = 0.45, with
three post-baseline assessments, and assuming a 20% attrition
rate, 0.5 subject correlation and a = 0.05. With 100 participants
per group, the power to detect an effect size d50.45 on the CAPS
total was 0.89. This level of power was deemed sufficient to justify
the intended sample size of n = 200.
Demographic and clinical differences at baseline between the
two programmes were evaluated using w2 analyses or t-tests.
Intent-to-treat analyses were conducted using covariance pattern
models within a general mixed-effects linear regression models
framework40 to evaluate the effect of treatment on the outcome
measures. For these models, baseline was included as a covariate,
and the post-treatment and 6- and 12-month follow-up assessments were the repeated dependent variables. Treatment group,
site and marital status were included as the independent variables,
as well as the group6time and group6site interactions. The
cross-time correlations were explicitly modelled (freely estimated)
using an unstructured variance–covariance matrix. Since baseline
scores were entered as covariates, the main effect of group tests
whether participants in the CBT group differed significantly from
those in brief group across the post-treatment assessments, the
main effect for time tests whether study participants in both
groups changed over the three post-treatment assessments and
the group6time interaction tests whether the two groups changed
differentially across the post-treatment assessments. Cohen’s d
effect sizes were calculated based on the average difference
between the two groups across all post-treatment assessments,
adjusting for baseline.41
Results
Comparisons of the two groups at baseline indicated one
significant difference: more participants in the CBT group had
married than in the brief group (Table 1). Follow-up assessments
were completed on 80% of the sample at post-treatment, 76% at 6
months, and 78% at 12 months, with 91% completing at least one
follow-up assessment. There were no differences between
treatment groups in rates of follow-up interviews.
Engagement and exposure to treatment programmes
Engagement in both programmes was high, with 88/97 (91%)
participants in the brief group and 92/104 (89%) participants in
the CBT group completing at least one session. Among engaged
participants, 83/88 (94%) were exposed to the brief programme
by completing at least two sessions, and 67/92 (73%) were exposed
to CBT by completing at least six sessions. There were no site
differences in rates of engagement for either programme, or rates
of exposure to the brief programme. However, there were site
differences in rates of exposure to the CBT programme
(w2 = 15.84, d.f. = 4, P= 0.003), with participants in the three
partial hospital programmes having higher rates of exposure
(68%, 85%, 100%) than participants in the two out-patient
programmes (47%, 49%).
Clinician adherence to treatment models
Adherence ratings were high for both treatments. The average
overall session quality item for 25 sessions rated for the brief
programme was 4.36 (s.d. = 0.70) and the average rating across
the 13-item scale was 4.34 (s.d. = 0.50), between ‘good’ and
‘excellent’. For CBT, the average overall session quality item
for 90 rated sessions was 3.84 (s.d. = 0.75) and the average
rating across the 17-item scale was 3.96 (s.d. = 0.64), between
‘satisfactory’ and ‘good’.
Intent-to-treat outcome analyses
The analyses of the primary outcome, PTSD symptom severity
(CAPS total), and other PTSD measures indicated significant
treatment group effects favouring the CBT over the brief
programme (see group effect, Table 2). Although participants in
both programmes improved from baseline to the post-treatment
and follow-up assessments on all PTSD measures, those in the
CBT group improved significantly more. There were also significant
time effects for the CAPS total and the CAPS re-experiencing and
avoidance subscales, but no group6time interactions, with
participants in both interventions improving from post-treatment
to the 6- and 12-month follow-ups (Table 2).
The analyses of the other outcomes indicated significant
group effects, with the CBT group improving more than the brief
group on overall functioning (GAF) and social functioning
(CAPS) but not the other variables (Table 3). However, there were
significant group6time interactions for social functioning and
post-traumatic cognitions (PTCI), with the CBT group improving
more than the brief group at post-treatment, and the brief
group catching up by 12-months post-treatment. There were also
significant time effects for depression (BDI-II) with both groups
improving from post-treatment to the follow-up assessments.
Participants in both interventions tended to improve from
baseline to the follow-up assessments on all of the secondary
outcomes.
Discussion
Main findings
Study participants with severe mental illness and PTSD who
received the full 12- to 16-week CBT programme, including
breathing retraining, education and cognitive restructuring,
experienced significantly greater reductions in PTSD symptoms
(which was the primary outcome for this study), higher rates of
remission of PTSD diagnosis and greater improvements in
5
Mueser et al
knowledge of PTSD than those who received the brief 3-session
programme (including only the breathing retraining and
education components). The magnitude of improvements in
PTSD for participants who received the CBT programme was
comparable with that in the first RCT,19 demonstrating that
the programme can be successfully implemented by frontline
clinicians in urban settings serving predominantly people
from minority ethnic backgrounds with severe mental illness,
with effects sustained for 1 year post-treatment. Furthermore,
participants who received the full CBT programme demonstrated
modestly greater improvements in overall functioning, and
improved more rapidly in social functioning, providing evidence

Cognitive restructuring for post-traumatic stress disorder
for additional benefits of the full programme beyond just the
symptom relief previously demonstrated. These findings replicate
and extend previous research on the CBT programme.19
Although participants in the full CBT programme improved
more than those in the brief programme in terms of PTSD
symptoms and overall functioning, the brief treatment
programme appeared to be clinically beneficial when compared
with the usual services condition in the first study.19 For example,
in the previous study, 90% of participants with severe PTSD
who received usual services still had PTSD at the post-treatment
assessment, and 88% had PTSD at 6 months,19 compared
with rates of 73% and 76% at the same assessment points
for participants in the present study who received the brief
treatment programme. Furthermore, participants in both groups
demonstrated comparable reductions in post-traumatic cognitions
and depression, which were similar to the improvements made
by the CBT group and greater than those in the usual services
group in the previous study.19
The greater impact of the CBT programme over the brief
treatment programme on PTSD symptom improvement and
functioning may reflect the impact of providing cognitive
restructuring in addition to breathing retraining and education,
although the role of non-specific treatment factors associated with
the longer programme cannot be ruled out. However, it should
also be noted that all study participants were receiving a range
of other treatments for their primary psychiatric disorder, with
three of the five sites being partial hospital programmes with
approximately 5 h per day of psychosocial programming. The
relative contribution of cognitive restructuring versus non-specific
treatment effects to the improved PTSD symptoms and functional
outcomes for the CBT programme cannot be determined by our
study design, but the relatively small number of additional hours
of treatment related to CBT (9–13 h more than in the brief
treatment programme) is modest in proportion to participants’
total treatment history. In general, published findings demonstrate
the beneficial effects of cognitive restructuring for the treatment of
PTSD.10–12,42–44
Implications
The apparently beneficial effects of the brief treatment programme
and the stronger impact of the full CBT programme on PTSD
suggest that it may be possible to develop more efficient
treatments for PTSD in people with severe mental illness. For
example, briefer interventions may be more feasible, acceptable,
and cost-effective in some settings than comprehensive
treatments. Alternatively, a stepped care treatment model (for
example the brief treatment programme provided first followed
by the longer CBT programme if needed), may prove useful for
this population, as have stepped care approaches for the treatment
of depression, anxiety and injured trauma survivors.45,46 Further
research is needed to evaluate such approaches.
People with severe mental illness are exposed to more trauma
and are more prone to PTSD and have worse functional outcomes
than people in the general population, but they have typically been
excluded from clinical trials of PTSD because of problems such as
psychotic symptoms and self-injurious behaviour.7 The findings of
this study, when combined with our prior research,19 provides
additional evidence that PTSD can be effectively treated in these
individuals with the standardised CBT programme.8 Our
intervention, to our knowledge, is the first of its kind that
addresses PTSD in people with severe mental illness that has
demonstrated significant benefits in RCTs. Increasing access to
effective interventions for people with severe mental illness and
co-occurring PTSD is an important priority for reducing distress
and improving functioning in this vulnerable population whose
trauma-related treatment needs are so often neglected.
