Effect of Honey on Nocturnal Cough and Sleep Quality:
A Double-blind, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Study
WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Honey is recommended as
a cough medication by the World Health Organization. To date, the
efficacy of this treatment has been shown in 2 studies: one tested
only buckwheat honey and the other study was not blinded.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: In a randomized controlled trial, we
compared 3 types of honey versus placebo as a treatment of
upper respiratory tract infection–associated cough. These types
of honey were superior to placebo in alleviating cough.
abstract
OBJECTIVES: To compare the effects of a single nocturnal dose of 3
honey products (eucalyptus honey, citrus honey, or labiatae honey) to
placebo (silan date extract) on nocturnal cough and difficulty sleeping
associated with childhood upper respiratory tract infections (URIs).
METHODS: A survey was administered to parents on 2 consecutive
days, first on the day of presentation, when no medication had been
given the previous evening, and the following day, when the study preparation was given before bedtime, based on a double-blind randomization
plan. Participants included 300 children aged 1 to 5 years with URIs,
nocturnal cough, and illness duration of #7 days from 6 general
pediatric community clinics. Eligible children received a single dose of
10 g of eucalyptus honey, citrus honey, labiatae honey, or placebo
administered 30 minutes before bedtime. Main outcome measures
were cough frequency, cough severity, bothersome nature of cough,
and child and parent sleep quality.
RESULTS: In all 3 honey products and the placebo group, there was
a significant improvement from the night before treatment to the night
of treatment. However, the improvement was greater in the honey
groups for all the main outcome measures.
CONCLUSIONS: Parents rated the honey products higher than the silan
date extract for symptomatic relief of their children’s nocturnal cough
and sleep difficulty due to URI. Honey may be a preferable treatment
for cough and sleep difficulty associated with childhood URI. Pediatrics

ARTICLE
Downloaded from pediatrics.aappublications.org by guest on June 21, 2014
Cough is a common symptom in pediatric practice. It can be particularly
troubling to children and their parents.
It often results in discomforttothe child
and loss of sleep for both the child and
parents. As a result, children miss day
care or school andparentsmiss a dayof
work. In an attempt to treat cough,
caregivers frequently administer overthe-counter (OTC) medications to their
children, with their attendant risks,1–7
lack of proven efficacy,8–11 and the disapproval of professional organizations
such as the American Academy of Pediatrics,12 and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).13
A variety of home remedies and herbal
medications, such as licorice, cloves,
lemon, and honey, are used by some
caregivers to treat the symptoms associated with upper respiratory tract
infections (URIs).14,15 The World Health
Organization has noted honey as a potential treatment of cough and cold
symptoms, and it is considered as a demulcent that is inexpensive, popular, and
safe (outside of the infant population).14
Honey has antioxidant properties and
increases cytokine release, which may
explain its antimicrobial effects.16–21
The objective of this trial was to comparethe effects on nocturnal cough and
the sleep difficulty associated with URIs
of a single nocturnal dose of 3 honey
products compared with placebo.
METHODS
Patients
Subjects were recruited from patients
who presented to 1 of 6 general pediatric community clinics for an acute
care visit between January 2009 and
December 2009. Eligible patients were
those between the ages of 1 and 5 years
complaining of nocturnal cough that
was attributed to a URI. A URI was defined by the presence of cough and
rhinorrhea of #7 days’ duration. Other
symptoms might have included but were
not limited to nasal congestion, fever,
sore throat, myalgia, and headache.
Patients were excluded if they had signs
or symptoms of asthma, pneumonia,
laryngotracheobronchitis, sinusitis, and/
or allergic rhinitis. Patients were also
excluded if they had used any cough or
cold medication or honey on the night
before entering the study. Patients were
not excluded when analgesic medications such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen were administered on either night of
the study.
Preintervention Study
Questionnaire
After attaining informed consent, all
participating parents were asked to
complete a 5-item questionnaire regarding their subjective assessments
of the child’s cough and sleep difficulty
on the previous night. The questionnaire used was a Hebrew version of a
previously validated questionnaire22
(Fig 1). Survey responses were graded
on a 7-point Likert scale. Minimum
symptom severity score criteria were
established to determine which children
should enter the randomized trial. Only
children whose parents rated a severity
of at least 3 for a minimum of 2 of the 3
questions related to nocturnal cough
frequency, effect on the child’s sleep, and
effect on parental sleep on the previous
night were included.
Study Design
A double-blind randomized design was
used to conduct this study. Eligible
children were randomized to 4 treatment groups: 3 groups were given 1 of 3
types of honey (eucalyptus honey
(family Myrtaceae), labiatae honey
(family Labiatae), or citrus honey (family
Rutaceae), or a placebo. Silan date extract was selected as the placebo because its structure, brown color, and
taste are similar to that of honey.
Intervention
The 3 honeys and the silan date extract
were prepared by the staff of the Zerifin
Breeding Apiary of the Volcani Agricultural Research Center in Rechovot,
Israel. All 3 types of honey and the silan
date extract were packed in small
plastic containers of 10 g each and
marked with the letters A, B, C, or D. The
study preparations were distributed to
the pediatric community clinics in
blocks of 4. Parents were instructed to
administer 10 g of their child’s treatment product within 30 minutes of the
child going to sleep. The parents were
instructed that the preparation could
be given undiluted or together with a
noncaffeinated beverage.
The parents, the physicians, and the
study coordinator did not know the
content of the preparation that was
dispensed. The envelopes containing
the codes of the study preparations
were stored at the office of the Ministry
of Agriculture, Extension Service, Beekeeping Department, and were not
opened until after the statistical analysis was completed.
Postintervention Study
Questionnaire
The day after the treatment, the parent
who completed the preintervention
questionnaire was contacted by telephone. Trained researchassistantswho
were blinded to the treatment group

asked the parent the same 5 questions
that had been answered in writing before the intervention, this time regarding the previous evening when the
child had received the treatment. No
physician examination was performed
on the second study day unless dictated
by illness progression.
Outcome Measures
The primary outcome was the cough
frequency. The primary outcome measure was the change in the frequency of
cough between the 2 nights. Secondary
outcome measures of importance were
changes in the cough severity, the bothersome nature of the cough, the effect of
the cough on sleep for both the child and
the parent, and the combined score of
these five measures.
Sample Size Analysis
On the basis of previously published
data,8 we estimated that the sample
size necessary to detect a 0.75-point difference between any 2 treatment groups
(using analysis of variance) with 90%
power and an a of .05 was 60 subjects
per treatment group.
To compensateforpossibledropoutsand
abnormal data distribution, we attempted to recruit 75 patients per group.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical comparisons of variables
between treatment groups were performed by using the x
2
test for nominal
variables and analysis of variance for
continuous variables. For comparisons
of cough evaluation before and after
treatment, a paired Student t test was
used. A P value ,.05 was considered
statistically significant. All statistical
analyses were done by using the SPSS
package for Windows (version 15.0.1,
SPSS, Chicago, IL).
Ethics
The study was approved by the Committee for Ethics in Human Subjects
Research, Meir Medical Center, Kfar
Saba, Israel.
RESULTS
Three hundred children with URIs were
enrolled and 270 (89.7%) completed the
single-night study (Fig 2). Sixty-four
children received eucalyptus honey,
62 received citrus honey, 73 received
labiatae honey, and 71 received placebo (silan date extract). The dropout
rate was higher in the citrus and eucalyptus groups (P = .006).
The median age of the patients completing the study was 29 months (range
12–71 months), with no significant
difference in age among the treatment
groups (Table 1). One hundred forty-six
of the children (54%) were boys. The
participants were ill a mean 6 SD of
2.8 6 2.0 days before enrollment, with
no significant differences among treatment groups (P = .161). Almost half
(47%) of the children had .3 days of
coughing, with no difference among
groups (P = .9). In addition, there were no
significant differences between measures of symptom severity at baseline.
When symptom scores were compared
for eachtreatment groupfromthe night
before treatment to the night of treatment, significant differences were detected in the amount of improvement
reported for all study outcome variables (Fig 3). No significant differences
were found among the different types
of honey; however, each of the honey
groups had a better response compared with the silan date extract. For
cough frequency, those who received
eucalyptus honey had a mean 1.77-
point improvement compared with a
1.95-point change for those receiving
citrus honey, 1.82 change for those
receiving labiatae honey, and a 1.00
point change for those who were treated
with silan date extract (placebo group)
on the second night (F = 5.708, P ,
.001). Parents also noted similar improvements in the severity of their
child’s cough: 1.78 points with eucalyptus
honey, 1.77 points with citrus honey, 1.94
points with labiatae honey and 0.99
points with silan date extract (F = 5.78,
P , .001). Parents felt the cough also
was less bothersome on the second
night, with honey providing the greatest
relief with a 2.0-point change with eucalyptus honey, a 2.16-point change with
citrus honey, and a 2.07-point change
with labiatae honey, compared with
a 1.25-point change with silan date
extract group (F = 4.63, P , .04). Parents
rated their children’s sleep better after
receiving honey, with improvement by
2.13 points with eucalyptus honey, 1.98
points improvement with citrus honey,
and 1.70 points with labiatae honey,
compared with a 1.21-point change
with silan date extract (F = 3.61, P ,
.014). As might be expected, parental
sleep improved in a fashion similar to
that of their children, with the honeytreatment arms improving the most,
a mean of 2.16 points with eucalyptus
honey, 2.10 points with citrus honey,
1.90 points with labiatae honey, and
1.28 points with silan date extract (F =
3.40, P , .018). When the results for
these outcomes were combined by adding the scores from the individual categories, honey again proved to be the
most effective treatment. The children
improved by an average of 9.88 points
with eucalyptus honey, 10.10 points with
citrus honey, 9.51 points with labiatae
honey, compared with 5.82 points for
those treated with silan date extract (F =
5.33, P , .001).
Stomachache, nausea, or vomiting were
reported by the parents of 4 patients in
thehoneytreatmentgroup (2inthecitrus,
1 in the eucalyptus, and 1 in the labiatae
honey group) and 1 in the placebo group.
The adverse events were not significantly
different between the groups.
DISCUSSION
The results of this study (Fig 3) demonstrate that each of the 3 types of

honey (eucalyptus, citrus, and labiatae)
was more effective than the placebo for
the treatment of all of the outcomes
related to nocturnal cough, child sleep,
and parental sleep.
The results of our study strengthen the
observation made by Paul et al8 that
honey products may have a beneficial
effect for symptomatic relief of nocturnal cough associated with URIs. Our
study differs, however, from the study of
Paul et al because they compared the
effect of 1 type of honey (buckwheat) to
dextromethorphan and a no-treatment
group, whereas our study compared
the effectiveness of 3 types honey to
placebo.
In contrast with Paul et al, we did not
document symptoms of hyperactivity,
nervousness,andinsomnia inthehoney
treatment groups versus the placebo
group. Shadkam et al23 also reported
that honey had a more alleviating effect
on URI-induced cough compared with
dextromethorphan and diphenhydramine.
That study was not blinded, however.
Thus, our study further supports the
recommendations of the World Health
Organization to use honey as a potential treatment of cough.14
Honey is a remarkably complex natural
liquid that is reported to contain at least
181 substances.24 It haswell-established
antioxidant and antimicrobial effects

that have been suggested as the mechanism for honey’s efficacy in wound
healing and may help to explain its superior results in this study.16–21
The antioxidants present in honey come
from a variety of sources, such as vitamin C, monophenolics, flavonoids,
and polyphenolics. Although there is a
wide spectrum of antioxidant types,
monophenolicssuchas4-hydroxybenzoic
and 4-hydroxycinnamic acids predominate in many honeys.21,25 Most of the
antioxidant components in processed
honey are water, not lipid, soluble.21
Different types of honey vary widely in
the quantity of water-soluble antioxidants they contain.26,27 This variability
is dependent on the honey’s floral source,
as well as seasonal, environmental, and
other external factors. It was observed
that the darker a honey’s color, the
higher its antioxidant capacity. The
levels of certain antioxidant components decrease with processing and
storage of honey.21 However, available
data show that phenolic antioxidants
from processed honey are bioavailable
and increase the antioxidant activity of
plasma.19
Eccles26 provided another possible explanation for some of the beneficial
effects of honey. Because of the close
anatomic relationship between the
sensory nerve fibers that initiate cough
and the gustatory nerve fibers that
taste sweetness, an interaction between these fibers may produce an
antitussive effect of sweet substances
via a central nervous system mechanism. This theory may explain some of
the observed effect in patients treated
with silan date extract because this
is also a sweet substance. However,
the significant difference between the
honey products and the silan date extract suggests that other factors in
addition to the sweet taste of honey
contribute to its beneficial effect on
children with cough.
Silan was used as placebo in this study.
An alternative hypothesis is that silan
date extract could worsen cough and
cold symptoms. However, our data
clearly show that patients treated with
silan date extract actually improved.
There is also no reason to believe silan
caused allergic symptoms or bronchospasm because dates are not a
common food allergen in the Israeli
population.27

Cough dueto a viral URI is generally selflimited. However, parents often wish
some active intervention. This tends to
lead to the use of OTC cough medications. However, these medications
are potentially dangerous. Many of the
adverse events reported were caused
by inadvertent overdoseswhen parents
gave the drug to a child too often or at
a higher than recommended dose.
Some overdoses were caused when the
parents gave a child a combination
of cold and cough medicines, not realizing the product containing the same
ingredient.
Dart et al28 reported 118 cases of fatalities in children younger than 12 years
of age that were judged as possibly,
likely, or definitely related to a cough
and cold ingredient. Of these 118 cases,
103 involved a nonprescription medication, and the ingredients most often
mentioned were pseudoephedrine (n =
45), diphenhydramine (n = 38), and
dextromethorphan (n = 36). Of these
cases, the evidence indicated that 88
involved an overdose. Several contributing factors were identified, age ,2
years, use of medication for sedation,
use in day-care settings, use of 2
medicines with the same ingredient,
failure to use a measuring device,
product misidentification, and use of
a nonprescription product intended
for adult use.
Rimsza et al reported 10 unexpected
deaths that were associated with the
use of OTC cough and cold medications
in a 1-year period.29 The authors recommended that such medications
should not be given to infants because
they may present a serious health
hazard, and there is no evidence to
support the efficacy and safe dosage of
these medications in infants. Rimsza
et al also suggest that educational
campaigns to decrease the use of OTC
cough and cold medications in infants
need to be increased.29
Lokker et al reported that unintentional
misuse of OTC cold products is common
and could result in harm if medications
are given inappropriately. Label language and graphics seem to influence
inappropriate interpretation of OTC
product age indications.30 As a result of
these studies, an FDA advisory committee recommended against the use
of OTC cough and cold medications in
children aged ,6 years, and a subsequent FDA public health advisory was
issued recommending against the use
of these medications in children ,2
years of age.13
Honey is an alternativethat is generally
regarded as safe for children older
than 1 year. Allan et al31 stated that
evidence for honey in acute pediatric
cough supports a small effect, but
clinical significance is uncertain. Our
randomized, placebo-controlled study
seems to indicate that treatment with
honey can be clinically effective.
We suggest, in concordance with the
FDA13 and the Israeli Ministry of Health
Pharmaceutical Administration, that
caregivers and clinicians should be
aware of the risk of serious adverse
events from administering cough and
cold medications to children ,2 years
of age and use several precautions
when using them in older children (2–
11 years). We believe that educational
campaigns to decrease the use of OTC
cough and cold medications in children
need to be increased. On the basis of
our findings, honey can be offered as
an alternate treatment to children .1
year of age. Honey should not be given
to children ,1 year of age because of
the risk of infantile botulism.32 Because
frequent use of honey can cause dental
caries, the recommendation should be
for a short course of honey.
The study is limited by the subjective
nature of the survey used. However,
clinicians and parents often make decisions based on subjective assessments of symptom severity. It should
also be noted that it is possible that
some of the improvement measured
could also be attributed to the natural history of URIs, which generally
improve with time and supportive
care. Furthermore, compliance with
honey and placebo administration
could not be guaranteed. However,
every parent reportedthattheir child
took the treatment as recommended.
Another limitation is the fact that the
effect of only a single dose was
evaluated. If the intervention period
would have been longer and more
than 1 dose given, the results would
have been more reliable and more
valuable.
The dropout rate was higher for children receiving citrus and eucalyptus
honey. The exact reason for the higher
dropout rate in these groups is not
known. Because these types of honey
are more aromatic, it is possible that
some children disliked the honey
taste.
CONCLUSIONS
Parents rated each of the honey products more favorably than the silan
date extract for symptomatic relief of
their children’s nocturnal cough and
sleep difficulty due to URI. Honey may
be a preferable treatment of cough
and sleep difficulties associated with
childhood URI. In light of this study,
honey can be considered an effective
and safe treatment of children .1 year
of age.
