Objectives: To compare the effects of a single nocturnal dose of buckwheat honey or honey-flavored dextromethorphan (DM) with no treatment on nocturnal cough
and sleep difficulty associated with childhood upper respiratory tract infections.
Design: A survey was administered to parents on 2 consecutive days, first on the day of presentation when no
medication had been given the prior evening and then
the next day when honey, honey-flavored DM, or no treatment had been given prior to bedtime according to a partially double-blinded randomization scheme.
Setting: A single, outpatient, general pediatric practice.
Participants: One hundred five children aged 2 to 18
years with upper respiratory tract infections, nocturnal
symptoms, and illness duration of 7 days or less.
Intervention: A single dose of buckwheat honey, honeyflavored DM, or no treatment administered 30 minutes
prior to bedtime.
Main Outcome Measures: Cough frequency, cough
severity, bothersome nature of cough, and child and parent sleep quality.
Results: Significant differences in symptom improvement were detected between treatment groups, with honey
consistently scoring the best and no treatment scoring
the worst. In paired comparisons, honey was significantly superior to no treatment for cough frequency and
the combined score, but DM was not better than no treatment for any outcome. Comparison of honey with DM
revealed no significant differences.
Conclusions:In a comparison of honey, DM, and no treatment, parents rated honeymostfavorablyfor symptomatic
relief of theirchild’snocturnalcoughand sleepdifficultydue
to upper respiratory tract infection. Honey may be a preferable treatment for the cough and sleep difficulty associated with childhood upper respiratory tract infection.

We have previously shown that neither DM nor diphenhydramine was superior to placebo for outcomes related to
cough and sleep quality when rated subjectively by parents.6 In that study, the
medications failed to produce an improvement in the frequency, severity, or bothersome nature of the cough to a greater degree than placebo. Importantly for parents,
neither their child’s sleep nor their own
sleep was significantly better when their
child received medication compared with
placebo.
In many cultures, alternative remedies such as honey are used to treat URI
symptoms including cough.7 In contrast
to DM, however, honey is generally believed to be safe outside of the infant population. Honey has many purported health
benefits and has repeatedly been shown to
aid in wound healing, even for children.8-11 For cough and cold symptoms,

honey is cited by the World Health Organization as a potential treatment.12 In the World Health Organization report on the treatment of URIs in young children, honey
is considered as a demulcent that is cheap, popular, and
safe. Although there is no scientific evidence to support
the use of honey for symptoms associated with a URI, it
is suggested in the World Health Organization report that
demulcents may soothe the throat and can be recommended to provide some relief from cough in children.
In addition to the demulcent effect, honey has antioxidant properties and increases cytokine release, which may
explain its antimicrobial effects.13-17
The objective of this trial was to compare the effects of
a single nocturnal dose of honey or honey-flavored DM
with no treatment on nocturnal cough and the sleep difficulty associated with URIs. A no-treatment arm was included instead of one with a placebo group for 2 reasons:
(1) our previous study found no difference between DM
and placebofor any outcome,6 soincluding both a DM arm
and a placebo arm would be unnecessary, and (2) a critique suggested that the study cohort was already improving at the time when DM or placebo was given, which limited our ability to detect a treatment effect.18Given the previous demonstration of DM’s nonsuperiority to placebo,
this study design allowed us to address previous critiques
and answer a clinicallyimportant question by hypothesizing that both honey and DM will be superior to no treatment for control of nocturnal cough due to URI as well
as its associated sleep difficulty.
METHODS
From September 2005 through March 2006, patients were recruited from a single university-affiliated pediatric practice in
Hershey, Pennsylvania, on presentation for an acute care visit.
Eligible patients were aged 2 through 18 years with cough attributed to URIs. The URIs were characterized by the presence
of rhinorrhea and cough for 7 or fewer days’ duration. Other
symptoms may have included but were not limited to congestion, fever, sore throat, myalgias, and headache. Patients were
excluded if they had signs or symptoms of a more treatable disease (eg, asthma, pneumonia, laryngotracheobronchitis, sinusitis, allergic rhinitis). They were also ineligible when they had
a history of reactive airways disease, asthma, or chronic lung
disease or were using a drug known to inhibit the metabolism
of DM, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Subjects were also excluded if on the prior evening they had taken
a medication that included an antihistamine or DM hydrobromide within 6 hours of bedtime or DM polistirex within 12 hours
of bedtime on the evening prior to or on the day of enrollment. Patients were not excluded when analgesic medications
such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen were administered on either
night of the study. While many more patients with URIs presented to the practice during the recruitment period, the exclusions, particularly the exclusion of taking medication on the
previous evening, disqualified many subjects.
Subjective parental assessments of their child’s cough and
sleep difficulty on the previous night were assessed after informed consent was obtained through previously validated questions using a 7-point Likert scale (Figure 1).19 Trained study
coordinators were responsible for survey administration, and
survey responses ranged from extremely (6 points) to not at
all (0 points). In an effort to study a population that was likely
to receive a therapeutic intervention by parents, minimum symptom severity criteria for enrollment were established. Only parents who answered at least somewhat (3 points) for a minimum of 2 of the 3 questions related to nocturnal cough
frequency, effect on the child’s sleep, and effect on parental sleep
based on the previous night’s symptoms were eligible.
After stratification for age (ages 2-5, 6-11, and 12-18 years),
each child was randomly assigned in a partially doubleblinded fashion to receive artificially honey-flavored DM (17
mg/5 mL prepared using DM hydrobromide powder [100% pure
United States Pharmacopeia grade], artificial honey flavoring,
coloring, stevia liquid extract, methocel, and simple syrup [Professional Compounding Centers of America, Houston, Texas]),
buckwheat honey, or nothing in a 10-mL syringe. A compounding pharmacy prepared the DM to approximate the consistency, texture, flavor, smell, and sweetness of honey. The randomization sequence was constructed by a statistician not
affiliated with the study (Susan Boehmer, MS) and was then
used by the study coordinators to assign treatment groups.
The syringes used for all of the 3 treatment groups were
opaque and were placed in brown paper bags to avoid investigator unblinding. Although the no-treatment group was not

blinded to their treatment arm, the honey and DM groups remained blinded. Dosage for DM approximated typical OTC label recommendations, with children aged 2 to 5 years receiving 8.5 mg/dose (1/2 teaspoon), children aged 6 to 11 years
receiving 17 mg/dose (1 teaspoon), and children aged 12 to 18
years receiving 34 mg/dose (2 teaspoons). Of note, these concentrations slightly exceed typical OTC products, which contain 15 mg/5 mL, and were the result of the compounding process but may be more likely to achieve a beneficial effect based
on our previous analyses.20 For the honey group, the volume
of honey dispensed was equivalent to the age-driven volume
dispensed for DM. The bags and syringes were refrigerated prior
to being dispensed. Parents were instructed that their child’s
treatment could be given with a noncaffeinated beverage and
should be administered within 30 minutes of the child going
to sleep. A second survey asking the same questions as those
answered at enrollment was then administered via telephone
interview the following day to the same parent by trained study
coordinators ( J.B., A.M., Sarah Sturgis, CRNP, Jennifer Stokes,
RN, Susan LaTournous, RN, and Diane Kitch, RN), who were
blinded to the treatment group, to assess symptom severity for
the night when DM, honey, or no treatment was given. No physician examination was performed on the second study day unless dictated by illness progression.
The prospectively estimated sample size necessary to detect a 1-point difference between any 2 treatment groups with
80% power was 35 subjects per treatment group for a total sample
size of 105 subjects with =.05. This calculation was based on
a 2-sided, 2-sample t test inflated to reflect the loss of efficiency that would result if it was necessary to use WilcoxonMann-Whitney tests for pairwise comparisons of the treatments. The 1-point difference for the primary outcome has been
used previously,6 and it resulted in a sample size that is greater
than several other well-known and similar clinical trials.21,22 The
principal outcome measure of interest was the change in the
frequency of cough between the 2 nights, and secondary outcome measures of importance were changes in the cough severity, the bothersome nature of the cough, the effect of the
cough on sleep for both the child and parents, and the combined score of these 5 measures.
Baseline characteristics were compared between treatment
groups using a 2 test for sex, a Kruskal-Wallis test for age, and
1-way analysis of variance for the remaining variables. The cough
outcomes showed no significant departures from normality;
therefore, treatment group comparisons were conducted using
1-way analysis of variance. The Tukey method was used to adjust P values for the pairwise treatment comparisons for each
cough outcome. These analyses were extended to include age
(in continuous form) and sex separately in analysis of covariance models. As adjustment for these covariates did not change
the findings, the results of the unadjusted analyses are reported. Fisher exact tests were used to compare adverse event
rates between treatments.
The study was approved by the Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine’s Human Subjects Protection Office,
and the trial was registered at http://www.clinicaltrials.gov prior
to the first subject’s enrollment. Informed consent was obtained from all of the participating parents and verbal assent
was obtained from all of the children aged 7 years or older.
RESULTS
One hundred thirty children with URIs were enrolled and
105 (81%) completed the single-night study. The median age of the patients completing the study was 5.22 years
(range, 2.22-16.92 years), with no significant difference
between treatment groups (Table). Thirty-five patients
received honey, 33 received DM, and 37 received no treatment. Fifty-three percent of the children were female and
the participants were ill a mean±SD of 4.64±1.68 days before participation, without significant differences in either
variable between treatment groups (P=.60). In addition,
there were no significant differences between measures of
symptom severity at baseline.
Symptom scores were obtained to describe the night
before enrollment when no participants received treatment, and they were compared with scores from the subsequent night when honey, honey-flavored DM, or no
treatment was given before bed. When separated by treatment group, significant differences were detected in the
amount of improvement reported for all of the study outcomes in the planned 3-way comparison (Figure 2). All
of the outcomes found honey to yield the greatest improvement, followed by DM, while no treatment consistently showed the least amount of improvement. For
cough frequency, those who received honey had a mean
1.89-point improvement as rated by their parents compared with a 1.39-point change for those receiving DM
and a 0.92-point change for those who had no treatment on the second night (P.001). Parents also noted

similar improvements in the severity of their child’s cough:
1.80 points with honey, 1.30 points with DM, and 1.11
points with no treatment (P.001). While parents felt
the cough also was less bothersome on the second night,
again honey provided the greatest relief with a 2.23-
point change compared with a 1.94-point change and a
1.30-point change for those children who received DM
and no treatment, respectively (P.001). Parents rated
their children’s sleep better after receiving honey, with
a 2.49-point improvement for the honey group compared with a 1.79-point change for the DM group and a
1.57-point change for those not receiving treatment on
the second night (P.001). As might be expected, parental sleep improved in a fashion similar to that of their
children, with the honey treatment arm improving the
most by a mean of 2.31 points, followed by 1.97 points
for DM and 1.51 points for no treatment (P.001). When
the results for these outcomes were combined by adding the scores from the individual categories, honey again
proved to be the most effective treatment. The children
in this group improved by an average of 10.71 points compared with 8.39 points for DM-treated children and 6.41
points for those who were not treated (P.001).
In pairwise comparisons, honey was significantly superior to no treatment for our a priori primary outcome of
cough frequency (P=.01) as well as the combined symptom score (P=.04), with marginally significant superiority for child sleep (P=.09) and the bothersome nature of
the cough (P=.08). Nonsignificant outcomes included
cough severity (P=.18) and parent sleep (P=.17). In contrast, DM was not significantly better than no treatment for
any study outcome. Similarly, pairwise comparison of honey
with DM revealed no statistically significant differences.
Even though the mean illness duration was not significantly different between treatment groups (P=.15), because of the possibility that the treatment effect was modified by the duration ofillness, the analysis of variancemodels
were extended to include the duration of illness and an interaction term between treatment and the duration of illness. This interaction term only reached statistical significance for cough frequency (P=.05) and child’s sleep
(P=.04); however, all of the outcome measures showed a
similar pattern of treatment effect modification. Improvement with the use of honey or no treatment increased as
the duration ofillnessincreased, whereasimprovement with
DM decreased as the duration of illness increased.
Few adverse events occurred in this investigation. The
combination of mild reactions that include hyperactivity,
nervousness, and insomnia occurred in 5 patients treated
with honey, 2 patients in the DM group, and no patients
in the no-treatment arm (P=.04). In the honey group, the
parent of 1 patient reported drowsiness and the parents of
2 patients reported stomachache, nausea, or vomiting, but
these adverse events were not significant when examined
separatelyfrom a statistical perspective (drowsiness, P=.65;
stomachache, nausea, vomiting, P=.21).
COMMENT
The results of this study demonstrate that in the overall
comparison of the 3 treatment groups, honey was the most
effective treatment for all of the outcomes related to cough,
child sleep, and parent sleep. Further, honey but not DM
was superior to no treatment for nocturnal symptoms associated with childhood URI. Notably, however, direct
comparison between honey and DM yielded no statistically significant differences. These findings complement the results of our previous study6 that found no
difference between DM, diphenhydramine, or placebo
for children with URIs, and they now provide a generally safe and well-tolerated alternative for practitioners
to recommend.
Honey has well-established antioxidant and antimicrobial effects,13,15,23-30 which have been suggested as the
mechanism for its efficacy in wound healing and may help
to explain its superiority in this study. Buckwheat honey
is a dark variety of honey, and darker honeys tend to have
a higher content of phenolic compounds. These compounds have been associated with the antioxidant properties of honey that may have contributed to its effect in
this study.15,16,31 Further, its topical demulcent effect may
contribute to its benefits for cough as postulated by the
World Health Organization review.12

Another explanation for some of the beneficial
effects of honey was recently described in a provocative
review by Eccles.32 This article argues that the sweetness of liquid preparations used to treat cough accounts
for a significant portion of the treatment effect and
also explains why studies have shown that antitussive
preparations containing DM are not significantly superior to sweet, liquid placebos. This hypothesis is based
on the suggestion that sweet substances naturally
cause reflex salivation and may also cause the secretion of airway mucus and lead to a demulcent effect on
the pharynx and larynx, thereby reducing cough (particularly dry, unproductive cough). For productive
cough, Eccles suggests that these secretions could
improve mucociliary clearance in the airway via an
expectorant mechanism. Additionally, the review
mentions the evidence related to endogenous opioids
that are produced following consumption of sweet
substances, a phenomenon that has been repeatedly
studied for its analgesic properties. Because of the
close anatomical relationship between the sensory
nerve fibers that initiate cough and the gustatory nerve
fibers that taste sweetness, Eccles suggests that an
interaction between the opioid-responsive sensory
fibers and the gustatory nerves may help to produce
the antitussive effects of sweet substances via a central
nervous system mechanism.
Dextromethorphan continues to be used very frequently in the United States despite numerous studies,
evidence-based reviews, and policy statements describing its lack of efficacy.2,3,6,21,22,33-38 Although it was generally well tolerated in the cohort of children who took
the medication in this study, its OTC availability is especially concerning given the numerous reports of serious adverse events described in the medical literature,
such as dystonia,39 anaphylaxis,40 and bullous mastocytosis41 with standard doses, and dependence,42,43 psychosis,44,45 mania,46,47 hallucinations,48 ataxia,49,50 somnolence,50 insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus,51 peripheral
neuropathy,52 cerebellar degeneration,53 megaloblastic anemia,52,53 and death54 with higher doses. Further, DM is
increasingly being used as a recreational drug of abuse,
particularly by adolescents,55-64 and one recent report63
indicated that nearly 5% of 12th graders in Dayton, Ohio,
have tried this drug for this purpose.
In contrast with DM, honey is generally recognized
as safe with the exceptions of the risk of infantile botulism for children younger than 1 year65-68 and the rare risk
of grayanotoxin-mediated syndrome characterized by salivation, emesis, circumoral and extremity paresthesias, hypotension, bradycardia, and, occasionally, cardiac rhythm
disturbances.69 Our study did find that the mild adverse
effect grouping of hyperactivity, nervousness, and insomnia was significantly more common in those treated
with honey, a finding that could affect clinician recommendations.
The use of a no-treatment arm somewhat negates the
criticism of our prior study that argued that the effect of
DM could not be determined because of the large placebo effect seen. The current results surprisingly indicate that DM was not significantly better than no treatment at all. While the trend seen in the results suggests
that a larger sample size may have had enough statistical power to detect a difference between DM and no treatment, for the individual outcome measures, the observed differences were all smaller than the 1-point
difference believed to be clinically meaningful prior to
study initiation. In any case, the fact that there was
sufficient power to find that honey was superior to no
treatment adds to the validity of our previous findings
suggesting that DM was no better than a placebo treatment of simple syrup without a pharmacologically active substance.
This study is somewhat limited by the fact that each
child had a physician visit between the 2 nights of the
study, which may provide some of the explanation for
the improvement in all of the groups, including the notreatment group. Alternatively, much of the improvement can also be attributed to the natural history of URIs,
which generally improve with time and supportive care.
The subjective survey used for this study may also be
considered by some to be a limitation, but clinicians and
parents often make decisions based on subjective assessment of symptom severity as has been argued previously.22,70 Additionally, investigators at the Massachusetts General Hospital recently validated this survey
with 120 caregivers of children aged 1 to 18 years and
found it to be reliable for assessing changes in cough frequency and severity over time.19 Further, compliance with
medication administration could not be guaranteed even
though every parent did report that the treatment was
taken by their child without difficulty regardless of randomization arm, but the lack of treatment in 1 of the study
arms could be viewed as causing biased results in that
treatment arm.
As we have stated previously, the desire to ease the
symptoms associated with URIs, particularly cough and
its associated sleep difficulty, is great.6 Both physicians
and parents want symptomatic relief for children
afflicted with these common and annoying illnesses.
While our findings and the absence of contemporary
studies supporting the use of DM continue to question
its effectiveness for the treatment of cough associated
with URIs, we have now provided evidence supporting
honey, which is generally regarded as safe for children
older than 1 year, as an alternative. While additional
studies to confirm our findings should be encouraged,
each clinician should consider the findings for honey,
the absence of such published findings for DM, and the
potential for adverse effects and cumulative costs associated with the use of DM when recommending treatments for families.
