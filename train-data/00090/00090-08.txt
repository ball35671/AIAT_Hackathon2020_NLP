Abstract
Purpose To compare the eVect of letrozole with laparoscopic ovarian diathermy (LOD) for ovulation induction in
clomiphene citrate (CC) resistant women with polycystic
ovary syndrome (PCOS).
Methods Two hundred and sixty anovulatory women with
CC-resistant PCOS were selected in this randomized controlled trial. Group A (n = 128) received 2.5 mg letrozole
daily for 5 days for up to six cycles. Group B (n = 132)
underwent LOD with 6 months follow-up. Outcome measures were ovulation rate, midcycle endometrial thickness,
pregnancy, miscarriage and live birth rates.
Results Ovulation occurred in 335/512 cycles (65.4%) in
letrozole group and 364/525 cycles (69.3%) in LOD group
without signiWcant diVerence between both groups.
Resumption of regular menstruation was similar in both
treatment groups. A signiWcant increase in midcycle endometrial thickness was observed in letrozole group
(8.8 § 1.1 mm vs. 7.9 § 1.2 mm) (P < 0.05). Pregnancy
rate was similar in both groups (15.6 vs. 17.5%). There
were no statistical signiWcant diVerences as regards miscarriage and live birth rates between both groups. No multiple
pregnancy or ovarian hyperstimulation occurred in either
group.
Conclusion Letrozole and LOD are equally eVective for
inducing ovulation and achieving pregnancy in CC-resistant
PCOS patients.

Ovulation induction
Introduction
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common cause of
infertility and is associated with chronic anovulation and
hyperandrogenemia. It aVects 7–8% of reproductive age
women [1]. Clomiphene citrate (CC) is still holding its
place as the Wrst-line therapy for ovulation induction in
these patients [2, 3]. However, the use of CC may be
associated with poor cervical mucous and endometrial
thinning in 15–50% of patients due to prolonged estrogenreceptor depletion in the endometrium and possibly in
the cervix [4–6]. Furthermore, clomiphene resistance, i.e.
failure to ovulate after receiving 150 mg/day is common
and occurs in approximately 15–40% in women with
PCOS [2, 7].
Although treatment with gonadotropins is often successful in those patients, yet they are expensive and have the
risk of ovarian hyperstimulation (OHSS) and multiple pregnancy [8]. Laparoscopic ovarian diathermy (LOD) is currently accepted as a successful second-line treatment for
ovulation induction in CC-resistant PCOS [3, 7–9]. Bayram
et al. [10] in a randomized trial compared LOD with recombinant FSH in 168 CC-resistant PCOS women. They
reported an ovulation rate of 70 and 69% per cycle and
pregnancy and live-birth rates 37, 75% and 34, 60% of
patients, respectively, following LOD and FSH therapy.
Nevertheless, LOD is costly and requires hospital treatment
and general anesthesia, and carries the risk of post-operative adhesions and premature ovarian failure in the inexpert
hands [11].

Letrozole, an aromatase inhibitor (AI), has attracted the
attention for a long time as an oral ovulatory agent with a
reported ovulation rate of 70–85% and a pregnancy rate of
20–27% per cycle [12]. Moreover, its use in CC-resistant
PCOS patients can achieve ovulation in 54.6–84.4% of
patients [13–15].
To our knowledge, no studies yet compared the eVects of
letrozole therapy with LOD in CC-resistant PCOS patients.
The aim of this prospective, randomized trial was to compare the eYcacy of letrozole administration for six cycles to
that of LOD for ovulation induction in CC-resistant infertile
PCOS women.
Materials and methods
Patient population
The study comprised of 260 women with CC-resistant PCOS
among those attending the Outpatient Clinic in Mansoura
University Hospitals, and a private practice setting in the
period from August 2006 to March 2009. Diagnosis of PCOS
based on the revised 2003 consensus on diagnostic criteria
and long-term health risks related to PCOS [16]. All women
were previously treated with 150 mg of CC daily for 5 days
per cycle, for at least three cycles with persistent anovulation,
i.e. CC-resistant. They had patent Fallopian tubes proved by
hysterosalpingography and normal semen analysis for their
partners according to the modiWed criteria of World Health
Organization [17]. At the study entry, all patients had the
basal hormonal assays (at day 2 or 3 of progesterone induced
menstruation, after an overnight fast) consisting of FSH, LH,
thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), prolactin, 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP), total testosterone and sex hormonebinding globulin (SHBG). Fasting serum insulin and glucose
levels were also performed. All patients had normal serum
prolactin, TSH and 17-OHP. Exclusion criteria were other
causes of infertility, age over 40 years, BMI > 35, contraindication to general anesthetic, previous history of LOD and
women who had received metformin, gonadotrophin, oral
contraceptives or other hormonal drugs during the preceding
6 months. Women who intended to start a diet or a speciWc
program of physical activity were also excluded. All women
were instructed to maintain their usual lifestyle and eating habits during the study. The study was approved by
Mansoura University Hospital Research Ethics Committee
and all participants gave informed consent before inclusion
in the trial.
Randomization
Women were randomized according to a computer-generated
random numeric table prepared by an independent statistician
with concealment of treatment allocation by use of sealed
opaque envelopes that were given to a third party (nurse)
who assigned patients to study arms; group A (letrozole) or
B (LOD). Once allocated, the treatment was revealed to
both the investigator and the patient. However, the radiologist who performed transvaginal ultrasound follow up
assessment was blinded to the treatment groups.
Protocol and treatment
In letrozole group (group A), treatment continued for up to
six cycles. Initially, withdrawal bleeding was achieved
using 10 mg of dydrogesterone tablets for 10 days before
stimulation using 2.5 mg of letrozole oral tablets (Femara;
Novartis Pharma Services, Switzerland) daily from day 3 of
the menses for 5 days. All patients were monitored by
transvaginal ultrasound for the mean follicular diameter
and endometrial thickness in the days 10, 12, and 14 of the
cycle. Serum P (ng/mL) was measured on days 21–23
of the cycle by RIA using antibody coated-tube method
(Coat-A-Count; Diagnostic Product Corporation, Los Angeles,
CA, USA). Actually, those who did not ovulate following
three successive cycles of letrozole at the same dose were
considered not responsive and counseled for further lines of
treatment. hCG (a total of 10,000 IU IM, Choriomon;
IBSA, Switzerland) was given when one follicle measured
at least 18 mm was found. Patients were advised to have
intercourse 24–36 h after hCG injection.
In LOD group (group B), laparoscopy was performed
using three-puncture technique. Each ovary was cauterized
at four points, each for 4 s at 40 W for a depth of 4 mm with
a mixed current, using a monopolar electrosurgical needle
(Karl Storz, ND, Germany). The pelvis was irrigated using
Ringer’s lactated solution. The total duration of the procedure was recorded, and intra-operative or post-operative
complications were reported. Follow-up continued for
6 months after the procedure. If menstruation occurred
within 6 weeks of the surgery, a blood sample would be
taken on day 21 of the same cycle for measurement of
serum concentration of progesterone. Ovulation was diagnosed when Serum P level was ¸5 ng/mL. Subsequent
cycles were monitored for ovulation by transvaginal ultrasound for the mean follicular diameter and endometrial
thickness on days 10, 12, and 14 of the cycle and serum
progesterone on day 21–23 of the cycle. All patients who
showed ovulation were advised for natural intercourse. On
the other hand, if anovulation persisted after LOD, as evidenced by the low progesterone levels or lack of menstruation, or if the patient became anovulatory again, they were
counseled for further lines of treatment.
In either group, biochemical pregnancy was considered
when serum -hCG was 50 mIU/ml or more in the absence
of menstruation, meanwhile the sonographic evidence for

intrauterine gestational sac at 6 weeks gestation were considered criteria to deWne a clinical pregnancy. All pregnant
women were followed up to obtain the miscarriage and
live-birth rates. Clinical miscarriage was deWned as any
conWrmed clinical pregnancy subsequently lost before
12 weeks of gestation, meanwhile biochemical miscarriage
was considered if any conWrmed biochemical pregnancy
subsequently lost without evidence of intrauterine pregnancy demonstrated by ultrasound.
Sample size
The primary outcome measure was the ovulation rate. Secondary outcome measures included midcycle endometrial
thickness (mm), biochemical pregnancy, miscarriage and
live birth rates. Sample size was calculated based on the
fact that with an expected rate of ovulation of 70% in the
LOD group [10] we needed 244 women to show an absolute increase of 15% in ovulation rate in the letrozole group
[12], with a power of 80% at conWdence interval of 95%
using a two tailed chi-square test with a 5% signiWcance
level (type  error).
Statistical analysis
Data obtained were statistically analyzed using Statistical
Package for Social Sciences (SPSS, Chicago, USA) software version 15.0 for Windows. Analysis was performed
on an intention-to-treat basis. Means were compared using
the unpaired student’s t test while proportions were compared using the chi-square test. P value of less than 0.05
was considered statistically signiWcant.
Results
A total of 260 patients were studied, 128 women (512
cycles) and 132 women (525 cycles) in groups A and B,
respectively (Fig. 1). There were no statistical signiWcant
diVerences between the two groups as regards age, duration
of infertility, anthropometric variables, clinical manifestations, hormonal proWles and ultrasound Wndings of PCOS
(Table 1). The duration of LOD was 26.5 § 5.2 min and no
intra-operative or post-operative complications occurred.
Clinical and reproductive outcomes are presented in
Table 2. Ovulation occurred in 335 out of 512 cycles
(65.4%) in group A and 364 out of 525 cycles (69.3%) in
group B without signiWcant diVerence between both groups.
Resumption of regular menstruation was similar between
the two treatment groups. There was no statistically signiWcant diVerence in pretreatment endometrial thickness
between the two groups. A signiWcant increase in mid-cycle
endometrial thickness was observed in group A
(8.8 § 1.1 mm vs. 7.9 § 1.2 mm) (P < 0.05). Biochemical
pregnancy occurred in 80 out of 512 cycles (15.6%) in
group A and 92 out of 525 cycles in group B (17.5%) and

statistically signiWcant diVerence regarding the clinical
pregnancy rate between the two groups (28.12 vs. 28.03%
in group A and B, respectively). No twin, higher order

rates were similar between both groups.
Discussion
In this randomized controlled trial, we have for the Wrst
time evaluated the eYcacy of letrozole administration for
six cycles as a method of ovulation induction in CC-resistant infertile PCOS women in comparison with LOD.
Letrozole is a third generation aromatase inhibitor. Its early
administration in the follicular phase induces ovulation by
releasing the hypothalamic–pituitary axis from E negative
feedback, thus increasing FSH secretion stimulating ovarian follicular development. In addition, it increases follicular sensitivity to FSH by accumulation of intraovarian
androgens [12, 18, 19]. In this study, ovulation occurred in
335 out of 512 cycles (65.4%) in group A which is comparable to that reported in two recent randomized trials by
Bayer et al. and Badawy et al. [20, 21] who had ovulatory
rates of 65.7 and 62% of letrozole cycles, respectively. In
other trials, Mitwally and Casper [14] had ovulatory rate of
75%, Al-Omari et al. [15] had an ovulatory rate of 87.5%,
while, Elnashar et al. [13] reported an ovulation a rate of
54.6%. This may be explained by the small sample size in
those trials. Pregnancy was achieved in 80 out of 512
cycles (15.6%) in group A which is comparable to (12.2%)
reported by Badawy et al. [21], however, less than that
reported by others (25 and 27%) [13–15]. The miscarriage
and live birth rates were similar in both groups. A recent
large randomized trial by Ganesh et al. [22] compared the
eYcacy of letrozole with that of rFSH and CC/rFSH for
ovarian stimulation in IUI cycles in 1,387 PCOS women
after CC failure. They reported an ovulation rate of 79.30%
in letrozole group versus 56.95 and 89.89% in other groups,
respectively, and pregnancy rate of 23.39% in letrozole
group versus 14.35 and 17.92% in other groups, respectively. However, they included not only CC-resistant PCOS
patients but also those who failed to conceive with 100 mg/day
CC for six cycles despite ovulating and those who showed
poor endometrial development, i.e. endometrial thickness
<7 mm on the day of hCG administration.
Monofollicular growth is seen as an advantage to both
LOD and AIs. LOD can resume the physiological monofollicular ovulation reducing risk of OHSS or multiple pregnancy [3, 8–10]. AIs are rapidly eliminated from the body
due to its relatively shorter half-life (about 2 days) than CC
(more than a month). So, in contrast to the use of CC, the
hypothalamus is able to respond to the estrogen-mediated
negative feedback mechanism. This will modulate excessive FSH discharge, thus more likely to result in a monofollicular ovulation with moderate estrogen concentrations.
Also in view of the absence of down-regulation of the
hypothalamic–pituitary estrogen receptors during the late
follicular phase, adverse eVects on peripheral organs such
as endometrium and cervix are considerably less [18, 19].
In this study, a signiWcant increase in mid-cycle endometrial
thickness was observed in the letrozole group. Mitwally
and Casper [14] showed that letrozole is associated with a
thicker endometrium when compared with CC. This might
be due to improved vascularization as reported by a recent
Doppler study [23].
The safety of letrozole has elaborated a vivid discussion.
Preliminary data by Biljan et al. [24] suggested an increased
risk of congenital anomalies in letrozole treated babies,
whereas recent data from retrospective and prospective trials
[25, 26] have contested these initial Wndings and supported
the safety of letrozole compared to traditional ovulation
induction treatment. The cost of treatment is another issue.
The cost of letrozole per cycle is much lower compared with
the hospital charges needed for LOD (185 vs. 1,500 Egyptian

pounds, respectively). On the other hand, LOD may be more
cost-eVective, because one treatment, in principle, results in
several ovulatory cycles, whereas one course of letrozole
therapy yields a single ovulatory cycle.
In conclusion, this trial suggested that up to six cycles of
letrozole and LOD (during the 6 month follow-up period)
are equally eVective for inducing ovulation and achieving
pregnancy in patients with CC-resistant PCOS. In view of
the invasiveness and cost of surgery, it seems plausible that
letrozole therapy should be tried Wrst for most of those
women before shifting to LOD.
