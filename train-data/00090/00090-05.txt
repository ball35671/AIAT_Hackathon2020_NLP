Objective: To compare the effectiveness of laparoscopic ovarian diathermy with gonadotropin ovulation
induction for women with clomiphene citrate–resistant polycystic ovary syndrome.
Design: Randomized controlled trial.
Setting: A tertiary referral fertility clinic.
Patient(s): Women with anovulatory infertility secondary to clomiphene-resistant polycystic ovary syndrome. Inclusion criteria were age of 39 years, body mass index of 35 kg/m2
, failure to ovulate with 150
mg of clomiphene citrate for 5 days in the early follicular phase, 12 months of infertility, and no other causes
of infertility.
Intervention(s): Laparoscopic ovarian diathermy versus three cycles of urinary or recombinant gonadotropins.
Main Outcome Measure(s): Cumulative pregnancy and miscarriage rates.
Result(s): Cumulative pregnancy rates were 28% at 6 months for laparoscopic ovarian diathermy and 33%
for three cycles of ovulation induction with gonadotropins. There were three miscarriages in each group.
Women in the laparoscopic ovarian diathermy arm of the study had four additional spontaneous pregnancies
6 to 12 months after surgery.
Conclusion(s): There was no statistically significant difference in pregnancy or miscarriage rates during the
6-month follow-up period or the three cycles. Laparoscopic ovarian diathermy is a safe and effective
alternative to ovulation induction with gonadotropins. (Fertil Steril 2002;78:404–11. ©2002 by American

Anovulatory infertility secondary to polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is common,
accounting for the majority of women with
anovulation who attend fertility clinics (1). The
treatment of first choice has been ovulation
induction with clomiphene citrate, and rates of
ovulation are usually reported at 70% (2).
Those women who do not ovulate with increasing doses of clomiphene citrate are described
as being clomiphene citrate resistant. In the
past, wedge resections have been used to induce ovulation, and this was reported to be
successful in as many as or up to 90% of
women (3). Wedge resection of the ovary was
largely abandoned by the early 1980s, as the
introduction of urinary gonadotropins and oral
anti-estrogen agents such as clomiphene citrate
had made this approach redundant.
However, with the advent of laparoscopic
surgery, the possibility of inducing ovulation
by laparoscopic ovarian diathermy was raised.
Although treatment with gonadotropins is often
successful, it requires a considerable investment of patient time and there is risk of ovarian

hyperstimulation and multiple pregnancy. These risks are
avoided with laparoscopic ovarian diathermy. An additional
advantage of laparoscopic ovarian diathermy is that consecutive ovulations occur without the need for further treatment.
The disadvantages are the need for a surgical procedure and
the possible long-term effect on ovarian function and creation of tubo-ovarian adhesions.
Since the advent of laparoscopic ovarian diathermy there
have been several reviews and case series in the literature,
totaling 1000 patients (4–7). Although ovulation rates are
often reported to be 80%, pregnancy rates vary from 20%
to 66%. Pregnancy rates with ovulation induction in women
with clomiphene-resistant PCOS are generally reported to be
40% (8). However, only one randomized controlled trial has
been published in the peer-reviewed literature that reported
similar pregnancy rates for gonadotropins and ovarian diathermy (9).
The aim of this study was to compare laparoscopic ovarian diathermy with three cycles of FSH in women who had
clomiphene citrate–resistant PCOS and who wished to conceive.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
A randomized controlled trial comparing two different
treatment modalities, namely laparoscopic ovarian diathermy and gonadotropin therapy, was undertaken. Women
were recruited from publicly funded and private tertiary
level fertility clinics in Auckland, New Zealand with some
additional fertility clinics entering women from other centers. The inclusion criteria for the study were as follows: 20
to 38 years of age, clomiphene citrate resistance (no ovulation after one or more cycles of 150 mg of clomiphene citrate
from day 2 to day 6 each month), infertility of 12 months
duration, polycystic ovaries on ultrasound scan according to
accepted criteria (10), a body mass index of 33 kg/m2 for
women of European descent and of 35 kg/m2 for women of
Pacific Island or NZ Maori descent, and normal semen
analysis (20 million per milliliter, 96% abnormal forms,
and 50% motility). Elevations of LH and androgen levels
were not inclusion criteria.
The exclusion criteria were other known causes of infertility, including male factor infertility or known tubal disease. The trial conditions were determined within the funding restrictions of a public fertility clinic. Tubal status in
women with anovulatory infertility was only established
after three ovulations had been induced with clomiphene
citrate or gonadotropins. Therefore not all women who were
randomized had had tubal status established.
Randomization was performed using computer-generated
sequences that were sealed in numbered opaque envelopes.
Randomization was not blocked. Women were randomized
to either group 1, which received laparoscopic ovarian diathermy, or group 2, which received three cycles of urinary
gonadotropins (Metrodin HP, Serono, Rome, Italy) or recombinant follicle-stimulating hormone (Puregon, Organon,
Oss, The Netherlands or Gonal F, Serono, Rome, Italy).
The laparoscopic ovarian diathermy was performed as
follows. The procedure was undertaken in the operating
theater under general anesthetic. Routine pneumoperitoneum
was achieved using a Verres needle, and the laparoscope was
introduced at the umbilicus. Two ports were used, one at the
suprapubic level and one in the left iliac fossa, both 5 mm.
Under laparoscopic control, each ovarian pedicle was
grasped using an atraumatic forcep. The ovary was mobilized and inspected. A monopolar electrocautery needle of 1
cm in length was used to drill 10 holes in each ovary. The
diathermy was done with cutting power at 30 units and was
continued for 10 seconds. Each ovary was then cooled with
irrigation fluid.
In group 2 three cycles of gonadotropin injections were
given. Initially only urinary gonadotropins were used, but
these became unavailable after 1998 and recombinant gonadotropins were then given. Initially, 75 IU/day (one ampoule) was given for 2 weeks, and serum E2 was measured
on day 8. If the E2 level was 200 IU, then gonadotropins
were continued at the same dose, with further serum E2
estimations every 3 days. When the E2 measured 500
mmol/L, an ultrasound scan was performed. An ultrasound
scan was then performed every 2 to 3 days until a follicle of
18 mm was measured. A 5,000-IU dose of human chorionic gonadotropin (Profasi, Serono) was used to trigger
ovulation unless ovulation had already occurred. The gonadotropin dose was increased on day 15 by half an ampoule
(37.5 IU) if the E2 was 200, and further increases of half
an ampoule per week (37.5 IU) occurred if the E2 level
remained low. Cycles were abandoned if more than three
follicles of 10 mm were recruited or if there was a suboptimal response.
Women in group 1 (who received laparoscopic ovarian
diathermy) were followed for 6 months. If no ovulation was
detected (by serum progesterone of 20 mmol/L) over the
6-month follow-up, treatment with three cycles of gonadotropins was offered. No further treatment was offered to
women from group 1 who ovulated during follow-up. All
women in group 2 who had not conceived at the end of three
cycles were offered laparoscopic ovarian diathermy.
The following outcome measures were collected and reported at 6 months. Ovulation rates were determined by
progesterone levels of 20 mmol/L in the luteal phase
(timed 21 days after spontaneous menstruation) for group 1
and by ultrasound in group 2. Pregnancy outcomes included
serum -hCG of 50 IU/L, fetal heart activity on ultrasound
scan, and birth after 20 weeks of gestation. Mean ovarian
volumes were calculated. Pretreatment and posttreatment
gonadotropin and androgen levels were collected. Spontaneous menstruations were recorded by diary in group 1 only.
Power calculations: it was estimated that 55% of women
FERTILITY & STERILITY 405
undergoing laparoscopic diathermy would conceive in the
6-month follow-up period (based on the results of a review
by Donesky and Adashi [6]) and that only 30% of women
having three cycles of gonadotropin therapy would conceive
(8). Twenty-seven women were required in each arm of the
study to detect a true difference at the 95% confidence level
with 80% power. Taking dropouts into account, it was estimated that 30 women would be needed in each arm of the
study to observe the difference described. Ethics committee
approval was received from the North Health Ethics Committee before the commencement of the study and for each
year of the study.
Statistical analysis was performed using SAS version
6.12 (SAS, Cary, NC). Frequency data were compared using
the 2
, Fisher’s exact, and McNemar’s (for paired data) 2
tests. Normally distributed continuous data were compared
using Student’s t test (paired for longitudinal data). Nonparametric continuous data and small samples were compared
using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. A P value of .05 was
required for statistical significance.
RESULTS
Fifty women were randomized to the two treatments
between mid 1996 and late 1999. The study was terminated
at this point because of both a lack of ongoing funding and
a decline in recruitment.
The baseline characteristics of women at the entry to the
study are presented in Table 1. The numbers of women in
each group are dissimilar because of unblocked randomization. There are no statistically significant differences between the two groups, with the exception of the proportion of
women who had length of infertility of 36 months (52% in
group 1 compared with 19% in group 2).
The analysis of all outcomes was on an intention to treat
basis. Three women were treated after only 11 months of
infertility as they had had previous infertility and treatment
for PCOS and met all other study criteria. There was one
treatment protocol violation in group 1 when one patient was
prescribed 50 mg of clomiphene citrate for 5 days in the
early follicular phase after only 2 months of follow-up and
this patient conceived but then miscarried. This patient has
been included in the final analysis under group 1.
Of the 29 women who were randomized to laparoscopic
ovarian diathermy, 1 withdrew after randomization. Of the
21 women who were randomized to gonadotropins, 2 withdrew after randomization (Fig. 1). The three women who
were randomized but subsequently chose not to proceed with
treatment were followed up 12 to 18 months later. None had
become pregnant. No major intraoperative or postoperative
complications occurred in group 1, and no cases of ovarian
hyperstimulation syndrome were diagnosed in group 2. One
patient in group 2 developed severe cystic acne in the follicular phase. The reproductive outcomes are presented in
Table 2. There was no demonstrable difference in the cumulative pregnancy rates at follow-up between the two treatment groups. There were no multiple pregnancies. Eight of
29 women (28%) in group 1 were pregnant over 6 months’
follow-up, and 7 of 21 (33%) women in group 2 were
pregnant after three cycles. The relative risk (95% confidence interval) for pregnancy at 6 months for group 1
compared with group 2 was 0.82 (0.36–1.93).
Of the eight women in group 1 who conceived during the
first 6 months, three had miscarriages, but all conceived
again without treatment within 12 months of surgery and
delivered healthy infants. In group 1, one further woman
conceived in the 6-month to 12-month follow-up period, and
three further women conceived in the 12-month to 24-month
follow-up period. Of the 19 women in group 1 who were
ovulating at 6 months, there was a total of 11 live births
within 24 months after treatment with laparoscopic ovarian
diathermy. Four women in group 1 who delivered infants
have subsequently conceived for a second time, one with
clomiphene citrate 21 months after laparoscopic ovarian
diathermy and three without further treatment at 30 months,
35 months, and 44 months after laparoscopic ovarian diathermy.
Nine women in group 1 who were not ovulating in the 6
months after surgery chose to undergo ovulation induction,
and three conceived during treatment. A further patient conceived spontaneously 4 months after completion of the last
cycle. For women in group 2 who were not pregnant after
three cycles of gonadotropins, 10 underwent laparoscopic
diathermy, and in the initial 6-month follow-up period, 1
became pregnant; in the 6-month to 12-month follow-up
period, 3 conceived; and in the 12-month to 24-month follow-up period, 2 conceived, including one twin pregnancy.
Combining results for women from both groups, 26 of 50
women (52%) conceived in the 24 months after commencing
treatment, not including 2 who conceived with IVF.
The endocrine and ultrasound outcomes are presented in
Tables 3 and 4. In 15 of 28 (54%) women who received
laparoscopic ovarian diathermy, ovulation was detected (luteal phase progesterone of 25 mmol/L), and 21 of 28
women (75%) menstruated spontaneously. For women in
group 2, ovulation was detected in 13 (81%) of the 16
women for whom data were available. The ovarian volume
in women who underwent laparoscopic ovarian diathermy
decreased from a pretreatment combined mean (standard
deviation) of 11.3 cm3 (5.7) to 9.4 cm3 (5.2) at 6 months
(P.05). Testosterone levels and number of follicles did not
change significantly from pretreatment levels. There was no
change in either acne or Ferriman Gallwey scores.
The body mass index for women who conceived was not
significantly different from that of women who did not
conceive, both within each treatment group and over all
women who did not conceive.
Nineteen women underwent both treatments and were
406 Farquhar et al. Trial of diathermy and gonadotropins Vol. 78, No. 2, August 2002
asked to compare the acceptability and convenience of the
two treatments. Of the 17 women who returned the questionnaires, 15 preferred laparoscopic ovarian diathermy, and
only 2 preferred ovulation induction with gonadotropins.
Comments on the questionnaire included statements that
laparoscopic ovarian diathermy was “easier and less traumatic” and “easier in the sense that you go through one
traumatic event only once.” However, one woman commented that “injection cycles provided more feedback and
control over what was happening” and that “the injections
were not particularly painful.”
The median (interquartile range) number of ampoules
used per cycle was 25 (17–38). Of 49 cycles, there were 20
abandoned cycles because of more than three follicles or
elevated E2 level, and 61% of women had one or more cycles
abandoned. Eighty-three percent of women had one or more
cycles triggered. Recombinant FSH was used in 8 of 49
cycles, and urinary gonadotropins were used in the other
cycles.

This randomized controlled trial has demonstrated that
laparoscopic ovarian diathermy has similar pregnancy outTABLE 1

comes to ovulation induction. It is the second randomized
controlled trial to be published in a peer-reviewed journal.
The first published trial has been criticized for being quasirandomized (9, 11). However, despite the study deficiencies,
the outcomes of the surgical and ovulation induction treatment were similar.
A systematic review that includes results from as-yet
unpublished trials has also demonstrated that the pregnancy
rates of the two treatments are similar, although there was a
higher multiple pregnancy rate in those women who received
gonadotropins than laparoscopic ovarian diathermy (12).
The pregnancy rate after six cycles of gonadotropins was
39%, which compares favorably with the 33% rate seen after
three cycles in our own study. Furthermore, in our study,
only 29 stimulated cycles occurred in 21 patients; 20 cycles
were abandoned because of either concern about an excessive number of follicles or a suboptimal follicular response.
This rate of abandonment may have contributed to the lower
than expected pregnancy rate but also has resulted in an
absence of multiple pregnancies.
Overall, the pregnancy rates in the published two randomized controlled trials (including this one) are lower than
those reported in the case series of laparoscopic ovarian
diathermy (9). For example, a review of 29 case series of 729
women reported a mean pregnancy rate of 56% (the length of
follow-up is not clear), suggesting that there may be other
factors than the ovarian diathermy accounting for their pregnancy rates (6). Individual case series report pregnancy rates
as high as 88% (13). This difference in outcomes between
trial data and case series has been reported in other examples
of new treatments and emphasizes the ongoing need for
careful evaluation of new treatments with randomized controlled trials (14).
The conclusions that can be made from this study are
limited by the small number of women recruited. The recruitment rate was lower than expected for a number of
reasons. Even though the regional gynecological endocrinology clinic was sited in the fertility clinic, the numbers of
available women were fewer than expected, possibly because of the inclusion criteria regarding body mass index and
the success of oral ovulation induction protocols. All eligible
women were approached, and women rarely declined to
enter the study. Recruitment was sought from the private
fertility clinics with only limited success because of the
FIGURE 1

perception that laparoscopic ovarian diathermy was a successful treatment and hence already widely used. The study
was further limited by the uneven numbers in the two groups
because of failure to anticipate low recruitment and prepare
for it by using block randomization. These difficulties, compounded by a failure to receive renewed funding, led to the
study being closed after 50 patients were recruited, 10 short
of the planned 60. In addition, the power calculations were
based on estimates from published literature and, in the case
of laparoscopic ovarian diathermy, were overly optimistic
(6).
The number of cycles of gonadotropins offered to women
with clomiphene citrate–resistant PCOS is generally determined by available resources. In our study, we were limited
to three cycles of gonadotropins because this is the number
funded in New Zealand. There are also discussions in the
literature about the number of “diathermy holes” that are
needed at the time of surgery. One study of 10 women
demonstrated that only four diathermy holes were needed in
one ovary (15). However, when planning this study, it was
decided that the more commonly used treatment protocol of
10 holes in each ovary was more prudent so as not to risk
having lower than expected pregnancy rates (5).
The consecutive spontaneous ovulations that result from
laparoscopic ovarian diathermy are perhaps one of the most
important advantages of this approach. This is confirmed by
this study, in which three women who miscarried conceived
shortly afterwards without the need for further treatment and
in which four women who had delivered infants are now
pregnant once again without need for gonadotropins. AlTABLE 2

though it is not the focus of this study, another potential
advantage of laparoscopic ovarian diathermy is the increased
responsiveness of the ovary to oral ovulation induction
agents after the procedure (16).
The other major advantage of laparoscopic ovarian diathermy is the ease and convenience of the treatment. The
majority of women who underwent both procedures stated
that they preferred the ovarian diathermy procedure over
ovulation induction with gonadotropins. The extent and duration of the effect of laparoscopic ovarian diathermy are not
established by this study. Furthermore, this study has not
established the long-term safety of the procedure, and concerns regarding premature menopause cannot be overlooked.
Questions have also been raised regarding tubo-ovarian adhesions after the procedure (17). The ongoing pregnancy rate
in the women who conceived after surgery, suggesting that
tubal function is preserved, is reassuring.
It is generally acknowledged that increased body mass
index in PCOS is associated with poorer reproductive outcomes (18). The reason for poorer outcomes is generally
attributed to insulin resistance (19). In the only other published trial of gonadotropins and laparoscopic ovarian diathermy, there was no exclusion on the basis of body mass
index (9). Access to publicly funded ovulation induction
with gonadotropins in New Zealand is limited to women
with a body mass index of 35 kg/m2
. Studies in New
Zealand have established distinct differences in body composition between New Zealand Maori and Pacific people and
Europeans and suggested new definitions of overweight and
obesity for New Zealand Maori and Pacific people, which is
the reason for the different criteria for ethnic groups in this
study (20, 21).
In conclusion, this study has demonstrated that laparoscopic ovarian diathermy is a safe and effective treatment for
women with clomiphene citrate–resistant PCOS. The pregnancy rates are lower than those reported by case series but
still are comparable to three cycles of ovulation induction
with gonadotropins. There are the obvious benefits of avoiding multiple pregnancies and hyperstimulation, and the risks
of the procedure can be balanced by the inconvenience and
need for careful monitoring with gonadotropins. The potential increased risk of premature ovarian failure is an ongoing
concern that will only be answered with long-term follow-up
of large numbers of women who have undergone the procedure.
