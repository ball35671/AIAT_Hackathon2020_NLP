Objective: To explore an optimal laser dose of transvaginal ultrasound–guided ovarian interstitial laser coagulation in management of anovulation in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).
Design: Randomized, controlled trial.
Setting: A reproductive medical center.
Patient(s): Eighty women with PCOS and clomiphene citrate–resistant infertility underwent ultrasound-guided
transvaginal ovarian interstitial yttrium aluminum garnet laser treatment. All subjects were divided randomly
into four groups of A, B, C, and D.
Intervention(s): Group A, one coagulation point per ovary; group B, two points; group C, three points; group D,
four to five points.
Main Outcome Measure(s): Postoperative ovulation rate, pregnancy rate, and some biochemical parameters.
Result(s): The rates of ovulation in groups C (75.00%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 51%–91%) and D (80.00%,
95% CI: 56%–94%) within 6 postoperative months were significantly higher than in groups A (5.00%, 95% CI:
0%–25%) and B (15.00%, 95% CI: 3%–38%). The pregnancy rates in groups C (45.00%, 95% CI: 23%–69%)
and D (40.00%, 95% CI: 19%–64%) also were significantly higher than in groups A (5.00%, 95% CI: 0–25%)
and B (10.00%, 95% CI: 1%–32%). The mean serum T levels were significantly lower in groups C (2.08
0.62 nmol/L) and D (2.07  0.42 nmol/L) compared with groups A (3.10  0.63 nmol/L) and B (2.95
0.63 nmol/L).
Conclusion(s): One and two intraovarian laser coagulation points per ovary are associated with poor outcomes.
Three points per ovary seem to represent the plateau of effective dose for the ovarian interstitial laser treatment
in PCOS. (Fertil Steril 2010;94:268–75. 2010 by American Society for Reproductive Medicine.)
Key Words: Anovulation, dose laser, ovarian interstitial, polycystic ovary syndrome, transvaginal, ultrasoundguided
In 2005, we designed and evaluated the effectiveness of the
transvaginal ultrasound–guided ovarian interstitial laser
treatment in 23 anovulatory women with clomiphene citrate
(CC)–resistant polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) as a new
method of ovulation induction in infertile women with
PCOS, with a >80% ovulation rate and 36% pregnancy
rate during 6 postoperative months (1). However, just as the
technique of laparoscopic ovarian diathermy or drilling applied in the management of anovulatory women with CC-resistant PCOS, in which a satisfactory treatment result usually
associates with the appropriate number of punctures made,
power setting, and duration of each puncture (2–6), an optimal outcome of ovarian interstitial laser treatment also
depends on the appropriate number of intraovarian laser
coagulation points. What is an optimal laser dosage applied
to the ovarian interstitial laser treatment? To explore an optimal laser dose for this new treatment protocol, we designed
the present randomized clinical trial to compare the effectiveness among women treated with different laser doses (number of ovarian interstitial coagulation points) and to try to
determine what is the optimal laser dose for women with
PCOS accepted for transvaginal ultrasound–guided ovarian
interstitial laser treatment.

a period of 30 months between January 2006 and June 2008.
The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of ShenZhen Maternity and Child Healthcare Hospital and the Institutional Review Board of Shen-Zhen Bureau of Science
and Technology of China. Subjects all signed an informed
consent form.
Sample Size
In a rough estimate before the study, the ovulation rates were
about 10% to 20% for the laser dose of one or two points per
ovary and 60% to 80% for three to five points. Therefore, the
sample size of 15 to 20 per group is the result calculated from
the comparison of multiple sample rates (a ¼ 0.05, b ¼ 0.10).
According to the guideline made by the Institutional
Review Board of Shen-Zhen Bureau of Science and Technology, the study had to be accomplished within 3 years. We calculated that, in our center, a sample size of 80 to 90 subjects
would need to be recruited over approximately a 30-month
period. We ended up with 80 patients in this study.
Subject Selection
Eighty patients with PCOS were enrolled by our clinicians
from our infertility treatment clinic between 2005 and 2008.
All women presented with oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea
and anovulation for at least 2 years and were seeking pregnancy. The mean ( SD) age was 29.1  3.1 years, and the
mean duration of infertility 3.3  2.0 years. The mean body
mass index was 22.9  3.5 kg/m2
. All subjects had polycystic
ovaries on transvaginal ultrasound scan (Aloka-1000,
UST-985, 5 MHz transvaginal probe; Aloka Co. Ltd, Tokyo,
Japan), and the diagnosis of PCOS was made referring to
the Rotterdam criteria (7). Serum concentrations of FSH
(6.5  1.4 IU/L), LH (13.7  4.6 IU/L), and T (2.9  0.75
nmol/L) were assessed at the third day of P-induced bleeding
(natural P injection; Guangzhou Minxin Pharmaceutical
Company, Guang-Zhou, China). Transvaginal ultrasound
scan examination revealed bilateral ovarian enlargement
and 10 to 30 subcapsular follicles of 2 to 8 mm in diameter
in a unilateral ovary with stromal hypertrophy. All patients
had received incremental CC doses (50, 100, and 150 mg), after which ovulation failed. A normal hysterosalpingography
or laparoscopy had to have been recorded in the past 3 years
before ovarian interstitial laser treatment. Any contraindications to surgery, previous treatment with laparoscopic ovarian
diathermy, and the presence of tubal or male factors for infertility were considered as exclusion criteria. The selection and
enrollment for each subject were decided by three clinicians
together. All subjects were informed that this procedure was
a new technique and that the optimal laser dose has not been
confirmed, although previously some patients were treated
by this technique for the same purpose with a good outcome.
During the selection procedure, five eligible subjects opted
not to participate when counseled about the possible risk,
and three other subjects who declined randomization were
excluded. Finally, 80 eligible patients were enrolled.
Randomization
First, 80 random numbers generated by means of computer
were divided randomly into four groups: A, B, C, and D.
Then, all subjects enrolled were arranged in an enrolled
date order, and at this time, the sequence of random numbers
became the sequence of all subjects. Therefore, 80 subjects
were divided randomly into groups A, B, C, and D. The random allocation sequence was concealed in a closed, dark-colored envelope until the surgeries were assigned, and
specifically just before entering the operating room. Randomization occurred after patients agreed to participate in the
study. After randomization, women who were allocated in
same group were given the same laser dosage during ovarian
interstitial laser treatment. For each group of A, B, C, and D,
the number of laser coagulation points made in their ovaries
was as follows: group A, one coagulation point per ovary;
group B, two points; group C, three points; group D, four
or five points. To each point, the size of the laser coagulation
zone was nearly 10 mm in diameter (a light spot of 10-mm
diameter on the ovarian plane monitored by transvaginal ultrasound). Each patient underwent the ovarian interstitial laser treatment performed by same experienced operator, who
assessed the size of each coagulation point and the operation
condition. The treating sequence of subjects was as same as
the sequence enrolled. The study was not double-blinded,
because the clinicians were aware of the treatment group.
Techniques of Ovarian Interstitial Laser Treatment
The procedure of transvaginal ultrasound–guided ovarian interstitial laser treatment has been detailed previously (1). All
participants were treated on the third day after P-induced
bleeding. An intramuscular injection of 50 to 100 mg of pethidine (pethidine hydrochloride injection; Shenyang First
Pharmaceutical, NEPG, Shen-Yang, China) was administered to each woman about 30 minutes before starting the operation. After emptying their bladder, the women were placed
in lithotomy position. They were then prepared with use of an
aseptic vulva and vaginal douche. The procedure proceeded
in the following four steps;
1. Location and puncture: The transvaginal probe was
moved from side to side to find the largest or the second
largest ovarian plane. The operator then punctured the
predetermined intraovarian point with the long 17-
gauge, 35-cm-long needle (K-OPS-1035-Cook IVF;
Brisbane, Australia). These points were always at least
10 mm distance from the surface of the ovary and 5 mm
from each other. If intraovarian coagulation occurred at
a spot 10 mm (actually a near sphere) in diameter away
from the ovarian surface, the coagulation was contained
to at least a 5-mm distance from the surface so that there
was minimal damage to the ovarian surface. Usually,
one to three intraovarian points can be predetermined
in the widest ovarian plane; in other words, one to three
laser coagulation points can be accomplished on the
widest ovarian plane. If not, the next largest ovarian
plane was chosen as the next option until some setting
Fertility and Sterility 269
laser coagulation points had been made in the unilateral
ovary.
2. The fiberoptic cable passes through the needle: After
aspiration of the fluid (blood or follicular fluid) present
inside the long needle, an assistant cut the soft tube connected to the long needle, and a fiberoptic cable of 400
mm in diameter was inserted into the long needle up to
the marked point. The tip of the fiberoptic cable had to
reach the tip of the long needle, so the operator could
draw the long needle back about 10 mm until the bare
fiber was out of the tip of the long needle.
3. Laser coagulation: The electrical laser (XH-YAG-100
Laser; Wuhan Xinghua Photoelectricty Co. Ltd.,
Wu-Han, China) was activated persistently for 2 to 5
minutes with a power of 3 to 5 W and current of 8 to
10 A, until a 10-mm light spot appeared on the ovarian
plane.
4. The fiberoptic cable withdrawal and relocation: The fiberoptic cable then was withdrawn carefully from the
long needle with care taken not to pull the needle out
of the ovary while withdrawing it toward the surface.
The next point was then located and punctured with repetition of the procedure as listed in steps 2 to 4. This
procedure continued until some treatment points on
the unilateral ovary were completed. The needle was
then withdrawn. This procedure was repeated on the
contralateral ovary as well. Ideally, there should only
be one puncture site on the surface of each ovary, and
care should be taken to minimize surface damage to
the ovaries. In group A, only one laser treatment point
was made per ovary; group B, two points; group C,
three points; and group D, four or five points. The
women stayed in bed for 2 to 3 hours after the surgery,
after which they were reexamined with a transvaginal
ultrasound scan to rule out intra-abdominal hemorrhage
before discharge.
Postoperative Monitoring
Serum hormone concentrations At the second, fourth, and
sixth month after the operation, a blood sample was taken
on day 3 of the menstrual cycle for measurement of serum
levels of LH, FSH, T, PRL, E2, and P if the women had a regular ovulation and menstrual cycle. If not, the blood sample
was taken on day 3 of P-induced withdrawal bleeding. Another blood sample was taken on day 21 of the same cycle
to measure the serum concentration of P when ovulation
could not be diagnosed by transvaginal ultrasound scan.
Follicle development and ovulation Follicular growth and
ovulation was monitored monthly by transvaginal ultrasound

scan at 4- to 5-day intervals after the operation. The scanning
was repeated after 2 to 3 days when the leading follicle
reached a diameter of 12 mm. When the dominant follicles
reached a diameter of 16 mm, LH surge was detected by urinalysis. Combining this result with transvaginal ultrasound
scan, ovulation and the timing of sexual intercourse could
be confirmed. If the ovulation intervals during the 6 postoperative months were within a range of 21 to 35 days, the woman
was documented as a responder having regular ovulation. If
spontaneous ovulation and menstruation did not occur during
6 postoperative months, the woman was categorized as a nonresponder. The women whose status was between both would
be categorized as having irregular ovulation.
Pregnancy and miscarriage A urine pregnancy test was performed if spontaneous menstruation did not occur during 16
to 19 days after ovulation. The pregnancy rate was calculated
on the basis of the women who conceived. Miscarriage would
be considered if a gestational sac of 7 to 8 pregnant weeks
was without cardiac action or previous cardiac action
stopped, although a urine pregnancy test was positive.
Adverse effects Adverse effects, including intra-abdominal
hemorrhage, infection, injuries of internal organs, and failure
of ovarian function, were recorded.
Analysis of the Data
The means  SD of the baseline and postoperative second,
fourth, and sixth month values among the four groups were
calculated for the serum LH, FSH, T, PRL, P, and E2 levels.
Analysis of variance to do an overall comparison between
groups (ANOVA) (Newman-Keuls method of q-test was
used to compare individual groups) and a linear test for trend
(linear regression) were used to see by how much the mean of
the outcome increased or decreased per dose. The ovulation
and pregnancy rates were calculated on the basis of the cases
of postoperative spontaneous ovulation and pregnancy. A c2
test for trend (or a linear-by-linear association test) was used
to compare the ovulation and conception proportions among
four groups (a fourfold table was used to compare individual
groups and P values would be corrected when 1%theoretical
frequency [T]<5), and a logistic regression was used to give
an odds ratio for each increase in dosage with 95% confidence intervals. The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS 13.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) was used for
statistical analyses. Statistical significance was set at P<.05.
RESULTS
The clinical and endocrinologic characteristics of the 80
women are shown in Table 1. Analysis of variance showed
no difference among groups A to D in these characteristics.
There were no losses to follow up.
Ovulation
The rates of ovulation from groups A to D, including subjects
with regular or irregular ovulation, were 5.00% (1 of 20),

15.00% (3 of 20), 75.00% (15 of 20), and 80.00% (16 of 20),
respectively. A c2 test for trend analysis showed a statistically
significant difference in incidences of ovulation among the
four groups of A through D (linear-by-linear association test,
P<.001) (see Fig. 1A). The rates of groups C and D were significantly higher than of groups A (P<.001; P<.001) and B
(P<.001; P<.001). With a logistic regression model analysis
to see the effect of dosage on ovulation, the odds ratio values
from group A to D were 1.000, 3.353, 7.550, and 4.234,
respectively. These results are listed in Table 2.
Conception
The conception rates for 6 postoperative months in groups A,
B, C, and D were 5.00% (1 of 20), 10.00% (2 of 20), 45.00%
(9 of 20), and 40.00% (8 of 20), respectively. Contingency table c2 test showed a statistically significant difference among
the four groups (linear-by-linear association test, P<.001).
The conception rates were significantly higher in groups C
and D than in groups A or B (Fisher’s exact test or linearby-linear association test, P<.05; P<.05) (see Fig. 1B). Via
a logistic regression model, the relationship between the dosage and pregnancy odds ratio from groups A to D was 1.000,
2.111, 3.943, and 2.233, respectively. These results are listed
in Table 2. One subject in group D decided to postpone pregnancy because of a family dispute, and the other woman in
group B had a miscarriage at pregnancy week 9.
Menstrual Pattern
All women in this study had oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea
before the treatment. After ovarian interstitial laser coagulation treatment, one woman in group C conceived before having the next menstrual cycle. A c2 test showed that the
frequencies of regular menstrual cycles were significantly different among the four groups (A through D) (P<.01). The frequencies of regular menstrual cycles were significantly higher
in groups C (11 of 20, 55.00%) and D (10 of 20, 50.00%) than
in groups A (1 of 20, 5.00%) (P<.01; P<.01) and B (2 of 20,
10.00%) (P<.01, P<.01) (see Fig. 1C).
Endocrine Changes
The postoperative endocrine values changed over time. The
trend of hormone levels is depicted in Figure 2. The serum
LH level, T level, and LH/FSH ratio reduced significantly
at 2, 4, and 6 months after ovarian interstitial laser treatment
(see Fig. 2A, C, and D). The mean level of the postoperative
endocrine values is presented in Table 3. An ANOVA showed
that the mean postoperative LH and T levels, as well as the
LH/FSH ratio, were statistically significantly different
among the four groups (P<.001; P<.001; P<.001). The
mean serum T levels were significantly lower in groups C
(2.08  0.62 nmol/L) and D (2.07  0.42 nmol/L) compared
with groups A (3.10  0.63 nmol/L) (P<.001; P<.001) and B
(2.98  0.63 nmol/L) (P<.001; P<.001). The mean LH value
and LH/FSH ratio in groups C and D also were significantly
lower than in groups A and B. See Table 3. A linear test for
trend (linear regression) shows that there was a linear regression relationship between the changes of several hormones
(independent variable) and increase of laser dose (dependent
variable). Each increase of dose with one point would decrease the mean LH level 2.238 IU/L (y ¼ 14.1752.238x,
R2 ¼ 0.918), the mean serum T level 0.671 nmol/L (y ¼
4.550.671x, R2 ¼ 0.925), and LH/FSH ratio value 0.411
(y ¼ 2.5850.411x, R2 ¼ 0.834).
Adverse Effects
All of the women finished their surgical procedure of ovarian interstitial laser treatment, and there were no adverse
events. The surgical procedure lasted approximately 35 to
40 minutes.
DISCUSSION
In this randomized clinical trial, we evaluated the effect of the
laser dose applied at ovarian interstitial laser coagulation
treatment on the clinical and biochemical outcome in 80
women with PCOS. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first series to report on the laser dose-response relationship of ovarian interstitial laser treatment.

In previous data published, the optimal clinical outcomes
of ovarian interstitial laser coagulation treatment to manage
the anovulatory women with PCOS-related infertility were
achieved by making three to five intraovarian coagulation
points per ovary with each point of diameter 10 mm (1).
The estimated volume of these three to five treatment points
is nearly 2 to 4 mL according to the sphere of diameter of
10 mm per point. In this study, the highest spontaneous ovulation (70%–80%) and pregnancy (40%–45%) rates within 6
postoperative months occurred in groups C (three points per
ovary) and D (four to five points), not in groups A (one point)
and B (two points). This indicated not only that three to five
treatment points per ovary is the optimal laser dose of ovarian
interstitial laser treatment but also that the technique described previously was reproducible and valid and need not
be changed. In terms of our observation it is difficult to
make six or more treatment points per ovary, because there
hardly is any clear ovarian plane to be found after five treatment points are made.
Laparoscopic ovarian diathermy as a traditional technique
has been used to manage anovulation in patients with CC-resistant PCOS infertility for the past 3 decades. The number of
punctures have varied markedly between three and 25 per
ovary with power settings between 30 and 400 W (2, 6).
Such a wide range of puncture points made in an ovary with
different outcomes in different studies can be explained by
the variation in techniques used in laparoscopic ovarian diathermy, including [1] using different instruments (e.g., needles, scissors, biopsy forceps) to deliver the energy to the
ovary; [2] applying a different amount of energy to the ovary
(measured in joules, equivalent to power in watts multiplied
by the duration of electricity applied in s per puncture); and
[3] distribution of the thermal energy, either localized to
a few holes or more widely spread over many holes with varying depths of penetration. Therefore, it is important that the
comparison between different studies of laparoscopic ovarian
diathermy should take into consideration the total amount of
thermal energy delivered to each ovary, not just the number
of holes made in the ovary. However, in this respect, the ovarian interstitial laser coagulation treatment is different when
compared with laparoscopic ovarian diathermy. First, the
size of the coagulation zone in the ovarian interstitium is
related positively to the thermal energy delivered to ovarian
interstitium and can clearly be monitored by transvaginal
ultrasound scan as a coagulation zone appearing in an ovarian
plane. Different laser doses yielded different sizes of the coagulation zone; in the other words, the different sizes of the
coagulation zones represented the different laser doses (the
power and persistent time). Second, the power used in ovarian
interstitial laser coagulation treatment usually is at 3 to 5 W
(1, 8), much lower than the power applied in laparoscopic
ovarian diathermy (30–400 W); therefore it is easier to control
the size of the coagulation zone in ovarian interstitial laser coagulation treatment than to control the damage range of the
hole made in laparoscopic ovarian diathermy. If the coagulation zone is of similar sizes, the different number of coagulation points will represent the different laser doses. Therefore,
only by analyzing (or controlling) the effect of number of laser
coagulation points made in each ovary on the clinical outcome
can we know the dose-response relationship of ovarian interstitial laser coagulation treatment.

It should be pointed out that the initial coagulation point
with a diameter of 10 mm on an ovarian plane may overrepresent the size of the real coagulation zone, because some
fluid or blood yielded during the procedure also appears as
strong light on the ovarian plane. The 10-mm diameter of
light spot is then possibly a mixture containing coagulation
tissue and fluid, and the real range of the coagulation zone
is revealed possibly several days after the fluid is absorbed.
However, in this study, we ignored this effect, and the size
of the coagulation zone used to judge the effect of the number of ovarian laser coagulation points on the outcome, including the clinical and endocrine outcome, was the size
shown by transvaginal ultrasound scan at the operation
time.
In this study, the application of one laser point per ovary in
group A was found to produce poor clinical or endocrine
change for 6 months after the operation; one treatment point
per ovary seems therefore to be an ineffective laser dose for
anovulatory patients with PCOS. Two laser points applied
per ovary (group B) also resulted in a significantly poorer outcome than the results seen in groups C and D in terms of restoration of menstrual regularity, spontaneous ovulation, and
conception rates. The two points per ovary probably does represent the threshold dose (i.e., the lowest dose at which a response could be seen). These clinical results also can be
explained in terms of the change in odds ratio values given
by logistic regression. The best clinical and endocrine outcome occurred in groups C (three points per ovary) and D
(four or five points), in which there was a nearly 80% spontaneous ovulation rate and 40% to 45% pregnancy rate during
6 postoperative months. As such the efficacy of transvaginal
ultrasound–guided ovarian interstitial laser treatment in the
management of anovulatory patients with PCOS is similar
to that of the traditional ovarian wedge resection and laparoscopic ovarian diathermy (9, 10). At the same time, we show
that three points per ovary is a plateau laser dose of ovarian
interstitial treatment, because the result of four or five points
per ovary was not significantly different from that achieved
with the application of three points. However, because four
or five treating points per ovary did not produce irreversible
damage to the ovary, it may not be excessive, but then we
do not know what an excessive laser dose for this new treatment method is.
Postoperative reduction of serum LH, LH/FSH ratio, and T
level occurred in three of four groups. In addition, it is of interest to note that the magnitude of the decrease in LH levels
and LH/FSH ratio after ovarian interstitial laser treatment
seems to be dose dependent, with the higher reduction being
achieved in groups C and D (three to five points per ovary).
A linear regression test showed a linear regression relationship between the increase of laser dose and decrease of the
mean serum LH, T level, and LH/FSH ratio. This may be explained by the greater reduction of serum T concentrations as
a result of greater destruction of the androgen-producing
ovarian stroma with higher laser dose (more number of laser
coagulation points). As the result, the serum estrogen level
decrease because of a reduction in androgen levels (androgens aromatize to estrogen) may be responsible for decreased
positive feedback on LH and decreased negative feedback on
FSH at the level of pituitary. The endocrine change after ovarian interstitial laser treatment is similar to the change of sex
hormones occurring after laparoscopic ovarian diathermy
described by Amer et al. (9). However, none of the groups
of women in our study showed postoperative increase of
the serum FSH level, probably because of the limited number
of laser points that can be applied. In this respect, the ovarian
interstitial laser treatment is different from laparoscopic ovarian diathermy, in which 15 to 25 punctures per ovary can be
made (11, 12). Too many treating points potentially may
cause excessive ovarian damage and result in an elevated
postoperative serum FSH concentration.
According to its pathophysiology, PCOS is manifested
clinically by both a hyperandrogenism and state of estrogen

excess, which can underlie a disorder of folliculogenesis with
increased follicular recruitment, but with an arrest of follicular development at the small antral stage (13). Theoretically,
the ovarian interstitial laser treatment should be more effective than laparoscopic ovarian diathermy in management of
anovulation in PCOS. This new technique decreased more
stroma tissue producing androgens than the laparoscopic
ovarian diathermy protocol by intraovarian interstitial laser
ablation instead of ovarian surface drilling. However, the
ovarian vasculature that distributes mainly in the myeloid tissue possibly will be damaged if intraovarian laser treatment
point is performed at the center of the ovary. Therefore, to
avoid damage to the ovarian vasculature, intraovarian hemorrhage, and premature ovarian failure, we suggest that the predetermined point of ovarian interstitial treatment had better
not be too close to the center of the ovary and the number
of treatment points not be many as well. A previous study
(14) showed that laparoscopic ovarian diathermy in women
with PCOS may result in a decrease in ovarian stromal blood
flow velocity. We do not known what the real influence of
ovarian interstitial laser, especially of the laser dose (the
number of ovarian interstitial laser treatment points), is on
the ovarian stromal blood flow. To answer this, a further study
is essential.
In conclusion, three coagulation points (with diameter of
10 mm per point) per ovary seems to be the plateau dose sufficient to produce an optimal outcome for ovarian interstitial
laser treatment in anovulatory women with PCOS. Reducing
the laser dose below that level is associated with poorer results and increasing the dose above it does not improve the
outcome.
