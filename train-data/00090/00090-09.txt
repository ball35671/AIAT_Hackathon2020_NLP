Abstract
Aim: To compare the effect of combined metformin and clomiphene citrate (CC) with laparoscopic ovarian
diathermy (LOD) meant for ovulation induction in CC-resistant women with polycystic ovary syndrome
(PCOS).
Methods: Two-hundred and eighty-two anovulatory women with CC-resistant PCOS were selected in this
randomized controlled trial. Patients (n = 138) received combined metformin–CC for up to six cycles or
underwent LOD (n = 144) with six months follow up. The outcome measures were: ovulation rate, midcycle
endometrial thickness, pregnancy and miscarriage rates.
Results: Ovulation occurred in 386/576 cycles (67%) in the combined metformin–CC group and 381/558
cycles (68.2%) in LOD group without a significant difference between the groups. Resumption of regular
menstruation was similar in both groups. A significant increase in midcycle endometrial thickness was
observed in the combined metformin–CC group (9.2  1.2 mm vs 7.6  1.1 mm) (P < 0.05). The pregnancy rate
was similar in both groups (15.4% vs 17%), and there were no statistically significant differences regarding the
miscarriage rate between both groups. Four twin pregnancies occurred in the metformin–CC group. No
ovarian hyperstimulation occurred in either group.
Conclusions: Combined metformin–CC and LOD are equally effective for inducing ovulation and achieving
pregnancy in CC-resistant PCOS patients.
Key words: clomiphene resistance, laparoscopic ovarian diathermy, metformin, ovulation induction, polycystic ovary syndrome.
Introduction
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common cause
of infertility and is associated with chronic anovulation
and hyperandrogenemia. It affects 7–8% of reproductive age women.1 Clomiphene citrate (CC) is still
holding its place as the first-line therapy for ovulation
induction in these patients;2 however, the use of CC may
be associated with poor cervical mucous and endometrial thinning in 15–50% of patients due to
prolonged estrogen-receptor depletion in the
endometrium and possibly in the cervix.3–5 Furthermore, clomiphene resistance, that is, failure to ovulate
after receiving 150 mg/day, is common and occurs in
approximately 15–40% of women with PCOS.6,7
Approximately 50–70% of all women with PCOS have
some degree of insulin resistance. Hyperinsulinemia
probably contributes to the hyperandrogenism that is

responsible for the signs and symptoms of PCOS.8 Metformin, a biguanide, is now the most widely used
insulin sensitizer for ovulation induction in women
with PCOS. Furthermore, many reports have confirmed
that its addition to CC in CC-resistant PCOS was highly
effective in achieving induction of ovulation.9–14
Although treatment with gonadotropins is often successful in these patients, they are expensive and have the
risk of ovarian hyperstimulation (OHSS) and multiple
pregnancy.15 Laparoscopic ovarian diathermy (LOD) is
currently accepted as a successful second-line treatment
for ovulation induction in CC-resistant PCOS.2,6,15–17
Bayram et al.
16 compared LOD with recombinant FSH in
168 CC-resistant women with PCOS in a randomized
trial. They reported an ovulation rate of 70% and 69%
per cycle, pregnancy rates of 37% and 75%, and livebirth rates of 34% and 60%, respectively, following LOD
and FSH therapy. Nevertheless, LOD is costly and
requires hospital treatment and general anesthesia, and
carries the risk of postoperative adhesions and premature ovarian failure in inexpert hands.18
To our knowledge, no studies have yet compared the
effects of combined metformin–CC with LOD in
CC-resistant PCOS patients. The aim of this prospective, randomized trial was to compare the efficacy of
combined metformin–CC administration for six cycles
to that of LOD for ovulation induction in CC-resistant
infertile women with PCOS.
Patients and Methods
Patients
The study population was comprised of 282 women
with CC-resistant PCOS among those attending the
Outpatient Clinic in Mansoura University Hospitals,
Mansoura University, Egypt, and a private practice
setting in the period from September 2005 to February
2009. Diagnosis of PCOS was based on the revised
2003 Rotterdam consensus on diagnostic criteria and
long-term health risks related to PCOS.19 All women
were previously treated with 150 mg of CC daily for
five days per cycle, for at least three cycles with persistent anovulation (i.e. they were deemed to be
CC-resistant). They had patent Fallopian tubes proved
by hysterosalpingography and normal semen analysis
for their partners, according to the modified criteria of
World Health Organization.20 All patients had normal
serum prolactin, thyroid-stimulating hormone and
17-hydroxyprogesterone. Exclusion criteria were other
causes of infertility, age >40 years, contraindications to
general anesthetic and women who had received metformin, gonadotrophin or oral contraceptives during
the preceding six months. All women were instructed
to maintain their usual lifestyle and eating habits
during the study. The study was approved by Mansoura University Hospital Research Ethics Committee
and all participants gave informed consent before
inclusion in the trial.
Women were randomized according to a computergenerated random numeric table. Opaque envelopes
that were numbered and sealed containing the allocation information were given to a third party (a nurse)
who assigned patients to study arms: group A (treated
with combined metformin–CC) or B (treated with
LOD).
Protocols and treatments
In group A, all patients received metformin HCl
(Cidophage; Chemical Industries Development, Cairo,
Egypt) 500 mg thrice daily for 6–8 weeks. After the end
of this period, they received 100 mg CC (Clomid; Global
Napi Pharmaceuticals, Cairo, Egypt) for 5 days starting
from day 3 of spontaneous or induced menstruation.
With anovulation, it was increased by 50 mg for the next
cycle. If patients ovulated in six subsequent cycles,
became pregnant or experienced anovulation with
150 mg CC, no further treatment was given. They then
completed the study according to the protocol. Metformin was stopped only when pregnancy was documented. All patients were monitored by transvaginal
ultrasound for the mean follicular diameter and
endometrial thickness on days 10, 12 and 14 of the cycle.
Serum progesterone (ng/mL) was measured on days
21–23 of the cycle by radioimmunoassay using the
antibody-coated tube method (Coat-A-Count; Diagnostic Product Corporation, LosAngeles, CA, USA); hCG (a
total of 10 000 IU IM, Choriomon; IBSA, Lugano, Switzerland) was given when one follicle measuring at least
18 mm was found. Patients were advised to have intercourse 24–36 h after hCG injection. A rising serum
b-hCG two weeks after the hCG injection in the absence
of menstruation and sonographic evidence of an intrauterine gestational sac at 6 weeks’ gestation were considered adequate criteria to define a pregnancy. The
pregnant women were followed up to obtain the miscarriage rate.
In the LOD group (group B), laparoscopy was performed using the three-puncture technique. Each
ovary was cauterized at four points, each for 4 s at
40 W for a depth of 4 mm with a mixed current, using
a monopolar electrosurgical needle (Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany). The pelvis was irrigated using

Ringer’s lactated solution. The total duration of the
procedure was recorded, and intraoperative and postoperative complications were reported. Follow up continued for six months after the procedure. The women
were asked to keep a record of their menstrual cycles.
If menstruation occurred within six weeks of the
surgery, a blood sample would be taken on day 21 of
the same cycle for measurement of the serum progesterone concentration. Ovulation was diagnosed when
the serum progesterone level was 5 ng/mL. Subsequent cycles were monitored for ovulation by transvaginal ultrasound for the mean follicular diameter
and endometrial thickness on days 10, 12 and 14 of the
cycle and serum progesterone on days 21–23 of the
cycle. All patients who showed ovulation were advised
to undertake natural intercourse. A rising serum
b-hCG in the absence of menstruation, plus sonographic evidence of an intrauterine gestational sac at
6 weeks’ gestation were considered adequate criteria
to define a pregnancy. If normal ovulation was
restored within the next 8 weeks for six subsequent
cycles, no further treatment was given. If anovulation
persisted after LOD, as evidenced by low progesterone
levels or lack of menstruation, or if the patient became
anovulatory again, they were counseled for further
lines of treatment.
The primary outcome measure was the ovulation
rate and midcycle endometrial thickness (mm). Secondary outcome measures included the pregnancy and
miscarriage rates.
Sample size was based upon the fact that with an
expected rate of ovulation of 70% in the LOD group,16
we needed 244 women to show an absolute increase of
15% in ovulation rate in the combined metformin–CC
group, with a power of 80% at confidence intervals of
95% using a two tailed c2
-test with a 5% significance
level (type a error). Data obtained were statistically
analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences
(SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA) software version 15.0 for
Windows. The means were analyzed using the
unpaired Student’s t-test, while proportions were analyzed using the c2
-test. A P-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Comparisons of the
baseline characteristics between ovulatory and anovulatory women in each group were made using the
Mann–Whitney U-test.
Results
A total of 282 patients were studied, 138 women (576
cycles) and 144 women (558 cycles) in groups A and B,
respectively (Fig. 1). There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups regarding
age, duration of infertility, anthropometric variables,
clinical manifestations, hormonal profiles or ultrasound findings of PCOS (Table 1). The duration of LOD
was 27.3  4.1 min, and no intra-operative or postoperative complications occurred.
Clinical and reproductive outcomes are presented in
Table 2. Ovulation occurred in 386 out of 576 cycles
(67%) in group A and 381 out of 558 cycles (68.2%) in
group B without significant difference between both
groups. Resumption of regular menstruation was
similar between the two treatment groups, and there
was no statistically significant difference in pretreatment endometrial thickness between the two groups.
A significant increase in midcycle endometrial thickness was observed in group A (9.2  1.2 mm vs
7.6  1.1 mm) (P < 0.05). Pregnancy occurred in 89 out
of 576 cycles (15.4%) in group A and 95 out of 558
cycles in group B (17%) and the difference was not
statistically significant. Four twin pregnancies occurred
in group A and none in group B. No higher order pregnancies or cases of OHSS occurred in either group.
Thirteen patients (9.4%) in the metformin–CC group
suffered gastrointestinal side effects (mainly nausea
and vomiting), but continued therapy. The miscarriage
rate was similar between both groups.
The baseline characteristics of ovulatory and anovulatory patients after combined metformin–CC or LOD
are reported in Table 3. Ovulatory women in both
groups showed significantly lower baseline body mass
index (BMI), lower testosterone, higher sex hormone
binding globulin (SHBG) and thus lower free androgen index (FAI) (P < 0.05). In group A, the baseline
fasting insulin was statistically significantly higher and
the fasting glucose/insulin ratio was statistically significantly lower (P < 0.05) in ovulatory patients compared with those who remained anovulatory after
treatment. In group B, the duration of infertility was
significantly lower, while the luteinizing hormone
(LH)/follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) ratio was significantly higher in ovulatory than in anovulatory
women (P < 0.05). No statistically significant differences regarding other parameters were found.
Discussion
Clomiphene citrate is not equally effective in all situations for the induction of ovulation or superovulation.
Lifestyle modification, especially weight reduction and

exercise to reduce the waist circumference and body
weight, is also an effective treatment for ovulation
induction in PCOS patients.21 Throughout the study, no
changes in diet or physical activity were implemented.
According to our protocol, the subjects were instructed
to follow their usual diet and physical activity to avoid
the effect of these co-intervention confounders that
might have biased the study results. Traditional alternatives in the case of CC-resistance PCOS include
gonadotropins and LOD. Aromatase inhibitors, such
as letrozole, have attracted attention as promising
drugs that could challenge CC for ovulation induction
in anovulatory women with PCOS. Inhibition of the
aromatase system results in a decrease in aromatization of androgens into estrogens, and releases the
hypothalamic–pituitary axis from negative estrogenic
feedback; however, this effect is reduced later in the
follicular phase because of its relatively shorter halflife (about two days) than CC (more than a month).22
In view of the absence of down-regulation of the
hypothalamic–pituitary estrogen receptors during the
late follicular phase, adverse effects on peripheral
organs, such as the endometrium and cervix, are considerably less, and might be associated with good
pregnancy rates with a lower incidence of multiple
pregnancies than CC due to achievement of monofollicular ovulation.22 In a recent randomized trial, two
letrozole regimens (short-course i.e. 5 days vs longcourse i.e. 10 days) were compared for efficacy in 218
clomiphene citrate–resistant women with PCOS.23 No
significant difference in ovulation rate (65.7% vs
61.8%) or endometrium thickness was reported
between the groups; however, a significantly lower
pregnancy rate per cycle was reported in the shortFigure 1 Flow chart of the participants in the trial. CC, clomiphene citrate; LOD, laparoscopic

course regimen when compared with the long-course
one (12.4% vs 17.4%). One twin pregnancy occurred
with the long-course regimen. A longer exposure to
letrozole provides a longer period of elevated FSH
levels in which follicular development can occur,
which may account for the higher pregnancy rate with
the long-course regimen. However, it also allows for
multiple follicles to develop and may result in a higher
rate of multiple pregnancies.23
Laparoscopic ovarian diathermy has been established as an effective second-line method of ovulation
induction in CC-resistant PCOS patients, being as
effective as gonadotrophin treatment and not associated with an increased risk of multiple pregnancy or
OHSS.2,6,15–17 The main drawbacks of LOD are the need
for general anesthesia and the risk of postoperative
adhesions.18 The assertion that it might affect the
ovarian reserve is not more than a theoretical concern
since a recent report concluded that LOD, when
applied properly, does not seem to compromise the
ovarian reserve in women with PCOS.24
Insulin resistance, compensatory hyperinsulinemia
and an increase in androgen production are all linked
together in PCOS patients. This pathophysiology
was the rationale for using insulin-sensitizing drugs
to lower circulating insulin levels and ameliorates
hyperandrogenemia in an attempt to restore normal
ovulation.25 Furthermore, the beneficial effects of

combined metformin–CC therapy have been reported
in CC-resistant PCOS patients.9–14 Actually, different
mechanisms explaining why metformin therapy
would facilitate ovulation induction by CC in
CC-resistant PCOS patients have been proposed. Kocak
et al.
10reported that the increased response to CC may
be obtained due to an intrinsic alteration of follicle
steroidogenesis caused by the effect of metformin pretreatment on the insulin-like growth factor-I pathway
in granulosa cells. Meanwhile, Attia et al.
26 found that
metformin improves ovulation by direct inhibition of
androgen production in human ovarian thecal cells.
Others reported that metformin administration led to a
reduction in the adrenal steroidogenesis response to
adrenocorticotropic hormone in women with PCOS.27
A recent explanation to the ovulatory response to metformin is its central action on the pituitary gland with
LH-lowering and prolactin effects in the women with
PCOS.28
In the present study, ovulation occurred in 386 out of
576 cycles (67%) in group A, which is comparable to
62.5% reported recently by Ben Ayed et al.,29 as well as
by Malkawi and Qublan,11 who had ovulatory rate of
68.6%, but less than that reported by Vandermolen
et al.
9 with an ovulatory rate of 75% following six treatment cycles of combined metformin–CC versus 25%
and 27% in placebo–CC controls. Pregnancy was
achieved in 89 out of 576 cycles (15.4%) in group A,
which is less than that reported by Vandermolen et al.
9
and Malkawi and Qublan,11 who had 55% and 56.3%,
respectively. This may be explained by the small
sample size in those trials. Another recent trial by
Kazerooni et al.
14 compared metformin–CC versus
placebo–CC in 37 CC-resistant PCOS patients. They
reported an impressive ovulatory rate of 88.9% in the
metformin group versus 21% in the placebo group, and
a pregnancy rate of 16.6% versus 0%; however, they
admitted their limited trial power and asked for
further larger studies.
In this study, four twin pregnancies occurred in
group A and none in group B. Actually, LOD has been
reported to resume physiological monofollicular ovulation with no risk of OHSS or multiple pregnancy.2,15,16
On the other hand, a multiple pregnancy rate of 8–13%
was reported with CC, the vast majority being twin
pregnancies. Clomiphene citrate results in central
estrogen receptor depletion for a lengthy time because
of the long half-time and slow clearance of its
zu-isomer (more than a month). As a result, supraphysiological levels of estrogen can occur without
central suppression of FSH because the normal

estrogen receptor-mediated feedback mechanisms are
blocked. This results in multiple follicle growth and
subsequently higher multiple pregnancy rates.30 In this
study, a significant increase in midcycle endometrial
thickness was observed in the metformin–CC group.
The same finding was reported by others who concluded that a higher endogenous estradiol level is
responsible for increased endometrial thickness and
an improved cervical score in the metformin–CC
group.10,14
To our knowledge, no studies have yet compared the
effects of combined metformin–CC with LOD
in CC-resistant PCOS patients. Two studies are available in the literature that compared the efficacy of metformin as a single treatment for three and six months,
respectively, with LOD in the treatment of CC-resistant
women with PCOS.31,32 In those trials, CC was added if
spontaneous ovulation or pregnancy was not achieved
within that time. A third recent trial by Ashrafinia
et al.
33 also compared the efficacy of metformin alone
for six months without adding CC with LOD in
CC-resistant women with PCOS. They reported that
treatment with metformin or LOD appears to have the
same effect on menstrual irregularity and hirsutism
and asked for further studies for the assessment of
ovulation, pregnancy rates and spontaneous abortion.
The current study showed no significant difference in
the miscarriage rate between both groups. Our findings
are consistent with the results of a recent systematic
review of 17 randomized controlled trials published up
to June 2008 and subsequent meta-analysis evaluating
the effect of pregestational metformin administration
on the abortion risk in PCOS patients. Overall, metformin was found to have no effect on the abortion
risk in PCOS patients when administered before
pregnancy.34
The safety of metformin has sparked a heated debate.
Recent evidence that metformin is probably safe
during the first trimester of pregnancy and beyond is
accumulating;35,36 however, the cost of treatment is
another issue. The cost of combined metformin–CC per
cycle is much lower compared with the hospital
charges needed for LOD (50 vs 1500 Egyptian pounds,
respectively). On the other hand, LOD may be more
cost-effective, because one treatment, in principle,
results in several ovulatory cycles, whereas one course
of metformin–CC therapy yields a single ovulatory
cycle.
In the secondary analysis of our study, we found that
all patients with a lower baseline BMI (24.8  1.7) ovulated with the metformin–CC treatment. This finding is
consistent with previous data from the literature,37,38
and supports the current recommendation to optimize
the BMI first before commencing any ovulation induction regimen.2,21 Ovulatory women in group A were
significantly more insulin resistant than anovulatory
women. These data are in line with that reported by
others supporting the common mechanism of action
for metformin in PCOS as directly related to improvement of insulin sensitivity or reduction of circulating
insulin levels.25 Ovulatory women in group A were less
hyperandrogenic than anovulatory women. This observation has been reported in other studies.39,40 Anovulatory women in group B were found to have a higher
baseline BMI (32.2  2.8), long duration of infertility
(5.2  1.6 years), more hyperandrogenism and a lower
LH/FSH ratio. These findings are in line with those
reported by others.41,42
Conclusion
In conclusion, this trial showed that up to six cycles of
combined metformin–CC and LOD (during the six
month follow-up period) are equally effective for
inducing ovulation and achieving pregnancy in
patients with CC-resistant PCOS. In addition, our
observations may help in counseling those patients
through a step-wise protocol. It is of utmost importance that all obese women with PCOS should first be
placed on an active exercise and weight-loss program
before any treatment is offered. In view of the invasiveness and cost of surgery, it seems plausible that combined metformin–CC therapy should be tried first for
young women with PCOS with previous CC-resistance
before resorting to LOD, especially in developing
countries where patients have financial constraints. It is
preferable, but clinically difficult, to select insulinresistant women. On the other hand, the metforminclomiphene protocol or LOD with a six-month
follow-up period is time consuming and may not be
ideal for women aged >35 years and for whom time is
of the essence and rapid establishment of pregnancy is
desired, so more rapid treatment protocols such as
gonadotrophins or in vitro fertilization and embryo
transfer should be considered.
