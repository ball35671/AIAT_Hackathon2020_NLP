OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of laparoscopic ovarian diathermy (LOD) vs clomiphene citrate
(CC) plus metformin in infertile patients with CC-resistant polycystic
ovary syndrome (PCOS).
STUDY DESIGN: Fifty primary infertile patients with CC-resistant PCOS
were assigned randomly to receive LOD followed by a 6-month observation (group A) or 6-cycle course of CC plus metformin (group B). Reproductive and safety outcomes were analyzed.
RESULTS: No significant difference between 2 groups in pregnancy
(15/92 women [16.3%] vs 14/107 women [13.1%]; P  .521) and
live-birth (13/92 women [14.1%] vs 12/107 women [11.2%]; P 
.536) rates per cycle was observed. With the use of a Cox regression
analysis, patients under medical treatment, compared with patients
who received surgical treatment, had a relative risk of pregnancy of 1.2
(95% confidence interval, 0.61–2.44; P  .582) and a relative risk of
live-birth of 1.4 (95% confidence interval, 0.63–2.96; P  .425).
CONCLUSION: LOD and CC plus metformin seem to be 2 effective approaches to treat infertility in patients with CC-resistant PCOS.

anovulatory patients with polycystic ovary syndrome: a randomized controlled trial. Am J Obstet Gynecol 2010;202:577.e1-8.
Laparoscopic ovarian diathermy (LOD)
has been proposed as a first-,1,2
second-,3 and third-line4 option in
anovulatory women with polycystic
ovary syndrome (PCOS). To date, clinical evidences confirmed the efficacy of
LOD as second-line treatment in patients with clomiphene citrate (CC)-
resistant PCOS.5 In fact, LOD is comparable with gonadotropins in terms of
ongoing pregnancies, miscarriages,
and live births with few side-effects, no
need of ongoing monitoring, lower
risk of multiple pregnancies, and lower
costs.6-8
On the other hand, several data have
been published recently regarding the
use of CC, which was the first agent to
be used for ovulation induction, and
metformin, which is a drug with insulin-sensitizing action that is used
widely for the treatment of type-2 diabetes mellitus, in the treatment of
anovulatory patients who are affected
by PCOS.
Even if it is still unclear which is the
best first-line drugs,9,10 some data suggest the efficacy of CC plus metformin
combination as second-line strategy in
the treatment of anovulatory infertility
in patients with PCOS with known resistance to CC.11,12 In this regard, in a recent metaanalysis,11 the authors concluded that the combination of CC plus
metformin was the preferred treatment
option before starting with LOD or follicle-stimulating hormone. Furthermore, this statement was not based on
the direct comparison between LOD and
CC plus metformin combination, but
only on the interpretation of previous
data that showed the high efficacy of
metformin vs LOD and of CC plus
metformin vs metformin. Previous
data2,3,5,11 seemed to suggest a theoretic
superiority of LOD over CC plus metformin in the treatment of anovulatory
infertility in CC-resistant women with
PCOS, given a clinical pregnancy rate of
approximately 60% vs approximately
40%, respectively. Thus, a direct comparison between surgical and medical
strategy, which is not available presently
in literature, is needed.
Based on these considerations, the aim
of the present randomized controlled
trial (RCT) was to compare LOD with
CC plus metformin in patients with CCresistant PCOS.

METHODS
The procedures that were used during
the study were in accordance with the
guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki
on human experimentation and of the
Good Clinical Practice guidelines. The
study protocol was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Department of
Gynecology & Obstetrics, University
“Magna Graecia” of Catanzaro, and submitted to the website for clinical trial
(www.clinicaltrials.gov, identifier no.
NCT00558077).
The purpose of the protocol was explained carefully to each woman, and a
written consent was obtained before the
study was begun.
Subjects
Between February 2003 and May 2004, a
total of 50 primary infertile anovulatory13 CC-resistant women with PCOS
and seeking pregnancy were enrolled. All
patients were referred to 1 of the 2 Academic Departments of Gynecology.
The diagnosis of PCOS was made initially according to the National Institutes
of Health14 criteria by the presence of
both clinical and/or biochemical hyperandrogenism and oligoanovulation,
although all patients also fulfilled the European Society for Human Reproduction and the American Society of Reproductive Medicine criteria.15 Chronic
anovulation was diagnosed by a serum
luteal progesterone assay (value 2
ng/mL for at least 2 previous consecutive
cycles); clinical hyperandrogenism was
defined as a Ferriman-Gallwey16 score
8, and biochemical hyperandrogenism
was defined as serum total testosterone
levels 2 SDs above our reference mean
values.
CC-resistance was defined as failure to
ovulate at a maximal dosage of 250 mg
daily with the use of a classic incremental
regimen. In particular, CC was given for
5 days, beginning cycle day 3 after a progesterone-induced withdrawal bleeding
with a starting dose of 50 mg daily. If
ovulation did not occur, the dose was increased by 50 mg in successive cycles until ovulation was achieved or up to a
maximal dose of 250 mg daily.
The following exclusion criteria was
used for all subjects: ages 18 or 35
years; body mass index (BMI), 35 kg/
m2
; neoplastic, metabolic (which included diabetes mellitus as excluded by
fasting glucose level 126 mg/dL [SI,
6.99 mmol/L], or 2-hour oral glucose
tolerance test (value, 200 mg/dL [SI,
11.10 mmol/L]);17 endocrine, hepatic,
renal, and cardiovascular disorders or
other concurrent medical illnesses; and
current or previous use of any drug that
affected hormone levels, metabolism, or
appetite (a wash-out period of at least 3
months was considered appropriate before enrolment).
Other exclusion criteria were organic
pelvic diseases, previous pelvic surgery,
suspected peritoneal factor infertility/
subfertility, and tubal or male factor infertility or subfertility that was excluded
by hysterosalpingogram and semen
analysis, respectively.
We also excluded those women who
wanted to start a diet or a specific program of physical activity, cigarette smokers, or alcoholic beverage abusers.
Protocol and interventions
At study entry, all subjects underwent
clinical evaluations that included venous
blood drawing to evaluate a complete
hormonal assay and fasting serum glucose and insulin levels.
Clinical evaluation consisted of anthropometric measurements (which included height, weight, BMI and waist-tohip ratio) and Ferriman-Gallwey score.
Body height and weight were measured
without shoes and clothes, respectively.
BMI was measured as the ratio between
weight and the square of the height,
whereas waist-to-hip ratio was calculated as the ratio between the smallest
torso circumference and hip circumference. All measurements were performed
with the patients in a standing position
with relaxed abdomen, arms at their
sides, and joined feet. The FerrimanGallwey score was calculated by the standard method.16
During the same visit, the patient’s daily
physical activity, job, and daily activities
were evaluated by means of a semiquantitative questionnaire,18 and a transvaginal
ultrasonography was performed.
Blood samples were obtained in the
morning between 8:00 and 9:00 am after
12-hour overnight fasting and bed rest
during the early proliferative phase (day
2-3) of the progesterone-induced withdrawal uterine bleeding. In anovulatory
women, uterine bleeding was induced
with a single dose of 100 mg natural progesterone intramuscularly.
Complete hormonal assays that consisted of follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, thyroid-stimulating
hormone, prolactin, progesterone, 17--
estradiol, 17-OH-progesterone, testosterone, androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, and sex-hormone binding
globulin were evaluated as previously reported.19 The homeostasis model of assessment (fasting glucose [millimoles per
liter]  fasting insulin (microunits per
milliliter) 22.5],20 the fasting glucose-toinsulin ratio (milligrams per 10–4 units),21
and the free androgen index (testosterone
[nanomoles per liter]/sex-hormone binding globulin  100])22 were calculated in
each subject.
The subjects were allocated randomly
into 2 treatment arms of 25 patients each
(groups A and B). The randomization
was achieved with online software
(www.randomization.it) to generate a
random allocation sequence in single
block as the method of restriction. The
random allocation sequence was concealed in sealed dark envelopes until the
interventions were assigned.
Group A underwent LOD followed by
6 cycles of observation; group B received
CC plus metformin for 6 cycles.
LOD procedures were performed by
experienced operators. Briefly, according to ovary size, 3-6 punctures of
approximately 3 mm diameter and approximately 4-5 mm in depth were performed on each ovary by insertion of an
insulated needle cautery of 36 mm as
perpendicularly as possible to the ovarian surface with a cutting current of
100-W power.23Then, the needle was activated for 2-3 seconds on each point
with a coagulating current of 40-W
power.23 At completion of the procedure, the ovarian surface was washed
with a crystalloid solution, and all injured areas were covered completely
with hyaluronic acid gel to avoid ovarian
adhesion formation.24 Based on clinical
conditions, patients were discharged eiResearch Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility www.AJOG.org

ther the same day of the surgical procedure or postoperative day 1.
CC was administered with a classic incremental regimen that was similar to
those used in the prestudy phase (detailed earlier).
Metformin was started from day 1 of a
progesterone-induced withdrawal bleeding with a dose of 850 mg (1 tablet daily),
and the dosage was increased after 1
week up to 1700 mg/day (2 tablets daily).
Metformin was taken before lunch during the first week and thereafter before
lunch and dinner. All subjects who became pregnant throughout the study
suspended metformin.
In this study, no drugs to trigger ovulation were used. All subjects, in the
absence of spontaneous withdrawal
bleeding after 35 days from last progesterone-induced uterine bleeding and after exclusion of a pregnancy with a serum -human chorionic gonadotropin
assay, received a further dose of 100 mg
natural progesterone intramuscularly.
Throughout the study, all subjects
were advised not to diet or modify physical activity; to the contrary, they were
instructed to follow their usual diet and
physical activity.
Follicle growth was not monitored.
However, each patient was motivated
and instructed to have sexual intercourse
regularly. Specifically, it was suggested to
have intercourse at least 4 times per cycle
(intercourse once every 3 days) starting
on day 9 after the progesterone-induced
or spontaneous uterine bleedings.
The duration of the study was 15
months for each patient. All women
were observed for 6 months. Those who
conceived were observed until the end of
the pregnancy (for up to further 9
months) to obtain live-birth data for
each treatment arm.
Reproductive outcomes
During the study, all reproductive events
were recorded for each patient. At the
end of the study, spontaneous cycle,
pregnancy and live-birth rates per cycle,
cumulative pregnancy, multiple pregnancy, miscarriage, and live-birth rates
were calculated in each treatment group.
The ovulation was assessed by plasma
progesterone assay (10 ng/mL [SI: 32
nmol/L]) that was performed 21 days
after spontaneous or progesterone-induced bleeding (7 days before the expected menses); rising -human chorionic gonadotropin and sonographic
evidence of intrauterine gestational sac
were considered to be criteria to define
pregnancy.
The ovulation, pregnancy, and livebirth rates per cycle were calculated as
the percentage of ovulatory cycles, pregnancies, and live-births per total observed cycles, respectively.
Cumulative pregnancy and live-birth
rates were defined as percentage of pregnant patients and patients who had a live
baby, respectively, per total patients. The
cumulative pregnancy and live-birth
rates were also calculated according to
time to the first event.
Multiple pregnancy rate was defined as
the percentage of patients with a multiple
pregnancy per pregnant patients. Miscarriage rate was defined as the percentage of
miscarriages during the first 12 weeks of
gestation per total pregnancies.
Other outcomes
During the study, the adverse events and
patient compliance were noted for each
subject. In particular, patients were instructed to report on a daily diary the onset of any adverse event and to specify the
severity, duration, and a possible causeeffect relationship with treatment that
had been received. To evaluate compliance with the treatment and with the
protocol, the number of tablets forgotten, the changes in diet, physical activity,
and weight, and the timing of the intercourse were also recorded in the same
personal diary.
The total cost of the 2 strategies were
also evaluated according to the Italian
Diagnosis Related Groups and to the average costs of 6 cycles of medical treatment for groups A and B, respectively.
Statistical analysis
The primary endpoint of our pilot study
was the live-birth rate. In January 2003,
when the study was designed, no robust
clinical data were available in literature
regarding the efficacy of CC plus metformin in patients with CC-resistant
PCOS; data regarding LOD were extremely heterogeneous. Thus, the sample size was defined arbitrarily. On the
other hand, a poststudy power and sample size for live-birth rate were calculated
to design a well-powered (80%) RCT.
The poststudy power analysis and the
sample size calculation were performed
with the use of SamplePower software
(release 2.0; SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL).
Data were analyzed with the intention-to-treat method on the basis of
treatment assignment and not on treatment received; only those subjects who
had not undergone at least 1 follow-up
visit after randomization were excluded
from the final analysis.
For categoric variables, the Pearson 2
test was performed; conversely, the
Fisher’s exact test was required for the
frequency tables when 20% of the expected values were 5.
The normal distribution of continuous variables data was evaluated with the
use of the Kolmogrov-Smirnov test.
Thus, our data were expressed as mean
 SD and were analyzed with the independent-samples t test.
Cumulative events (pregnancy and
live-birth) rate was calculated by the
Kaplan-Meier method, with the time to a
first event as the outcome variable; the
differences between groups were tested
with the use of log-rank test. In addition,
Cox proportional-hazards model was
used to calculate the hazard ratio and its
95% confidence interval [CI] for pregnancy in patients who received experimental or control treatment. The hazard
ratio also represented the relative risk because it was calculated for a dichotomous variable, in which there are 2
levels.
Statistical significance was set at a
probability value of  .05. The Statistics
Package for Social Science (version
14.0.1; SPSS Inc) was used for all statistical analyses.
RESULTS
An overview of the trial is shown in Figure 1.
Patient characteristics are presented in
Table 1. After randomization, the 2
groups were similar for demographic,
clinical, and biochemical data (Table 1).

All patients had biochemical hyperandrogenism; clinical hyperandrogenism
was present in 21 of 25 women (84.0%)
and 20 of 25 women (80.0%) from
groups A and B, respectively.
At study entry, all women had polycystic ovaries at transvaginal ultrasound
examination.25
One and 2 subjects in groups A and B,
respectively, were excluded from the final analysis for having missed their first
follow-up visit.
In 1 obese patient, laparoscopy was
not performed because of the difficulty
to obtain the pneumoperitoneum. In
this case, the decision was taken after repetitive trials with a Veress needle. The
patient was then treated with CC plus
metformin, even if her data were included in the group A according to the
intention-to-treat analysis. In the other
cases, laparoscopies were completed successfully, and no surgical complication
was observed. In 2 cases, we observed a
minimal endometriosis (histologically
confirmed26) and avascular pelvic adhesions, which were treated, respectively,
with bipolar ablation and adhesiolysis.
Reproductive data
Overall, at the end of the study, subjects
from groups A and B were studied for 92
and 107 cycles, respectively. No difference in number of sexual intercourses
for each cycle of observation was observed between groups (data not
shown).
The ovulation rate per cycle was significantly lower in group A than in group B
(52/92 women [56.5%] vs 77/107 women
[72.0%], respectively; P  .023). Conversely, the rate of amenorrheic nonpregnant patients by cycle day 35 was significantly higher in group A than in group B
(38/92 women [41.3%] vs 29/107 women
[27.1%], respectively; P  .035).
No significant difference in pregnancy
rate per cycle (15/92 women [16.3%] vs
14/107 women [13.1%] in groups A and
B, respectively; P  .521) was observed
between groups. Similarly, no significant
difference in live-birth rate per cycle
(13/92 women [14.1%] vs 12/107

women [11.2%], respectively; P  .536)
was reported between groups A and B.
The miscarriage rate was not different
between groups (2/15 women [13.3%] vs
2/12 women [16.7%] in groups A and B,
respectively; P  1.000).
No multiple pregnancy was observed.
At the end of the study, no differences
in cumulative pregnancy (15/24 women
[62.5%] and 14/23 women [60.9%], respectively; P  1.000) and live-birth
(13/24 women [54.2%] and 12/23
women [52.2%], respectively; P 
1.000) was detected between groups A
and B.
In Table 2, ovulation and pregnancy
rates are detailed for each observation
cycle in both groups.
At the end of the study, 7 of 24 women
(29.2%) from group A remained oligoor amenorrheic; 3 of 23 women (13.0%)
from group B remained CC-resistant.
The probabilities of first pregnancy
(P  .458) and live-birth (P  .394) by
the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis were
similar between groups (Figure 2). With
the use of a Cox regression analysis, the
benefit that was associated with the metformin administration was not significant for pregnancy (P  .582) and livebirth (P  .425) rates. In fact, infertile
patients under medical treatment, compared with those who received surgical
treatment, had a relative risk of pregnancy of 1.2 (95% CI, 0.61–2.44) and a
relative risk of live-birth of 1.4 (95% CI,
0.63–2.96).
Considering present data, at least 9775
patients per group will be required to detect the effect of LOD or CC plus metformin on live-birth rate in patients with
CC-resistant PCOS with a power of 80%.
Other data
No intra- or postoperative complications were detected in surgically treated
patients with PCOS.
Throughout the study, the combined
CC plus metformin was well tolerated
generally. The drug-related adverse
events caused by CC plus metformin
were diarrhea, abdominal pain, hot
flashes, and nausea (4/23 [17.4%]) that
occurred during the first 3 cycles of treatment. There was no treatment discontinuation because of drug-related adverse
events.
A significant difference in the mean
costs ($3830.9  $316.8 vs $119.6 
$56.3 for groups A and B, respectively;
P  .001) of each treatment per patient
was detected.
COMMENT
To our knowledge, no direct comparison
between the 2 strategies is available to
date, and our study is the first head-tohead clinical trial that has aimed to compare, in a randomized controlled fashion, the efficacy of LOD and CC plus
metformin association in the treatment
of patients with PCOS with anovulatory
infertility.
Notwithstanding the expected higher
pregnancy rate for patients who are
treated with LOD,2,3,5,11 the current pilot
study showed that LOD and CC plus

metformin both seem to be highly effective approaches in terms of pregnancy
and live-birth for treating patients with
CC-resistant PCOS.
The comparison between 2 treatment
arms showed a significant benefit of the
CC plus metformin combination over
LOD in terms of ovulations. In fact, our
findings showed, in an overall 6-cycle
observation period, an ovulation rate per
cycle of at least 55% in patients with CCresistant PCOS who were treated with
LOD and 72% at the end of a 6-cycle
course of CC plus metformin. Thus,
metformin seemed to increase the ovulatory response to CC, and the efficacy of
the combination CC plus metformin was
maintained. This probably is related to
the cumulative effect of metformin,
which is increased in the last cycles of
treatment.
Furthermore, no significant difference was detected in pregnancy and
live-birth rates, which should be the
primary endpoint for the assessment of
infertility treatments,27 that were evaluated both per total population and
per cycle. Several issues could explain
this figure.
First, the short follow-up period could
bias our results because LOD, contrary
to CC plus metformin combination was
maintained during the 6 months of treatment. In this regard, a longer follow-up
period would reveal a higher reproductive performance of the last strategy consisting in CC plus metformin administration. Moreover, for infertile couples,
it is very difficult to design a study with a
very long observation period.
Second, the pregnancy rate per ovulatory cycles was higher after LOD,
whereas a discrepancy between ovulation and pregnancy rates was observed in
patients who were treated with CC; this
figure could be sustained also in patients
who received CC combined with metformin. In this view, metformin was not
able to eliminate completely the adverse
effects of CC on the peripheral tissues.28,29 Whereas, the difference between ovulation and pregnancy rates
that were observed in the present study
were lower than those observed in patients who received CC alone19,30 for a
potential effect of metformin on several
parameters of endometrial receptivity
and on ovarian vascularity, as already detected in 2 our previous subanalyses.29,31
This hypothesis is also supported by the
miscarriage data. In fact, in the present
trial, the miscarriage rate was of 16.7%
after the use of CC plus metformin coadministration, although an incidence of
miscarriages of 26.3% was observed previously in a PCOS population, which was
similar for demographic and metabolic
characteristics of women who received
CC at incremental doses.30 Notwithstanding these considerations, the clinical effect of metformin is probably small.
In fact, in a recent metaanalysis,32 no significant benefit of preconceptional metformin administration on the miscarriage rate was detected; these data were
confirmed when metformin was coadministrated with CC.

The interesting cycle-by-cycle analysis
demonstrated that the clinical response
to LOD was immediate, with an ovulation rate per cycle 60% during the first
3 cycles and a remarkable reduction after
the fourth cycle, because of the acute effects of ovarian surgery mainly on ovarian hormonal secretion and pituitary
feedbacks.33 Our findings are in agreement with previous clinical data that
demonstrated a constant ovulation rate
over 6 months after LOD thanks to CC
addition after the first 3 months in patients who remained anovulatory after
surgery.6
On the other hand, CC plus metformin treatment showed an incremental reproductive response over time
probably because of the combination of
the beneficial effects of CC during the
first cycles and the beneficial effects of
metformin thereafter.30 These data explained in part the different mechanisms
of action of LOD, metformin, and CC,
which have selective beneficial effects
with time and should be administered in
combined strategies to improve their
efficacy.9
Our findings cannot be considered
conclusive because the current pilot
study was clearly underpowered. In fact,
considering the live-birth rate that was
obtained, its power resulted of approximately 5%. In addition, CC administration after the third month after LOD
would improve the reproductive outcomes, as previously suggested,6 in the
same treatment arm with a subsequent
reduction of the differences between
groups and the need for a larger sample.
Similarly, in 2 recent RCTs, the poststudy power analysis did not reflect the
expected results on the basis of which a
power of 80% was calculated in a previous study design phase. In particular, the
recent study by Amer et al,2 which initially was designed to detect difference in
cumulative pregnancy rate of 35% between LOD and CC strategy as first-line
treatments for anovulatory patients with
PCOS with a power of 80%, demonstrated a poststudy power of only 32% in
the detection of differences between
groups. Similarly, the study by Bayram et
al6 assumed a difference between gonadotropins and electrocautery strategy as
second-line approaches for patients with
CC-resistant PCOS of 14% in the primary outcome (ie, ongoing pregnancy),
although an equal cumulative ongoing
pregnancy rate of 67% was observed for
both procedures at the study end, which
resulted in a poststudy power of 5%.
Our pilot study provides relevant findings in designing a well-powered clinical
trial. In fact, it is universally acknowledged that a medical intervention that is
justified by observational data must be
verified through an RCT.34 Furthermore, we should ask ourselves if the
search for an evidence-based medicine is
always and everywhere clinically useful,
cost-effective, and feasible. To this regard, at least 9775 patients per group will
be required to detect the effect of LOD or
CC plus metformin, as second-line treatments, on live-birth rate in patients with
CC-resistant PCOS with a power of 80%.
Moreover, considering our restricted
inclusion/exclusion criteria that have
implied the exclusion of 45.7% of the initially screened subjects, 14,000 patients should be screened.
In this view, we are probably in agreement with Amer et al2 who concluded
that the differences between medical and
surgical strategy were relevant enough to
justify a very wide clinical trial with the
power to demonstrate clinical differences between different approaches. On
the other hand, considering the high efficacy of both treatments a noninferiority trial should be advocated that would
need a significantly larger sample size of
approximately 10,450 patients per arm.
In conclusion, the current pilot RCT
showed that LOD and CC plus metformin seem to be 2 effective approaches
to the treatment of patients with CC-resistant PCOS, even if, because of their
comparable effectiveness, a total of 9775
subjects should be enrolled in a wider
trial to detect statistically significant differences between the 2 different strategies. Notwithstanding recent guidelines35 that suggested that metformin
plus CC was the best second-line treatment to induce ovulation in patient with
CC-resistant PCOS, LOD may still be
considered a further valid strategy, specifically in the case of anovulatory patients with PCOS who are scheduled for
laparoscopy for other indications. f
