Objective: To compare hormone levels and clinical outcomes in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome
(PCOS) after metformin therapy or laparoscopic ovarian diathermy (LOD) at 6 months follow-up. Methods: A
randomized trial was conducted in 126 patients with PCOS who had a history of infertility for at least 1 year
and resistance to clomiphene citrate (CC). Patients (n= 63) received metformin treatment or underwent
LOD (n= 63). Results: Levels of follicle-stimulating hormone did not change in either group after the
intervention (PN0.05). Serum levels of testosterone (Pb0.001) and luteinizing hormone (Pb0.001) were
significantly lower after the treatment in both groups. The proportion of women with regular menstrual
cycles increased significantly to 35% (Pb0.001) in the LOD group and to 49% (Pb0.001) in metformin group
compared with before the intervention. Although proportion was higher in the metformin group compared
with the LOD group, the difference was not significant (odds ratio 1.81; 95% CI, 0.88–3.69, P= 0.1). Hirsutism
decreased significantly from 100% to 79.37% (Pb0.001) in both groups. Conclusion: CC-resistant patients with
PCOS were treated effectively by both metformin and LOD.

1. Introduction
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrinopathy
affecting 5%–10% of women of reproductive age. Chronic anovulation
causes the endometrium to be exposed to prolonged mitogenic effects
of estrogen, unopposed by the inhibitory effects of progesterone,
which are present in the luteal phases of normal menstrual cycles. In
addition to problems such as infertility, hirsutism, and disturbances
to the menstrual cycle, recent reports show that women with PCOS
have an increased prevalence of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and
cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, potentially putting them at a
high risk for heart disease [1,2].
Several medical treatments are available for patients with PCOS, and
each of these has advantages and disadvantages. One of the treatments
is metformin. Metformin reduces plasminogen activator inhibitor-1
(PAI-1) activity. High PAI-1 activity is related to a high risk of
spontaneous abortion [3]. Hyperinsulinemia is an important parameter
in deciding whether to initiate metformin therapy for women with PCOS
[4].
Bilateral wedge resection, proposed in 1935 by Stein and
Leventhal, became the accepted treatment for PCOS. This procedure
has now been replaced by laparoscopic diathermy [5].
Some studies have shown that laparoscopic ovarian electrocautery or
diathermy, as an alternative to wedge resection, is a safe and effective
treatment for antiestrogen (clomiphene) resistant anovulatory infertility
in women with PCOS, and should be considered as the next step in
patients who fail to respond to antiestrogen treatment [6–8].
Bilateral ovarian wedge resection is associated with only a transient reduction in androstendione levels and a prolonged minimal
decrease in plasma testosterone [6].
Successful treatment depends, therefore, on altering the ratio of
follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) to androgens, either increasing
FSH (with clomiphene) or decreasing androgen (wedge resection) to
overcome the androgen block at the granulosa cell level [9].
Two studies that compared treatment with metformin with
laparoscopic ovarian diathermy (LOD) in patients resistant to clomiphene citrate (CC) [10,11] produced conflicting results. Malkawi et al.
[10] demonstrated a significant improvement in the regularity of menstrual cycles and a significant reduction in serum levels of testosterone
and luteinizing hormone (LH) after treatment. There were no significant
differences between the metformin group compared with the LOD
group in ovulation and pregnancy rates. They concluded that both
treatments are effective in treating patients with PCOS who are resistant
to CC. However, Palomba et al. [11] reported that the cumulative
pregnancy, abortion, and live-birth rates were significantly different
between the two groups and that metformin administration was more
effective than LOD in overall reproductive outcomes.
The aim of the present study was to compare metformin and LOD
treatment in patients with PCOS to evaluate changes in clinical signs

and hormone levels in each group and between the 2 groups at followup at 6 months.
2. Materials and methods
A randomized trial was undertaken from March 2006 until
February 2008 to evaluate women, between the ages of 15 and
45 years, with a history of infertility for at least 1 year and 3 treatment
cycles with no response to CC (CC resistant). The Ethics Institutional
Review Board of Tehran University of Medical Sciences approved the
study, and informed consent was obtained from all participants.
Eligibility of the women to participate in the trial was based on
the following criteria according to the Rotterdam consensus [12]:
(1) irregular menstruation; (2) clinical and/or biochemical signs of
hyperandrogenism; (3) polycystic ovaries (presence of 12 or more
follicles in each ovary measuring 2–9 mm in diameter, and/or
increased ovarian volume greater than 10 mL).
Exclusion criteria were: (1) diseases that would disturb clinical
and hormonal responses (congenital adrenal hyperplasia, ovarian
tumors, hyperprolactinemia, or thyroid disease, Cushing syndrome
and androgen-producing tumors); (2) pregnancy during follow-up;
(3) body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by
height in meters squared) above 30 or below 17.
After review of all inclusion and exclusion criteria, the 126 eligible
patients were randomly divided into 2 equal groups (n= 63), using
serially numbered opaque envelopes, for treatment with metformin
or LOD.
A 5-mL sample of venous blood was drawn from all of the patients for
measurement of FSH and LH (ELISA Diagnostic Kit, Pishtaz Teb Inc,
Terhan, Iran) and testosterone (DRG instrument GmbH Inc, Marburg,
Germany) using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) before
and 6 months after the intervention. Patients were asked to record their
menstrual cycles and days of bleeding for 6 months after treatment. A
regular menstrual cycle was defined as a cycle of 24–35 days.
A modified Ferriman-Gallwey (FG) score was used to score hirsutism. Reduction of the score was considered as an improvement.
Age and body mass index of the patients were recorded.
Patients in the metformin treatment group received a daily dose
of 1500 g of metformin for 6 months. Patients in the LOD group
underwent laparoscopy under general anesthesia. Both ovaries were
inspected for signs of PCOS. The ovarian ligament was held by Babcock
forceps and ovarian drilling was done using unipolar diathermy. The
drilling needle (Karl Storz, ND, Germany) was used to penetrate the
ovarian capsule at right angles to a standard depth of 8 mm with a
60 W cutting current, and coagulated with a 40 W current if bleeding
occurred. Drilling was performed 4 times in each ovary for 2–4 seconds
each time. The ovaries were cooled with normal saline solution.
The primary outcome measure was menstrual regularity. We hypothesized a regular menstruation rate of 35% with metformin and
60% with LOD. On the basis of this analysis, 63 patients were required
for each group to detect such a difference with a 5% level of significance and 80% power.
Statistical analysis was performed with JMP software version 4 (SAS
Institute, Cary, NC, USA). The results for the 2 groups were compared
using the χ2 test and odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI).
Paired t test was used to compare changes in continuous variables. A
2-tailed P value of less than 0.05 was considered significant.
3. Results
The flow of patients through the study is shown in Fig. 1. There was
no statistically significant difference in the age of patients or hormonal
levels (LH and testosterone) before treatment between the 2 groups
(Table 1). However, baseline FSH levels were lower in the metformin

group compared with the LOD group (4.81± 2.95 vs 5.96± 2.99;
P= 0.03)
In both groups, FSH levels were not significantly different before
and after treatment (PN0.05). However, the levels of testosterone and
LH in both groups were significantly lower after treatment (Pb0.001;
Table 2).
The proportion of women with regular menstrual cycles increased
significantly to 34.9% in the LOD group (Pb0.001) and to 49.2% in the
metformin group (Pb0.001) in comparison with the proportion before
intervention. The proportion of hirsutism decreased significantly from
100% in both groups to 79.4% in each group after treatment (Pb0.001;
Table 2).
The proportion of women who achieved a regular menstrual cycle
was higher in the metformin group compared with the LOD group,
but the difference was not significant (OR, 1.81; 95% CI, 0.88–3.69;
P= 0.1).
4. Discussion
The results of our study confirm that treatment with metformin or
LOD are both effective for patients with PCOS who are resistant to
CC. However, the metformin group showed more improvement in
menstrual pattern, although the difference was not significant.
In the present study the proportion of women with menstrual
regularity in the LOD group was 34.9% after surgery. This is not consistent with previous reports; for example, Amer et al.[13]investigated
the long-term follow-up of patients with PCOS after LOD. They
reported that the proportion of women with regular menstrual cycles
increased significantly from 8% before LOD to 67% after LOD. However,
the proportion dropped to 55% at long-term follow-up. Naether et al.
[14] reported that the proportion of regular cycles after LOD was 80%
at 1–3 months and 82% after 6–24 months following LOD.
The lower proportion of regular menstrual cycles after LOD in the
current study may be due to the number of puncture sites used. In the
study by Amer et al. [13], 3–10 puncture sites were made in each
ovary, depending on its size. In the study by Naether et al. [14], 5–20
sites per ovary were coagulated. However, we used 4 puncture sites in
each ovary so that ovarian reserve was not diminished, because more
punctures may be responsible for premature ovarian failure [15].
Another reason for the lower proportion of regular menstrual cycles
may be the differences in the definitions of regular menstrual cycles.
Another factor that could account for the difference in the proportion of regular menstrual cycles is the age of the patient. In the
study by Amer et al. [13], the results were analyzed on the basis of age;
in women who were aged 36 years or older the proportion of women
achieving regular menstrual cycles (65%) was significantly higher
than that of women aged 35 years or younger (39%). The mean age of
the women in the LOD group in the present study was 26.54±
4.72 years. If age of the patients is taken into account, our results will
be nearer to those of Amer et al. [13] (34.9% vs 39%).
Another outcome of the present study was the improvement in
hirsutism, which had improved in 13 (20.6%) women in each group
and was consistent with the study by Amer et al. [13] who reported
improvement in 23% of women in their LOD group [13].
A recent study by Amer et al. [16] did not confirm the theoretical
superiority of LOD over CC as a first treatment for anovulatory infertility in women with PCOS. However, treatment with CC resulted in
more pregnancies and live births than did treatment with LOD,
although the differences were not significant.
Surgical therapy with LOD may avoid or reduce the need for
gonadotropin or may facilitate their use. This procedure, although
effective, can be traumatic for the ovaries, which may cause postoperative adhesions and/or diminished ovarian reserve. Kandil and
Selim [17] do not endorse this procedure. Their results showed
significant decreases in ovarian volume after bilateral ovarian drilling
(but not after unilateral drilling), and they concluded that there is a
diminished ovarian reserve after bilateral ovarian drilling.
The results of recent trials by Api [18] revealed that although the
values of ovarian reserve markers were lower after LOD compared
with before LOD, values remained higher than normal after LOD when
compared with those of women without PCOS. Their study concluded
that most of the changes in the ovarian reserve markers observed after
LOD could be interpreted as normalization of ovarian function rather
than a reduction of ovarian reserve.
The results of the present study are consistent with those of Api
[18] in showing low levels of FSH by this method of bilateral drilling
(4 points in each ovary), and after 6 months follow-up the FSH level
had not increased.
In patients who underwent LOD, there was a significant decrease in
LH and testosterone levels, and this is in agreement with previous
reports [10,14].
In the present study, testosterone levels fell after intervention in all
patients in the metformin group and in 95.2% of patients in the LOD
group. All women who had regular menstrual cycles and an improvement in hirsutism also had a decrease in testosterone and LH levels.
The mechanism by which LOD alters androgen levels and restores
ovulation in women with PCOS remains unclear, but is likely to involve
destruction of theca and stroma, the main compartments contributing
to androgen concentrations [19].
Finally, treatment with metformin or LOD appears to have the
same effect on menstrual irregularity and hirsutism. Because laparoscopy is an expensive and invasive procedure and may have some
adverse effects, such as adhesions, metformin treatment could be a
first-line treatment for women with PCOS. Laparoscopy could be
conducted in women with PCOS if indicated for other reasons. For
patients with PCOS for whom hirsutism is a major concern and who do
not respond to drug therapy after at least 6 months, LOD may be a
better choice.

The present study had some limitations because of its low power
and lack of assessment at follow-up for ovulation, pregnancy rates,
and abortions. Further study with a larger sample size, additional data,
and a long-term follow-up period is required to evaluate the effects
of these two methods of treatment in patients with PCOS who are
resistant to CC.
