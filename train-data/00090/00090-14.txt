Abstract
Background: Laparoscopic ovarian drilling (LOD) is an alternative method to induce
ovulation in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients with clomiphene citrate (CC)
resistant instead of gonadotropins. This study aimed to compare the efficacy of unilateral
LOD (ULOD) versus bilateral LOD (BLOD) in CC resistance PCOS patients in terms of
ovulation and pregnancy rates.
Materials and Methods: In a prospective randomized clinical trial study, we included
100 PCOS patients with CC resistance attending to Al-Zahra Hospital in Rasht, Guilan
Province, Iran, from June 2011 to July 2012. Patients were randomly divided into two
ULOD and BLOD groups with equal numbers. The clinical and biochemical responses
on ovulation and pregnancy rates were assessed over a 6-month follow-up period.
Results: Differences in baseline characteristics of patients between two groups prior
to laparoscopy were not significant (p>0.05). There were no significant differences
between the two groups in terms of clinical and biochemical responses, spontaneous menstruation (66.1 vs. 71.1%), spontaneous ovulation rate (60 vs. 64.4%), and
pregnancy rate (33.1 vs. 40%) (p>0.05). Following drilling, there was a significant
decrease in mean serum concentrations of luteinizing hormone (LH) (p=0.001) and
testosterone (p=0.001) in both the groups. Mean decrease in serum LH (p=0.322)
and testosterone concentrations (p=0.079) were not statistically significant between
two groups. Mean serum level of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) did not change
significantly in two groups after LOD (p>0.05).
Conclusion:Based on results of this study, ULOD seems to be equally efficacious as BLOD
in terms of ovulation and pregnancy rates (Registration Number: IRCT138903291306N2).

Introduction
The most common cause of anovulatory infertility is polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) (1-4).
Induction of ovulation with clomiphene citrate
(CC) is the first line of treatment in these patients
(1, 5-8). CC resistant is defined as failure to ovulate after receiving a maximum dosage of 150 mg
per day for five days beginning on the third day of
menstrual cycle (1, 9) Laparoscopic ovarian drilling (LOD) is an alternative method to induce ovu-

lation in these patients instead of administration of
gonadotropins (1, 2, 10-14). Despite minimal morbidity associated with this method, LOD has some
benefits. The benefits consist of the elimination of
cycles monitoring, decreasing the risk of ovarian
hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), multifetal
pregnancy associated with gonadotropins (2, 14-
21), as well as occurring spontaneous ovulation in
some patients without further treatments (16). Two
disadvantages of LOD are the probability of tuboovarian adhesion (TOA) (12, 22-31) and risk of
premature ovarian failure (POF) (24, 25). Reducing the potential damage to ovarian surface epithelium (OSE) leads to a significantly decreased
risk for TOA and POF (24, 25). A few studies have
compared unilateral LOD (ULOD) and bilateral
LOD (BLOD) and concluded that ULOD is equally efficacious as BLOD in inducing ovulation and
achieving pregnancy besides minimizing the risk
of adhesion and POF (24, 25, 32-34). Therefore,
changing the usual method of LOD for both ovaries to only one ovary may minimize those risks.
This study was done prospectively to compare the
efficacy of ULOD versus BLOD in CC resistant
patients in terms of ovulation and pregnancy rates.
Materials and Methods
This prospective parallel randomized clinical trial
was conducted in Al-Zahra Hospital in Rasht, Guilan Province, Iran, from June 2011 to July 2012.
Among PCOS women attending the infertility
clinic with CC resistant ovaries, 121 patients with
CC resistance PCOS were initially examined. Before laparoscopy, five patients had other endocrine
abnormally, four patients had mechanical factors
abnormally such as unilateral or bilateral tubal
blockages in hysteroscopy (HSC), seven patients
had concomitant male infertility, and five patients
refused to participate in the study; therefore, 100 patients were included in this study (Fig.1).

ULOD vs. BLOD in CC Resistant PCOS Women
Given that few studies have been done in this
field, this study was considered as a pilot study
after considering the attrition coefficient, so an
equal number (n=50) were allocated to each
ULOD (group I) and BLOD (group II) groups.
PCOS patients were diagnosed based on presence two out of three Rotterdam 2003 criteria,
including: oligomenorrhea and/or anovulation,
hyper androgenism (biochemical or clinical)
and PCOS. We used transvaginal ultrasound to
diagnose PCOS, after ruling out other causes,
like congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH),
Cushing syndrome, administration of androgen, and androgen secreting tumor (AST). CC
resistant is defined as failure to ovulate after
receiving a maximum dosage of 150 mg per
day for five days beginning on the third day of
menstrual cycle (1, 9). All patients had normal
hysterosalpingography and their partners had
normal spermiogram using criteria of World
Health Organization (WHO). Also all patients
had normal uterus in ultrasound scan. Normal
uterus was defined as normal size and shape
with regular endometrium without any polyp
or myoma. According to laparoscopic findings,
patients with evidence of tubo-peritoneal diseases, such as tubal obstruction and peritoneal
adhesion to tubes or ovaries and endometriosis
were also excluded. Among 50 patients in group
I undergoing ULOD, two patients were excluded because of tubal disease diagnosed during
laparoscopy, and three patients were excluded
due to the missed follow-up visit. Among 50
patients in group II, one patient was excluded
because of endometriosis diagnosed during laparoscopy, and 4 patients were excluded due to
the missed follow-up visit. Finally 45 patients in
each group were included for analysis (Fig.1).
The cycles of all patients were oligomenorrhea
or amenorrhea.
This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Guilan University of Medical Sciences, Guilan, Iran. All patients provided a written
informed consent before entering the study. A
randomization list was generated using blocked
sample randomization. The permuted block
randomization method was used in order to
give a block size of four. Assignment proceeds
by randomly selecting one of the orderings and
allocating the next block of subjects to groups
according to the specific sequence. Prior to the
laparoscopic procedure, all the patients were
tagged in the changing room before entering
the operation room by an operating room (OR)
nurse, in a blocked randomization design, and
the surgeon were not aware of the type of the
tag, before entering the operation room.
All 100 PCOS patients with CC resistance
were randomly assigned into ULOD (group I)
and BLOD (group II) groups. The group I, right
ovary, and group II, both ovaries, underwent
electrocauterization. We chose right ovary in
ULOD because most of the studies have concluded that ovulation occurs more frequently
(about 55% of the time) in the right ovary as
compared with the left one, and oocytes from
the right ovary have a higher potential for pregnancy (35). Besides the probability of adhesion
is more in left ovary than right one (31). For all
patients, triple puncture laparoscopy was done
by a gynecologist. After establishing tubal patency with methylene blue, LOD was performed
using unipolar diathermy needle (Karl Storz,
Germany). The penetration was about in depth
of 8 mm, a setting of 60W, and 5 points per
ovary. Ovaries were cooled by normal saline
immediately after cauterization, and about 300-
500 ml of normal saline was left in pelvic cavity
for prevention of adhesion. In the cases of any
complications during surgery such as anesthetic
problems or injury to organs, the operation was
discontinued and the cases were dropped out of
the study. The variables, including: age, infertility duration, cycle characteristic (oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea), body mass index (BMI),
follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing
hormone (LH), and testosterone level on day 3
of spontaneous or induced menstruation, were
assessed before and after laparoscopy.
The day after laparoscopy, the women were
asked to keep their menstrual calendar. If the patients started a menstrual period within 6 weeks after LOD, a blood sample for measurement of LH,
FSH and testosterone levels was taken on days 2-3
of menstrual cycle. If spontaneous menstruation
did not occur within 6 weeks, an intramuscular
injection of 100 mg progesterone (Iran hormone, 
Int J Fertil Steril, Vol 9, No 1, Apr-Jun 2015 12
Zahiri Sorouri et al.
Iran) was prescribed. After excluding pregnancy,
on days 2-3 of menstrual cycle, hormonal measurements were done.
Ovulation was assessed on day 21 by measurement of progesterone in patients who had spontaneous menstruation. Progesterone level >3 ng/
mL is considered as ovulation. If there was no
ovulation as evidenced by progesterone level or
lack of menstruation, the patients was advised
to use CC with starting dose of 50 mg/day up
to 150 mg/day from days 3-7 that was monitored by ultrasound. Patients were followed-up
until they conceived or 6 mount after LOD. The
clinical, defined as menstrual resumption, spontaneous or induced, and biochemical, defined as
FSH, LH and free testosterone levels before and
after surgery, responses on ovulation and pregnancy rates were measured. In this study, pregnancy was defined as detection of fetal heart on
transvaginal ultrasound.
Statistical analysis
Data were analyzed in IBM SPSS software,
version 11.5. (SPSS, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL,
USA). We used descriptive and analytic statistics. For numeric variables, data were described
as mean and standard deviation, while for categorical variables, data were shown as number
and percentage. For statistical analysis, independent t test (two-tailed) was used to compare
mean values between two groups, while paired
t test was used to compare mean values of FSH,
LH, and testosterone levels before and after
LOD. Also Fisher’s exact test was used to compare relative proportions of variables between
two groups. Differences were considered significant at p<0.05.
Results
Total of 100 patients with PCOS who underwent LOD were included in this study. These
patients were divided into two groups of ULOD
or BLOD equally. Among 50 patients in group I
undergoing ULOD, two patients were excluded
because of tubal disease diagnosed during laparoscopy, and three patients were excluded due to
the missed follow-up visit. Among 50 patients
in group II undergoing BLOD, one patient was
excluded because of endometriosis diagnosed
during laparoscopy, and 4 patients were excluded due to the missed follow-up visit. Finally 45
patients in each group were included for analysis (Fig.1).
The baseline characteristics of the women in
two groups are shown in table 1. There were no
significant differences between patients of two
groups in terms of clinical and endocrinologic
characteristics and cycle history. After LOD, 30
(66.7%) of patient in group I and 32 (71.1%) in
group II had spontaneous menstruation within 6
weeks. But this difference was not statistically
significant (p=0.820). To induce menstrual period, an intramuscular injection of 100 mg progesterone was prescribed for remaining women
(Table 2).
The ovulation rate after the first menstruation
(spontaneous or induced) was assessed with
mid-lutealprogesterone level. Overall 27 (60%)
patients in group I and 29 (64.4%) patients in
group II had spontaneous ovulation. CC was
used by starting dose of 50 mg/day up to 150
mg/day for 5 days from third day of cycle, while
the findings showed that 11 (24.4%) women in
group I and 11 (24.4%) women in group II ovulated successfully.
There were no significant differences between
two groups in term of spontaneous (p=0.82) or
CC-induced (p=0.70) ovulation (Table 2). Fourteen women (31.1%) in group I and 18 women
(40%) in group II were pregnant within 6 month
of follow-up visit, but this difference was not
statistically significant. In both groups, after
LOD, means serum levels of LH (p=0.0001)
and testosterone (p=0.001) were decreased significantly.
Also there were no significant differences in
means serum levels of LH (p=0.322), testosterone (p=0.079) and FSH (p=0.758) between
two groups after drilling (Table 3). Two cases
in group II were aborted after detection of fetal
heart and one case of triplet was seen in group I.

Discussion
In this study, we have evaluated the effect of ULOD
versus BLOD on the ovulation and pregnancy rates
of 90 CC resistant PCOS patients. We found that
there are no significant differences between groups
in terms of ovulation and pregnancy rates.
PCOS women who are CC resistant can be treated with gonadotropins, but there are risks of OHSS
and multiple pregnancies in this method. Also gonadotropines are expensive and time-consuming
treatment requiring intensive monitoring. Surgical
therapy is an alternative method for ovulation induction in these patients to overcome the disadvantages of gonadotropins (1, 2, 9, 14, 36, 37).
Ovarian wedge resection surgery was an accepted
method of ovulation induction over 40 years (38).
However, it was abandoned because of adhesion
formation (39-41). LOD was first described by
Gjonnaess in 1984 (42).
The mechanism of LOD is similar to ovarian
wedge resection surgery. Destruction of androgenproducing ovarian tissue leads to a decrease in the
peripheral conversion of androgen to estrogen.
Decreased serum levels of androgen and LH and
increased FSH level have been demonstrated after ovarian drilling (40, 43, 44). A change in endocrine function converts the androgen-dominant
intrafollicular environment to estrogenic one (45).
It affects ovarian-pituitary feedback mechanism
(46), so both local and systemic effects may induce ovulation in these patients. Due to ovulation
and pregnancy success rates, mentioned in various
studies, LOD is an accepted method for ovulation
induction in CC resistant PCOS patients (25).
Two important potential adverse effects of LOD
are peri-ovarian adhesions and reduced ovarian
function (47, 48). The rate of peri-ovarian adhesion is very different in various studies, from 19 to
43%, and with greater damage to the ovaries, the
risk become higher (42, 49-51). Furthermore POF
is another concern of LOD that is dependent on the
number of puncture made (>4-6) (52). Therefore,
the risk of peri-ovarian adhesion and the rate of
POF can be minimized by decreasing the number
of punctures (24, 25).
The idea of ULOD instead of BLOD for minimizing these two side effects was first introduced
by Ballen and Jacobs (53). They showed that
ULOD can result in bilateral ovarian activity due
to local cascade of growth factors, such as insulinlike growth factor-1 (IGF-1), which interacts with
FSH, leading to a decrease in the serum LH concentration (53, 54).

ULOD vs. BLOD in CC Resistant PCOS Women
Nowadays BLOD is a standard method of LOD.
Few studies compared ULOD and BLOD and concluded that ULOD is as effective as BLOD and
minimizes the risk of adhesion and POF (24, 25,
31-34, 54, 55).
In this study, after performing LOD, we found
significant decreases in serum levels of LH and testosterone in both groups that were similar in both
groups. Also there were no significant differences
between groups in terms of ovulation and pregnancy
rates. Youssef and Atallah (25) in 2007 evaluated 87
patients with ovulation failure as a result of PCOS
who were randomly allocated into ULOD (n=43)
and BLOD (n=44). In patients who ovulated after
drilling, there was a significant fall in serum LH concentration, while ovulation, pregnancy and miscarriage rates were similar between both groups. Roy et
al. (24) in 2009 evaluated the effect of ULOD versus
BLOD in 22 patients. The clinical and biochemical
responses on ovulation and pregnancy rates over a
1-year follow-up period were compared. They also
evaluated tubo-ovarian adhesion rate during cesarean
section or a second-look laparoscopy. They found no
significant differences between two groups in terms
of clinical and biochemical responses, ovulation and
pregnancy rates, and tubo-ovarian adhesions. They
concluded that ULOD may be a suitable option in
CC resistant infertile patients of PCOS which can replace BLOD with the potential advantage of decreasing the chance of adhesion formation. Abdelhafeez
et al. (55) in 2013 reported that ULOD is as effective
as BLOD in terms of restoration of regular menstrual
pattern and ovulation rate. Sunj et al. (31) in 2013
represented that the results of applied method can be
improved when using less thermal energy in volumeadjusted ULOD in comparing to BLOD.
Conclusion
Based on the results of this study, ULOD seems
to be equally efficacious as BLOD in terms of ovulation and pregnancy rates.
