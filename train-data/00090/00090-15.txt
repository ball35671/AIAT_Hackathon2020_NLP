During Laparoscopic Ovarian Diathermy
in Women with Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome
Mohamed Fouad Selim, MD
Abstract
Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine the amount of thermal energy required during laparoscopic ovarian diathermy (LOD) for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) to produce an optimal success rates
without excessive ovarian damage. Design: This study was designed as a prospective comparative study.
Setting: The study took place in a fertility unit in a specialized hospital. Participants: The participants were
women with clomiphene-resistant PCOS. Intervention: Subjects underwent LOD and were divided into five
groups by number of punctures per ovary. Main outcome measure(s): The outcome measures were reproductive performance and endocrine assays. Results: The subjects’ reproductive performance significantly improved after three or more punctures per ovary; in each group, the rates of restoration of menstrual regularity
were 30, 73, 82, 82, and 50%; the rates of spontaneous ovulation were 23, 60, 64, 58, and 42%; and the rates of
conception were 15, 40, 53, 47, and 28%, respectively, after LOD. Serum luteinizing hormone (LH) and
LH:follicle stimulating hormone (LH:FSH) ratio was reduced in all studied groups proportionally with increasing amount of thermal energy. There was only a significant increase in serum FSH after six or more
punctures. The reductions of serum androgen after LOD were observed significantly in women receiving three
or more punctures per ovary. Conclusions: The clinical response to LOD seems to be thermal energy dosedependent. Two punctures (300 J) per ovary are associated with poor results. Between three and five (450– 750 J)
punctures per ovary seem to represent the effective thermal dose. The application of six or more ( ‡ 900 J)
punctures per ovary may result in excessive destruction to the ovary and should therefore be discouraged.

Introduction
Since the introduction of laparoscopic ovarian diathermy (LOD) by Gjonnaess in 1984, it has become widely
accepted as a second-line treatment for induction of ovulation
in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) after
failure of a course of clomiphene citrate.1–4
LOD can produce high ovulation (> 80%) and pregnancy
(up to 60%) rates,4 and it also corrects the underlying endocrine abnormalities associated with the disease, such as
raised serum concentrations of luteinizing hormone (LH)
and androgens.2,5–7 In addition, ovarian drilling may render
the ovaries more sensitive to clomiphene citrate.7
Although LOD is widely practiced by many gynecologists,
there is a lack of consensus on how much energy should be
used. It depends upon the number of punctures made, and
the power setting and duration of each puncture. Currently,
the choice of the number of punctures to be applied at LOD
is empiric. Historically, the amount of ovarian tissue removed during bilateral ovarian wedge resection varied between one third and three quarters depending upon the size
of the ovary.8–11 Some gynecologists apply the same principle to LOD by empirically making different numbers of
punctures in each ovary depending upon its size; between 3
and 25 punctures have been reported with power settings
between 30 and 400 W.1,5,6,12–16 As a general principle, increasing the amount of thermal energy delivered to the
ovarian stroma may increase the efficacy of the procedure,
but at the expense of increasing the risk of ovarian atrophy.16
This study was designed to investigate the influence of the
amount of thermal energy delivered to ovarian tissue on
clinical outcome after laparoscopic ovarian drilling in women with PCOS, to achieve satisfactory results for the surgery with the least ovarian destruction.

Materials and Methods
Subjects
From January 2004 through September 2007 (*4 years’
duration), this randomized trial took place in the infertility
unit of Al-Hammadi Specialized Hospital, Riyadh, Saudi
Arabia. A total of 82 women with anovulatory infertility
associated with PCOS, who had been clomiphene citrate
resistant, underwent LOD to assess the optimal number of
punctures to be applied to ovarian tissue. All subjects provided written informed consent. Subjects who fulfilled both
inclusion and exclusion criteria were randomly assigned to
one of the five treatment groups (1:1:1:1:1 ratio). Each randomization number corresponded with one of the five possible interventions, and labeling was done by personnel not
involved in the trial. There were 17 cases in groups 3 and 4,
and 16 cases in groups 1, 2, and 5.The data used in this study
were collected from 76 subjects after exclusion of 6 subjects
who missed follow-up (3 cases in group 1, 1 case in group 2,
and 2 cases in group 5, Fig. 1).
Clomiphene citrate resistance was defined as the absence
of developing follicles after ovarian stimulation with 150 mg
clomiphene citrate/day given for 5 days beginning with the
2nd day of the menstrual cycle, or failure of conception after
responding to induction. Patients were stimulated with clomiphene for a minimum of three and a maximum of six
cycles. In the current study, clomiphene citrate failed to induce ovulation in 67 women; the remaining 9 patients ovulated but failed to conceive after clomiphene citrate treatment
for 6 months.
PCOS was diagnosed according to the revised European
Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE)
and American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM)
criteria of 2004, which were based on the Rotterdam criteria:
the presence of two out of three diagnostic criteria of the
Rotterdam consensus being present for each patient, namely,
1) oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea; 2) hyperandrogenism
(clinical and/or biochemical); or 3) polycystic ovaries on
ultrasound, with the exclusion of other etiologies.17–19
Ovulatory dysfunction was defined as:17,18 oligomenorrhea
(menstrual bleeding that occurs at intervals of > 35 days to 6
months, with < 9 menstrual periods per year) or secondary
amenorrhea (an absence of menstrual periods for 6 months).
Polycystic ovarian morphology by ultrasound was defined
as:19,20 ‡ 12 follicles in at least one ovary measuring 2–9 mm
in diameter, or a total ovarian volume of >10 cm.3 The
ovarian volume was calculated using the formula for a
prolate ellipsoid: 0.523 · length · width · thickness, according to the method of Sample et al.21 Ultrasound volume is
presented as the mean volume of both ovaries.
Androgen excess or hyperandrogenism: this clinically manifests
as excess terminal body hair in a male distribution pattern
(hirsutism). Some patients have acne and/or male-pattern
hair loss (androgenic alopecia). Hirsutism was evaluated
using the modified Ferriman–Gallway; mFG22 score; if the
mFG score was ‡ 8. Androgen excess can be tested by
checking for testosterone and androstenedione levels on the
early follicular phase (defined as days 2–5 of the menstrual
cycle). In women with severe oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea,
a random blood sample was accepted. For the purpose of this
study, subjects were deemed hyperandrogenaemic if the level
of total testosterone was ‡ 2–5 nmol/L, free androgen index
(FAI) was > 4, or androstenedione was ‡ 10 nmol/L.22–25
FAI is calculated using the formula testosterone · 100/sex
hormone-binding globulin (SHBG).18,22,25
Conditions that should be ruled out include: 21-hydroxylase-deficient nonclassic adrenal hyperplasia (NCAH),
Cushing’s syndrome, and androgen-secreting neoplasms by
appropriate testing, if suspected clinically.19,25,26 There are
also a number of other disorders that may result in ovulatory
dysfunction, including hyperprolactinemia and thyroid abnormalities.26
An LH:follicle stimulating hormone (LH:FSH) ratio > 2
may be helpful, but has limited sensitivity and is no longer a
necessary part of the diagnosis of PCOS.27 Hyperinsulinemia
is common; however, it is not essential for a diagnosis of
PCOS.28 Hyperinsulinemia has not formed part of any of the
recognized definitions to date, and the task force found no
evidence to suggest that it should be otherwise;18 therefore, a
test for this was not performed in the current study.
The other exclusion criteria included:
 Other known causes of infertility including male factor
infertility or known tubal disease
 The presence of a persistent ovarian cyst ‡ 12 mm as
documented by ultrasound because of the bias in
ovarian assessment.
Laparoscopic ovarian diathermy
The techniques of LOD used were those that have been
previously published by Li et al.,4 and Amer et al.6 The same
operator performed all laparoscopic procedures. Threepuncture laparoscopy was performed with the patient under
general anesthesia. After executing a pneumoperitoneum
using a Verres needle, a 10-mm videolaparoscope was inserted umbilically, followed by the lateral insertion of two 5-
mm ancillary trocars in the left and right iliac fossa. A careful
inspection of the pelvic cavity was performed in each patient.
Through one of the two lower abdominal 5-mm punctures, a
non-toothed grasping forceps was then used to grasp the
utero-ovarian ligament and to lift the ovary away from the
bowel. The third entry was used to introduce the diathermy
needle. A specially designed monopolar electrocautery probe
(Karl Storz GmbH and Co. KG, Tuttlingen, Germany) was
used to penetrate the ovarian capsule at a number of points
with the aid of a short burst of monopolar diathermy. The
probe has a distal stainless steel needle measuring 8 mm in
length and 2 mm in diameter projecting from an insulated
solid cone. The probe was applied to the surface of the ovary
at a right angle to avoid slippage and to minimize surface
damage after setting the electrosurgical device (ErbotomACC450, Erbe GmbH, Tubingen, Germany). A monopolar
coagulating current at a 30 W power setting was used to
make a puncture in the ovarian tissue. As the needle was
pushed into the ovarian capsule, electricity was activated for
5 seconds. A total of two to eight punctures were made in
each ovary depending upon its study group. The ovary was
then cooled down by irrigation using Ringer’s solution before releasing the ligament. At the end of the procedure,
*200 mL of Ringer’s solution was left in the pelvis.
Amount of thermal energy: a standardized monopolar coagulation current set at 30 W was applied for duration of 5
seconds per puncture, giving a total thermal energy of 150 J
(30 · 5) per puncture.

Postoperative monitoring
Following ovarian diathermy, women were asked to keep
a record of their menstrual cycle for 6 months. If the patient
started a menstrual period within 6 weeks of the surgery, a
blood sample was taken on day 2 of that cycle for measurement of serum concentrations of LH, FSH, testosterone,
androstenedione and SHBG. If spontaneous menstruation
did not occur during the 6 weeks following surgery, a random blood sample was taken to measure all the abovementioned hormones.
Reproductive outcomes
The rates of conversion of oligo/amenorrhoea to regular
cycles, spontaneous ovulation, and conception after LOD
using different doses of thermal energy (numbers of punctures) were detected. Ovulation rate was calculated as the
percentage of ovulatory cycles relative to total cycles. Pregnancy rate was defined as the percentage of pregnancies
relative to total cycles.
The ovulatory cycles were evaluated using transvaginal
ultrasound (TV-USG). The scans were performed every 3
days, starting on day 7 after intervention (during the first
month from surgery), and subsequently on day 2 after the
onset of menses. When the follicular dimensions achieved at
least 16 mm, the TV-USG was performed daily. The day of
ovulation was retrospectively defined with the observation of
decreased follicular dimensions and of liquid in the cul-de-sac,
and confirmed by a plasma progesterone level ‡ 30 nmol/L
on day 21 of the cycle. A rising b-human chorionic gonadotropin level and the sonographic evidence of intrauterine
gestational sac were considered criteria to define a pregnancy.
Analysis of the data
Patients (76 cases) available for statistical analysis were divided into five groups according to the number of punctures
made in their ovaries during LOD as follows: group 1 (n = 13)
treated with two punctures per ovary = 300 J; group 2 (n = 15)
three punctures = 450 J; group 3 (n = 17) four punctures = 600 J;
group 4 (n = 17) five punctures = 750 J; and group 5 (n = 16) six
to eight punctures ‡ 900 J. The clinical and biochemical data
before and after LOD were documented. The age of the patients and other demographic details including body mass
index (BMI), primary or secondary infertility, and the duration of infertility were also documented. The data were entered into the Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) for
Windows, version 11 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Appropriate
statistical tests including multiple comparison using ANOVA
and z-test were performed, wherever appropriate, among the
five groups. Data are expressed as mean – SD. Significance of
the test was performed at the 5% level (p < 0.05).
Results
The demographic, clinical and endocrinologic characteristics of the 76 women who underwent LOD are shown in
Tables 1 and 2. The characteristics of each group are shown
separately. ANOVA showed no significant difference among
the five groups pre-LOD.
Reproductive performance
Table 3 shows the proportion of women with regular
menstrual cycles, the rate of spontaneous ovulation, and the
conception rates during the 6 months after surgery, achieved
using different doses of thermal energy. The proportion of
women with regular menstrual cycles after LOD in group 1
(30%) was significantly lower (p < 0.05) than in the other
groups (50%–82%), and the incidence of ovulation in group 1
(23%) was significantly lower (p < 0.05) than in the other
groups (42%–64%). Table 3 also shows that the pregnancy
rate in group 1 (15%) was significantly lower (p < 0.05) than
in the other groups (28%–53%).

groups after LOD compared with preoperative concentrations. The serum levels of FSH after LOD showed insignificant changes in groups 1–4, but a statistical significance
increase (p < 0.05) in women treated with the highest dose
(group 5). ANOVA of all studied groups after LOD showed
that the reduction in LH levels and the LH:FSH ratio was
highest in group 5, who received six punctures per ovary
or more (p < 0.05). There were no significant changes in the
serum FSH levels after ovarian diathermy except in the
women in group 5 (p < 0.05).
The results in Table 5 show a statistically significant
(p < 0.05) reduction in FAI and the serum concentrations of
testosterone and androstenedione after LOD in groups 2–5.
However, these reductions did not reach statistical significance in group 1.The changes in the serum concentrations of
SHBG were variable and statistically insignificant. On the
other hand, the reductions of FAI and the serum concentrations of testosterone and androstenedione after LOD were
increasingly in women receiving higher doses of thermal
energy (from 300 J to ‡ 900 J). It may, therefore, be concluded
that the effect of LOD on androgen levels is influenced by the
amount of energy delivered to the ovary, and a small
amount may not significantly reduce these levels. This may
support the hypothesis that LOD works by the destruction of
androgen-producing tissue in the ovary.6,16
Discussion
In this study, the influence of the amount of thermal energy applied at LOD on the clinical and biochemical outcome
in 76 women with PCOS divided into 5 groups, has been
investigated. The amounts of thermal energy per ovary used
in each group were as follows: group 1 = 300 J; group 2 = 450
J; group 3 = 600 J; group 4 = 750 J; group 5 = 900–1200 J, using
a needle measuring 8 mm in length and 2 mm in diameter at
a 30 W power for 5 seconds. A total of two to eight punctures
were made in each ovary depending upon its study group.
There are a number of difficulties in comparing the experience of various authors, because of variation in the techniques used in LOD, including: 1) using different
instruments (needles, scissors, biopsy forceps, etc.) to deliver
the energy to the ovary; 2) applying different amounts of
energy to the ovary (measured in joules, equivalent to power
in watts multiplied by the duration of electricity applied in
second per puncture); and 3) distribution of the thermal
energy, either localized to a few holes or more widely spread
over many holes with varying depths of penetration. It is
important that the comparison between different studies
should take into consideration the total amount of thermal
energy delivered to each ovary, not just the number of holes
made in the ovary and the depth of penetration of energy.
Gjonnaess1 correlated the ovulation rates after LOD to
different numbers of cauterized points. He used a significantly greater amount of thermal energy; five or more
punctures were made in each ovary at 200–300 W for 2–4
seconds each puncture (energy on average = 250 W · 3 sec ·
‡ 5 = ‡ 3750 J per ovary), using a pair of biopsy or sterilization forceps, applied the thermal energy to the ovarian
surface, and the depth of penetration was between 2
and 4 mm, that is, superficial. Using the same technique as

Gjonnaess,1 Dabirashrafi and colleagues29 reported mild-tomoderate adhesion formation in 20% of cases. Naether and
colleagues11 did 5–20 points per ovary, with 400 W for *1
second, and they found that the rate of adhesion was 19.3%,
and that this was reduced to 16.6% by peritoneal lavage with
saline.11 Naether and coworkers30,31 reported that the greater
the amount of damage to the surface of the ovary, the greater
the risk of periovarian adhesion formation; this led Armar
to develop a strategy of minimizing the number of diathermy
points.32 Armar et al.2 found that four diathermy punctures
(8 mm deep) per ovary at 40 W for 4 seconds per puncture
were sufficient to achieve good results, and that no improvement was achieved when applying more holes. The
amount of thermal energy delivered to each ovary was
40 W· 4 sec · 4 = 640 J, which is significantly lower than that
used by Gjonnaess.1 Armar and Lachelin32 reported that the
smaller the number of diathermy points used, the lower the
rate of significant adhesion formation was.
The depth of penetration in this study was up to 8 mm
using a specially designed ovarian diathermy needle; the
same was done by Armar et al.,2 Felemban et al.,5 and Amer
et al.6,16 The amount of thermal energy used to produce a
good result ranged from nearly 450 up to 1200 J per ovary,
which was significantly lower and deeper than that applied
by Gjonnaess.1 It is therefore possible to conclude that with
deeper penetration during LOD, the amount of thermal energy can be reduced without compromising the outcome.
Furthermore, achieving good results with deep penetration
using low energy supports the hypothesis that LOD works
by destroying androgen-producing ovarian stroma.
This study showed that the response to LOD is governed
by a dose–response relationship; restoration of menstrual
regularity, ovulation rate, and conception rate. Results indicate that 300 J/ovary could be the threshold dose, that is, the
lowest dose at which a response could be seen, and 450 J/
ovary may be the plateau dose, that is, the lowest dose at
which all subjects will respond as nearly the same rates occurred with doses between 400 J and 750 J, but higher doses
( ‡ 900 J) showed a lower success rate.
Amer et al.6 concluded that three punctures (450 J) per
ovary seemed to be the plateau dose for LOD. Making seven
or more punctures ( ‡ 1050 J) per ovary appears to deliver an
excessive amount of thermal energy to the ovary; this offers
no advantage over the lower doses of energy in terms of
success rates, and may potentially cause excessive ovarian
damage. Again, Amer et al.16 reported that the response to
LOD is governed by a dose–response relationship. They
concluded that four punctures per ovary using a power

setting of 30 W for a duration of 5 seconds per puncture (i.e.,
600 J per ovary) appear to be sufficient to produce an optimal
response (67% spontaneous ovulation rate and 67% conception rate). Reducing the thermal energy below that level reduces the chances of spontaneous ovulation and conception.
Malkaw and Qublan33 studied two groups of patients with
clomiphene-citrate-resistant PCOS who had laparoscopic
ovarian drilling: group 1 had 5 punctures per ovary, and
group 2 had 10 punctures per ovary. The authors concluded
that 5, instead of 10, punctures per ovary are sufficient to
improve the clinical and reproductive outcome.
Dabirashrafi reported a case of severe ovarian atrophy
following LOD in which eight punctures were created at 400
W for 5 seconds per each puncture, equivalent to 16000 J.15 It
is therefore possible that application of excessive amounts of
thermal energy to the ovary during LOD will produce irreversible damage to the ovary, leading to ovarian failure. FSH
is considered to be a reasonable marker of ovarian reserve
and function.16 In the current study, it is of interest that the
application of six or more punctures ( ‡ 900 J) per ovary resulted in a 40% increase in the FSH levels after LOD, compared with a nonsignificant variable change in the other
groups with less thermal doses. It seems possible that the
application of six or more punctures per ovary represents an
excessive amount of thermal energy and should therefore be
discouraged. This concept is in accordance with the recommendation of older studies.5,6,15,16,29,30
The results of current study showed a statistically significant reduction of the serum concentration of LH, LH:FSH
ratio, and androgens in all groups. There were no significant
changes in the serum FSH levels after ovarian diathermy
except in women treated with ‡ 900 J/ovary. The magnitude
of reduction of LH and androgens show that dose dependency increased with increased thermal energy, with the
highest reduction being achieved with more than six punctures per ovary ( ‡ 900 J/ovary). The reduction of androgens
and LH observed after LOD in this study, which is consistent
with several other previous studies,1,2,5,6,16,33–36 supports the
hypothesis that LOD exerts its effects through the destruction of androgen-producing tissue in the ovaries. The decreased androgen concentrations may result in a fall in
estrone (E1) that may result in decreased positive feedback
on LH and decreased negative feedback on FSH at the level
of the pituitary. This effect, coupled with a decrease in local

androgen concentrations, would convert the intrafollicular
environment from being androgen dominant to one that is
estrogenic. This may remove an intraovarian block to follicular growth, allowing follicular recruitment and development to proceed to subsequent ovulation.6,16,36 It has also
been hypothesized that the response of the ovary to injury
during LOD leads to a local cascade of growth factors (such
as insulin-like growth factor 1 [IGF-1]), which sensitize the
ovary to circulating FSH resulting in the stimulation of follicular growth.36 The concentrations of anti-Mu¨llerian hormone (AMH) in PCOS patients are significantly higher than
in subjects with regular ovulatory cycles. This indicates that
there is an intrinsic abnormality in the ovarian follicles
themselves in PCOS.37 AMH is unlikely to be the sole cause
of anovulation.38 Amer et al.39 reported that, following LOD,
the serum AMH concentration significantly decreased and
remained low at 3- and 6-month follow-up.
However, caution should be exercised in the interpretation
of these results, as the number of punctures applied to
ovaries was determined by chance and was independent of
ovarian size or endocrine milieu; because of the lower LH
levels, hyperandrogenism and smaller ovarian volumes may
indicate a milder form of the syndrome and this might have
an impact on increasing the amount of thermal ovarian destruction. There is a need in the near future for a prospective
study to estimate the optimal amount of thermal energy required for LOD, and to correlate the clinical outcome with
ovarian volume and serum concentration of gonadotrophins,
androgen, and AMH.
Conclusions
This study analyzed the influence of the amount of thermal energy, through number of punctures made at LOD, on
the clinical outcome in terms of restoration of menstrual
regularity, ovulation rate, and conception rate. Energy was
delivered to the ovary as deep penetration with the specially
designed diathermy needle using a power setting of 30 W for
duration of 5 seconds per puncture. The application of two
holes per ovary (300 J) was found to produce significantly
poorer results than those in the other groups who received
up to 750 J. Three punctures (450 J) per ovary seemed to be
the plateau dose for LOD. Four or five punctures (600 or
750 J) per ovary appear to be sufficient to produce an optimal
response. Making six or more punctures ( ‡ 900 J) per ovary
appears to deliver an excessive amount of thermal energy to
the ovary without advantage over the lower doses in terms
of success rates, and may potentially cause excessive ovarian
damage.
