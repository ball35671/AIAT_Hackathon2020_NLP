Objective: To study the effects oflaparoscopic ovarian cauterization and combination oflongacting GnRH agonist (GnRH-a) and oral contraceptive (OC) therapy on endocrine changes in
women with clomiphene citrate (CC)-resistant polycystic ovary disease (PCOn).
Design: Prospective, randomized.
Setting: University-based infertility clinic.
Patients: Seventeen women with CC-resistant PCOD were included randomly in the study
to either laparoscopic ovarian cautery or GnRH-a and OC therapy for 3 months.
Main Outcome Measures: Serum concentrations of LH, FSH, androstenedione (A), T, and
sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) were determined before each therapeutic approach and
during the follicular phase of first menstrual cycle after the cessation of each treatment.
Results: The mean serum concentrations and the clinical profiles were similar in both groups.
Both groups showed significant changes in LH, FSH, A, T, and SHBG compared with pretreatment levels. There were no significant differences in the final concentrations of LH, FSH,
and A between the two study groups after each treatment, whereas T and SHBG levels were
significantly different in the goserelin and OC group. The decrease in LH and increase in SHBG
serum concentrations were greater in the goserelin and OC-treated women [-59% and +5.9%
versus -70% and + 13.5%, respectively]. Although the SHBG concentration increased in both
groups, the serum SHBG concentration of the goserelin and OC group was significantly higher
than the other group.
Conclusion: Both therapeutic modalities revealed similar effects on the endocrine profiles
in women with CC-resistant PCOD. Considering the invasiveness, cost, and potential complications of laparoscopic ovarian cauterization, noninvasive medical treatment with GnRH-a and
OC combination may be more effective in restoring the optimal follicular environment in women
with PCOD. Fertil Steril 1996;65:1115-8

Polycystic ovary disease (PCOD) is a heterogeneous spectrum of symptoms frequently presenting
itself with infertility and metabolic changes (1). One
of the main problems with the disease is chronic
anovulation with certain hormonal disturbances
such as increased LH-to-FSH ratio and hyperandrogenism (2, 3).

mammg 10% to 15% of women fail to respond to
increasing doses of CC. Exogenous gonadotropin
therapy with or without GnRH agonist (GnRH-a)
has been accepted as primary treatment for infertility in women with PCOD who fail to respond to increasing doses of CC. Alternatively, bilateral wedge
resection of the ovaries was accepted as a successful
treatment in PCOD patients who fail to respond hormonal medication (5). Although reported to be effective, this approach has been abandoned because it
necessitates invasive surgery with a high probability of periovarian adhesions which may cause mechanical infertility (6, 7). Since the recent work of
Gjonnaess (8), less destructive approaches such as
laparoscopic ovarian electrocautery have gained
popularity. Clinical and/or the endocrine changes
after the procedure have been described in the recent
literature (9-11).
This study was designed to compare the effects of
laparoscopic ovarian electrocautery with a combination of long-acting GnRH-a and oral contraceptive
(OC) therapy on endocrine changes in women with
PCOD who fail to respond increasing doses of CC.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
This study included 17 consecutive women with
clinical and biochemical findings consistent with
PCOD. All participating women consented to the
trial and the protocol was approved by the investigation review board. V pon admission to the clinic, the
patients were allocated randomly into two groups by
sequential assignment based on a table of random
numbers: [1] laparoscopic ovarian cautery and [2]
GnRH-a and low dose OC regimen. All the participants had infertility secondary to anovulation, increased serum LH-to-FSH ratio, elevated androgen
levels (A-T ratio) and/or clinical evidence of androgen excess. In every case the women had enlarged
ovaries with characteristic ultrasonographic features of PCOD (1). All the women had failed previously to ovulate after increasing doses of CC. The
CC dose was increased up to 150 mg/d with the addition ofhCG (10,000 IV) for at least three cycles. The
cycles were monitored with sonographic ovulatory
changes, day 10 serum E2 levels, urinary LH determination, and day 21 serum P assays.
Surgical manipulation was performed (n = 8) under general anesthesia with the use of three puncture techniques. The 10-mm scope was introduced
subumbilically and two other 5-mm trocars were
placed suprapubically. Mter inspecting the pelvic
structures for associated pathology and checking the
tubal patency, the ovaries were stabilized by a grasping forceps. With the aid of unipolar needle cautery,
which was set at 30 W blended current, the ovarian

Approximately 10 to 12 cautery points were applied
to each ovary.
The other group (n = 9) received both 3.6 mg SC

induced menstruation and continued for 3 months.
Blood samples were drawn before operation and
GnRH-a and OC therapy, 1 week after surgery and
during the 6th to 8th day of the first menstrual cycle
of each patient to assess serum levels of LH, FSH,
T, A, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG). The
samples were numbered consecutively and serum
was separated and frozen at -20°C until assayed.
All samples were assessed by RIA in the same assay.
Statistical analyses were performed using at-test
for both paired and unpaired data.
RESULTS
The clinical and endocrine profiles of women included in the study are depicted in Table 1. There
were no differences observed among the treatment
populations regarding age, body mass index, and serum concentrations of the studied hormones (P
> 0.05). No complications were noted from either
treatment modality. The serum concentrations of
LH, A and T began to decrease in the first week after
ovarian cauterization. Menstruation occurred 18 to
27 days after the operation in the ovarian surgery
group and 3 to 7 days after the cessation of OC in
the goserelin and OC group. The ovulation rate after
the cessation of either therapy was similar (6/8 versus 8/9, P > 0.05). Both groups had significant decreases in LH, A, and T levels compared with the
pretreatment levels (P < 0.05) with either therapy.
The change in SHBG levels was significant only

in the goserelin and OC group (P < 0.05), whereas
the observed increase was not significant in the ovarian cautery group (P > 0.05). Figure 1 outlines the
changes in serum concentrations of the measured
hormones compared with the pretreatment levels.
As depicted in Fig. 1, the decrease in LH and increase in FSH and SHBG serum concentrations were
greater in the goserelin and OC-treated women
(-59% and +5.9% versus -70% and + 13.5%, respectively [P < 0.05]).
As shown in Table 2, the mean serum concentrations measured in the follicular phase after each
treatment cycle revealed similar concentrations except for T and SHBG levels. All the measured hormone levels decreased significantly compared with
pretreatment levels. There were no significant differences in the concentrations of LH, FSH, and A (P
> 0.05) between the two study groups, whereas T
and SHBG levels were significantly different in the
goserelin and OC group (P < 0.05). Although the
SHBG concentration increased in both groups, the
serum SHBG concentration of the goserelin and OC
group was significantly higher than the other group
(P < 0.05).
DISCUSSION
The effects of ovarian cauterization on endocrine
profiles and ovulation are clearly established despite
various techniques used. Although the mechanism
of ovulation is uncertain in ovarian cauterization , an increasing number of studies are being reported.
Normalized endocrine milieu is the probable factor
inducing ovulation (12). Generally this favorable endocrine change consists of improved LH-to-FSH ratio and reduced A and T levels, which could be a
direct cause of the improved ovulation (9, 12).
Our results support the above findings in both
treatment groups. It is clearly evident that with
ovarian cauterization, endocrine milieu, specifically
LH levels and hyperandrogenic state, improved irrespective of ovulation. Abdel Gadir et al. (13) have
postulated that withdrawal of a factor, e.g., inhibin,
was responsible for the initial FSH response,
whereas improvement in the LH levels might be T
related. Besides its favorable endocrine effects, ovarian cauterization revealed similar ovulation, pregnancy and abortion rates after the use of hMG or
pure FSH (14). Recently, Balen and Jacobs (15) by
using unilateral diathermy demonstrated bilateral
ovarian activity and showed that diathermy
achieved its effect by correcting abnormal ovarian
pituitary feedback.
The main concern with ovarian cauterization irrespective of technique is the high probability of periovarian adhesions, which may cause mechanical infertilityas a result of ovarian cortex injury. This issue
was the main drawback in ovarian wedge resection.
The degree of damage caused by ovarian cauterization
varies considerably with the techniques used. Irrespective of the technique used (laser photocoagulation or
electrocautery), development of periovarian adhesions
depends on the amount of damage to the ovarian surface; the mild-to-moderate adhesion formation varied
from 20% to SO% with a 50% to 90% ovulation rate
(16-1S). This subject has challenged investigators to
develop strategies to minimize ovarian damage by using appropriate laparoscopic technique. Armar et al.
(11) decreased the number of diathermy points, which
resulted in a low. adhesion formation rate and a high
pregnancy rate.
Long-acting GnRH-a have been used to suppress
abnormal gonadotropin secretion and ovarian hyperandrogenism of pcon besides ovulation induction.
A study comparing electrocautery and GnRH-a demonstrated that both regimens had similar endocrine
effects (19). The only difference was in FSH levels,
which increased after electrocautery. Although we

Vol. 65, No.6, June 1996 Taskin et aI. Ovarian cauterization versus GnRH-a in PCOD 1117 
have added a OC to the GnRH-a, our results were
consistent with the above study. In addition, levels
of FSH were similar to the ovarian cautery group.
Also, SHBG levels in the GnRH-a and OC group
were significantly higher than in the ovarian cauterization group, which might contribute further to optimizing the follicular environment. These observed
favorable effects of GnRH-a and OC treatment on
SHBG and ovarian androgenism are further supported by a recent study (Anania C, Elkind-Hirsch
K, Mack M, abstract). Obviously positive effects of
this regimen on levels of certain growth factor binding proteins such as insulin growth factor-binding
protein (IGF-BP) should be emphasized. Decreased
IGF-BP levels in PCOD may increase the availability offree IGF, which potentiates LH-induced androgen synthesis (20). Tiitinen et al. (21) have demonstrated that CC unresponsiveness is related to low
serum IGF-BP concentration in lean PCOD patients.
Adashi et al. (22) and Balen and Jacobs (23) have
proposed that an increased local cascade of growth
factors such as insulin-like growth factor may increase FSH levels and gonadotropin surge attenuating-inhibitory factor, leading to a fall in LH levels.
On the basis of our results and recent reports on
ovarian cauterization, we conclude that despite similar endocrine effects, medical treatment with GnRHa and OC may be more appropriate and effective in
reversing the abnormal cascade in PCOD. Although
both regimens have temporary and similar improvement on PCOD, the adhesion-forming potential, invasiveness, cost, and surgical complications of laparoscopic ovarian cauterization may enable GnRH-a
and OC combination to be a cost-effective option in
women with PCOD. Moreover, its possible role on
IGF-BP and IGF levels will further improve the abnormal follicular environment and should be emphasized. Further well-controlled studies are needed to
outline the effects of ovarian cauterization and
GnRH-a and OC combination on the IGF/IGF-BP
system in addition to the potential adhesion formation effect.
