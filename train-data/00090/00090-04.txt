Abstract
Objectives To compare the hormonal-metabolic profiles
and reproductive outcomes between women receiving
metformin plus letrozole and women undergoing bilateral
ovarian drilling in clomiphene citrate (CC)-resistant
women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).
Methods In this randomized study, 146 patients were
randomly allocated into group 1 (n = 73) who received
metformin plus letrozole, and group 2 (n = 73) who
underwent bilateral ovarian drilling. Comparison was done
between the basal and after treatment biochemical values
for each group, in addition reproductive outcomes after
treatment were compared between both groups.
Results There was significant reduction in testosterone
(p B 0.001), fasting insulin (p B 0.001), and fasting glucose/fasting insulin ratio (p = 0.029) in metformin plus
letrozole group, while there was significant reduction in
FSH, LH and LH/FSH ratio in bilateral drilling group
(p B 0.001, 0.001 and 0.001). No significant difference in
cycle regularity (p = 0.82), ovulation (p = 0.24), pregnancy rate (p = 0.32) and abortion rate (p = 0.51)
between both groups.
Conclusion Both metformin plus letrozole and bilateral
ovarian drilling are similarly effective as second-line
strategies for the treatment of women with PCOS who do
not conceive with CC.

Introduction
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a leading cause of
anovulatory infertility that affect up to 10 % of women of
reproductive age [1]. Clomiphene citrate (CC) remains the
first line treatment for PCOS [2]. Approximately 15–40 %
of women with PCOS have CC resistance which can be
attributed to the antiestrogenic effect of CC on endometrium and cervical mucus or by oversecretion of luteinizing
hormone [3]. Using other mechanisms to induce ovulation
in patients with CC resistance is a desirable target in
reproductive medicine, gonadotropin and laparoscopic
ovarian drilling have been added to CC to improve treatment outcome in women with PCOS [4]. However, gonadotropin use requires extensive monitoring and associated
with increased risks of multiple pregnancy and ovarian
hyperstimulation syndrome [5]. Clinical evidences confirmed the efficacy of LOD as second-line treatment in
patient with CC-resistant women with PCOS [6].
Many studies have shown the beneficial role of metformin in PCOS patients by increasing pregnancy rate and
improving the metabolic situation [7–10]. Aromatase
inhibitors offer a new horizon in the treatment of anovulation in women with PCOS, letrozole is a selective aromatase inhibitor that decreases estrogen production without
affecting estrogen receptors, reduce the negative feedback
on hypothalamus and pituitary and stimulate FSH release
[11]. Furthermore, letrozole has a short half life [12]. This
study aimed to compare endocrinal changes, metabolic
effects and reproductive outcomes between combined

metformin plus letrozole treatment and laparoscopic
bilateral ovarian drilling in women with CC-resistant
PCOS.
Patients and methods
This study was conducted at Zagazig University Hospitals;
we invited women with PCOS and CC resistance who
attended the infertility clinic to participate in this study.
Ethics Committee of Zagazig University approved the
study and written informed consent was obtained from
each patient at the start of the study. PCOS was diagnosed
on the basis of the revised Rotterdam 2003 criteria [13].
The presence of 2 out of 3 criteria (oligo and/or anovulation, clinical and/or biochemical signs of hyperandrogenism and polycystic ovary) was recommended as
diagnostic of PCOS. Clomiphene citrate resistance was
defined as failure to achieve adequate follicular maturation
after 3 consecutive induction cycles with CC at 150
mg/day for 5 days [14]. Exclusion criteria includes women
with other causes of infertility as male factor or tubal
factor, those with endocrine disorders as thyroid dysfunction and hyperprolactinemia, women who received hormonal treatment or ovulation induction drugs 3 months
before the study. At the start of study, complete medical
history was taken, thorough physical examination was
done, basal hormonal assays were performed on day 2 of
the menstrual cycle in women with oligomenorrhea and at
random in women with amenorrhea, and included measurements of the serum concentrations of luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), fasting
glucose (FG), fasting insulin (FI) level and serum testosterone level. The participant women were randomized
according to a computer-generated random numeric table.
The random allocation sequence was concealed in sealed
dark envelopes, then patients were assigned randomly into
group 1 (n = 73) received metformin plus letrozole, and
group 2 (n = 73) underwent LOD. In group 1, metformin
was started from the first day with a dose of 850 mg (1
tablet daily) and the dosage was increased after 1 week up
to 1,700 mg/day (2 tablets daily) and continued. Metformin
was taken before lunch during the first week and thereafter
before lunch and dinner, then 5 mg of letrozole was added
only for 5 days from day 3 each month of spontaneous or
induced bleeding, metformin was stopped only when
pregnancy was documented.
Group 2 patients underwent ovarian drilling through 3
punctures technique under general anesthesia, after production of pneumoperitoneum using a verrus needle, a
10-mm video laparoscope was inserted infraumbilically,
followed by the lateral insertion of a 5 mm ancillary trocar
in each iliac fossa. The ovarian ligament of each ovary was
held by babcock forceps and 4 drills were performed, then
the ovary cooled by irrigating with normal saline solution
and 500 ml of this solution left in the pelvis at the end of
procedure.
After 6 months, all the previous investigations were
repeated and during this period all participants registered
their bleeding periods in a calendar and ovulation was
monitored by transvaginal ultrasound. A total of 10,000 IU
of HCG was administered to those in whom at least one
ovarian follicle was C18 mm in size with luteal support by
natural progesterone and was continued for 12 weeks if
pregnancy test was positive.
Clinical pregnancy; defined as sonographically visualized intra-uterine gestational sac with pulsating fetal pole.
Spontaneous abortion was defined as the spontaneous loss
of a pregnancy before the end of the 20th week.
Statistical analysis
The data were collected, presented and analyzed using
SPSS-PC (version 10) software. Comparisons between
measures (mean ± SD) were done using Student’s t test for
unpaired data, while comparisons between measures
(mean ± SD) in paired data were done by paired t test. In
addition, comparisons between qualitative categories were
done by chi-square test (v2
). The test results were considered significant when P\0.05.

Results
The baseline characteristics of women in both groups were
shown in (Table 1) they were found comparable in terms of
age, period of infertility, body mass index (BMI), cycle
pattern, hormonal levels and metabolic profile. Six months
after treatment (Table 2) metformin plus letrozole group
showed significant improvement of cycle regularity
(p B 0.001) and significant decrease in testosterone level
(p B 0.001), fasting insulin level (p B 0.001) and HOMA
index (p B 0.001), while FG/FI ratio showed significant
increase (p = 0.029), the decrease in FSH, LH, LH/FSH
ratio and FG levels had not reached significance. On
the other side ovarian drilling group (Table 3) showed
significant improvement of cycle regularity (p B 0.001)
and significant reduction in FSH, LH and LH/FSH ratio
(p B 0.001, 0.001 and 0.001, respectively), no significant
changes were found in other studied parameters. Reproductive outcome had been compared between the two
groups after 6 months (Table 4). The proportion of women
who achieved a regular menstrual cycle was higher in the
metformin plus letrozole group when compared with the
LOD group, but the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.82). There was no significant difference in
ovulation and abortion rates between both groups
(p = 0.24 and 0.51). Pregnancy rate was higher in metformin plus letrozole group (35.6 %) than ovarian drilling
group (31.5 %) with no statistically significant difference
(p = 0.32) (Table 5).
Discussion
Gonadotropin and LOD used traditionally as second line
strategies for the treatment of women with CC-resistant
PCOS [4]. However, both modalities are expensive and not
without risks [15]. In the current study, after treatment with
metformin plus letrozole the decrease in BMI, FSH, LH,
LH/FSH ratio and FG was not statistically significant, while
there was significant improvement of the menstrual cycle, FI,
FG/FI ratio, and testosterone level. Dhanalakshmi et al. [16]
found that after treatment with combined metformin plus
letrozole there was significant decrease in BMI, FSH, LH and
testosterone also significant improvement in cycle regularity. Ashrafinia et al. [17] compared metformin with LOD and
found that after metformin treatment there was significant
decrease in LH and testosterone, but FSH did not show significant change and cycle regularity improved significantly.
In the present study after LOD, there was significant
decrease in FSH and LH with significant improvement of
cycle pattern. In accordance with our study, Apia et al. [18]
reported that after LOD there was significant decrease in
FSH, LH, and testosterone. Ashrafinia et al. [17] found that
after LOD there was significantly improved cycle pattern
with significant decrease in LH and testosterone, but FSH
showed no significant change.
In this study, there was no significant difference in cycle
regularity, ovulation, pregnancy rate and abortion rate
between metformin plus letrozole group and LOD group.

metformin and those undergoing LOD and they found that,
LOD group had more regular cycles and higher rates of
ovulation and pregnancy compared with metformin group,
the difference in early abortion rates between the two
groups was not statistically significant. Abu Hashim et al.
[20] compared the effect of combined metformin and CC
with LOD and found that, resumption of regular menstruation and pregnancy rate were similar in both groups, and
there was no statistically significant difference regarding
the miscarriage rate between both groups. Abdellah [21]
studied the reproductive outcome of letrozole versus LOD
and reported that the ovulation rate was significantly higher
in the letrozole group than in the LOD group, and women
receiving letrozole had a higher pregnancy rate and a lower
rate of spontaneous abortion, but these differences were not
statistically significant. Other study [22] reported that letrozole and LOD groups were similar in resumption of
regular menstruation and pregnancy rate with no statistical
significant differences as regards ovulation, miscarriage
and live birth rates between both groups. Sohrabvand et al.
[23] added either CC or letrozole after initial 6–8 weeks of
metformin treatment in CC-resistant PCOS women then
they noticed that, the combination of metformin and letrozole leaded to higher full-term pregnancies. In this
study, we performed only 4 drills as there is a continuing
concern about the adverse effects of laparoscopic ovarian
drilling (LOD) particularly on periovarian adhesions formation and premature ovarian failure [6] and the greater
the amount of damage to the surface of the ovary the
greater the risk of periovarian adhesions [24] our results are
consistent with other studies [21, 22] in which the same
number of drills were used and even higher ovulation rates
were reported. In conclusion, the results of this study
indicated that both metformin plus letrozole and LOD were
equally effective in the management of women with CCresistant PCOS. Metformin plus letrozole, as compared to
LOD, had not associated with the risks of this invasive
procedure, such as anesthetic risk, adhesion formation, and
possibility of ovarian destruction and premature ovarian
failure. Hence, combined metformin plus letrozole should
be considered as an efficient alternative in treatment of CCresistant PCOS women, while LOD could be reserved for
women with PCOS if laparoscopy indicated for other
reasons.
