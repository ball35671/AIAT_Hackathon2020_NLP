Abstract: Objective: The aim of the current trial was to compare the efficacy of unilateral versus bilateral LOD in
women with CC-resistant PCOS as regard regularity of menses and successful ovulation within 3 months following
laparoscopy. Methods: The study included women who had a diagnosis of clomiphene-citrate-resistant polycystic
ovarian syndrome (CC-resistant PCOS) and planned for laparoscopic ovarian drilling (LOD). In all included cases, a
three-puncture laparoscopy was performed under general anesthesia. Ovarian drilling was performed using unipolar
diathermy needle. The primary outcome was documented ovulation through a midluteal serum progesterone > 3 ng/ml
three months after laparoscopy. Results: A total of 60 women were included in the study; and randomized equally into
one of the two groups: unilateral versus bilateral ovarian drilling. There was no significant difference between women
of both groups regarding regularity of menses within 3 months following LOD. In each group, individually, there was a
significant rise in basal serum FSH, a significant reduction in basal serum LH and a significant rise in midluteal serum
progesterone when 3-month post-LOD levels were compared to pre-LOD levels. These significant changes were
comparable in both groups. Conclusion: Unilateral LOD seems to be as effective as bilateral LOD in terms of
restoration of regular menstrual pattern and ovulation, as evident by the midluteal serum progesterone.

1. Introduction:
Polycystic ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is the
most common cause of anovular infertility being
responsible for almost 70% of such cases [1]. Medical
induction of ovulation with clomiphene citrate (CC),
despite being the drug of choice in induction of
ovulation in those cases, is not always successful, with
an approximate 20% rate of the so-called CC
resistance. One treatment option for women who are
CC-resistant is induction of ovulation using
gonadotropins. Gonadotropin therapy is often
characterized by over-production of follicles and is,
therefore, associated with higher risk of ovarian
hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) and multiple
pregnancies [2]. The second alternative to gonadotropin
therapy is the laparoscopic ovarian drilling (LOD) [3]. A
recent study [4] even suggested that LOD could be
recommended as a first line if laparoscopy is indicated
for other reasons in these women and as an adjunct to
CC treatment. It has been shown that LOD both
induces ovulation and remarkably improves
responsiveness of the ovaries to the CC in previouslylabeled CC-resistant women [5.6]. Benefits of LOD
include the eliminated need for cycle monitoring and
the low risk of multiple pregnancies and OHSS [3].
LOD is not without hazards, however. Tubo-ovarian
adhesions and theoretical risk of premature ovarian
failure (POF) following LOD are of concern. The
standard LOD includes drilling of both ovaries. It has
been suggested by some authors that unilateral rather
than bilateral ovarian drilling would have similar
benefits, with lower risk of adhesions and POF [7]. The
aim of the current trial was to compare the efficacy of
unilateral versus bilateral LOD in women with CCresistant PCOS as regard regularity of menses and
successful ovulation within 3 months following
laparoscopy.
2. Patient and Methods:
The current study was conducted at Ain
Shams University Maternity Hospital during the period
between February 2010 and September 2010. The
study included women attending the outpatient
infertility clinic with a diagnosis of clomiphene-citrateresistant polycystic ovarian syndrome (CC-resistant
PCOS) and planned for laparoscopic ovarian drilling
(LOD). PCOS was diagnosed according to the
Rotterdam criteria [8], by presence of two of the
following three criteria (after exclusion of related
disorders of hyperandrogenism like congenital adrenal
hyperplasia): oligomenorrhea and/or anovulation;
clinical and/or biochemical signs of hyperandrogenism;
and transvaginal sonographic appearance of polycystic
ovaries. Oligomenorrhea was defined as cycle intervals
of more than 35 days. Anovulation was defined if midluteal serum progesterone was less than 3 ng/ml. The

presence of polycystic ovaries is established when at
least one ovary has either ≥ 12 follicles measuring 2–9
mm in diameter tightly spaced along the periphery of
the ovary and/or an ovarian volume of >10 cm3 by
transvaginal ultrasonography [9]. CC resistance was
identified when the patient failed to respond in terms of
ovulation to an incremental dose of clomiphene citrate
up to 150 mg per day [7]. Basal serum levels of follicle
stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone
(LH) and midluteal serum progesterone were assayed
in included women prior to laparoscopy. In all included
cases, a three-puncture laparoscopy was performed
under general anesthesia. Ovarian drilling was
performed using unipolar diathermy needle (Karl
Storz®, ND, Germany). The drilling needle was used to
penetrate the ovarian capsule at right angle to a
standard depth of 8 mm at 4 points with an initial 60-W
cutting current to allow penetration of the ovarian
surface followed by a 40-W coagulation current for 4
seconds. The included 60 women were randomized into
one of two groups: group I, in who unilateral ovarian
drilling was performed; and group-II, in whom bilateral
ovarian drilling was performed. The primary outcome
was documented ovulation through a midluteal serum
progesterone > 3 ng/ml three months after laparoscopy.
Secondary outcomes included regularity of menstrual
cycles and basal levels of serum FSH and LH within
three months after laparoscopy.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using
Microsoft® Excel® version 2010 and Statistical
Package for Social Sciences (SPSS®, Inc., Chicago, IL,
USA) for Windows version 15.0. Data were described
as range, mean and standard deviation (for numeric
variables); or number and percentage (for categorical
variables). Difference between two unrelated groups
was estimated using independent student’s t-test (for
numeric variables) or chi-squared test (for categorical
variables). Difference between two related numeric
groups was estimated using paired student’s t-test.
Significance level was set at 0.05.
3. Results
A total of 60 women were included in the
study; and randomized equally into one of the two
groups: unilateral versus bilateral ovarian drilling. The
mean age of included women was 27.23 ± 2.11 years
(range: 24 – 32 years). The mean duration of infertility
was 3.01 ± 0.94 years (range: 2 – 5 years). Of the
included 60 women, 14 (23.3%) had amenorrhea, while
46 (76.7%) had oligomenorrhea. The mean body mass
index (BMI) was 29.8 ± 2.8 Kg/m2 (range: 26 – 40
Kg/m2
). There were no significant differences between
women of both groups regarding age, duration of
infertility, irregularity of menses and BMI. There were
no significant differences between women of both
groups regarding initial (pre-laparoscopy) serum levels
of basal FSH, basal LH and midluteal progesterone
(Table-1). There was no significant difference between
women of both groups regarding regularity of menses
within 3 months following LOD [21/30 (70%) vs.
23/30 (76.7%), respectively, p=0.826] (Table-2). The
rate of documented ovulation (through a midluteal
progesterone > 3 ng/ml) 3 months following LOD was
slightly lower in women who had unilateral LOD when
compared to those who had bilateral LOD [20/30
(66.7%) vs. 22/30 (73.3%), respectively]; this
difference was, however, not significant (p=0.573)
(Figure-1). There were no significant differences
between women of both groups regarding serum levels
of basal FSH, basal LH and midluteal progesterone
measured 3 months post-LOD (Table-2). In each
group, individually, there was a significant rise in basal
serum FSH, a significant reduction in basal serum LH
and a significant rise in midluteal serum progesterone
when 3-month post-LOD levels were compared to preLOD levels. These significant changes were
comparable in both groups (Table-2).

4. Discussion
In the current trial, 21 (70%) women of those
who had unilateral LOD restored their regular
menstrual cycles after unilateral ovarian drilling, in
contrast to 23 (76.7%) women of those who had
bilateral LOD; an obviously non-significant difference.
LOD has been evidently shown to clinically improve
outcomes in women with PCOS in terms of regular
menstrual cycles. In a study conducted on 66 women
with oligo/amenorrhea due to PCOS, 53 (80.3%)
showed a regular menstrual cycle post-laparoscopy [10].
In a study similar to the current one, Roy et al.
randomized 44 women into either unilateral or bilateral
ovarian drilling. The rates of regular menstrual cycles
following LOD were 72.7% and 81.8%, respectively
(p=0.760) [7]. Restoration of regular menstrual cycles is
a good clinical indicator of resumption of normal
ovulatory function. This has been biochemically
proven through a significant rise in midluteal serum
progesterone 3 months post-LOD in both women who
underwent unilateral or bilateral drilling. The
difference between both groups regarding the midluteal
serum progesterone was not significant, denoting,
along with the close rates of regular menstrual cycles
following LOD, a comparable efficacy of unilateral and
bilateral drilling regarding induction of ovulation.
Similar conclusions were reached by similar previous
studies [7,11-13]. LOD has been associated with reduction
in basal serum LH level in women with PCOS; a
finding of the previous and current studies [7,11,13-14].
High basal serum LH has been linked to CC resistance
in women with PCOS. Reduction in basal serum LH
was known to be a marker of good response to LOD
[7,13,15]. One of the possible major drawbacks of LOD is
the risk of diminished ovarian reserve and premature
ovarian failure (POF) [16]. In the current study, despite
being short-term, LOD was associated with significant
rise in basal serum FSH; the rise was no significantly
different between women who underwent unilateral
and those who underwent bilateral ovarian drilling.
However, again, the results regarding ovarian reserve
cannot be deduced from such short-term evaluation.
Longer follow-up over years is needed to explore such
a risk. Indeed, the impact of LOD on ovarian reserve
has been revised by more recent work and was found to
be just theoretical. Api conducted a systematic review
in 2009 on this issue and concluded that no solid
evidence of a diminished ovarian reserve or POF was
associated with LOD over years [17]. In conclusion,
unilateral LOD seems to be as effective as bilateral
LOD in terms of restoration of regular menstrual
pattern and ovulation, as evident by the midluteal

serum progesterone. Nevertheless, impact on ongoing
pregnancy rates is needed to be explored. Moreover,
long-term follow-up is needed to explore the difference
between both approaches regarding the risks of tuboovarian adhesions and diminished ovarian reserve.
