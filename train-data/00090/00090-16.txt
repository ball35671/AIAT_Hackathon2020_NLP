ABSTRACT
Objective: A randomized, prospective pilot study was conducted to evaluate the clinical and
endocrine parameters following laparoscopic unipolar and bipolar ovarian drilling in infertile women with clomiphene-resistant polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). Study Design:
This was a randomized, prospective pilot study of 20 patients with clomiphene–resistant
PCOS attending the gynecology outpatient department and gynecology endocrinology clinic
of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (New Delhi, India). The patients were randomly
assigned to 2 groups: unipolar (group I) and bipolar (group II), of 10 patients each. Outcome measures were ovulation rate, pregnancy rate, changes in luteinizing hormone (LH),
follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), testosterone levels, and alteration of glucose tolerance
and insulin levels. Results: After ovarian drilling, 6 patients (60%) in group I and 8 (80%)
in group II ovulated spontaneously (p  0.63), and 3 (30%) more patients ovulated after
clomiphene citrate in group I and 1 (10%) in group II, with a total ovulation rate of 90%
in both groups (p  0.46). Six (6; 60%) pregnancies resulted in group I and 8 (80%) pregnancies resulted in group II (p  0.63). LH levels fell significantly only in group II after 3
months (11.11  1.25 to 4.88  1.34 mIu/mL; p  0.036), and there was no significant change
in FSH and testosterone levels in either group. The fasting serum insulin levels increased
nonsignificantly from 17.70  5.27 IU/mL to 21.90  7.43 IU/mL (p  0.71) in group I
and from 7.73  IU/mL to 13.11  3.55 IU/mL (p  0.27) in group II 3 months after
surgery. Area under curve (AUC) glucose and insulin values fell postoperatively in both the
groups. Conclusions: Laparoscopic bipolar ovarian drilling is an effective alternative to
unipolar drilling in resuming ovulatory cycles and conception. Bipolar electrocoagulation
has merits of favorable success rates along with expected safety and chances of fewer postoperative adhesions. (J GYNECOL SURG 22:105)
INTRODUCTION
POLYCYSTIC OVARY SYNDROME (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder, affecting
5%–10% of premenopausal women.1 Clomiphene citrate, menopausal gonadotropin (hMG),
and so forth, are the most frequently used drugs, which induces ovulation in 60%–70% of cases,

but the reported pregnancy rate is low, 30%–40%,1,2 and is associated with increased incidence
of multiple pregnancies, miscarriage, and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, and ovulatory cycles tend to become anovulatory after suspension of treatment.
The development of operative laparoscopy permitted the introduction of minimally invasive
surgery for the treatment of PCOS. In 1984, Gjonnaess,3 using unipolar biopsy forceps, performed
ovarian electrocauterization. Since then, several reports of laparoscopic management of PCOS,
using various modalities, such as unipolar drilling, multiple ovarian biopsies, and laser vaporization, emerged. These techniques have limitations, such as risk of bleeding, postoperative adhesions, and risk of overtreatment and consequent ovarian atrophy with unipolar coagulation.
Merchant, in 1996,4 introduced a new technique of bipolar electrocoagulation of ovaries, using
low-watt bipolar current, which is known to cause less bleeding, decreased destruction of tissue,
and lower risk of injury to other viscera and, theoretically, less chances of ovarian atrophy.
There are no studies indicating the effect of bipolar electrocauterization on the clinical outcome
and endocrine parameters in management of resistant PCOS. So we conducted a study to find the
response of bipolar ovarian drilling in resistant PCOS on clinical outcome, endocrine profile, and
insulin resistance in comparison of unipolar cautery.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
A randomized, prospective pilot study was conducted in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (New Delhi, India). The diagnosis of
PCOS was made on criteria by the National Institute of Health Consensus Conference on PCOS.
A total of 20 PCOS patients who were resistant to 6 cycles of ovulation induction with clomiphene
citrate and were having patent tubes on hysterosalpingography or laparoscopy with normal husband semen analysis were included in the study. They were randomly assigned by using computerized random table to group I and group II for unipolar and bipolar electocautery of 10 patients each.
On enrollment, patients were evaluated clinically in detail, and luteinizing hormone (LH) and
follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) testosterone were estimated on days 3–7 of spontaneous menstrual cycle or medroxy progesterone acetate–induced withdrawl bleeding. Glucose tolerance test
(GTT) with 75 g glucose and serum insulin level fasting and 120 minutes after 75 g glucose was
done after overnight fast and followed in the cycle with ultrasound for ovarian morphology. Patients were subjected to unipolar or bipolar ovarian drilling after informed consent and anesthesia clearance. The unipolar ovarian drilling was done by unipolar diathermy needle from Karl
Storz 30675 ND (Tuttilingen, Germany) at power settings of 30–40 watts, and bipolar ovarian
drilling was done by bipolar diathermy needle from Eisner, Vitalitec 490096 at power settings of
40–50 watts. Electrocauteries were used with pure cutting current to pierce the capsule of 5 mm
deep, followed by coagulation current for 5 seconds. The average number of punctures were 14.8
and 14.9 in each ovary in groups I and II, respectively. All the procedures were done by the second author.
Patients were discharged after 24 hours and followed up after 1 and 3 months at onset of periods. Patients were assessed clinically for regularization of cycle, ovulation, and pregnancy outcome, and LH, FSH, and testosterone were estimated on both follow-up visits, whereas GTT and
serum insulin levels were done after 3 months of surgery. If the patient had not ovulated or conceived after 3 months of the procedure, ovulation was induced with clomiphene and was followed
up for conception.
Serum LH, FSH, and testosterone were measured by Elecsys 1010 by electrochemiluminiscence
assay by Boehringer Mannheim (Mannheim, Germany). Serum insulin levels were measured by
106 Sharma et al. Journal of Gynecologic Surgery
an Enzyme Immunoassay (EIA) kit from Mercodia (Uppsala, Sweden). Clinical outcome was assessed on the basis of achievement of regular cycles, ovulation, and conception. Endocrine parameters were assessed on the basis of changes in biochemical values. Hyperinsulinism was considered when the glucose to insulin ratio (G/I) was more than 4.5.
The responses of ovarian drilling on clinical and biochemical parameters in each group were
assessed by the Mann-Whitney test and chi-square test with Yate’s correction factor. To see the
trend within the group, Friedman two-way analysis of variance (ANNOVA) and the Wilcoxon
signed test was applied separately for both groups and a p-value 0.05 was considered as one of
statistical significance. The Kaplan-Meier test acturial survival analysis was done to see the probability of conception. The response to OGTT was analyzed as the area under curve (AUC) calculated by the trapezoidal method, and SPSS 7.5 (Chicago, IL) was used for calculation of the
study.
RESULTS
The average age of patients in the study was 27.3 (range, 21–32) in group I and 25.5 (range,
23–30) in group II. The baseline clinical and biochemical profile of the patients is shown in Table
1. All patients had ultrasound morphology suggestive of polycystic ovaries. Baseline menstrual
patterns in both groups and responses to surgery are shown in Table 2. The endometrial aspirate
showed proliferative endometrium in 45% (9/20) of patients (3/10 in group I and 6/10 in group
II), and simple hyperplasia was seen in 10% (2/20) of patients; both patients belonged to group
I. High LH levels (LH 10 mIU/mL) was seen in 3 (30%) patients in group I and 5 (50%) patients in group II. LH/FSH ratio 2 was found in 8/20 (40%) patients in both groups. Hyperandrogenemia (testosterone 1.2 ng/mL) was found in 5 (50%) patients in group I and 6 (60%) paVolume 22, Number 3, 2006 Ovarian Drilling in Women with PCOS 107

20%) patients ovulated after clomiphene citrate (3 [30%] in group I and 1 [10%] in group II) with
total ovulation rate of 90% in both the groups (p  0.46).
After surgery, 12 (60%) patients conceived, 5 (50%) patients in group I and 7 (70%) patients in group II (p  0.65). All patients in group I and 6 (60%) patients in group II conceived spontaneously, and 1 patient conceived in her first cycle of ovulation induction with
clomiphene after surgery in group II. In group I, 1 (10%) patient had a miscarriage at 8 weeks,
the rest (4 patients) delivered at term, giving birth to live, healthy babies. One (1) patient conceived a second time after a miscarriage and was delivered vaginally at term. Only 1 patient
developed gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), and none of the patients developed pregnancyinduced hypertension (PIH). In group II, 7 (70%) patients conceived and 1 patient conceived
twice. None of the patients developed GDM or PIH. Using a life-table analysis, the cumulative pregnancy rates in group I were 40% and 50% and in group II were 50% and 60% at 3
months and 6 months, respectively.
Hormonal changes, the results of a glucose tolerance test, and insulin levels after ovarian drilling
are shown in Table 3. Four (4; 40%) patients in group I had fasting hyperinsulinemia, of which
1 patient conceived soon after surgery; in another 2 patients, serum insulin decreased marginally,
and in a fourth patient, fasting serum insulin level increased after surgery. One (1; 10%) patient
in group II had fasting hyperinsulinemia, which remained the same after surgery. Two (2) patients
in group I were insulin-resistant with a fasting glucose-to-insulin ration of 4.5, 1 conceived, and
another patient had a fasting glucose-to-insulin ratio increase. One (1, 10%) patient in group II
was insulin-resistant, which remained the same after surgery. AUC glucose responses to OGTT
were marginally lower in both groups after surgery (14494.5  975.07 mg/dL to 14157.5  1268.7

DISCUSSION
There are various studies of unipolar laparoscopic ovarian drilling with short- and long-term effects on ovulation, conception, and hormonal profile. This is the first study where bipolar drilling
has been compared to the standard unipolar drilling in terms of clinical and biochemical parameters. After unipolar drilling, the ovulation rate varies from 30% to 80%5,6 in resistant PCOS. In
one study, after bipolar drilling, 88% ovulated spontaneously and after clomiphene supplementation, 100% patients ovulated.4 In our study, 70% of patients ovulated spontaneously after the
surgery. The ovulation rate was higher in group II (80%) than in group I (60%), which increased
to 90% in both the groups after clomiphene stimulation after 3 months of surgery.
In our study, after ovarian drilling, 12 (60%) women conceived, 5 (50%) women in group I and
7 (70%) in group II. A large study of bipolar ovarian drilling, although it was not compared with
unipolar cautery, shows that pregnancy rate after bipolar electrocauterization was 84%, where
57% conceived spontaneously within three cycles and 27% after supplementation with
clomiphene.4 Our results are consistent with the above study in which 6 patients (60%) conceived
spontaneously and 1 (10%) conceived after supplementation in the bipolar group. The pregnancy
rate was slightly better in group II, but it was not found statistically significant because of the
small sample size. There are no studies in the literature, to the best of our knowledge, regarding
postoperative adhesions after ovarian drilling comparing unipolar and bipolar electric current. In
animal studies, the lowest adhesion rates were seen after coagulation with bipolar high-frequency
current, when compared with unipolar current and lasers.5

After surgical treatment of PCOS by electrocauterization, most authors have reported a fall in
LH levels responsible for resumption of ovulation and conception.6–8 In group I, there was a marginal rise in LH levels after 1 month, with a further rise after 3 months of surgery, but the change
was not statistically significant. In group II, LH levels were found to increase after 1 month, and
after 3 months, there was a significant decrease in LH levels.
FSH levels increased among patients who ovulated spontaneously after laparoscopic resection
or electrocauterization by some surgeons.9,10 However, many other surgeons did not find any significant increase in FSH levels after electrocauterization.10 In both of the groups, FSH levels had
an initial rise after 1 month but a statistically insignificant fall at the 3-month follow-up. In both
groups, testosterone levels decreased postoperatively. Patients who had conceived soon after
surgery were those whose hormonal mileu had responded favorably to the drilling. In this study
4 (40%) patients in group I and 5 (50%) patients in group II conceived within 3 months of surgery
and hormonal analysis could not be done in these patients. The favorable endocrine changes might
not occur after surgery in patients who failed to conceive and hence reflecting a persistence of
high LH levels after surgery.
Hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance are important features of PCOS, which through insulinlike growth factors, impair ovarian function, leading to infertility. High LH levels were found in
60% of patient and LH/FSH ratio 2 in 45.7% among 70 women with PCOS.8 In our study, high
LH levels were seen in 40% and 10% of women with PCOS in groups I and II, respectively, and
LH:FSH ratio 2 in 40% of women with PCOS in both the groups. Legro et al., in 1998,11 evaluated the fasting glucose to insulin ratio as the single best measure of insulin resistance, with a
cut-off value 4.5 in PCOS. In this study, 3 (15%) women were insulin resistant, with the fasting
G:I ratio 4.5 (2 in group I and 1 in group II).
Insulin-mediated changes have not been well studied after surgical treatment of PCOS. Tulandi
et al., in 2003,12 studied the effect of laparoscopic ovarian drilling on insulin responses to the oral
glucose tolerance test (GTT) in 27 women with PCOS and concluded that there was no difference in serum glucose and insulin responses to oral GTT before and after ovarian drilling, which
is similar to our finding in this study. Among three insulin-resistant patients in our study, 1 conceived and in 2 others, the G:I ratio remained the same after surgery.
In both the groups, there was a slight rise in fasting serum insulin levels, which was statistically not significant. The postprandial insulin and fasting glucose to insulin ratio decreased nonsignificantly in both the groups. One (1) patient in the unipolar group had impaired glucose tolerance, which remained the same after the surgery. Another patient in the bipolar group had
impaired glucose tolerance before surgery, which disappeared after the surgery. There were 5 conceptions in the unipolar group; all were in those patients who had achieved regular cycles. Among
3 insulin-resistant patients, 1 patient conceived. In the bipolar group, of 7 patients who conceived,
3 patients conceived even before menstruation occurred, and other patients had regular cycles.
One (1) patient required ovulation induction. Insulin-resistant patients were poor responders. Even
in our previous study, we found that responders with metformin had lower insulin levels.13
CONCLUSIONS
Our study shows ovulation rate and pregnancy after bipolar ovarian drilling are better than
unipolar ovarian drilling, but statistical significance could not be arrived at owing to the small
sample size. Bipolar cautery, having merits of less tissue destruction and probably less postoperative adhesions, may be a preferred modality for ovarian drilling. A larger study is required to
conclude with statistical significance that bipolar cautery is a safe modality for treatment of infertile women with PCOS with less tissue destruction and less postoperative adhesions leading to
better pregnancy outcome.
