Objective: To evaluate the outcome of ovarian needle drilling using transvaginal ultrasound guidance as an alternative to the traditional laparoscopic electrosurgical drilling for patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).
Design: A randomized controlled study.
Setting: University teaching hospital and private practice setting.
Patient(s): The study comprised 163 patients with clomiphene-resistant PCOS.
Intervention(s): Patients were randomly allocated to either treatment with ultrasound-guided transvaginal needle
ovarian drilling (UTND; n ¼ 82) or laparoscopic electrosurgery ovarian drilling (n ¼ 81).
Main Outcome Measure(s): Hormonal changes (FSH, LH, T), ovulation and pregnancy.
Result(s): There were no significant differences between the two groups with regard to body mass index, hormonal
profiles, clinical manifestations, and ultrasound findings of PCOS. The duration of UTND was 15.3  5.61 minutes
(10.5–22.3 minutes), while it was 25.6  8.2 minutes (20.3–38.1 minutes) in laparoscopic drilling, with a statistically significant difference between the two groups. There were no significant differences between the two groups
with regard to resumption of normal menstruation, hirsutism, acne, ovulation, and pregnancy. UTND resulted in
significant improvement in the ovulation, pregnancy, hirsutism, and acne. There were significant decreases in
the serum LH and T levels but not in the FSH or LH/FSH levels after UTND as well.
Conclusion(s): UTND can be adopted as an outpatient office procedure. The ease of scheduling, reduced costs, and
rapid recovery suggest it as a first-line treatment for PCOS cases resistant to clomiphene citrate. (Fertil Steril

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine
disorder in young women that manifests itself in a variety of
clinical manifestations such as oligomenorrhea/amenorrhea,
hyperandrogenism, and anovulation. About 55%–75% of
patients with PCOS are infertile because of chronic anovulation (1–3). Clomiphene citrate (CC) is the standard drug
for inducing ovulation in those patients. It is not, however,
equally successful in all situations. Gonadotropin stimulation is often the next step for the treatment of CC-resistant
infertile women. After unsuccessful medical induction of
ovulation, ovarian drilling has been established for drug-resistant PCOS (4). The cumulative pregnancy rate after ovarian surgery for PCOS is approximately 55%, which is
similar to that obtained by medical induction of ovulation
(5–7). To date, several techniques of laparoscopic surgery
have been described, including ovarian biopsy (8), ovarian
electrocautery (9, 10), laser ovarian drilling (11), and ovarian hydrocoagulation (12). Nevertheless, laparoscopic ovarian drilling is costly and requires hospital treatment and
general anesthesia, and the risk of postoperative adhesions
cannot be ignored (7). In the present study, we aim to evaluate the outcome of ovarian needle drilling using transvaginal ultrasound guidance (UTND) as an alternative to the
traditional laparoscopic electrosurgical drilling for patients
with PCOS.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The study comprised 163 patients with CC-resistant PCOS
among those attending the Outpatient Clinic at the Mansoura University Hospitals, Egypt, and a private practice
setting in the period from January 2005 to January 2007. Diagnosis of PCOS was based on the Rotterdam ESHRE/
ASRM-sponsored PCOS Consensus Workshop Group’s
‘‘Revised 2003 consensus on diagnostic criteria and longterm health risks related to polycystic ovary syndrome
(PCOS)’’ (13). All women had patent fallopian tubes proved
by hysterosalpingography, and their partners had normal
semen analysis according to the modified World Health Organization criteria. All patients had normal serum PRL,
TSH, and 17-OH-P. Clomiphene resistance, in this study,
means that women were previously treated with CC 100
mg daily for 5 days per cycle, for 2–3 cycles, with persistent
anovulation or ovulation with very thin endometrium, <5

approved by the local Research Ethics Committee, and all
participants gave informed consent before inclusion in the
trial.
Randomization
Patients were randomly allocated to either treatment with
UTND (n ¼ 82) or laparoscopic electrosurgery ovarian drilling (n ¼ 81) using a computer-generated random table.
Ultrasound-Guided Transvaginal Needle Ovarian Drilling
(UTND)
The patient was placed in the dorsal lithotomy position with
slightly elevated shoulders to allow the enlarged ovaries to
fall into the Pouch of Douglas. The vagina and perineum
were prepared with an antiseptic solution. A preliminary
transvaginal ultrasound was done to scan the pelvis before attempting the procedure and to measure the ovarian volume using the endovaginal probe. The UTND was performed, under
general anesthesia with Propofol (Diprivan, Zeneka Pharma
International, Cheshire, UK), using a 16-gauge, 35-cm long
sharp needle connected to a continuous manual vacuum pressure. Each ovary was repeatedly punctured from different
angles with between three and six punctures, and all the small
follicles visible by ultrasound were aspirated. Patients were
discharged after 2–3 hours after transvaginal ultrasound scanning to rule out any complications of the procedure. The total
duration of the procedure was recorded, and intraoperative or
postoperative complications were reported.
Laparoscopic Electrosurgery Ovarian Drilling
A three-puncture laparoscopy was performed. A monopolar
electrosurgical probe was used to penetrate the ovarian capsule at a number of points with the aid of a short burst of diathermy. A monopolar coagulating current at 30-W power
setting was used, and the duration of each penetration was
5 seconds. Three to six punctures were made in each ovary
depending on its size, each measuring 4 mm in diameter
and 5–7 mm in depth. Each ovary was cooled by irrigation
using Ringer’s lactated solution. The total duration of the procedure was recorded, and intraoperative or postoperative
complications were reported.
Follow-up
All patients in both groups had serum FSH, LH, and free T
levels measured on day 3 of the next menses after the procedure. All patients were monitored by transvaginal ultrasound
for the mean follicular diameter and endometrial thickness on
days 10, 12, and 14 of the cycle. Serum P (ng/mL) was measured on days 21–23 of the cycle by radioimmunoassay using
the antibody coated-tube method (Coat-A-Count; Diagnostic
Products Corporation, Los Angeles). Ovulation was considered when serum P was >5 ng/mL. Follow-up continued
for 6 months after the procedure. All patients who showed
ovulation were advised to engage in natural intercourse.
Serum hCG was determined in the absence of menstruation
for diagnosis of pregnancy.
RESULTS
The study comprised 163 patients in total, aged 18–32 years.
Table 1, which describes the patient characteristics, shows
that there were no significant differences between the two
groups with regard to body mass index, hormonal profiles,
clinical manifestations, and ultrasound findings of PCOS.
The duration of UTND was 15.3  5.61 minutes (10.5–
22.3 minutes), while it was 25.6  8.2 minutes (20.3–38.1
minutes) for the laparoscopic drilling, with a statistically

differences between the two groups with regard to resumption of normal menstruation, hirsutism, acne, ovulation, and
pregnancy. In addition, there were no differences in the
hormonal changes after drilling in the two groups. Figure 1,
which shows the clinical outcome after UTND, indicates
significant improvement in ovulation, pregnancy, hirsutism,
and acne rates (P<.05). Hormonal changes after UTND
showed a significant decrease in the serum LH and T levels
(P<.05) but not in the FSH or LH/FSH levels (P>.05). No
complications were reported in either treatment group.
DISCUSSION
Invasive surgical treatment for PCOS to restore physiological
function has been demonstrated since 1935 to be effective
(14). This approach was the standard therapy until the early
1970s, when it was demonstrated that it is associated with
postoperative pelvic adhesions that may lead to subsequent
mechanical infertility (15). The development of operative
laparoscopy in 1972 permitted the introduction of minimally
invasive procedures for surgical treatment of patients with
PCOS. Since that time, several investigators have described
different approaches for ovarian drilling using unipolar current, mechanical scissors, or laser technique. The precise
mechanism through which surgical therapy improves the
ovarian function in patients with PCOS has not been clearly
defined. First, it has been postulated that ovarian trauma may
impair local androgen synthesis with associated reduction of
intraovarian androgen levels and a diminished androgen
inhibitory effect on follicular maturation (16). Second,
decreased androgen levels may result in lowered peripheral
conversion of androgen to estrogen and hence in a decreased
positive feedback on LH secretion (17). It is likely that other
factors, such as inhibin and other intraovarian substances,
may also be involved. The removal of these inhibitor factors
through the drainage of ovarian microcysts or the destruction
of ovarian stromal tissue can permit the recruitment of a new
cohort of follicles either spontaneously or under exogenous
FSH stimulation (18). In this study, we showed that even
the transvaginal ovarian needle drilling can act at the ovarian
levels to improve the ovulation. The outcome of this simple
technique was comparable to the standard bipolar drilling
without all the risks expected from the latter. The idea of
needle drilling came to mind through the observation of
improved ovarian performance in patients with PCOS after
previous follicular aspiration for IVF trials. Mio et al. tried
transvaginal ultrasound-guided follicular aspiration in the
midluteal phase for all persistent follicles (19). None of the
participants in this trial conceived in the aspiration cycle.
However, the response to ovulation induction was improved
in subsequent cycles.
These findings were similar to those of other investigators
who have performed transvaginal ultrasound-guided cyst aspiration in anovulatory women with PCOS for research into in vitro
maturation and have found that ovulatory cycles are resolved
without the aid of adjuvant ovulation induction therapy (20).

The results of UTND were similar to those of laparoscopic
electrosurgical drilling with regard to the resumption of normal menstruation, acne, hirsutism, ovulation, and pregnancy.
The duration of the procedure was significantly shorter than
the traditional laparoscopic drilling using electrosurgery. In
agreement with previous studies (21) for hormonal changes
after drilling, we found a significant decrease in LH and androgen levels but not in FSH or LH/FSH levels. We did not
have any complications during the procedure, and patients
needed minimal pain management in the early postoperative
period and were discharged within 2–3 hours of the completion of the procedure. We sometimes had difficulty in fixing
the ovaries during drilling; however, slightly raising the
shoulders of the patients and the heavy weight of the polycystic ovaries helped in getting the ovaries accessible in the
Pouch of Douglas in almost all cases.
We think that UTND fulfills the criteria of the ideal office
procedure because it is safe and can be undertaken in a short
period of time with minimal morbidity and inconvenience to
the patient. Moreover, the cost of the procedure is minimal
compared with the hospital charges needed for the conventional laparoscopic ovarian drilling. In the present study,
follow-up of the patients after the procedure continued for
only 6 months; however, a longer duration of follow-up is
required to verify its medium- and long-term effects.
In conclusion, UTND can be adopted as an outpatient
office procedure. The ease of scheduling, reduced costs,
and rapid recovery suggest it as a first-line treatment for
PCOS cases resistant to CC. It can be repeated in those cases
who fail to ovulate or in those with recurrent anovulatory
states.
