Objective: To compare the hormonal-metabolic profiles and reproductive outcomes in clomiphene-resistant
patients with polycystic ovary syndrome and insulin resistance between women receiving metformin and
those undergoing laparoscopic ovarian drilling. Methods: A total of 110 eligible participants were randomly
allocated to diagnostic laparoscopy plus metformin therapy (group 1, n= 55) or laparoscopic ovarian drilling
(group 2, n= 55). The t test was used for mean comparisons of hormonal-metabolic parameters and OGTT
values before and after treatment. The χ2 test was used for comparisons of ovulation, pregnancy, and
abortion rates. Results: Groups 1 and 2 showed a significant decline in testosterone, insulin-like growth
factor-1 (Pb0.001 vs Pb0.001), and luteinizing hormone (Pb0.05 vs Pb0.001), while the glucose to insulin ratio
was significantly increased (Pb0.001 vs Pb0.05) compared with baseline. Group 2 patients had more regular
cycles and higher rates of ovulation and pregnancy compared with group 1: 76.4% [42/55] vs 58.2% [32/55],
Pb0.04; 50.8% [131/258] vs 33.5% [94/281], Pb0.001; and 38.2% [21/55] vs 20.0% [11/55], Pb0.03, respectively.
The difference in the early abortion rate between the groups was not statistically significant. Conclusion:Although
metformin results in a better attenuation of insulin resistance, laparoscopic ovarian drilling is associated with
higher rates of ovulation and pregnancy.

1. Introduction
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine-metabolic
disorder affecting 6%–10% of women of reproductive age. Insulin
resistance is found in approximately 60%–80% of obese PCOS patients,
with an increased risk of associated glucose intolerance and development of type-2 diabetes [1,2]. Insulin resistance and obesity result in
hyperinsulinemia, which is considered the key factor in the pathogenesis
of anovulation and hyperandrogenism [1].
Weight reduction and clomiphene citrate (CC) are considered the
first-line medical approach to improve fertility in women with PCOS
[3]. When CC fails, second-line treatments should be attempted,
which include laparoscopic ovarian drilling (LOD) and gonadotropins.
LOD is associated with an ovulation rate of 30%–90%, which is comparable to gonadotropins, but has the advantages of lower complications and less need for ongoing monitoring [3,4]. In the last few years,
metformin has been used to improve ovulation, but with conflicting
results. In previous studies [5–7], metformin was seen to be effective
in achieving ovulation and improving the clinical and biochemical
features of PCOS. However, more recently, the Thessaloniki ESHRE/
ASRM-sponsored PCOS Consensus Workshop Group [8] recommended
that treatment with metformin should be restricted to women with
glucose intolerance. This recommendation was based on randomized
trials that concluded that the routine use of metformin as a primary
line of treatment is not associated with improvement of rates of
ovulation and live birth [9,10].
Two studies in the literature compared metformin with LOD in
CC-resistant patients without considering insulin resistance as a prerequisite, and the results were conflicting [11,12]. In the first study
[11], no significant difference was found in the ovulation or pregnancy
rates between patients who received metformin or LOD; however, the
second study reported a higher pregnancy rate in the metformin group
[12].
With this background in mind, we hypothesized that if metformin is
used in PCOS patients with insulin resistance, the ovulation and
pregnancy rates might be comparable to those obtained for patients
who underwent LOD. The aim of the present study was to compare the
hormonal-metabolic profile and reproductive outcomes in CC-resistant
PCOS patients with insulin resistance who received metformin or
underwent LOD.
2. Materials and methods
The study was conducted in the Women's Health Center in cooperation with the Physiology Department of Assiut University, Egypt.
All PCOS patients attending the infertility clinic with previous CC
failure who were between 20 and 35 years of age were counseled

to participate in the study during the period from May 2007 to
September 2008. The study was approved by the Assiut Medical
School Ethical Review board. Written informed consent was obtained
from each participant after an information sheet had been provided.
All women met the criteria for diagnosis of PCOS according to the
Rotterdam Consensus Group (2004) [13].The inclusion criteria included patients with CC resistance. The male partner in each couple
had a normal result on semen analysis and patent tubes in each
woman were shown by hysterosalpingography. All recruited patients
had insulin resistance based on a fasting glucose to insulin ratio (G/I)
using a cut-off of less than 4.5 [14]. This test was done for all recruited
patients before randomization. Exclusion criteria included women
under 20 or over 35 years and patients who had received gonadotropins or hormonal contraception in the 3 months prior to the
study. Patients with hyperprolactinemia (morning plasma prolactin≥
30 ng/mL) or other endocrine, hepatic, or renal disorders were also
excluded; as were patients with an organic pelvic mass, or previous
abdominal surgery suggesting pelvic factor infertility.
Randomization was performed using a computer-generated random numbers table. Allocation concealment was done using serially
numbered opaque envelopes. The patient's allocation was not changed
after opening the envelope. Group 1 underwent diagnostic laparoscopy followed by 850 mg of metformin orally twice daily beginning
the day after the laparoscopic procedure. Group 2 underwent LOD
using 4–8 punctures, according to the size of the ovary, each for
4 seconds with an insulated needle and monopolar diathermy
adjusted at 40–60 watts [12,15]. All laparoscopic procedures were
performed under general anesthesia.
At enrollment to the study, all eligible patients were examined
physically and body mass index (BMI, calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) was recorded. A blood
sample for baseline biochemical assays was taken on the day prior to
laparoscopy in both groups. A standard oral glucose tolerance test
(OGTT) was performed using the hexokinase enzymatic method and
spectrophotometric quantitation (Glucose HK Assay Kit; SigmaAdrich, St Louis, MO, USA) and was assessed according to the international standards [16]. The fasting blood samples were used for
measuring total testosterone (ELISA kit, Biosource Europe, Belgium),
luteinizing hormone (DRG Diagnostics, Marburg, Germany), and
insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) (ELISA method; Immunodiagnostic Systems Limited, Boldon, UK). Serum samples were separated
and stored at –20 °C until assayed. A second blood sample was taken
after the first postoperative menstrual period after excluding patients
who had achieved pregnancy in the first cycle. All surgical interventions and biochemical assays were done in the early proliferative
phase of a spontaneous menstrual cycle or after progestin withdrawal
bleeding.
The patients were treated and followed-up for 6 cycles or 30 weeks,
whichever occurred first. They were asked to report the length of their
menstrual cycles and bleeding days. Throughout the study, the patients
were asked to follow their usual diet and physical activity, and report
any adverse effects, or poor compliance with metformin. Patients returned each month for 1–2 visits to measure BMI and confirm ovulation.
The baseline BMI was compared with the BMI obtained at the last visit
before pregnancy or at the end of the study. Ovulation was confirmed by
either the presence of a mature ovarian follicle (≥17 mm) or day-21
serum progesterone (≥5 ng/mL). The couples were advised to have
sexual intercourse every other day when a mature follicle was seen on
vaginal ultrasound. The patients were asked to contact the clinic for
further evaluation as soon as they had a missed period (N1 week) and/or
had a positive urinary pregnancy test. Once clinical pregnancy was
proved, by appearance of an intrauterine gestational sac, patients in

group 1 were instructed to stop taking metformin. The pregnancy was
followed up until 13 weeks of gestation.
The primary outcome was ovulation rate. The secondary outcomes
were clinical pregnancy and first trimester (b13 weeks) abortion
rates, patients resuming regular cycles, and G/I ratio. A patient was
considered to be menstruating regularly if 50% or more of her cycles
during follow up were of 28± 7 days duration.
The sample size was calculated according to the ovulation rate as a
primary outcome in this study. In multiple previous reports [1–4],
LOD was associated with an average ovulation rate of 65% (range,
30%–90%). On the assumption that a 20% difference in the ovulation
rate with metformin would be clinically relevant, we needed 54 patients
in each arm to demonstrate this difference to statistical significance with
a type I error probability (α) of 0.05, type II error (β) of 0.2, and a power
of 80%. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 13 (SPSS, Chicago, IL,
USA) and are expressed as mean± SE and/or percentages. The t test was
used for mean comparisons of hormonal-metabolic parameters and
OGTT values before and after treatment. The χ2 test was used for
comparisons of ovulation, pregnancy, and abortion rates. P≤0.05 was
considered statistically significant.
3. Results
Of 200 patients assessed for eligibility, 110 met the inclusion
criteria and were randomly allocated to either receive metformin after
diagnostic laparoscopy (group 1, n= 55) or undergo LOD (group 2,
n= 55). Participant flow through the trial is shown in Fig. 1.
The patients’ demographic data at baseline are shown in Table 1.
There were no significant differences between the groups for age,
duration of infertility, previous pregnancies, BMI, or the biochemical
assays for testosterone, luteinizing hormone, and IGF-1.
Throughout the study, metformin was generally well tolerated. In
group 1, 10 (18.2%) women treated with metformin reported dizziness,
nausea, and flatulence during the first month of treatment, but these
symptoms were self-limiting and did not affect treatment continuation.
Laparoscopies were completed successfully without intraoperative or
postoperative complications. In both groups, laparoscopy revealed
patent healthy tubes with no pelvic masses, adhesions, or endometriosis.
The postoperative biochemical assays were performed after a
mean period of 36.6± 4.2 days after starting metformin in group 1
compared with 34.2± 3.6 days after undergoing LOD in group 2. One
patient in group 1 and two patients in group 2 achieved pregnancy
within the first month of treatment and consequently were excluded
from the biochemical assays. Both groups had significant decreases in
levels of testosterone, IGF-1, and luteinizing hormone after treatment
compared with at baseline (Table 2). However, there was a more
obvious increase in the G/I ratio in group 1 (3.3± 0.4 vs 6.8± 0.6;
Pb0.001) compared with group 2 (3.4± 0.6 vs 4.2± 0.8; Pb0.05).
BMI significantly decreased in group 1 only.
Regarding the OGTT, 97.3% of the total number of patients (107/110)
had impaired fasting glucose at baseline (113.0± 3.4 vs 116.0±
5.2 mg/dL in groups 1 and 2, respectively). Fig. 2 shows that after
treatment, there was a significant decrease in blood glucose at 30, 60,
90, and 120 minutes compared with baseline in both groups 1 and 2
(Pb0.001 vs b0.05).
The patients were observed for a total of 281 and 258 cycles in
groups 1 and 2, respectively. As shown in Table 3, the ovulation rate
per cycle was significantly higher in group 2 compared with group 1
(odds ratio 2.05; 95% CI, 1.4–2.9; Pb0.001). Women in group 2 had

significantly increased pregnancy rate per cycle (OR 2.19; 95% CI,
1.03–4.63), cumulative pregnancy rate (OR 2.47; 95% CI, 1.05–5.81),
and number of regular cycles (OR 2.32; 95% CI, 1.02–5.27) compared
with women in group 1. Although, the first trimester abortion rate
was higher in group 2 compared with group 1, the difference was not
statistically significant (P= 0.9).
4. Discussion
Insulin resistance was diagnosed using a G/I ratio of less than or
equal to 4.5, measured before randomization. Obesity, as documented
in the current study by a high BMI, can exacerbate insulin resistance
and increase the risk of type-2 diabetes, as proven by the impairment
of fasting blood glucose in 97% of our patients. Both insulin resistance
and obesity lead to development of hyperinsulinemia through stimulation of ovarian theca cell androgen production by either a direct
action on the ovary through binding to insulin or IGF-1 receptors, or
by stimulating the release of luteinizing hormone. Hyperinsulinemia
could enhance the bioavailability of androgen by decreasing the
biosynthesis of sex hormone-binding globulins (SHBG) [2].
Perhaps the most convincing evidence linking insulin resistance
with reproductive and metabolic abnormalities is the data from the
trials of metformin in women with PCOS. In agreement with other
reports [14,17–21], metformin in the current study showed a significant decrease in the levels of luteinizing hormone, testosterone,
and IGF-1. Metformin possibly exerts these effects in part through
increasing SHBG, modulation of adrenal androgen production, or
decreasing intraovarian androgen production by either generalized
improvement of insulin metabolism or modulation of ovarian steroidogenesis by localized attenuation of insulin sensitivity at the ovary
[20,21].
In the present study, the patients treated by LOD also showed a
significant decrease in the levels of luteinizing hormone, testosterone,
and IGF-1, which is in agreement with previous reports [11,20,22,23].
These changes could be explained by the reduction of ovarian theca
cell mass and consequently androgen production. Converting this
androgenic intrafollicular environment to an estrogenic one corrects
disturbances of the ovarian–pituitary feedback, resulting in a decrease
of luteinizing hormone pulse amplitude and more recruitment of
ovarian follicles [23].
The significant improvement of G/I ratio after treatment in both
groups was in agreement with several studies [14,17–21,24]. However,
this effect was more obvious in the metformin group than the LOD
group. This could be explained by the metabolic actions of metformin. It
inhibits hepatic glucose output and improves the peripheral insulin
sensitivity with an increase in glucose utilization by skeletal muscles
[6,7,18]. On the other hand, the underlying mechanism by which LOD
affects G/I ratio is not fully understood. The attenuation of ovarian
androgen production with ovarian cautery is suggested as a possible
mechanism. The improvement in the G/I ratio seen with LOD in the
present study disagrees with other studies [15,25], which reported little
or no change in insulin sensitivity after LOD; however these studies did
not distinguish women with hyperinsulinemia from those with normal
insulinemia.
In the present study, although metformin resulted in greater improvement of insulin resistance, this metabolic effect was not translated
into higher reproductive outcomes compared with LOD. This could be
explained by ovarian theca cell mass destruction, together with the
greater reduction of luteinizing hormone that is seen with LOD, which
has an important role in restoring normal intraovarian paracrine
signaling and decreasing local androgen production [23]. These could
have a greater effect in achieving ovulation than the general metabolic
effect of metformin in reducing insulin resistance.
The higher rates of ovulation and pregnancy seen with LOD in the
present study are inconsistent with two previous studies that compared metformin with LOD in CC-resistant patients [11,12]. The first
study was prospective and included 161 patients in which CC was
added for both treatment groups if spontaneous ovulation was not
achieved within 3 months, and laparoscopy was not performed in the
metformin group. A significant improvement in the regularity of
menstrual cycles was noted, but no significant difference was found in
ovulation and pregnancy rates (79.7% vs 83.5% and 64.1% vs 59.8%,
respectively) [11]. The second study was carried out with 120 overweight PCOS patients in a double-blind, placebo controlled, randomized trial [12]. Diagnostic laparoscopy was carried out in the
metformin group. Although the ovulation rate was not significantly
different between treatment groups after 6 cycles (54.8 vs 55.1%),
the cumulative pregnancy and live birth rates were higher in the
metformin group (72.2 vs 56.4% and 82.1 vs 64.5%, respectively) [12].
Although the present study showed significantly higher rates of
ovulation and pregnancy with LOD, the possibility of some benefit
from metformin cannot be excluded. The ovulation and cumulative
pregnancy rates with metformin seen in the present study (33.5%
and 20%, respectively) are relatively higher than those obtained in a
multicenter, randomized trial of 626 patients randomized to CC,
metformin, or a combination of both [10]. The study reported ovulation and pregnancy rates of 29% and 12%, respectively, in the
metformin group. This difference could be explained by our targeting
of a selected population with high BMI, insulin resistance, and glucose
intolerance, and hence the metformin had its optimal metabolic and
reproductive effects. Another possible explanation is the substantial
decrease in BMI noted with metformin as an additional factor that
could affect fertility independently.
In the present study, the ovulation and pregnancy rates in patients
managed by LOD (50.8% and 38.2%, respectively) are in agreement
with other studies that have reported rates of 30%–90% and 13%–88%,
respectively, depending on the follow-up period [4,20,25]. This variation regarding the reproductive outcomes is mostly due to the
heterogeneity of the samples studied and the different techniques
used.
The first trimester abortion rate in the present study was comparable in both groups. These results are inconsistent with those of
Palomba et al. [12] who reported significantly lower abortion rates
with metformin compared with LOD (6/39 vs 9/31 respectively).

However, our study was not adequately powered to detect such a
difference, and this needs further research.
In conclusion, although metformin better attenuated insulin resistance, LOD was associated with greater regulation of menstrual
cycles and higher rates of ovulation and pregnancy in obese PCOS
patients with insulin resistance and CC failure.
