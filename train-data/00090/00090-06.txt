Abstract
Purpose To compare conventional laparoscopic ovarian
drilling (LOD) with transvaginal hydrolaparoscopy (THL)
ovarian drilling in terms of ovarian adhesion formation,
evaluated using office THL during follow-up in CC-resistant anovulatory patients affected by PCOS.
Methods Prospective randomized study on 246 CC-resistant women with PCOS. The patients enrolled were divided
into two groups, 123 were scheduled to undergo LOD and
123 to undergo THL ovarian drilling. Six months after the
procedure all patients were offered office transvaginal
hydrolaparoscopy (THL) follow-up, under local anesthesia
to evaluate adhesion formation.
Results Duration of the procedure was significantly shorter
in the THL group in comparison with LOD group
(p\0.0001). No intra- or post-operative complication was
observed in any of the patients in both groups. Post-operative THL follow-up after 6 months showed that 15
(15.5 %) patients in the THL group and 73 (70.2 %) in the
LOD group showed the presence of ovarian adhesion. This
difference was highly significant with a p value \0.0001
and a relative risk of 0.22 [95 % IC 0.133–0.350].
Conclusion This study seems to indicate that THL ovarian
drilling may reduce the risk of ovarian adhesion formation
and could be used as a safe and effective option to reduce
ovarian adhesion formation in patients undergoing ovarian
drilling.

Introduction
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a common endocrine
disorder affecting women in the reproductive age, is a
predominant cause of anovulatory infertility [1], with a
prevalence rate of 17–20 % [2]. Clomiphene citrate (CC)
still remains the first-line treatment for ovulation induction (OI) in PCOS patients [3, 4]. Ovulation induction
with CC is not always successful, with approximately
20 % of women described as ‘‘clomiphene-resistant’’ [5].
Laparoscopic ovarian drilling (LOD) is an alternative
method to induce ovulation in these patients, as an
alternative to gonadotropins [6, 7]. However, there are
concerns regarding the long-term effects on ovarian
function of LOD, in particular iatrogenic adhesions and
decreased ovarian reserve (DOR), which may potentially
jeopardize future fertility [8]. Fernandez et al. [9] suggested a new approach for ovarian drilling using
transvaginal hydrolaparoscopy (THL). They showed THL
to be a safe and feasible alternative procedure to LOD.
Since THL could be considered less invasive than
laparoscopy, infertile women with PCOS may benefit
from ovarian surgery performed using a mini-invasive
approach that may limit post-operative ovarian adhesions
and return to daily activities. Aim of our study was to
compare conventional LOD with THL ovarian drilling in
terms of ovarian adhesion formation, evaluated using
office THL during follow-up.

Materials and methods
This open, randomized study was performed at the
Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of the
University of Naples ‘‘Federico II’’. During the period
from December 2009 and July 2015, 286 patients CCresistant with PCOS were considered for inclusion in the
study. Inclusion criteria were: age 18–40 years; PCOS
diagnosis according to 2003 Rotterdam Criteria [10].
Exclusion criteria: endocrine anomalies other than PCOS
(congenital adrenal hyperplasia, Cushing syndrome, previous administration of androgens, and androgen secreting tumor—AST); any disease potentially responsible of
ovarian adhesion (i.e., ovarian cyst, endometriosis, pelvic
infection, pelvic inflammatory disease), previous abdominal or pelvic surgery, presence of adhesions, fixed
retroverted uterus; lateral displacement of the cervix;
suspect pelvic tumor; vaginal infection; abnormalities at
vaginal examination and transvaginal ultrasound; psychiatric condition impairing the ability of the patients to
cooperate, obliteration of the pouch of Douglas or
inability to perform the vaginal exam and any other
contraindication to THL or laparoscopy.
The study design was approved by the institutional
review board (IRB), and written informed consent was
obtained from each patient.
The flow of patients throughout the study is illustrated in
Fig. 1.
Two hundred and forty-six patients satisfied the inclusion criteria. Forty patients were not included in the study:
12 refused to undergo the randomization process and 28
did not meet the inclusion criteria. Two hundred and fortysix patients were randomized into two groups in a 1:1 ratio
by use of a randomization list generated by a computer
with blocks of 4. One hundred and twenty-three patients
were scheduled to undergo LOD and 123 to undergo THL
ovarian drilling. Before the procedure, all patients underwent a clinical examination, routine preoperative biochemical testing and a transvaginal pelvic ultrasound scan.
The allocation sequence was concealed from the
researchers (GAT and IM), who enrolled and assessed the
participants and attached a sequentially numbered, opaque,
sealed, and stapled envelope containing the allocated
treatment to the clinical record of the patient after having
signed the informed consent. The envelope was opened on
the morning of the procedure. Patients and surgeon were
not blinded to the procedure performed because concealment was not possible due to the differences in the procedures. All procedure were performed by a single surgeon
(PG) who already performed more than 50 procedures
before the beginning of the study. Patients in group A
(n = 123) underwent ovarian drilling by laparoscopy under

general anesthesia, while patients in group B (n = 123)
underwent ovarian drilling with THL under spinal anesthesia. All subjects received antibiotic prophylaxis immediately before the procedure (cefazolin 2 g intravenously).
Laparoscopic ovarian cautery was performed using a traditional 10-mm endoscope inserted through the primary
sub-umbilical trocar, with two additional 5-mm trocars in
the lower abdomen. A grasping forceps was introduced
through one of the lower abdominal 5-mm trocars to grasp
the utero-ovarian ligament and lift the ovary away from the
bowel. The other access was used to introduce the unipolar
needle. The whole length of the needle was inserted with a
90 angle into the ovary using an unipolar needle electrode
with a power setting of 40 W for 4–5 s set at 30 W per
ovary (the lowest recommended dose) [11]. The ovarian
punctures were uniformly distributed throughout the
ovarian surfaces. Three to six punctures per ovary were
performed depending on the size of the ovary, since it was
demonstrated that these numbers yield statistically significantly higher ovulation and pregnancy rates [12].
THL was performed with the patients in gynecologic
position, under spinal anesthesia. Using a Veress needle,
300 mL of normal saline solution was instilled into the
peritoneal cavity through the posterior vaginal fornix. A
specially designed needle dilating trocar system with a total
diameter of 3.9 mm was placed 10–20 mm below the
insertion of the posterior vaginal wall to the cervix. A 2.7-
mm diameter semi-rigid endoscope with a 3.5 mm sheath
was used with an optical angle of 30 to visualize the
pelvic cavity (Karl Storz, GmbH & Co., Tuttlingen, Germany). The posterior aspect of the uterus was examined
first, followed by the ovary and fallopian tube on each side.
A bipolar electrosurgical probe (Versapoint-Gynecare Inc.,
menlo Park, CA) was introduced through the auxiliary
channel of the sheath. By using this probe, the ovarian
cortex was drilled in 3–6 points per ovary, using a power
setting of 110–130 W. The informed consent that the
patients signed before being included in the study stated the
possibility to undergo laparoscopy or THL with the same
probability. Moreover, the informed consent states the
possibility of converting the procedure to laparotomy (or
laparoscopy for the patients allocated to the THL group).
Six months after the procedure, all patients underwent
transvaginal ultrasound scan and evaluation of any complication. Moreover, all patients were offered office
transvaginal hydrolaparoscopy (THL) under local anesthesia to evaluate the presence of adhesions. After office
THL follow-up, the participants were instructed to monitor
their menstrual cycles for the next 6–12 months for a
spontaneous pregnancy.
The primary end-point of the study was the proportion
of women without ovarian adhesions as evaluated by THL
180 days after the primary surgical procedure. Secondary
end-point was the grade of ovarian adhesions and any periand post-operative complication. Grading of adhesions was
as follows: grade 1 filmy avascular; grade 2, dense or
vascular; grade 3, cohesive [13]. Adhesions not involving
the ovaries were not the object of this study. Considering
an adhesion formation rate of 60 % in the laparoscopic
group [14] and hypothesizing a reduction of 20 % of this
rate in the THL group, we calculated that a sample of 194
patients would have been sufficient to reject the null
hypothesis (i.e., adhesion formation equal in the two
groups) with a statistical power of 80 % and an alpha error
of 5 %. Hypothesizing that 25 % of patients would have
refused to undergo the follow-up THL procedure, we
recruited 123 patients per group. Statistical analysis was
performed using the Social Package for Social Sciences
(SPSS, Chicago, II, version 17.0). Data distribution for
continuous variables was assessed with the Shapiro–Wilk’s
test. Student’s t test for paired was used to compare these
variables, which all showed a normal distribution. Differences in proportions between groups for categorical variables (presence of adhesions, grading of adhesions) were
analyzed with the v2 test.
Results
The flow of patients is reported in Fig. 1. All patients
received their allocated intervention. Analysis was carried
out on an intention-to-treat basis. Baseline demographic,
clinical and hormonal data of the patients included in the
study are given in Table 1. No significant differences were
observed between the two groups.
Duration of the procedure was significantly shorter in
the THL group in comparison with LOD group
(p\0.0001) (Table 1). No intra- or post-operative complication was observed in any of the patients in both
groups. Post-operative THL evaluation of ovarian adhesion
formation 6 months after the original procedure was performed on 104 patients in group A and 97 patients in group
B because 45 patients (19 group A and 26 group B) refused
follow-up with THL. The analysis showed that 15 (15.5 %)
patients in the THL group and 73 (70.2 %) in the LOD
group showed the presence of any type of ovarian adhesion. This difference was highly significant with a p value
\0.0001 and a relative risk of 0.22 [95 % IC 0.133–0.350]
Among patients with post-operative ovarian adhesions
observed at follow-up THL, 8 (53.3 %) and 44 (60.3 %)
showed filmy adhesions, 5 (33.3 %) and 22 (30.1 %) dense
adhesions, and 2 (13.3 %) and 7 (9.6 %) cohesive adhesions in the THL and LOD groups, respectively.
Cumulative pregnancy rate was defined as percentage of
pregnant patients, per total patients. The cumulative pregnancy was calculated according to time to the first event. In
Arch Gynecol Obstet (2016) 294:791–796 793
123
our study cumulative pregnancy rate after ovarian drilling
was 68 %; no multiple pregnancy was observed and no
differences in cumulative pregnancy was detected between
groups that underwent different surgical techniques.
Discussion
Our study showed that ovarian drilling using THL reduces
post-operative ovarian adhesion formation. Post-operative
adhesions, fibrous connections developing between tissue
and organs as a sequel to surgical trauma, have become the
commonest complication of surgery and a source of major
concern because of their potentially dramatic consequences. Adhesions may produce disruption of the normal
anatomy, thus altering normal tubal performance. Thus,
follicular growth, pick-up of the oocyte after ovulation and
spermatozoa or embryo transport may be impaired [15].
Several women develop post-operative adhesions after
laparoscopy surgery. The most common site of post-operative adhesion formation is the ovary [15]. Although several surgical measures and systemic pharmacologic
treatments for adhesion prevention have been proposed the
rate of peri-ovarian adhesion formation was not significantly reduced [15, 16]. The high incidence of post-operative adhesions and their clinical significance underline the
importance of modifying the surgical technique in order to
reduce potential adhesion formation [16]. Laparoscopic
ovarian drilling (LOD) is a common surgical approach
currently to treat anovulatory infertility in clomiphene
(CC)-resistant women with polycystic ovarian syndrome
(PCOS). The mechanism of action is still uncertain, but
likely lies in the reduction of ovarian androgen production
through a decrease in stromal mass, or in the disruption of
parenchymal blood flow [17]. Nevertheless, two main
drawbacks prevent LOD from being considered a primary
approach to the treatment of PCOS: the risk inherent to any
surgical procedure, and the risk of adhesion formation
potentially interfering with fertility [18]. Indeed, one of the
main shortcomings of LOD is post-operative adhesion
formation due to bleeding from ovarian surface or premature contact between the ovary and the bowel after cauterization [14]. A number of studies have been designed to
evaluate the rate of adhesion formation. As a result, currently, the incidence of post-operative adhesion formation
range from 19 to 43 % in some studies and up to 82 % in
other studies, but such wide variation possibly reflects an
inadequate study design. Variation in the surgical techniques can obviously affect the rate of adhesion formation
[19]. The recent European Guidelines (2012) indicated the
good surgical strategy to reduce adhesion formation: to
reduce pressure and duration of pneumoperitoneum in
laparoscopic surgery, to reduce the risk of infection, to
perform diligent hemostasis and ensure diligent use of
cautery, to use frequent irrigation and aspiration when
needed and to reduce the time of surgery [20]. THL was
developed as a less invasive alternative to conventional
laparoscopy. THL may be considered as a less traumatic
and more suitable outpatient procedure than diagnostic
laparoscopy. This approach was recently proposed as a
first-line procedure in the exploration of adenexal structures in infertile women [21]. In a recent study, we have
evaluated the pain during office THL and we have shown
that office THL is well tolerated by patients [22]. Some
authors reported the feasibility of ovarian drilling with
THL for anovulatory women with PCOS to induce ovulation [9, 23]. Fernandez et al. [9] suggest that THL with
ovarian drilling using bipolar electrosurgery may be considered an alternative to conventional laparoscopy. In
another study, Shibahra [24] investigated the post-operative endocrine alteration and clinical outcome of infertile
women with PCOS that underwent THL ovarian drilling,
showing an improvement of the endocrine pattern. In a
recent study, Franz et al. [25] investigated the learning

curve of diagnostic THL and operative THL ovarian drilling with bipolar electro-surgery in patient with clomiphene citrate-resistance. These authors showed that the
learning curve of THL is comparable or shorter than traditional laparoscopy and encourage to consider fertiloscopy as a first line in diagnostic workup of infertile
women and in clomiphene citrate-resistant PCOS for
ovarian drilling. There are no data in literature on postoperative ovarian adhesion formation after THL ovarian
drilling. The only studies available evaluate adhesion formation after LOD.
This is the first study comparing post-operative ovarian
adhesion formation after LOD and THL in patients with
PCOS using THL follow-up. Our data showed that after
6 months significant differences exist between the two
groups in favor of THL. The exact mechanism through
which THL seems to induce adhesion in a lower proportion
of patients is difficult to explain. It may be hypothesized
that the use of saline solution instilled into the peritoneal
cavity during THL, the shorter duration of the procedure
and avoiding the creation of pneumoperitoneum may
contribute to this reduction. While laparoscopic surgery has
been considered to be less adhesiogenic in comparison with
laparotomy, in particular for the development of de novo
adhesions [26], a meta-analysis revealed comparable
results for open vs laparoscopic surgery [26]. Factors
influencing post-operative adhesion are the pelvis environment, and the pressure and duration of the pneumoperitoneum [20]. This study had some limitations. THL
allows to visualize only the lower part of the pelvis and the
posterior wall of the uterus, so the presence of anterior or
cranial adhesions cannot be excluded. The not exact
number of drilling points was practiced in every patient,
but we have defined the number of ovarian puncture case
by case depending on the size of the ovary. Another possible limitation of the study may be the different types of
electro-surgery used in the two techniques: monopolar
diathermy for LOD and bipolar diathermy for THL. On the
other hand, we feel that this can be a significant bias for the
primary outcome of this study, considering that the depth
of the coagulation, as well as the total number of drills
were similar between the two groups. Moreover, considering the studies published in literature [27–30], where
both mono- and bi-polar electricity were used, there seems
not to be differences in terms of adhesion formation
between the two techniques. Strengths of this study rely on
its randomized design, with robust exclusion and inclusion
criteria, and the use of a single operator for all procedures,
eliminating one of the most important factor influencing
surgical outcomes and an objective tool for the evaluation
of adhesion formation (office THL). In conclusion, this
study seems to indicate that THL ovarian drilling may
reduce the risk of ovarian adhesion formation and could be
used as a safe and effective option to reduce ovarian
adhesion formation especially in CC-resistant, anovulatory
patients affected by PCOS. Prospective comparative studies including more patients should be conducted to confirm
our preliminary results, but we are confident that this
procedure may be offered as a first-line therapy in treatment of clomiphene citrate-resistant infertile women with
PCOS.
