Abstract
Objectives Laparoscopic ovarian drilling (LOD) has been
put forward as the treatment of choice in women with clomiphene citrate (CC)-resistant polycystic ovary syndrome
(PCOS), with tubo-ovarian adhesion formation as the major
disadvantage. Our study proposed to compare the eYcacy
of laparoscopic unilateral ovarian drilling with bilateral
ovarian drilling in terms of ovulation and pregnancy rate
with the expected advantage of decreasing postoperative
adhesion rate and change in Wmbiro ovarian relationship
with unilateral drilling.
Methods This prospective randomized study included 44
patients with anovulatory infertility due to PCOS. Twentytwo patients underwent unilateral ovarian drilling in groupI and 22 patients underwent bilateral ovarian drilling in
group-II between June 2005 and June 2007. The number of
drilling site in each ovary was limited to Wve. The clinical
and biochemical response, ovulation and pregnancy rates
over a follow-up period of 1 year were compared. Tuboovarian adhesion rate was compared during cesarean section or during repeat laparoscopy.
Results There was no statistical diVerence between the
two groups in terms of clinical and biochemical response,
ovulation rate and pregnancy rate. Postoperatively, tuboovarian adhesions could be assessed in 36.3% of the
patients and no adhesions were found in a single case in
either group.
Conclusion Unilateral drilling cauterization of ovary is
equally eYcacious as bilateral drilling in inducing ovulation and achieving pregnancy. Unilateral ovarian drilling
may be a suitable option in clomiphene citrate resistant
infertility patient of PCOS which can replace bilateral ovarian drilling with the potential advantage of decreasing the
chances of adhesion formation.

Introduction
Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is the most common
cause of anovulatory infertility and is responsible for 70%
of infertility due to anovulation [1]. For women with
anovulatory infertility, the Wrst line of treatment is usually
clomiphene citrate and it induces ovulation in approximately 80% of the patients although the pregnancy rate is
only about 35–40% [2]. If patients fail to respond in terms
of ovulation to a dosage of 150 mg/day, they are considered
as clomiphene resistant [1, 3]. About 10–30% of the
patients will remain anovulatory after 6 months of treatment [3]. Laparoscopic ovarian drilling (LOD) was Wrst
introduced by Gjoannaess in 1984 [4] and since then LOD
has been widely established as an eVective second line
method of ovulation induction in CC-resistant PCOS
patients with high ovulation (80%) and pregnancy rate (60–
80%) [5–7]. Recently one study [8] suggest that LOD can
be recommended as a Wrst line if laparoscopy is indicated
for other reasons in these women and as an adjunct to CC

treatment should monotherapy fail to provide after a limited
duration of exposure. BeneWts of LOD include the minimal
morbidity associated with a laparoscopic procedure, the
eliminated need for cycle monitoring and the low risk of
multiple pregnancies [7]. Furthermore, some CC-resistant
women respond once again to CC after laparoscopic electrocautery [6, 9]. The surgical approach is not associated
with ovarian hyperstimulation and can lead to consecutive
ovulations without the need for further treatment. However,
tubo-ovarian adhesions and theoretical risk of premature
ovarian failure (POF) following LOD are of concern. During LOD greater the amount of damage to the surface of the
ovary, using monopolar needle, greater is the risk of periovarian adhesion formation and POF. Therefore, the role of
treating only one ovary, minimising the number of diathermy points and creation of artiWcial ascitis in reducing
future tubo-ovarian adhesions need further assessment. We
performed this prospective study to compare the eYcacy of
unilateral ovarian drilling compared to bilateral ovarian
drilling in patients of resistant PCOS in terms of ovulation
and pregnancy rate and to evaluate the chance of post operative adhesion formation in these patients.
Materials and methods
In this prospective randomized clinical study, 44 patients of
PCOS who presented to the Department of Obstetics and
Gynaecology, AIIMS, New Delhi between June 2005 and
June 2007 and found to be resistant to clomiphene citrate
were recruited. All patients were randomly allocated to
either unilateral or bilateral laparoscopic ovarian drilling.
They gave informed consent to the study, which had been
approved by the hospital ethical committee. PCOS was
diagnosed on basis of the revised Rotterdam 2003 criteria
[10]. Presence of 2 out of 3 criteria (Oligo and/or anovulation, clinical and/or biochemical signs of hyper androgenism and polycystic ovaries) was recommended as
diagnostic of PCOS. All women had normal hysterosalpingography and their partners had normal semen parameters.
In addition, women were diagnosed as clomiphene citrate
resistant if they had persistent anovulation despite 150 mg
clomiphene citrate daily for 5 days during one cycle. The
primary exclusion criteria were other causes of infertility
like hypothalamic amenorrhoea, Cushing’s syndrome, premature ovarian failure, congenital adrenal hyperplasia,
androgenic ovarian tumors, endometrial tuberculosis,
abnormal TSH and prolactin levels. Patients who had
already received other regimens of ovulation induction (e.g.
hMG, Letrozole) were also excluded. Additional exclusion
criteria, evaluated during laparoscopy, were tubal obstruction, extensive adhesions of the ovaries or fallopian tubes
and endometriosis. An initial clinical, ultrasonographic
(USG) and endocrine evaluation were done before treatment with laparoscopic electrocautery. Clinical variables
studied were age, duration of infertility, cycle history
(amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea), and body mass index
(BMI). Oligomenorrhoea was deWned as cycle intervals of
>35 days but <6 months and amenorrhoea was deWned as
cycle intervals of >6 months.
In all cases, a three-puncture laparoscopy was performed
under general anesthesia. During laparoscopy, bilateral
ovaries were inspected for the signs of PCOS: hard thick
pearly white ovaries which when brought in front of the
uterine fundus covered more than half of it. Bilateral chromotubation was done to check the tubal patency. The ovarian ligament was held by babcock forceps and ovarian
drilling was done using unipolar diathermy needle from
Karl Storz, ND, Germany. The drilling needle was used to
penetrate the ovarian capsule at right angle to a standard
depth of 8 mm at points with 60 W cutting current and
coagulated with 40 W current if bleeding occurred. In
group-I, unilateral ovarian drilling was done on 22 patients
and in group-II, bilateral ovarian drilling was done on 22
patients by randomization. The number of drill performed
in each ovary was Wve. Each ovary was cooled by irrigating
with normal saline solution and 300–500 ml normal saline
was left in the pelvis to prevent adhesions. The follow up
was started from the next cycle after ovarian drilling.
Women were asked to keep their menstrual calendar and
regular cycles was considered when the patient resumed her
menstruation spontaneously within 6 weeks period after
LOD. Ovulation was assessed by serial USG at mid cycle,
until visualization of preovulatory follicle of at least
18 mm. Ovulation was conWrmed by seeing follicle collapse in subsequent USG and elevated serum progesterone
level (¸25 nmol/l). Subsequent cycles were monitored for
ovulation by measurement of progesterone on cycle day 21.
Serum LH, FSH and testosterone were measured on day-2
of the menstrual cycle or at 6 weeks following surgery if
spontaneous menstruation did not occur. If there was no
ovulation as evidenced by low progesterone levels or lack
of menstruation within 3 months, the patients were started
on CC 50 mg daily for 5 days increasing upto maximum of
150 mg daily for 5 days for maximum of 6 cycles. Second
look laparoscopy was done after 6 months if patient failed
to conceive, to evaluate the incidence and extent of tuboovarian adhesions in both unilateral and bilateral ovarian
drilling groups. Patients who conceived and required caesarean section, tubo-ovarian adhesions were assessed during the surgery. All patients were followed up for 1 year.
The clinical and biochemical response, ovulation rate and
pregnancy rate in the two groups were recorded and compared. Student t test and Fisher’s exact test were used to
determine statistical signiWcance and p value of less than
0.05 was taken as statistically signiWcant. Following LOD,

the change in FSH, LH and testosterone, were adjusted for
age duration of infertility and BMI in both the groups using
regression coeYcient and p value was calculated to Wnd out
statistical signiWcance.
Results
A total of 44 patients with anovulatory infertility associated
with PCOS who underwent LOD were included in this
study. Twenty-two patients in group-I underwent unilateral
ovarian drilling and 22 patients in group-II underwent bilateral ovarian drilling. The characteristics of women in both
the groups are shown in Table 1. They were found comparable in terms of epidemiological, clinical and endocrinological characteristics. The clinical response, biochemical
response, ovulation rate, conception rate and pregnancy
survival analysis are given in Table 2.
Overall in 77.2% of the patients, regular menstruation
resumed following drilling. In group-I, 72.7% of the
patients resumed regular menstrual cycle and in group-II,
81.8% had regular cycles. The diVerence in clinical outcome in terms of regular cycle in the two groups was not
statistically signiWcant (p = 0.76). The overall ovulation
rate in both the groups were similar (63.6% in group-I vs.
63.7% in group-II). Spontaneous ovulation occurred in
36.3% in group-I compared to 45.5% in group-II patients
which was statistically signiWcant (p = 0.031). In 27.2% in
group-I compared to 18.2% in group-II patient ovulated
after induction with CC following LOD which was also statistically signiWcant (p = 0.042). Following drilling there
was a decrease in the serum concentrations of LH in both
the groups, mean decease in serum LH concentrations was
more in unilateral ovarian drilling group than bilateral ovarian drilling group but the diVerence was not statistically
signiWcant. The FSH levels also showed a falling trend after
LOD in both the groups and the diVerence was not statistically signiWcant. There was a fall in serum concentration of
testosterone following ovarian drilling in both the groups
but the diVerence was not statistically signiWcant.
Pregnancy rate in each group was 45.4%. In group-I,
seven pregnancies occurred spontaneously and three following treatment with CC. In group-II, four pregnancies
occurred spontaneously and six were induced with CC.
There was one twin conception following treatment with
clomiphene citrate in group-II. No antenatal or postnatal
complications were observed in any of the pregnancies. The
miscarriage rate in this study was 20%; there were two
missed abortions in each group. Twelve patients had

cesarean section done for obstetric indications. The take
home baby rate was 36.3% in group-I compared to 40.9%
in group-II and the diVerence was not statistically signiWcant.
Repeat laparoscopy to look for periovarian adhesions
was performed in 12 patients (7 in group-I and 5 in groupII) who had failed to conceive within 6 months of ovarian
drilling. Four patients (2 patients in each group) were
assessed for peri-ovarian adhesions during ceasarean section. Overall, 40.9% of patients in group-I and 31.8% of
patients in group-II could be assessed for tubo-ovarian
adhesions. None of the patients assessed so far showed any
peri-ovarain adhesions. The remaining 12 patients refused
second look laparoscopy as they did not want a repeat general anesthesia.
Discussion
Though bilateral wedge resection of ovaries was the
accepted treatment for polycystic ovaries for over 40 years
[11], this procedure has now been replaced by laparoscopic
diathermy. The Wrst reported series of ovarian diathermy
showed a very encouraging result of 90% ovulation rate
and 70% conception rate [4] but the miscarriage rate was
15% [12]. A number of subsequent studies have shown
similar encouraging results and now ovarian drilling is a
well accepted intervention for ovulation induction in clomiphene citrate resistant PCOS [13]. However there is a ongoing concern about the adverse eVects of LOD particularly
on periovarian adhesion formation and ovarian function
[14–16]. The periovarian adhesion formation was found to
be in the range of 19–43% [14] in various studies.
The greater the amount of damage to the surface of the
ovary the greater the risk of peri ovarian adhesion formation and is related to the number of drilling cauterizations
[4, 17, 18, 19]. POF is another concern with ovarian drilling, especially when a large number of punctures are made
(>4–6) [20]. In another study, cases of POF were detected
probably in those who had >6–8 punctures done [15].
Recent Cochrane review 2008 [16] suggests that post operative adhesion formation and theoretical long term risk of
POF after LOD should be kept in mind. It also suggested
that, with regard to adhesion formation, there is insuYcient
evidence to favour any one surgical technique over the
other and therefore until more data become available the
clinical decision as to which treatment to recommend could
be made on other considerations such as local facilities,
adverse eVects, cost and patient preference. Limiting the
cauterization at 4 points by Amar’s technique [21] in various studies showed lower rate of adhesions with comparable pregnancy rates [5, 17]. The risk of periovarian
adhesions formation can be reduced by use of an insulated
needle cautery [22] and by cooling the ovaries followed by
bilateral peritoneal lavage and instilling 200 ml of Hartman’s solution in the POD [13]. With the minimizing the
number of drill [21] the theoretical risk of POF appear to be
little clinical signiWcance [8].
The novel idea of reducing the chance of ovarian reserve
and periovarian adhesions by doing unilateral drilling was
Wrst introduced by Ballen et al. [23]. This study demonstrated that unilateral diathermy leads to bilateral ovarian
activity and achieves its eVect correcting abnormal ovarian
pituitary feedback. The hypothesis given is that the
response of the ovary to injury leads to a local cascade of
growth factors and such as insulin like growth factor I
which interact with FSH [24]. This results in stimulation of
follicular growth and the production of the hormone gonadotropin surge attenuating/inhibitory factor, which leads to
fall in serum LH concentration [25]. All these eVects can be
achieved by minimal ovarian damage with unilateral drilling. Other studies showed no evidence of a diVerence in
ovulation rate and clinical pregnancy rate between unilateral and bilateral drilling of the ovaries [26, 27]. Another
recent study concluded that unilateral laparoscopic ovarian
diathermy is as eVective as bilateral ovarian diathermy in
normalization on of ovarian function in CC resistance
anovulatory women with PCOS [28].
In our study we compared unilateral versus bilateral laparoscopic ovarian drilling in 44 patients (22 patients in each
group). We found there was decrease in serum concentration of LH in both the groups, mean decrease in serum LH
concentration was more in the unilateral ovarian drilling
group than the bilateral ovarian drilling group but the diVerence was not statistically signiWcant. We also found, there
is decrease in FSH level in both the groups after LOD and
the mean decrease is more in the unilateral group compared
to the bilateral group but the diVerence was not statistically
signiWcant. In this study no statistically signiWcant diVerences in overall clinical response, ovulation and pregnancy
rate were found between the two groups. To reduce the
damage to the ovarian surface we also used insulated
monopolar needle cautery and limited drilling cauterisation
site at Wve points with comparable results in both the
groups. Overall 63.6% patients where adhesion formation
following ovarian cauterization in our study were assessed
during repeat laparoscopy or during cesarean section, did
not show adhesions in a single case. This was due to limiting the number of drilling cauterisation sites to Wve followed by cooling the ovary with thorough irrigation with
normal saline and leaving 300–500 ml of normal saline in
the pelvis. It has been reported [29] that ovarian volume did
not seem to inXuence the outcome of LOD. Various other
studies also reported, the size of the ovary and the androgen
level were not associated with response to ovarian drilling
Arch Gynecol Obstet (2009) 280:573–578 577
123
[30–32]. In our study we did not take ovarian volume as a
predictor for outcome of LOD in both the groups.
It has been reported that there is no diVerence in the live
birth rate and miscarriage rate in women with clomiphene
resistant PCOS undergoing LOD comparable to gonadotropin treatment [7, 16]. But the reduction in multiple pregnancy rates in women undergoing LOD makes this option
an alternative [7], particularly when the patient can not
aVord multiple cycles of gonadotropin therapy. In conclusion, laparoscopic ovarian drilling is an alternative modality of treatment in clomiphene resistant PCOS, though there
is ongoing concern about post operative adhesion formation
and long term eVects of LOD on ovarian function. This can
be prevented by reducing the number of drilling sites to
Wve, cooling the ovarian surface by thorough irrigation with
normal saline and leaving normal saline in the pelvis. Unilateral drilling cauterisation of the ovary is equally eYcacious as bilateral drilling in inducing ovulation and
achieving pregnancy.
