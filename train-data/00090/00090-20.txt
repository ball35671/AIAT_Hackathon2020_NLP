Objective: To compare reproductive outcome of adjusted thermal dose on the basis of ovarian volume versus fixedpuncture dosage in laparoscopic ovarian drilling.
Design: Randomized controlled trial.
Setting: University Women’s Health Center.
Patient(s): One hundred twenty patients with polycystic ovary syndrome and clomiphene citrate resistance.
Intervention(s): Patients were assigned randomly to two groups of 60 women each. Group A received an adjusted
thermal dose based on ovarian volume with use of a new model for dose calculation (60 J/cm3 of ovarian tissue), and
group B received 600 J per ovary through four ovarian holes regardless of size. One month afterward, the hormonal
profile was reevaluated, and second-look laparoscopy was performed in patients who had not conceived by 6
months to evaluate adnexal adhesions.
Main Outcome Measure(s): Ovulation, conception, and early abortion rates, cycle rhythm, and adnexal adhesions.
Result(s): More patients resumed regular cycles in group A than in group B (87.9% vs. 75.4%). The ovulation and
pregnancy rates were significantly higher in group A than in group B (81.8% vs. 62.2% and 51.7% vs. 36.8%,
respectively). There was no significant difference between groups in early miscarriage rate or postdrilling
adhesions.
Conclusion(s): Adjusted diathermy dose based on ovarian volume for laparoscopic ovarian drilling of polycystic
ovary syndrome has a better reproductive outcome compared with fixed thermal dosage. (Fertil Steril 2011;95:

Key Words: PCOS, LOD, thermal dose, ovarian volume, reproductive outcome, adhesions
Laparoscopic ovarian drilling (LOD) is accepted widely as secondline treatment of patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)
after failure of clomiphene citrate (CC) therapy (1–3). Currently
the optimum amount of electrosurgical energy needed during
LOD to achieve maximum reproductive outcome without risks is
uncertain (4).
Many authors investigated an empirical numbers of ovarian
punctures or tailored thermal dose subjectively to ovarian size during
laparoscopy (3, 5–14). In earlier studies(3, 5)there was an assumption
that the greater the amount of energy, the more effective the procedure.
Later on, lower thermal doses through use of a fixed number of
puncture points regardless of ovary size (8–10, 12) or unilateral
ovary cauterization (15) had been reported, aiming to decrease the
potential risks of ovarian atrophy and adnexal adhesions. Armar
et al.(8) first described ovarian drilling with only four holes, delivering
640 J per ovary. This method later became widely accepted and
adopted by many investigators (4). In a recent study, however, the
correlation between number of ovarian punctures and adnexal
adhesions was not proved (16). On the other hand, such fixed thermal
dosage may not achieve the optimum ovulation rates or even may
retain disease manifestations in patients with large ovaries (4, 10).
We hypothesize that adjustment of thermal dose objectively on
the basis of preoperative ovarian volume will ameliorate androgen
production adequately and enhance follicular growth resulting in
better reproductive outcomes without the extra risk of adnexal
adhesions. The aim of this study was to compare the ovulation,
pregnancy, and adnexal adhesion rates in an adjusted thermal dose
based on ovarian volume with a fixed thermal dosage of 600 J per
ovary in LOD of PCOS with CC resistance.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
This prospective randomized trial was conducted between January
2007 and December 2009 in the Women’s Health Center and
Physiology Department, Assiut University. The protocol was
approved by the Ethical Review Board of the Faculty of Medicine.
Polycystic ovary syndrome was diagnosed according to Rotterdam
criteria (17). The inclusion criteria included patients aged 18 to 38
years, CC resistance (18), anovulatory infertility R2 years duration,
patent tubes by hysterosalpingography or diagnostic laparoscopy,
and normal semen analysis results from the husband (19). The exclusion criteria included patients with endocrine abnormalities or pelvic
pathology.
The sample size was calculated on the basis of the expected ovulation rate as a primary outcome. Amer et al. (10) used a thermal dose of
600 J per ovary to achieve an ovulation rate of 67%. On the assumption
that a 20% ovulation difference with an adjustedthermal dose based on
ovarian volume will be clinically relevant, we needed a total of 114
patients to demonstrate this difference with a statistical significance
of a ¼ 0.05 and b ¼ 0.2.

After clinical examination, basal transvaginal sonography was
done to measure ovarian volume with use of the prolate ellipsoid
formula (20). Hormonal assays were performed for LH, FSH, T,
and androstenedione. Recruited patients were assigned randomly
to either group A, which underwent LOD with a thermal dose based
on ovarian volume, or group B, which received 600 J per ovary
regardless of size.
During LOD, the pelvis was examined initially, and a dye test was
performed. The monopolar diathermy (Erbotom; Erbe, Hamburg,
Germany) was set at 30 W. Through the cutting mode, the ovarian
capsule was penetrated by an insulated needle to a depth of 8 mm,
and then the coagulation mode was activated. The total thermal
dose in group B was delivered through four holes in each ovary;
the needle was activated for 5 seconds (4 punctures  5 seconds
30W ¼ 600 J) (10). In group A the dose was calculated with use of
the following suggested model. In four previous studies similar needle penetration depth was used; the least effective doses were 640 J
(8), 450 J (9), 600 J (10), and 800 J per ovary (12) giving a median
of 625 J per ovary. The reported ovarian volume mean was 10.8
cm3 (range of mean: 9.6–12.0 cm3
) (9). Because we were planning
to use the least effective dose, our suggested dose was 625 J/10.8
cm3 ¼ 60 J/cm3 of ovarian tissue. The required number of punctures
then was calculated by dividing total individual ovarian dose with
dose delivered in each puncture point. After the procedure, 200 mL
of heparinized Ringer’s lactate was left.
Hormonal assays were repeated during the first postoperative
period. Cycle rhythm, ovulation, and pregnancy were monitored
for the next 6 months. Ovulation was defined by one leading follicle
of 18 mm or midluteal serum P and pregnancy by intrauterine
gestational sac. Patients who did not achieve pregnancy by 6 months
were evaluated by second-look laparoscopy. Any adhesions were
classified as grade 1 if filmy or avascular, grade 2 if vascular or
dense, and grade 3 if cohesive (21).
Statistical analysis was performed with use of SPSS version 15
(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Continuous data were described as
mean  SD. Categorical data were summarized as ratios. Student’s
t test was used to compare means, and the c2 test or Fisher’s exact
probability test was performed for categorical variables. Life table
analysis was performed for measurement of ovulation rates in
both groups.
RESULTS
The participant flow is shown in Figure 1. The patients dropped from
follow-up after two cycles were ovulating but had not achieved
pregnancy.
There was no significant difference between groups in demographic and baseline data including age (25.7  5.9 years vs. 25.4
 5.7 years, P¼.7), duration and type of infertility, body mass index
(28.9  3.9 vs. 29.6  3.4, P¼.2), ovarian volume (13.1  3.1 cm3
vs. 12.9  3.4 cm3
, P¼.6), or hormonal assays. All operative procedures were completed successfully without complications. Pelvic
evaluation during LOD revealed patent tubes with no masses or
endometriosis in both groups.
In group A (n ¼ 60) four to nine holes delivering a thermal dose of
480 to 1,080 J per ovary were made on the basis of ovarian volume.
Out of those, 17 patients received five punctures and 18 had six
punctures per ovary.
Table 1 shows that, after drilling, LH, T, and androstenedione
levels were decreased significantly compared with baseline, a decline
that was more evident in group A. Life-table analysis in Table 2
shows that spontaneous ovulation and pregnancy rates and regular
cycles were higher in group A. There was no significant difference
between groups in early abortion rate and postoperative adnexal
adhesions. Recorded adhesions and adhesion density in patients
who received four and nine punctures in group A were comparable.
Successful adhesiolysis was performed in all patients.
DISCUSSION
Androgen excess in PCOS is believed to be the result of insulin’s ability to increase androgen production by ovarian theca cells (22, 23).
The significant decline in postdrilling serum androgens and LH
that is seen more obviously in patients who received an adjusted
thermal dose could be explained by adequate thermal destruction
of androgen-secreting stroma cells. This postulation had been
reported previously to be the main mechanism of LOD (10). This
decline in serum androgen and the amount available for peripheral
aromatization to estrogens might restore normal feedback mechanism to the hypothalamus-pituitary axis (12). The reduction in LH
level leads to decreased ovarian androgen production, which along
with increasing FSH levels allows appropriate follicular development and ovulation (12, 24–26). It may be assumed therefore that
the ameliorating effect of LOD on androgen and LH levels is
influenced by the amount of energy applied to the ovary, and low
doses may be associated with lower success rates (10).
Earlier studies reported a range of 1 to 40 puncture points for
a depth of 2 to 8 mm, diameter of 2 to 5 mm, and duration of 1 to 7
seconds at each point (3, 5–12, 14). The authors compared
empirical numbers of puncture points (11, 14), used a fixed thermal
dose (8), or tailored it to operative ovarian size (12). Current adjusted
thermal dose showed higher ovulation and conception rates compared
with two previous studies that used a similar needle penetration depth

and study population (9, 12). The first (12) included 112 patients who
had undergone LOD with 10 to 15 holes that yielded energy of 800 to
1,200 J per ovary. The authors reported 73% ovulation and 54%
conception rates after 12 months. The second was a dose-response
study (9) in which three ovarian holes delivering total 450 J per ovary
was reported as a plateau dose that was associated with 58% ovulation
and 50% conception rates. In contrast, we had a lower ovulation rate
compared with an early study that reported 92% ovulation with a thermal dose of 3,750 J per ovary (3). Because ovarian volume was not
reported, this higher rate could not be explained by high thermal
dosage. Different study population and extended follow-up are possible explanations. On the other hand, the ovulation and conception
rates with fixed thermal dosage are comparable with those of others
using similar methods (8–10). We found better cycle regulation in
patients who received an adjusted thermal dose, which is consistent
with reports by others of 65% to 81% depending on thermal doses
and study population (3, 8–12).
The current miscarriage rates are comparable in both groups and
are consistent with other reports of 13% with a thermal dose of 800
to 1,200 J per ovary (12). Higher miscarriage rates up to 30% were
reported previously and can be attributed to high LH levels (27).
The current study showed comparable adhesions in both groups,
which is consistent with other reports of a rate of 19% to 45%
(6, 12). However, the long 6-month follow-up makes the ability to
assess postdrilling adhesions difficult because development of other
pathologic conditions causing adhesions could not be excluded. In
addition, in a recent study, the authors performed six or 12 puncture
points in the right or left ovary alternately (16). There was a 60%
adhesion rate after 5 to 9 weeks after surgery independent of the
number of ovarian punctures (16). These data support the hypothesis

of surface damage rather than ovarian stroma as the main factor for
development of periovarian adhesions (12).
In conclusion, LOD using a thermal dose of 60 J/cm3 has a better
reproductive outcome compared with fixed thermal dosage of 600 J
per ovary in treatment of patients with PCOS with CC resistance.
Large powered studies are needed to demonstrate the effect of
this dosage on potential risks of adnexal adhesions and ovarian
failure.
