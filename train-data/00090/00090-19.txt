!BSTRACT
Ovarian drilling is a well-accepted intervention for ovulation induction in clomiphene citrate-resistant polycystic ovarian
syndrome (PCOS) patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of unilateral and bilateral ovarian drilling by
electrocautery in PCOS women. In this prospective randomized clinical study, 87 patients with ovulation failure as a result
of PCOS were randomly allocated to either unilateral (group A; n = 43 patients) or bilateral (group B; n = 44 patients)
laparoscopic ovarian drilling by electrocautery. The average time required for unilateral ovarian drilling was shorter than for
bilateral drilling. In patients who ovulated after drilling, there was a significant fall in serum LH concentration (group A, P
< 0.05, group B, P < 0.05). Ovulation, pregnancy and miscarriage rates were similar in both groups. It seems that unilateral
ovarian drilling in PCOS is effective, less time-consuming and probably associated with fewer complications.
Keywords: miscarriage rate, ovarian drilling, ovulation rate, PCOS, pregnancy rate
Anovulation is estimated to cause 40% of female infertility. In
most cases, it is related to polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS).
PCOS is a common endocrinopathy affecting approximately 5–
7% of women of reproductive age. The definition of the syndrome
has been much debated (Frank, 1995). At a joint consensus
meeting of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine
(ASRM) and the European Society of Human Reproduction
and Embryology (ESHRE), a refined definition of PCOS was
agreed, namely the presence of two out of the following three
criteria: oligoovulation and/or anovulation, hyperandrogenism
(clinical and/or biochemical), and polycystic ovaries, with the
exclusion of other aetiologies (Rotterdam ESHRE/ASRMSponsored PCOS Consensus Workshop Group, 2004).
When infertility is the main problem affecting a patient suffering
from PCOS, ovulation induction is necessary. Weight loss is
important to improve the prospects of both spontaneous and
drug-induced ovulation. Anovulation can be treated medically
in some cases with anti-oestrogens, but a proportion of patients
fail to respond, and of those who ovulate, the pregnancy rate is
low and the miscarriage rate and the risk of multiple pregnancy
are high (Hassan, 2000).
Given the drawbacks of clomiphene and the reported
effectiveness of insulin-sensitizing agents such as metformin
in the induction of ovulation, its first-line use may potentially
reduce the number of clomiphene cycles to which women with
PCOS are exposed. The therapeutic options for women who are
resistant to anti-estrogens are either parenteral gonadotrophin
therapy or laparoscopic ovarian diathermy (Khorram et al.,
2005). Gonadotrophin therapy may be more successful,
but it is expensive, and there is a significant risk of ovarian
hyperstimulation and multiple pregnancy. Therapy with LHreleasing hormone (LHRH) has been used, but the results have
been disappointing and the miscarriage rate has also been high
(Regan et al., 1990). Laparoscopic ovarian diathermy has taken
the place of wedge resection of the ovaries (which resulted in
extensive periovarian and tubal adhesions), and

risk of multiple pregnancy compared with gonadotrophin
therapy in the treatment of clomiphene-insensitive cases (Amer
et al., 2003)
Laparoscopic surgery is associated with significantly less pain,
earlier discharge from hospital, and more rapid convalescence
than equivalent procedures performed by minilaparotomy.
However, patients undergoing laparoscopic procedures do
experience post-operative pain, especially in the upper and
lower abdomen, back and shoulder regions (McMahon et al.,
1994).
This prospective randomized study was designed to determine
the efficacy of unilateral and bilateral laparoscopic ovarian
cauterization on FSH, LH, and testosterone concentrations,
post-operative analgesia, ovulation, pregnancy, and miscarriage
rates in patients with PCOS, with particular attention to
unilateral ovarian drilling.
-ATERIALSANDMETHODS
After obtaining the approval of the Ethical and Scientific
Committee of Mansoura University, all the patients were
counselled in detail about the procedure, type and duration of
anaesthesia, possible complications, chance of success and the
possible need for follow-up therapy. Written and verbal consent
was obtained from both groups. Eighty-seven patients with
ovulatory failure as a result of PCOS were randomly allocated
by an independent investigator blinded to the treatment group
to either unilateral or bilateral laparoscopic ovarian drilling by
electrocautery using the closed envelope method. The study was
performed in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology and
Fertility Care Unit, Faculty of Medicine, Mansoura University
Hospital, from January 2003 to December 2006.
The criteria for inclusion were the following: infertility
secondary to anovulation, as indicated by amenorrhoea or
oligomenorrhoea, elevated serum LH concentrations and
normal-to-low serum FSH concentrations, clinical evidence
of androgen excess (acne, hirsutism), and slightly elevated
androgen concentrations. The clinical characteristics of the 87
patients are shown in Table 1.
Weight reduction and insulin-sensitizing drugs were tried first
for 3 months (metformin HCL 500 mg twice daily; Cidophage
CID Co., Egypt).
All 87 women had been treated medically with clomiphene
citrate and gonadotrophins for anovulation, but the treatments
had been unsuccessful. Women with amenorrhoea had hormonal
withdrawal treatment to induce menses. They received
clomiphene citrate (Clomid; Global Napi Pharmaceuticals,
Egypt) 50 mg daily for 5 days, from day 3 to day 7; if there
was no response, the dosage was increased up to 150 mg daily
for 5 days. Transvaginal folliculometry was performed; if
there was still no response, human menopausal gonadotrophin
(HMG) (Merional 75 IU; IBSA Institut Biochimique SA,
Switzerland) was used to stimulate ovulation. Human
chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) (Choriomon 5000 IU; IBSA
Institut Biochimique SA) was used between day 14 and day
18, according to the follicular size. Failure of ovulation was
confirmed by a combination of ultrasound scan and low lutealphase progesterone (day 21). Forty-three women (group A)
received unilateral laparoscopic ovarian drilling, and another
44 (group B) had bilateral ovarian drilling.
4ECHNIQUEOFDRILLING
Oral midazolam 0.1 mg (Dormicum Roche; F Hoffmann La
Roche Ltd, Basel, Switzerland) was given the previous evening
and at 1.5 h before the procedure. Intraoperative monitoring
consisted of electrocardiogram, oxygen saturation, end tidal
carbon dioxide (ET CO2
), and non-invasive blood pressure. A
standardized anaesthetic technique was used for all patients.
Anaesthesia was induced with propofol (2–3 mg/kg) (Diprivan
1% w/v; AstraZeneca, UK) and fentanyl 2 μg/kg i.v. (Janssen
Pharmaceutica, Belgium), Tracheal intubation was facilitated
by atracurium 0.5 mg/kg i.v. (Tracrium; GlaxoSmithKline,
Parma, Italy), and the lungs were ventilated with intermittent
positive-pressure ventilation by using a mixture of 1.5–2%
isoflurane (Flurane; Abbott Laboratories S.A., Geneva,
Switzerland) and 66% nitrous oxide in oxygen. Ventilation
was adjusted to keep ET CO2
 between 30 and 40 mmHg.
All patients received ondansetron 8 mg i.v. (Zofran; Glaxo
Welcome, Egypt) and diclofenac 100 mg (Adwiflam; ADWIA
Co. S.A.E. 10th of Ramadan City, Egypt) rectally after the
induction of anaesthesia.
The operation was performed for all patients using standardized
laparoscopic procedures through three puncture technique
with a 10 mm videolaparoscope and two lateral punctures.
A uterine manipulator was inserted for traction and countertraction to aid in the exposure and manipulation of the ovary.
The pelvic organs were inspected and tubal assessment was
confirmed by transcervical injection of methylene blue dye.
The ovary was lifted up and sited away from the bowel and
wedged against the pelvic side-wall using the flattened edges
of the closed Maryland forceps. The utero-ovarian ligament
was not grasped for fixation of the ovary in any case. Overly
aggressive manipulation was avoided, since it can cause
lacerations in the capsule, follicles and the utero−ovarian
ligament, which can result in bleeding. If both ovaries were
equal in size, the right ovary was chosen for cauterization,
since it is easier. However in cases of unequal ovarian
size, the larger one was cauterized. The chosen ovary was
cauterized at four points each for 4 s at 40 W at a depth of 4
mm with mixed current, using a disposable monopolar needle
(5-mm electrosurgical suction/irrigation device with a wire J
hook tip configuration: Reflex ELS; Richard-Allan Medical
Industries, USA).
Cooling of the ovary was achieved by irrigation with Ringer’s
lactate solution, and 250–300 ml of the solution was left in the
peritoneal cavity at the end of the operation to minimize the
risk of adhesion. All the procedures were performed without
complications, and the average surgical time was calculated.
At the end of the operation, anaesthesia was discontinued,
and neuromuscular blockade was reversed with neostigmine
methylsulphate 0.05 mg/kg (neostigmine; Amriha Pharm.
Ind., Alexandria, Egypt) and atropine sulphate 0.02 mg/kg
(MISR Co., Egypt).

RBMOnl
Post-operative pain was assessed both at rest and on movement
(patients being asked to move from the supine to the sitting
position) at 30 min and 2, 4, and 6 h post-operatively. The
patients were asked to rate the severity of pain via a visual
analogue scale (VAS) ranging from no pain (0 cm) to worst
imaginable pain (10 cm). The use of these measures was
explained to all patients before surgery. An independent
investigator blinded to the treatment group obtained the
scores. If the VAS score was greater than 5, the patient was
prescribed 0.5–1 mg/kg i.v. meperidine (demerol HC1; G.
Breon and Co., USA) once every 4 h as required for analgesia.
The drugs were administered on demand (within the limits
defined above) by an experienced recovery nurse with no
knowledge of the perioperative analgesia administered. The
time to the first analgesia administration and total analgesic
requirements in the first 6 h was recorded.
Post-operative nausea was measured using a VAS score at
each of the time intervals outlined, and a record was kept of
any vomiting experienced by the patient.
On the day of the operation, blood samples were taken from
the patients and then also every 2 weeks for 8 weeks. Pelvic
ultrasound scan was performed at each visit to the clinic. The
patients were followed up for 1 year for ovulation, pregnancy
and miscarriage rates.
/UTCOMEMEASURES
The mean pretreatment and post-treatment FSH, LH, and
testosterone concentrations and post-operative nausea, vomiting
and pain were the primary outcomes. Ovulation, pregnancy,
miscarriage rates during the 1 year follow-up period were the
secondary outcomes.
3TATISTICALANALYSIS
Results of the study were reported as arithmetical mean ± SD.
Statistical analysis were performed using Student t-test and
Pearson’s correlation test for comparison between different
study groups. A probability of ≤0.05 was taken as the limit
of statistical significance. Based upon preliminary data (not
shown), a prior power analysis indicated that 40 patients in
each group would be sufficient to detect a 20% reduction in
the duration of the ovarian drilling values, with a type I error of
0.05 and a power of approximately 90%.
2ESULTS
The average time for unilateral ovarian drilling (group A) was
18.3 ± 3.5 min and for bilateral ovarian drilling (group B) was
23.5 ± 2.5 min. The mean pretreatment and post-treatment
FSH, LH, and testosterone concentrations are shown in Tables
2 and 3. Two women were lost to follow-up and excluded from
the analysis.
As regards the primary outcomes, there was no significant
statistical difference between the hormonal concentration in
serum FSH and testosterone when pretreatment and posttreatment concentrations were compared in both responders
(Table 2) and non-responders (Table 3). However, in
the responders, there was a significant fall in serum LH
concentration after ovarian drilling (group A, P < 0.05, group
B, P < 0.05) (Table 2), whereas in the non-responders there was
no significant difference in LH concentration before and after
treatment (Table 3).
As regards the secondary outcomes (ovulation, pregnancy,
miscarriage rates), 68 of the 85 patients (80%) ovulated within
6 months of laparoscopic ovarian drilling without additional
therapy, but the remaining 17 patients failed to ovulate. Patients
who failed to ovulate received clomiphene citrate (50 mg daily)
for 5 days, from day 3 to day 7; if there was no response, the
dosage was increased up to 100 mg daily for 5 days in addition
to insulin sensitizing drug (metformin HCL 500 mg, twice
daily).
Thirty-four of the 43 patients (79.1%) who received unilateral
ovarian drilling ovulated from both ovaries. Thirty-four of the
44 patients (77.3%) who received bilateral ovarian drilling
ovulated from both ovaries. Ovulation was assessed by
ultrasound scan and serum progesterone at mid-luteal phase.
During the 1 year follow-up period, the pregnancy and the
miscarriage rates were 60.5 and 15.4% for group A and 56.8
and 16.0% for group B (Table 4). Perhaps surprisingly, most
of the pregnancies occurred within the first 6 months (35/51,
68.6%). In group A, 18 patients became pregnant within the
first 6 months, while in group B, 17 patients became pregnant
within the same period.
The median VAS, first request for analgesia, and the postoperative meperidine consumption (mg) for the first 6 h were
similar in both groups. (Table 5).

$ISCUSSION
PCOS is associated with chronic anovulation and infertility.
In most cases ovulation can be induced with weight reduction,
insulin-sensitizing drugs and clomiphene citrate (CC), but
approximately 25% of patients fail to ovulate and require
alternative treatment (Franks et al., 1988). Human menopausal
gonadotrophins have been used, but are associated with the risk
of hyperstimulation and multifetal gestation. A variety of surgical
options for the treatment of PCOS have been applied during
laparoscopy such as biopsy, cauterization and laser surgery
(Cohen, 1996).
The reported ovulation rate after laparoscopic ovarian drilling
(LOD) varies between 50 and 90% (Daniel and Miller, 1989,
Abdel Ghadir et al., 1990; Parsanezhad et al., 2005).
Since the introduction of LOD by Gjonnaess (1984) in the early
1980s, the technique has become widely accepted as a second
line treatment for induction of ovulation in women with PCOS
after failure of clomiphene citrate. Not only does LOD produce
high ovulation (>80%) and pregnancy (60%) rates, but it also
corrects the underlying endocrine abnormalities associated with
the disease, such as raised serum concentrations of LH and
androgens. In addition, ovarian drilling may render the ovaries
more sensitive to clomiphene citrate (Amer et al., 2003).
As regards the adverse effects of ovarian cauterization, whether
by electrocautery or laser, periovarian adhesion is the main
problem. An additional concern is the possibility of ovarian
destruction leading to ovarian failure in up to 5.2% after bilateral
ovarian wedge resection (BOWR) and laparoscopic surgery
(Cohen, 1996).
For these reasons, a strategy of minimizing the number of holes
in each ovary has been advocated, with the intention of reducing
the peri-ovarian adhesion and ovarian destruction. Cauterization
of only one ovary has even been suggested (Khandil and Selim,
2005). It has been reported that ovulation took place from both
ovaries in patients who had only one ovary treated with laser
beams (Hassan, 2000).
Balen and Jacobs (1994) compared unilateral with bilateral
ovarian diathermy in 10 patients with anti-oestrogen-resistant
PCOS. They reported a 75% ovulation rate in women who
underwent unilateral ovarian diathermy applying four punctures.
They also found that unilateral ovarian diathermy resulted in
ovulation from the contralateral ovary in the first cycle and then
alternatively from each ovary (Balen and Jacobs, 1994). Although
the numbers in this study are small, it clearly indicates that the
effects of LOD depend on the destruction of a certain amount of
ovarian tissue, whether this is inflicted on one ovary or divided
between the two ovaries. It is therefore possible that the optimal
amount of energy could be delivered to one ovary only without
compromising the success rates (Amer et al., 2003). Pain after
laparoscopy results from stretching of the intra-abdominal cavity,
peritoneal inflammation, and phrenic nerve irritation caused by
residual carbon dioxide in the peritoneal cavity (Jackson et al.,
1996). No significant changes were recorded in post-operative
analgesia between the studied groups. This may be attributed to
the fact that the severity of post-laparoscopic pain may not be
affected by the site of the surgical manipulation.
It has been proposed that the degree of ovarian destruction
should be determined by the size of the ovary. However, in the
present study, there was no relationship between the response to
surgery and size of the ovaries (data not shown).
The correct dose of any therapy is the lowest one that works.
Furthermore, a combined approach may be suitable for some
women where low-dose diathermy is followed by low dose
medical ovarian stimulation. In this study, ovulation took place
from both ovaries in patients who had only one ovary treated.
Ovulation, pregnancy and miscarriage rates were nearly the
same in both groups, which is in accordance with the work of
Hasan et al. (2005) and Al-Mizyen et al. (2007).
In conclusion, in patients with PCOS who failed to ovulate
after medical therapy, unilateral ovarian laparoscopic drilling
was as effective as bilateral drilling, less time-consuming and
is probably associated with a lower rate of complications than
bilateral drilling. Both techniques were followed by a significant
(P < 0.05) fall in serum LH concentration. However, the postoperative pain relief, ovulation, pregnancy and miscarriage
rates were similar in both groups.
