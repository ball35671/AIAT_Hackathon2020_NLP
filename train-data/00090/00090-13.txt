Abstract
Objectives Rosiglitazone, an insulin sensitizing agent is
used currently in women with clomiphene citrate (CC)
resistant polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). Our study
proposed to compare the efficacy of rosiglitazone and CC
with laparoscopic ovarian drilling (LOD) and CC in terms
of biochemical effects, ovulation rate and pregnancy rate in
patients of PCOS resistant to CC.
Methods This prospective randomised trial included 43
patients of PCOS resistant to CC. Twenty-two women were
assigned to the rosiglitazone (4 mg twice daily) and CC
group and other 21 patients underwent unilateral LOD and
then received CC and multivitamins. The treatment continued for six cycles in both the groups. The biochemical
response, ovulation rate and pregnancy rate over a follow
up period of 6 months were compared.
Results Treatment with rosiglitazone and CC or LOD and
CC resulted in increased ovulation (80.8 vs. 81.5%) and
pregnancy (50 vs. 42.8%), respectively. There was no
statistical difference between the two groups in terms of
biochemical response, ovulation rate and pregnancy rate.
Conclusion To avoid the risk of adverse effects of LOD
preference may be given to the use of rosiglitazone and CC
therapy in patients of PCOS resistant to CC.

Introduction
Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrinopathy among women of reproductive age [1, 2]. It is
frequently associated with insulin resistance and compensatory hyperinsulinemia. Clomiphene citrate (CC) is currently the first line therapeutic modality for women with
infertility and PCOS. PCOS patients are frequently resistant to CC and these results in numerous cycles where CC
is unsuccessfully used for ovulation induction. The use of
novel insulin sensitizers such as biguanides and thiazolidenediones promise a new treatment options for PCOS [3].
Addition of metformin in the CC resistant patients is highly
effective in achieving ovulation induction [4]. But metformin is associated with gastrointestinal side effects. The
newer thiazolidenedione rosiglitazone is alternative to
metformin in CC resistant PCOS with lesser side effects
[5]. Laparoscopic ovarian drilling (LOD) is another
effective option in PCOS resistant to CC though there is
concern about postoperative adhesion and theoretical longterm risk of premature ovarian failure (POF) [6, 7].
Various studies reported till date has compared either
metformin with rosiglitazone or metformin with LOD [5,
8]. There are no studies available comparing rosiglitazone
with LOD in CC resistant PCOS. This present study was
conducted to evaluate and compare the efficacy of rosiglitazone and CC with LOD ? CC in women with CC
resistant PCOS.
Materials and methods
The women were recruited from the gynaecological clinic

taken prior to commencing the study. The inclusion criteria
included patients in the age group 20–40 years, having
primary infertility with CC resistant PCOS, had documented patent tubes on hystero-salpingography and no
other infertility factor. PCOS patients who failed to ovulate
with a dose of CC of 150 mg/day for 5 days from day 3 of
the menstrual cycle were considered as CC resistant PCOS.
The patients of PCOS were recruited in the presence of
oligomenorrhoea (i.e. interval between periods was
C35 days) or amenorrhoea (i.e. absence of vaginal bleeding for 6 months), hirsutism, enlarged ovaries with multiple follicles (C10 measuring 2–8 mm in diameter)
arranged peripherally on transvaginal ultrasonography
(USG), and/or elevated serum testosterone. Finally the
diagnosis of PCOS was made on the basis of revised
Rotterdam 2003 criteria [9]. Presence of 2 out of 3 criteria
(Oligo and/or anovulation, clinical biochemical sign of
hyperandogenism and polycystic ovaries) was recommended as a diagnostic of PCOS. All women had normal
hysterosalpingography and their partners had normal
semen parameters. The primary exclusion criteria were
other PCOS like syndromes, including Cushing’s syndrome, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, androgen producing
tumours, hyperprolactinemia and hypothyroidism. All
women were evaluated by a detailed history and clinical
examination. The anthropomentric measurements included
height, weight, body mass index (BMI) and waist-to-hip
ratio (WHR). BMI was measured as the ratio between the
weight and square of the height (kg/m2
). WHR was calculated as the ratio between the smallest circumference of
torso (between the 12th rile and the iliac crest) and circumference of the hip (considered as the maximal extension of the buttocks). The same operator, who was blinded
to the treatment allocation, performed all measurements.
Patients were evaluated on the first day of spontaneous
cycle or withdrawal bleeding after a 5-day course of
10 mg/day medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA). Venous
blood was collected between 8 a.m. to 10 a.m. after an
overnight fast and the following hormones were measured:
follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone
(LH), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxin
(T4), total testosterone (T), free T, dehydroepiandrosterone
sulphate (DHEA-S), 17-OH-Progesterone (17-OH-P), glucose and serum insulin. The glucose (nmol/L)-to-insulin
(pmol/L) ratio (GIR) proposed as an index of peripheral
insulin sensitivity [10] was also calculated. During the
same visit all patients underwent a baseline transvaginal
USG. The patients were randomly allocated into two
treatment groups of 25 women each (group A and group
B). Randomization was carried out using online software
(http://www.randomization) to generate a random number
table. The randomization was completed by opening
sealed envelopes containing numbers from the computer
generated random table. All patients underwent laparoscopy and patients who had other factors found on laparoscopy which can be responsible for infertility, were
excluded from the study. Unilateral LOD was done only in
group B patients by same experienced surgeon and number
of drill was 5. The surface of the ovary was cooled by
irrigating with normal saline solution and 300–500 mL
normal saline was left in the pelvis to prevent adhesion.
After laparoscopy patients in group A were treated with
Rosiglitazone (Rezult, Sun pharmaceutical industries,
Jammu, India) at a dose of 4 mg twice daily and CC
(Siphene, Serum Institute of India, Pune, India) at a dose of
100 mg daily from the third day of the period for 5 days. A
baseline liver function test was performed in these patients
before starting rosiglitazone. In the presence of abnormal
liver function test, the patients were excluded from the
study. The patients in group B received multivitamins (two
tablets daily orally) and CC (100 mg daily) from the third
day of the period for 5 days. Multivitamins were added to
CC in patients of group B as placebo. Duration of treatment
in both the groups was 6 months. In both the groups,
ovulation was assessed by serial USG at mid-cycle until
visualization of pre-ovulatory follicle of at least 18 mm.
Ovulation was confirmed by seeing follicle collapse on
subsequent USG and elevated serum progesterone level
(C25 nmol/L). Each woman was asked to have timed
intercourse after ovulatory dose of HCG (5,000–
10,000 IU). In group A once the patient misses her period
and urine pregnancy test was positive, rosiglitazone was
discontinued and ultrasound was arranged to document
pregnancy. Women in both the groups without evidence of
ovulation and with negative pregnancy tests were asked to
follow the respective schedule of treatment in subsequent
cycles. Clinical and biochemical monitoring of any adverse
drug reactions was done during and at the end of each
treatment cycle. Hormone tests performed at the baseline
was repeated on the first day of menses in women who did
not become pregnant after three cycles and six cycles of
rosiglitazone and CC or LOD and CC.
The variables which were taken as outcome of this study
included ovulation rate, number of follicles and serum
estradiol (E2) on day 12 of the cycle, pregnancy rate,
changes in the fasting levels of plasma glucose and other
endocrine parameters including serum insulin, total T, free
T, FSH, LH, DHEAS, 17-OHP and GIR. Results were
presented as mean ± SD and data were analyzed using
SPSS, Statistical Package, version 11.0 for windows.
Qualitative data were analyzed using ‘Chi’ square test or
Fischer’s exact test as applicable and the quantitative data
were analyzed using the Student’s t test. Comparison of
values of various parameters taken before and after treatment was made by using the student two-tailed, unpaired t
test and a p value \0.05 was considered as significant.

Result
During the study period a total number of 50 women were
recruited for the study and 5 patients lost follow-up. Out of
45 women 2 women refused to participate in the study
before randomization and therefore 43 women entered and
completed the study. Twenty-two patients in group A were
assigned to the rosiglitazone and CC group and the rest 21
patients were assigned to LOD and CC group. All these 43
patients were available for follow up and were included for
analysis. The women studied in both the groups were
young [27.32 ± 4.25, 23–33 years (mean ± SD, range) in
the rosiglitazone and CC group and 28.42 ± 3.65, 23–
34 years in LOD and CC group] and there was no statistical difference in age when compared in both groups. In
both the groups the patients were not obese with BMI and
WHR \30 and \0.8, respectively. Before treatment 30
patients had oligomenorrhoea and 13 patients were amenorrhoeic. No significant differences were found in the other
base line characteristics of both groups (Table 1). The
ovulation rate in rosiglitazone ? CC group and
LOD ? CC group was similar (19 of 22 (86.3%) [72 out of
89 cycles (80.8%)] in rosiglitazone ? CC versus (17 of 21
(80.9%) [72 out of 92 cycles (78.2%)] in LOD ? CC
group). Similarly no statistical differences were found in
the number of follicles C 14 mm in the rosiglitazone
? CC group (2.4 ± 1) (mean ± SD) compared to LOD ?
CC group (2.2 ± 1) (p = 0.68) and E2 on day 12 in the
rosiglitazone ? CC group (968 ± 426 pmol/L) compared
to LOD ? CC group (1,024 ± 325 pmol/L) (p = 0.72).
There was no occurrence of ovarian hyperstimulation
syndrome (OHSS) in both the groups. There was also no
statistical difference in the pregnancy rate when both
groups were compared [11 of 22 (50%) in rosiglitazone ? CC group versus 9 of 22 (42.8%) in LOD ? CC
group] (p = 0.59). The pregnancy rate per cycle was
12.3% for rosiglitazone ? CC group and 9.2% for
LOD ? CC group. The cumulative pregnancy rate was
similar in both the group as depicted in Figs. 1 and 2. There
was one twin pregnancy in rosiglitazone ? CC group and
two twin pregnancies in LOD ? CC group. There was one
missed abortion in each group. There are nine ongoing
pregnancies and the rest of the pregnant women completed
their pregnancies with successful live births. The various
endocrine and metabolic parameters of women with PCOS
before and after treatment with rosiglitazone ? CC or
LOD ? CC are depicted in Table 2.
Both the rosiglitazone ? CC and LOD ? CC groups
show no significant changes in fasting plasma glucose. The
fasting serum insulin decreased significantly by 41.5% in
the rosiglitazone ? CC group (p = 0.04) compared to in
LOD ? CC group where the fasting insulin decreased by
only 12.5%. This was accompanied by significant increase
in the GIR values in rosiglitazone ? CC group compared
to LOD ? CC group (65.1 vs. 14% respectively). Although
both rosiglitazone and CC and LOD ? CC groups exhibited a significant decline in the levels of LH (38.5 vs.
28.5% respectively), no significant differences were

(40.3 vs. 43.1%) and DHFAS (34.8 vs. 32.6%) in the
rosiglitazone ? CC and LOD ? CC groups, respectively.
There were no major side effects observed with the use of
rosiglitazone.
Discussion
Polycystic ovarian syndrome is the most common cause of
anovulatory infertility and is responsible for 70% of
infertility due to anovulation [11]. About 10–30% of these
patients will remain anovulatory after 6 months of treatment with CC [12]. In women with CC resistant PCOS, the
use of novel insulin sensitizers such as biguanides and
thiazolidenediones promise new treatment options [3, 5].
LOD has also been widely established as an effective
second line method of induction in CC resistant PCOS
patients with high ovulation (80%) and pregnancy rate (60–
80%) [7, 13, 14]. Ghazeeri et al. [15] treated 25 patients
with rosiglitazone and CC (13 women) or rosiglitazone and
placebo (12 women) for 2 months. This study reported that
the ovulation rate in women treated with rosiglitazone and
CC was 77% compared with 33% in women with rosiglitazone only. Belli et al. [16] demonstrated that treatment
with rosiglitazone decreased LH levels, improved insulin
resistance (IR) parameters and normalized menstrual
cycles in women with PCOS and IR. Another study [17]
reported that out of 12 obese patients with PCOS with
severe IR who received 6 months rosiglitazone therapy, 11
(91%) women reverted to regular ovulatory cycling during
the treatment period. More recently, Rouzi et al. [5]
showed insulin-sensitizing therapy with rosiglitazone and
CC or metformin and CC resulted in increased rate of
ovulation (64.3 vs. 36.4%) and pregnancy (58.3 vs. 38.5%),
respectively, in CC resistant women with PCOS. They
concluded in this study that short-term use of rosiglitazone
and CC is more efficacious than metformin and CC in
ovulation induction in women with CC resistant PCOS.
Another important study by Lergo et al. [18] did not find a
significant benefit of combination therapy with CC and

metformin over CC alone in patients of PCOS. Regarding
LOD, though various studies [19, 20] have shown
encouraging results in CC resistant PCOS, there is an
ongoing concern about the adverse effects of LOD particularly on periovarian adhesion formation and ovarian
function [21, 22]. Recent Cochrane review 2008 [23]
suggests that post operative adhesion formation and theoretical long-term risk of POF after LOD should be kept in
mind. In this regard our previous study [24] and other
recent studies [25] suggested that unilateral LOD may be a
suitable option in CC resistant PCOS which can replace
bilateral LOD with a potential advantage of decreasing the
chances of adhesion formation. It has been reported that
patients of PCOS resistant to CC respond once again to CC
treatment after LOD [14]. Based on these supportive evidences we did unilateral ovarian drilling in patient of LOD
and added CC after LOD in LOD ? CC group. To the best
of our knowledge there is no randomized trial available in
the literature comparing the clinical and endocrinological
outcome with rosiglitazone versus LOD in patient of CC
resistant PCOS. In the present study, treatment with rosiglitazone and CC or LOD ? CC resulted in increased
ovulation (80.8 vs. 81.5%) and pregnancy (50 vs. 42.8%),
respectively, in CC resistant women with PCOS. The
outcome in terms of ovulation rate and pregnancy rate in
both the groups was not statistically significant. Similarly
no statistical difference was found in both the groups in
terms of number of follicle C14 mm and serum E2 level on
day 12 of the cycle. Ghazeeri et al. [15] demonstrated
significant decrease in the serum levels of LH, total T and
DHEAS in CC resistant women with PCOS treated with
rosiglitazone. The changes in LH levels were different
from that described in previous studies in women with
PCOS treated with rosiglitazone, which showed decrease in
circulating androgen but without any changes in LH values
[26, 27]. In our study the rosiglitazone and CC group
showed significant decrease in the serum levels of LH, total
T and DHEAS. Similar results were also obtained in
LOD ? CC group.
It has been reported that with rosiglitazone therapy,
there was an improvement in IR, as indicated by the
changes in the values of GIR [5]. In our study we found
there is significant decrease in serum fasting insulin and
GIR values in rosiglitazone group (p\0.04) whereas the
decrease in insulin and GIR values was not statistically
significant in LOD ? CC group. The normalization of
insulin levels in response to therapy with different insulin
sensitizing drugs including rosiglitazone, metformin, and
others in women with PCOS suggests that the metabolic
and reproductive abnormalities might be related to the
hyper insulinemia per se and not to any specific mechanism
of IR [5]. Rosiglitazone decreases hepatic fat content and
increases insulin sensitibility in muscles and thereby
making the drug more useful in patients with insulin
resistance [5]. On the other hand in LOD, the hypothesis
given is that the response of the ovary to injury leads to a
local cascade of growth factors and such as insulin like
growth factor I which interact with FSH [28]. This results
in stimulation of follicular growth and the production of
hormone gonadotropin surge attenuating/inhibitory factor,
which leads to fall in serum LH concentration [29].
Adverse effects reported with rosiglitazone therapy include
peripheral oedema, fall in hemoglobin and hematocrit [5].
In our study we did not find any such side effects with
rosiglitazone therapy. Since our sample size was small, we
do acknowledge that there is a possibility of type II (beta)
error in this study. This may be addressed by recruiting
more number of patients or applying non-parametric tests
in future randomized control trials.
Conclusion
It appears that rosiglitazone and CC therapy is equally
efficacious in terms of ovulation and pregnancy rate when
compared with therapy with LOD ? CC in patient of CC
resistant PCOS. Since there is an ongoing concern of
adverse effects with LOD, preference may be given to the
use of rosiglitazone and CC therapy as a promising therapeutic option in these patients.
Conflict of interest statement None.
