Venous leg ulcers represent a signifi cant public health problem that will increase as the population ages. Numerous herbs and their extracts are potentially conducive to wound healing, including the ability to serve as an
antimicrobial, antifungal, astringent, etc. A total of 32 patients with venous leg ulcers were randomized into
two groups: a group with herbal therapy treatment (PT) (17 patients) and a control group (C) (15 patients).
The investigation focused on fi ve controls of parameter changes important for ulcer healing and the control of
microbiological fl ora. Within-treatment analysis of the PT group showed that, following herbal therapy treatment, there was a signifi cant decrease in the scores of surface leg ulcer and venous leg ulcer after week 7 of
treatment (p < 0.05). In group C following topical antibiotic treatment there was no signifi cant decrease in the
surface leg ulcer. Comparing the results of decreased venous leg ulcer surface of the) PT group with the C
group showed a signifi cant difference at p < 0.05 after week 7 of treatment. The number of different types of
isolated bacterial species decreased signifi cantly (p < 0.05) after the use of herbal preparations. The results of
this pilot study demonstrate the healing and antimicrobiological effects of herbal therapy on non-infected
venous leg ulcer. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

INTRODUCTION
Venous ulcer is a severe clinical manifestation of chronic
venous insuffi ciency (CVI). It is responsible for about
70% of chronic ulcers of the lower limbs. Venous ulcer
presents on the lower limb, below the knee, with one or
more signs of chronic venous hypertension, such as
edema, hyperpigmentation, eczema, lipodermosclerosis
and varicose veins (Bergqvist et al., 1999). Thrombophlebitis and trauma with long-term immobilization predisposing to deep venous thrombosis are important risk
factors for CVI and venous ulcer (Evans et al., 1999).
Also, numerous microorganisms are commonly found in
ulcers, sometimes only contaminating the ulcer (Abbade
and Lastoria, 2005). The most recent theories about the
pathogenesis of venous ulcer have associated it with
microcirculatory abnormalities and the generation of an
infl ammatory response. The high prevalence of venous
diseases, specifi cally venous ulcers, has a signifi cant
socioeconomic impact in terms of medical care, days off
work and reduced quality of life (Valencia et al., 2001).
In recent years novel therapeutic approaches for
venous ulcers have offered valuable tools for the management of patients with this disorder. A wide variety
of agents are available for the treatment of venous leg
ulcers, including ointments, dressings, compressive
therapy, skin grafting, drug therapy and venous surgery
(Robson et al., 2006). Also, the applied treatments
are expensive, often without any effects (Briggs and
Flemming, 2007). The selection of agents suited to an
optimal treatment process especially for contaminated
or infected wounds continues to be controversial. The
microbiological profi le of chronic ulcers of the lower
limbs has an application to the general principles of
treatment as well as to institution-specifi c guidelines for
management (Harker, 2001).
Herbal therapy is becoming increasingly popular
among patients and physicians. Also, it is used often by
physicians in conventional dermatology, in the therapy
of different dermatological diseases and disturbed
venous circulation and ulcers (Neldner, 2000). Numerous herbs and their extracts are potentially conducive
to wound healing, including the ability to serve as an
antimicrobial, antifungal, astringent, etc (Matthew and
Leach, 2004).
This study supports the ability of topical herbal treatment for venous leg ulcers and their antimicrobiological
and healing effects in clinical practice because there is
not enough clinical investigation in this area. Plantoderm® ointment contains alcohol extracts of Calendulae
off., Symphytum off., Achilea millefolium and Salvia off.
Plantoderm® ointment is used topically for venous
ulcers and in the form of a lotion and tincture in the
therapy of other dermatological diseases (acne, eczema,

seborrhea). Fitoven® herbal gel contains alcohol
extracts of Aesculus hipp. Melilotus off., Rosmarini
and Lavandulae. Fitoven®gel is used in the therapy of
varicose veins, chronic venous insuffi ciency, thrombophlebitis, hematomas and hemorrhoids. Both herbal
remedies are used with the manufacturer’s recommendations and with various success in ambulatory dermatology practice as over the counter preparations
(Jankovic´ et al., 2003).
AIMS
The aim of the study was to evaluate the healing and
microbiological effects of herbal therapy on venous leg
ulcers.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study was opened, randomized and controlled at the
Clinic of Dermatology and Venerology, Clinical Centre
Niš, Serbia. There were a total of 32 patients with venous
leg ulcers. The patients were randomized into two groups:
a group with phytotherapy treatment (PT) (17 patients)
and a control group (C) (15 patients). To be defi ned as a
venous ulcer, all patients needed to have varicose veins
with chronic venous insuffi ciency and a clinical diagnosis
of venous leg ulcer with an ankle brachial index (ABI)
value of > 0.8. The study included patients older than 18
years, with a history of ulcer duration not longer than 2
months, or episodes of recurrent venous leg ulcers in the
past 6 months, located below the level of the knee.
Patients who were entered into the study had not received
similar topical or oral herbal therapy nor any other supportive physical or light therapy (electric, magneto, low
laser, phototherapy, etc). Exclusion criteria were patients
suffering from venous leg ulcers larger than 10 cm2
, clinical signs of infection (pyrexia, cellulitis, erysipelas, pain
and rapidly enlarging ulcer), past thrombophlebitis and
phlebothrombosis, hyperglycemia, patients with renal
diseases and malignancies.
Antimicrobial activity in vivo. All ulcers showed
clinical signs of contamination or colonization (mild
increased exudation, foul odor, friable granulation
tissue, small fi brin deposits, discoloration) without signs
of systemic infection. The wound bed was fi rst cleaned
with sterile saline solution, and superfi cial slough was
debrided using tweezers and scissors. Premoistening the
swab with sterile saline was considered when the surface
of the wound was dry. The tip of the swab was rolled
on its side in a zigzag pattern for at least one full rotation. The swabs were put in transport medium and sent
to the laboratory, where they were processed immediately. Standard methods for isolation and identifi cation
of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were used (Sibbald
et al., 2003). Patients in both groups were treated twice
daily. In the PT group, Plantoderm® ointment was
applied two times on the venous leg ulcers and Fitoven®
gel on lower leg and surrounding ulcers according to the
manufacturer’s recommendations.
Appropriate care, washing and bandaging of ulcerations in the C group was performed every day. In
group C, utilization of topical antibiotics was based on
the biogram and antibiogram results in the therapeutic
range. On the basis of certain clinical features antiexudative, antiinfl ammatory and disinfectant wet dressing
bandages were applied. Treatment followed the general
guidelines for topical treatment and were adjusted to
the ulcer healing phase. Measurements of the venous
leg ulcer surface were made with acetate tracing. After
tracing each venous leg ulcer on transparency fi lm, the
leg ulcer area was calculated by multiplying the length
and width measurements with a ruler. The area of an
ellipse was adopted because many wounds approximated the shape of an ellipse. The area of an ellipse is
given by (0.5 × length of major axis) (0.5 × length of
minor axis) (π) (Majeske, 1992). Epithelization and
granulation of venous ulcers were evaluated on the 0–3
scale (0, prominent; 1, moderate; 2, slight; 3, absent).
For evaluation of other parameters, such as fi brin
deposits, exudation, edema, the 0–3 scale was also used
(0, absent; 1, slight; 2, moderate; 3, prominent).
The investigation focused on the control of parameter
changes important for ulcer healing: wound surface
area, reduction of venous leg ulcer score (epithelization,
granulation, fi brin deposits, exudation and eczema) and
control of microbiological fl ora. All parameters were
evaluated fi ve times: at baseline and at the end of weeks
1, 3, 5 and 7 of treatment. Descriptive statistics are
reported as mean ± SD. The rate of healing (cm2
 and
percent change per control week) was analysed using
ANOVA. The difference between pre- and post- therapy
was calculated using a paired t-test. The Wilcoxon
signed-rank test was done to compare the reduction of
venous leg ulcer score and the number of isolated species
before and after treatment of the venous leg ulcers. Data
were analysed using analysis of variance for multiple
comparisons (SPSS 14 for Windows), with signifi cance
set at p < 0.05. In this study, the protocol was recommended by manufacturer and guidelines of good clinical
practice were used. The study protocol was approved by
the Ethics Committees of the University Clinical Center
of Niš (Serbia) and written informed consent was
obtained from all patients prior to enrolment.
RESULTS
Detailed characteristics of the demographic information
of patients and ulcerations are provided in Table 1. In the
PT group there were 17 patients, of which there were
seven males (41.17%) and ten females (58.82%). The
average age of the patients was 66.82 years (oldest 81.2
years), and the average duration of venous ulcers was 5.53
weeks (longest 8 weeks and shortest 1.8 weeks). The
mean ABPI index was 0.95. In group C there were 15
patients, seven males (46.66%) and eight females
(53.33%). The average age of the patients was 68.06 years
(oldest 79.4 years), and the duration of venous leg ulcer
was 5.80 weeks (longest 8 weeks and shortest 2.3 weeks).
The mean ABPI index was 0.97. The characteristics of
sex, age, duration and ABPI index were not signifi cantly
different at baseline. The fi nal results of venous leg ulcer
treatment effects in all groups are shown in Table 2. After
1 week of herbal therapy in the PT group, the reduction
in ulcer surface was 15.21%, after 3 weeks the surface
reduction was 26.82%, after 5 weeks the reduction was
32.92% and at the end of the study the reduction was
42.68%. Within-treatment analysis of the PT group

showed that, following herbal therapy treatment, there
was a signifi cant decrease in the surface leg ulcer and the
venous leg ulcer score after 7 weeks of treatment
(p < 0.05, mean 4.06 cm2
). Two venous leg ulcers (11.76%)
completely healed. After 1 week of therapy in group C
the reduction in the ulcer surface was 13.53%, after 3
weeks the surface reduction was 23.0%, after 5 weeks the
reduction was 27.81% and at the end of the study the
reduction was 35.65%. In group C following topical antibiotic treatment there was no signifi cant decrease in the
surface leg ulcer (mean 4.12 cm2
). The decrease in venous
leg ulcer score in group C was signifi cant (p < 0.05). Comparing the results of the decreased venous leg ulcer
surface in group PT with group C showed a signifi cant
difference at p < 0.05 after 7 weeks of treatment.
At baseline assessment, a large number of different
types of bacteria were detected in all venous leg ulcers
in both treatment groups. S. aureus and P. aeruginosa
were isolated from almost all controls. The predominant
fl ora in the PT group were S. aureus and P. aeruginosa.
At baseline in the PT group, mixed bacterial fl ora
(41.17%) were isolated in eight venous leg ulcers
(seven ulcers with S. aureus-P. aeruginosa and E. coliEnterobacter spp -P. aeruginosa). In the PT group at the
end of treatment 13 venous ulcers were found to have S.
aureus (76.47%) and P. aeruginosa (17.64%) and four
venous leg ulcers were found to be sterile (23.5%). In
group C there was a predominance (73.33%) of mixed
bacterial fl ora (P. mirabilis-P. aeruginosa, S. aureus-E.
coli, S. aureus-P. aeruginosa, P. mirabilis-E. coli). At the
end of treatment in the C group, six leg ulcers (40%)
were found to have mixed bacterial fl ora (S. aureus-P.
aeruginosa) and nine venous leg ulcers (60%) were
found to have S. aureus. During the treatment time the
predominant bacteria were S. aureus and P. aeruginosa.
The results of microbiological isolates during treatments
in the PT and C groups are presented in Tables 3 and 4.

The number of different types of isolated bacterial
species decreased signifi cantly (p < 0.05) after the use of
herbal preparations. Therapy in all groups was administered without any side effects.
DISCUSSION
The effi cacy of this herbal therapy was demonstrated in
patients with non-infected venous leg ulcerations of
duration not longer than 2 months. No side effects or
adverse reactions were detected during the 7 weeks of
two-daily applications of the extract-containing herbal
preparations which support the safety and good tolerability of these products. In the control group, a small
increment of the ulcerated area was observed and it was
considered that topical antibiotics, antiseptics and antiinfl ammatory dressing had no effects on epithelization.
A small limited number of studies determined the therapeutic effi cacy of Plantoderm ointment on the epithelization of lower leg venous ulcers (Ðuran et al., 1997).
However, to date, the small number of patients in these
studies, invalidates the assessment of the real impact of
the administered herbal therapy and their effects especially on venous leg ulcer microbiology (Jankovic´ et al.,
2003). On the basis on the investigations so far, it is very
diffi cult to draw conclusions on their effects on venous
ulcers. According to the literature, the favorable action
of herbal preparations on healing parameters and antibacterial effects is explained by the medical properties
of Plantoderm®I and Fitoven®plants and their extracts
from the viewpoint of pharmacognosy, pharmacological
and phytochemical studies (Mimica-Dukic et al., 2000).
Herbal extracts that contain Plantoderm® stimulate the
regeneration and epithelization of tissues, act as antiinfl ammatory, antiphlogistic and antiseptic, and show high
inhibitory effects on the production of hydroxyl radicals
(OH) (Ðuran et al., 1997; Mimica-Dukic et al., 2000).
Constituents identifi ed in Calendula such as saponins,
micronutrients, fl avonoids and polysaccharides, may be
responsible for the antiedematous, antiinfl ammatory,
antiseptic, antioxidant and wound healing effects of the
plant (Ðuran et al., 2005). Cineol, tannin and proazulen
from Achillea millefolium have a wide range of antiseptic and antiinfl ammatory actions on infections and
wounds and help skin regeneration (Kultur, 2007). Symphytum off. is used in wound healing, apart from tannins
and alantoin, it is an antiphlogistic, antioxidant and
induces cell proliferation (Barna et al., 2007). Eteric oil
from Salvia off. has an antibiotic effect, increases the
phagocyte activity of leucocytes that partly affects
wound healing (Matthew and Leach, 2004). Extracts of
Aesculus hippocastanum (Fitoven®) contains terpenes
and the active component aescin. The mechanism of
action appears to be related to inhibiting leukocyte activation, it is also thought that they prevent vascular
leakage by inhibiting elastase and hyaluronase, which
are involved in proteoglycan degradation at the capillary endothelium (Pittler and Ernst, 1998). Mellilotus
off. has been shown to increase venous refl ux and the
relief of symptoms associated with venous insuffi ciency
such as pain, heaviness, pruritus and swelling (Bedi
and Shenefelt, 2002). Rosmarinus offi cinalis extract

 ANTIMICROBIOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF HERBAL THERAPY ON VENOUS LEG ULCER 281

contains active principles shown to be free radical
scavengers and reputed to have antioxidant, antimicrobial and antiinfl ammatory activities (ursolic acid)
(Oluwatuyi et al., 2004). Lavandulae is also a tannincontaining herb and is helpful for the topical treatment
of wounds because of the antimicrobial properties (Lai
and Roy, 2004). From a microbiological perspective,
successful therapy of herbal venous leg ulcer is dependent on the host’s ability to maintain control over the
microorganisms in venous leg ulcer tissue. The results of
the aerobic and anaerobic bacteria found in this study in
both groups are similar to those in the literature (Bowler
et al., 2001). The microbiological fi ndings demonstrated
the presence of more than one type of bacteria in venous
ulcers, i.e. combined bacterial colonization in both
groups. The microbiologic results should be reconsidered from the viewpoint of the use of appropriate
bandage material. Venous ulcers can be bandaged with
adequate non-sterile bandage material in both groups.
The results obtained were compared and signifi cant
variations in microfl ora reduction were found in the PT
group. In the literature, the importance of bacterial colonization is stressed, as well as the role of bacteria in
ulcers with objectively reduced size and surface (Bowler
et al., 2001). The presence of bacteria not causing signs
of infl ammation does not have unfavorable effects on
ulcer healing. Venous ulcer treatment with topical antibiotics has been abandoned since they cannot stimulate
healing and because of possible complications – oversensitivity and bacterial resistance to the applied antibiotic (RCN et al., 1998). Ulcerations from which bacteria
were isolated did not demonstrate clinical symptoms of
infection in both groups. Every venous ulceration is
colonized by bacteria. The published reports indicate
that bacterial colonization of leg ulcers is universal
and that many colonizing microbes are potentially
pathogenic in causing local or systemic infection
(Gjodsbol et al., 2006). The infection is often polymicrobial, where isolates range from two to six per specimen.
Although the exact pathogenic role of all bacterial isolates may be vague, the synergistic action in polymicrobial infections has been studied extensively (Gjodsbol
et al., 2006; Lim et al., 2006). Organisms such as Staphylococci or Streptococci are diffi cult to eradicate without
systemic antibiotics (Gjodsbol et al., 2006). The results
from our study showed that in patients those species
could not be removed adequately with the Plantoderm®
and Fitoven® treatments. The results of the PT group
indicate positive effects of herbal therapy with better
values of venous leg ulcer epithelization and a decrease
in microbiological species when compared with that in
group C. Topical antimicrobial agents are not essential
in wound care management. However, their use has also
been associated with cytotoxicity, delayed healing, the
emergence of bacterial strains resistant to common antimicrobial agents and the appearance of contact dermatitis (RCN et al., 1998; Bowler et al., 2001). During the
treatment, it is necessary to follow the general guidelines
for topical treatment, which could be adjusted to the leg
ulcer healing process.
CONCLUSION
The results of this pilot study demonstrate healing and
the antimicrobiological effects of herbal therapy on
non-infected venous leg ulcer. These are preliminary
observations that raise the need for appropriately
designed clinical studies to demonstrate and to evaluate
the inherent properties of herbal preparations desirable
to achieve venous leg ulcer healing.
