ABSTRACT
Objective: Comparison of Biofilm dressing with Jelonet
and Betadine in the treatment of venous leg ulcers.
Design: Randomized parallel-group controlled trial,
stratified by initial maximum ulcer diameter of 2-4 ern
or >4 em,
Setting: Community.
Patients: Five hundred and twenty-nine patients were
assessed and 200 patients with clinical evidence of
venous leg ulceration and initial ulcer diameter >2 em
were recruited to the trial. Patients with appreciable
arterial disease (ratio of ankle to brachial systolic
pressure <0.75) were excluded.
Interventions: Ulcers were treated with either Biofilm (a
hydrocolloid dressing) or Betadine and Jelonet in the
community for 4 months or until the ulcer healed, if
sooner. All patients wore standardized graduated compression.
Main outcome measures: Time to complete healing of
the ulcer, subjective assessment of pain and total cost of
treatment.
Results: Healing was more rapid in patients using Biofilm
dressing (relative risk 1.16, 95% confidence interval
0.8-1.8), but not significantly so p = 0.48. Patients'
subjective pain scores after 1 month of treatment
indicated there was significantly less pain experienced by
patientstreated with Biofilm (p =0.02). The total cost of
treatment (including dressings and nursing time) was
similar for Biofilm and Betadine for small ulcers «6cm)
but Biofilm cost three times as much for larger ulcers.

Conclusion: Provided that standardized graduated compression was used, the primary dressing did not significantly affect the time to complete healing of the ulcer.

Introduction
The prevalence of active leg ulceration in Scotland is
0.15% and the overall prevalence of the chronic condition is estimated as 1% (1]. The majority of patients
with leg ulcers are treated in the community, 62% of
those identified by the Harrow District Leg Ulcer
Survey never having attended a hospital [2]. Ninetyeight per cent of all district nurse case loads include
patients with leg ulcers [3]. On average there are 7.7 leg
ulcer patients per nurse, 45% ofthese patients requiring
dres~ing changes more than three times a week [3J. A
multitude of different dressings are used, applied in
numerous ways.
Many new dressings are available for the treatment of
leg ulcers [4], but there have been few well-controlled
trials assessing their efficacy. These new dressings tend
to be more expensive than the traditional ones,
manufacturers justifying this by claims of improved
wound healing and consequent reduction in treatment
time. We performed a randomized controlled trial in the
community comparing one of the new hydrocolloid
dressings (Biofilm, Clinimed) with Jelonet (Smith and
Nephew) and Betadine in patients with venous ulceration of the leg. Jelonet and Betadine was chosen for the

Statistical Methods
Results
Recruitment took 21 months, beginning on 23 January
1987. Five hundred and twenty-nine patients were
assessed; 200 were recruited to the trial and 329 were
excluded for the reasons given in Table 1.
Table 2 describes selected baseline characteristics of
the 200 patients. The bacterial contamination found is
consistent with the findings of others [11Jexcept for the
lower numbers of haemolytic streptococcus. This was
due to patients' prior exclusion from the trial because
their clinical presentation was of sufficient concern as to
require immediate treatment.

The time to ulcer healing was used as the dependent
variable in a Cox proportional hazards model; this was
fitted using the program BMDP2L [8]. All possible
subsets model fitting was performed using the procedures of Kuk [9]. An additional criterion was that
each covariate in the best model must be significant at
the 1% level using the likelihood ratio test. Relative
risks, i.e. ratios of hazards, were calculated; a relative
risk of 1 indicates a variable has no effect. either
beneficial or detrimental, on the time to complete ulcer
healing. Model assumptions of proportional hazards
were checked using the methods described by Christensen [10].
The five-point scales used to assess patients' ulcer
pain and dressing comfort were analysed using a twoway analysis of variance. The association between the
treatment received and whether the ulcer had healed
was examined using Fisher's exact test.
A healing rate was obtained for each ulcer by calculating the decrease in ulcer area during the first month on
trial, expressed as the area of ulcer healed per day. The
Mann-Whitney V-test was used to assess whether there
was a difference in the median healing rate on each
treatment in each strata.

p.rior to commencement, approval for the study was
glV~n by the local ethics committee. A detailed explanahon of the trial was given to all potential participants
~nd their verbal consent obtained. All GPs were
Informed of their patients' involvement.
Two hundred patients with venous leg ulceration
assessed by continuous-wave ultrasound and photoplethysmography (PPG) [5] were randomly allocated to
each treatment group, stratified by initial maximum
ulcer diameter 2-4 em and >4 em, using a block length
of 4 within each strata. Patients with diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, infected ulcers requiring treatment that
pr~cl~ded dressings being left in situ, known intolerance
to lodme or neurological disease causing trophic impairment were excluded, as were patients with a resting
brachial/ankle systolic pressure <0.75 [5]. All patients
Were initially assessed in the hospital Outpatient
De~artment vascular/venous clinic by one of two state
~eglstered nurses responsible for coordinating the trial
In the community. Patients returned to the hospital
monthly for treatment and assessment for 4 months, or
until the ulcer healed, if sooner. All other dressings
Were carried out by the district nurses. All patients who
met the inclusion criteria were admitted.
On admission to the trial the size of each ulcer was
recorded by tracing its outline onto acetate and then
~ea~uring the area in square centimetres by planimeter.
racings of each ulcer were made three times and the
average recorded. Ulcer area was measured monthly
thereafter. In patients with bilateral ulceration, data
Were recorded for the right leg only. Blood pressure was
recorded and ulcers were swabbed for bacteriological
ass~ssment on admission and at monthly intervals.
Patients' ulcer pain and dressing comfort were assessed
on a five-point scale at monthly intervals (1, no pain at
all; 5, worst pain imaginable; and 1, very comfortable:
5, uncomfortable).
The procedure for application of new dressings was as
follows. Ulcers were cleansed with sterile isotonic saline.
In the control group, dressings were cut to fit exactly the
Shape of the ulcer and an absorbent pad placed over. In
th.e Biofilm group, excavated ulcers were filled with
Blofilmpowder until level with the ulcer margins, before
applying the Biofilm dressing, ensuring at least a 2 ern
Overlap all round. The form of compression used was
standardized to two layers of shaped Tubigrip or a

function as described in previous work [6.7). Patients in
the Biofilm group were allowed to remove their compression and bath OF shower with the dressing in place.
This was not possible with the control group.

Five patients did not receive their randomly allocated
treatment because of clerical errors. Two patients
received Biofilm instead of Betadine and three patients
received Betadine instead of Biofilm. Statistical analysis
was performed on the basis of treatment received, since
this was not a blind study and it was thought unlikely
that these five patients would bias the results.
One hundred and forty patients (70% ) completed the

significant interaction between treatment and ulcer area
(p =0.37), i.e. the effect oftreatment did not depend on
the initial ulcer area.
Figure 1 shows the estimated survival function for
ulcers in the Biofilm and Betadine groups in each strata,
i.e. the proportion of healed ulcers at each point in the
trial including available information from patients withdrawn.
Healing rate was assessed for the first month of
treatment in 151 patients (Table 6). This information
was not available for patients who had dropped out,
withdrawn or did not attend for their first assessment.
Healing rate tended to be more rapid with Biofilm than
control dressing in ulcers >4 em, although this did not
reach significance at the 5% level, p = 0.09. There was
no significant difference in healing rates for ulcer 2-4 cm
(p = 0.40).
Pain and dressing comfort were assessed for the first
month of treatment in 123 patients (Table 6). This
information was not available for patients who dropped
out or healed. There was a significant effect of treatment, with less pain for Biofilm for both small and large
ulcers (p = 0.(2). There was a significant effect of ulcer
size with more pain for large ulcers (p<O.OOI). There
was no significant effect of treatment on the comfort
scores (p = 0.14) but there was a significant effect of
ulcer size, with the large ulcers tending to be less
comfortable (p = 0.(2). The analysis of pain and
comfort scores was repeated, including those variables
found to be significantly related to time to complete
healing as covariates. The covariates were not significant and the conclusions did not change.
Table 7 gives an estimate of the cost of treating an
ulcer over the 4-month trial period. There is little
difference between the costs of the two dressings when
the ulcer is small, i.e. with a initial maximum diameter
of <6 cm. For the larger ulcers the cost of treatment
with Biotilm is three times more expensive than Jelonetl

Betadine dressing. This cost difference will be partially
offset by the lower frequency of dressing changes
required as the ulcer begins healing and the change to
small Biofilm dressings when the maximum diameter of
the ulcer falls below 6 em.
During March 1989 the 43 patients who were still
receiving treatment at the end of their 4 months in the
trial were followed-up. Of the 40 patients who could be
contacted, the ulcer had healed in 25 (63%). Only eight
patients continued to receive the same treatment after
the end of the trial (88% healed). Twenty patients were
changed to Bactroban because of persistent growth of
Staphylococcus aureus (60% healed) and a further 14
were changed to other treatments (43% healed).
Discussion
Biofilm was not found to be significantly different from
Jelonet and Betadine in the time taken for complete
ulcer healing. The significant reduction in pain experienced by the Biofilm group is a well documented benefit
of hydrocolloid dressings over more traditional ones
[12-15]. The total cost of treatment over the 4-month
duration of the trial was similar for both treatments for
small ulcers, but for large ulcers Biofilm costs about
three times as much as Jelonet and Betadine. There are
a number of convenience advantages for Biofilm dressing. Patients using Biofilm could have a bath or shower
and there were less withdrawals in the large Biofilm
group, suggesting greater patient acceptability. Biofilm
is easier to apply than conventional dressings, thus
reducing the time taken for dressing changes and the
cost of the district nurse's time.
The type of stocking worn (Venosan 2002 or two
layers of shaped Tubigrip) did not significantly affect the
time to complete ulcer healing. Previous work [7) has
shown that both types of stocking produce a similar
degree of graduated compression.
The bacteria present at the start of the study did not
significantly influence the time to complete ulcer healing. Eriksson (11) found that healing seamed to be
independent of the bacteria present in the ulcers.
However, we also observed that the bacteria present in
Biofilm Dressing for Venous Leg Ulcers
the ulcer change from month to month. For example, in
those patients with S. aureus present at either their first
or !a~t visit, in only 59% was it found on both occasions.
This IS In agreement with Ormiston et al. [17]who found
no consistent trend towards eradication of particular
pathogens irrespective of treatment or response of
ulcers.
Many trials assessing treatments for venous ulcers are
of Poor quality. Sample sizes are often small [18,19] and
the length of follow-up unrealistically short [18,20]. We
re~mmend that the sample size should be at least 100
patIents and follow-up 6 months. Many studies use
~ross-over designs [17,19,21], which are only suitable
or Chronic, stable conditions that cannot be cured.
Some studies fail to distinguish between the number of
Ulcers and the number of patients [19] although it is
~nrealistic to consider different ulcers on the same
IndiVidual as independent observations. Others fail to
apply standardized graduated compression [19] or have
no concurrent control group [22].
~he simple analysis of the proportion of ulcers healed
~~nng the 4 months of the trial (Table 4) suggests that
lofilm treatment improved healing for large ulcers.
H?wever, even though treatment allocation was randomized and stratified by initial ulcer diameter, there was
some imbalance between the treatment groups in variables found to be related to prognosis (Table 2). The
proportional hazards model adjusts the treatment companson to make allowance for these imbalances in
Pfogno.stic variables. This form of analysis also includes
a 1 avatlable information from patients who are with-
~awn, drop out or where the ulcer fails to heal during
t e 4 months of the trial. The proportional hazards
~odel did not find any significant difference (p = 0.48)
.etween Biofilm and Jelonet, and there was no sugges-
~Ion that Biofilm was better for large ulcers (test for
Interaction between initial ulcer diameter and treat-
~ent, p = 0.31). Time to complete healing is the most
Important outcome variable in leg ulcer trials.
The variables found to be related to prognosis can be
~se~ to construct a prognostic index [16]. The prognostic Index can be used in future clinical trials to stratify
patients into high, medium and low risk groups, before
randomly assigning treatments. This would ensure that
comparable groups are used to assess any effect of
treatment.
Approximately 1% of the population suffer from
chronic leg ulceration [1]. Prevalence increases with
age, so that 2% of those aged over 85 years have active
ul~ration. About one-quarter of recurrent ulcers are
actIve at any point in time, so approximately 8% of
~ose aged over 85 years experience chronic ulceration.
emographic predictions suggest a 40% increase in the
number of people aged over 85 years by the year 2000
[23] so there is an urgent requirement for well-condueted trials evaluating treatments.
