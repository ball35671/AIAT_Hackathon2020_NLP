Systemic administration of antibiotics in the
management of venous ulcers
A randomized clinical trial
A. Alinovi, M.D.,* P. Bassissi, M,D.,* and M. Pini, M.D.** Parma, ltaly
Forty-seven patients with chronic venous leg ulcers were included in a
randomized clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of Systemically administered
antibiotics in healing this condition. One group was treated by means of
elastic support bandages only, whereas the other one received the same local
treatment plus systemic antibiotics. No statistically relevant difference was
noted between the two groups in healing rates of ulcers or in changes of the
microbiologic flora. The results of our study do not support the routine
administration of systemic antibiotics in the management of chronic venous
leg ulcers. (J AM ACAD DERMATOL 15:186-191, 1986.)
Medical management of chronic venous ulcers
includes bed rest with leg elevation and compressive bandaging. Both treatments reduce venous
hypertension and favorably affect ulcer healing, 1.5
but the latter appears to be preferable because it
allows ambulation and can be accomplished on an
outpatient basis. 3,6,7 Topical antimicrobial agents
are also usually given, since the common bacterial
contamination of ulcers is supposed to interfere
with the healing process .8-14 The procedure implies
a frequent change of dressing, with repeated application and removal of the elastic bandages,
which may be cumbersome.
A prolonged period of occlusive bandaging
would be simpler and cheaper, but some physi,
cians fear that it could be detrimental to ulcer healing by inducing a favorable environment for bacterial proliferation. In this setting, inhibition of
bacterial growth by means of systemic administration of antimicrobial agents could be beneficial.

To verify this assumption, we randomly allocated
patients affected by chronic venous ulcers with
positive bacterial cultures to receive or not receive
systemic antibiotics, beyond the standard treatment with gauze dressing and elastic bandages,
and we evaluated whether there was any difference
in the healing rates of ulcers between the two
groups. By repeating cultures after the course of
antimicrobial treatment, we also assessed its effect
on bacterial colonization.
Since there are few quantitative data on the effect of the different treatment modalities for venous ulcers, a secondary goal of the study was to
generate information that could be useful for future
comparisons.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Patients
Between January 1983 and December 1984, all patients referred to the University of Parma Department
of Dermatology because of venous ulcers of the lower
limbs were considered for entry into the trial. Exclusion
criteria were as follows: (1) ulcers of less than 1 month's
duration, (2) ulcers with clinical signs of infection, (3)
ulcers with negative bacteriologic cultures, (4) ulcers
with a nonvenous main cause, (5) diabetes or severe
liver or kidney disease, and (6) arterial insufficiency.

Antibiotics in management of venous ulcers 187
Randomization was by sealed envelope, and eligible
patients were assigned either to Group A (standard treatment) or to Group B (standard treatment plus systemic
antibiotics).
Methods and procedures
A medical history was obtained from each patient,
and a general physical examination and routine hematologic and blood chemistry tests were done. Limb
examination included observation of the ulcer site and
of the depth, size, and number of ulcers per leg. For
measurement of ulcer size, a sheet of transparent paper
was applied over the lesion, and the profile of the lesion
was traced, cut out, and weighed by means of a precision scale. In case of several ulcers on the same leg,
the largest one was considered for assessment. Arterial
flow was evaluated with a Doppler ultrasound flowmeter, patients being excluded from the trial if their
ankle-arm systolic pressure gradient was < 0.90.
Without prior preparation, the ulcer surface was
swabbed and the specimens were immediately transported to the laboratory for culture and sensitivity of
aerobic organisms. While waiting for the microbiologic
results, the patients were placed on bed rest, and open
wet dressings of Dalibour's solution were applied over
the lesions twice a day. If bacterial cultures were positive, patients entered the trial and were randomly allocated to one of the alternative regimens. Group A
received standard treatment, which included (1) merbromin (Mercurochrome) 2% solution applied to the
ulcer surface, (2) a thin layer of betamethasone dipropionate 0.05% cream applied to the whole leg, except
the ulcer area and perilesional skin up to 2 cm, (3) a
gauze bandage impregnated with zinc oxide and ichthammol (Ichthyol) and wrapped around the leg, and
(4) an elastic support bandage applied from toes to knee
with gradually decreasing pressure.
Beyond the standard treatment, which was always
performed by one of us (P. B.), patients allocated to
Group B received a 10-day course of systemic antibiotics selected on the basis of the sensitivity tests.
As a rule, patients were discharged from the hospital
the day after the application of the support bandages.
At the follow-up visit, performed after 20 days, the
bandages were removed, and ulcer condition, size, and
bacterial contamination were assessed with the same
procedures reported in the first paragraph of this
section,
Statistical analysis
Student's t test for unpaired data and the X 2 test with
Yates' correction were used for statistical analysis.

RESULTS
Of the fifty-six patients referred to our~ department during the study period, eight were excluded
from the trial (one had pyoderma gangrenosum,
one had cirrhosis of the liver, one had diabetes, one had arterial insufficiency, and four had
negative baseline cultures). Twenty-four patients
(twenty-six legs affected) were allocated to Group
A and twenty-four patients (thirty legs affected)
to Group B. One patient belonging to Group B
was not able to tolerate the compressive bandages
and was therefore excluded from the analysis.
The relevant clinical characteristics of the fortyseven analyzed patients in the two treatment
groups were similar (Table I), Table II reports the
baseline and posttreatment bacteriologic results of
each examined ulcer and the list of the administered antibiotics. Overall, pretreatment cultures
showed growth of a single species in forty-three
cases, whereas a mixed flora was found in twelve
ulcers. The most frequently isolated organism
was Staphylococcus aureus (56.4%), followed by
Pseudomonas aeruginosa (18.2%) and ~-hemolyric streptococcus (14.5%). After treatment, cultures became negative in 13 cases (5 in Group A

DISCUSSION
Medical treatment of venous ulcers of the legs
is largely empirical. Compressive bandages and a
variety of topical agents have been used for centuries, but few controlled studies have been carried
out with reliable methods for measuring ulcer healing rates. 1.15:6 Among the different available procedures for biologic morphometry, the greatest
precision is accredited to the specific planimetric
method we used (i.e., tracing the profiles of the
structure to be measured, cutting them out, and
weighing them). 17 By applying this simple and
precise method, we addressed the unsettled issue
of the role of systemic antibiotics in the treatment of chronic venous ulcers, as an adjunct
to prolonged compressive bandaging. After 20
days of occlusive bandaging, the mean percentage
of ulcer healing was found to be 61.6 ___ 25.8%
in the group of patients given systemic antimicrobial agents, versus 57.2 ~ 29.3% in the control group. The difference is not significant
(p = 0.56).
The number of patients with negative posttreatment cultures (five in Group A and eight in Group
B) and the number of patients with the'appearance
of new organism(s) associated with either persistence or disappearance of the previously identified
microorganisms (eight in Group A and nine in
Group B) were also similar.
The sample size of the trial was established to
detect a 25% difference in the mean ulcer healing
rate between the two treatment groups, with the
acceptance of an alpha error of 0.05 and a beta
error of 0.20. Within these limits the study results
indicate that a 10-day course of systemic antibiotics chosen on the basis of the sensitivity tests
does not significantly improve the ulcer healing
rate obtained with compressive bandaging, nor
does it appreciably influence bacterial colonization
of ulcers.
One cannot infer from these findings that bacterial colonization does not influence ulcer healing, since quantitative bacteriologic measurements
were not carried out and since, in both groups,
higher healing rates were obtained in ulcers with

negative posttreatment bacterial cultures than in ulcers with positive posttreatment cultures (mean _

Aand76.6 _+ 13.6%vs42.1 + ll.9% in Group
B; p = 0.04 and 0.00003, respectively).
The disappearance of bacterial flora could have
played an important role in promoting a higher
healing rate, or, alternatively, the disappearance
of bacteria could have been a secondary phenomenon occurring in cases with the greatest hemodynamic and environmental improvements induced by the compressive bandaging. Since healing rates have not been influenced by antirnicrobial
therapy, the latter explanation appears to be more
likely.

Four patients with HTLV-III-related immunedefect showed severe
generalized psoriasis. Three of these patients were affected with
lymphadenopathy syndrome, the fourth with AIDS-Kaposi sarcoma.
All four patients showed a severe disturbance of cellular immunity;
three of them a decrease of helper cells to 50-200 per ~1. There was
complete cutaneous energy in all four patients. This observation may
be of significance for the conception of an immunopathogenesis of
psoriasis.

The use of bone and joint scintigraphy in unselected psoriaties
showed a 90% incidence of psoriatic osteoarthropathy, whereas elinical and roentgenologic investigations showed only 7%. Early forms
of bone and joint psoriatic manifestations could be found only scinfigraphically. Extraarticular manifestations of psoriatle arthropathy
could also be detected in skull, long bones; ribs, and d!stal phalartges.
Scintigraphic findings have led to promising therapeutic results.
Treatment with diphosphonates that have antiproliferative and antiinflammatory effects achieved good results in 50% of twenty treated
patients with psoriatic osteoarthropathy.
