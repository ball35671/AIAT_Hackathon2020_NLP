Abstract
A total of 67 patients with treatment resistant chronic venous ulcers were admitted to hospital for 6 weeks of bed rest and daily dressings. The patients came from a rural area in Poland with poor socio-economic conditions. They were randomized to treatment with either standard dressings or with cadexomer iodine. After 6 weeks all but four patients had shown a clear reduction of ulcer area; the mean reduction was 54% within the former group and 71% with cadexomer iodine. The latter treatment was significantly more effective than the standard hospital dressings in debriding the ulcer, accelerating healing and reducing pain. Elevation of serum concentrations of protein-bound iodine occurred after treatment with cadexomer iodine in patients with large ulcers, but tests of thyroid function showed no changes associated with the use of cadexomer iodine. It is concluded that cadexomer iodine significantly accelerates the healing of chronic, infected, treatment-resistant, venous ulcers in hospitalized patients.
