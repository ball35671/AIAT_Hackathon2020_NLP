Abstract
Background: Some of the views contrasting the beneficial and toxic effects of antimicrobials upon wound healing remain controversial. Objective: To assess the clinical relevance of histological findings following antimicrobial applications on chronic leg ulcers. Method: The
present study was performed in three parallel groups of
17 patients suffering from at least 2 similar chronic leg
ulcers. Clinical planimetric assessments were performed
before and after 3 and 6 weeks of treatment using hydrocolloid dressings. In addition, 1 ulcer in each patient
received applications of povidone-iodine (PVP-I), silver
sulfadiazine or chlorhexidine digluconate. Histological
examinations were made at inclusion and after the 6-
week therapy. Time to healing was also recorded. Results: At entry in the study, fibroblasts, macrophages,
neutrophils and vessels were abundant in the ulcers. In
addition, focal necrotizing vasculitis was related to the
microbiological load. Compared to the control lesions,
both the healing rate and time to healing of the leg ulcers
showed a modest improvement at the sites receiving
silver sulfadiazine (2–7%) or chlorhexidine digluconate
(–1 to 5%). By contrast, PVP-I increased significantly the
healing rate (4–18%, p ! 0.01), and time to healing was
reduced by 2–9 weeks (p ! 0.01). The 3 antimicrobials
decreased the bacterial density, and the vascular margination and migration of inflammatory cells, thus abating
the vasculitic changes. PVP-I applications did not alter
the microvessels and did not significantly reduce the
density in dendrocytes and fibroblasts. By contrast, both
silver sulfadiazine and chorhexidine digluconate appeared to alter the superficial microsvasculature including the dendrocyte population. Conclusion: Although
topical antimicrobials may apparently achieve almost
similar activity on the bacterial load inside chronic leg
ulcers, the toxicity upon host cells was different among
these agents. PVP-I appeared to be an efficient compound in these respects exhibiting a positive and relevant clinical effect.

Introduction
The role of bacteria in the pathogenesis of chronic leg
ulcers and bedsores is unclear and disputed [1–10]. Delayed healing has been reported to be linked to the
influence of some or all recovered microorganisms even
when clinical infection was not evidenced. Hence, antimicrobials might appear appealing as therapeutic agents, but
previous studies have reported variable in vitro toxicity of
antiseptics on cultured cells [11–16]. By extrapolation, it
is sometimes inferred that antiseptics should not be

applied on healing wounds [17]. However, there is no clinical evidence for such a deleterious effect when using
povidone-iodine (PVP-I) formulations [17–25].
In this field, the potential for microbial colonization to
impair leg ulcer healing must be differentiated from clinical infection [22, 24]. In addition, a distinction must be
made between the superficial flora collected by swabs and
foci of microorganisms present more deeply in the wound
where they may elicit a discrete to severe vasculitis
impeding wound healing [22, 26].
The issue of using or not antimicrobials in leg ulcers is
further clouded by their decreased activity in such lesions
compared to in vitro effects. This aspect was particularly
studied for PVP-I and the relevance of lowered clinical
activity is debated and probably insignificant [27–34].
The aim of this study was to revisit the clinical relevance of antiseptic toxicity in the process of leg ulcer healing and to bridge the gap between histological findings
and in vivo realities.
Patients and Methods
The trial was performed according to the Helsinki Declaration
and its revisions and was approved by the Ethics Committee of the
University of Liège. The patients were informed about the nature
and purpose of the study and that they could withdraw whenever
they wanted. Written consent was obtained from each volunteer
prior to inclusion.
A total of 51 patients were enrolled in this open study conducted
over 5 years. They were aged 55 B 5 years and they suffered from
chronic leg ulcers. At least 2 of these lesions were present and looked
similar in each patient at entry in the study. The wound beds were
dull and dark red with dispersed yellowish foci. Their minimal size
was 16 cm2 at inclusion and there was no evidence for clinical infection. All lesions were developed on moderate grade lipodermatosclerosis. The main noninclusion criteria were neurological disorders,
arterial occlusion, hypertension, diabetes and intake of antibiotics
and any other drug acting on microcirculation or blood coagulation.
At entry in the study, the two target ulcers in each patient were
randomly assigned to receive one of the two treatment modalities.
The basic treatment on control ulcers consisted in physiological
saline rinsing and hydrocolloid dressing (Duoderm E®, Convatec)
covered by a compressive bandage. The procedure was repeated
three times a week. The other target ulcer benefited from the same
procedure, but antimicrobials were applied in addition underneath
the hydrocolloid dressing. According to the order of inclusion, three
parallel groups of 17 patients were randomized. They received 1 of 3
test antimicrobials corresponding to 10% PVP-I solution (Iso-Betadine dermique®, Asta Medica), 1% silver sulfadiazine cream (Sulfasil, Purna) and 5% chlorhexidine digluconate solution (Hibitane,
Astra Zeneca), respectively.
Time to healing was recorded. In addition, clinical assessments
were performed at inclusion and after 3 and 6 weeks of treatment. At
each evaluation session, the limits of the ulcers were traced using a
felt tip pen and a transparent film. The area and perimeter were measured using computerized image analysis (MOP Videoplan, Kontron, Eiching, Germany). The healing rate was calculated using the
healing index parameter [22, 35, 36] as described in table 1.
At inclusion and after the 6-week treatment, a 3-mm punch biopsy was also performed inside the ulcer, near the border of the lesion.
Sections were stained with hematoxylin-eosin or prepared for immunohistochemistry looking for bacteria and specific cells of the dermal
and inflammatory lineages (table 2). 3-Amino-9-ethylcarbazole was
used as chromogen. Controls were performed by omitting or substituting reagents of the immunohistochemical procedure. Semiquantitative assessments were performed in a 5-point grading scale ranging
from 0 (absent) to 4 (abundant/severe).
In each group of 17 patients, the assumption of a normal distribution was checked using the Shapiro-Wilks test. This assumption was
not fulfilled, and thus nonparametric tests were used after calculation
of median values. At each evaluation time, comparisons were
described as percentage variations relative to baseline values. Statistical analysis was performed using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. The
analyses of difference between the three arms of the study were made
using the Kruskall-Wallis test. Times to healing were described using
Kaplan-Meier curves and the treatment groups were compared using
a log-rank test. A p value lower than 0.05 was considered significant.

Results
Clinical Assessment
At inclusion, the area and perimeter of the paired leg
ulcers were not significantly different in each of the three
groups of 17 patients. Comparative results of the effects of
treatment are presented in table 3. At the 3-week assessment, no specific effects of the antimicrobials were seen
using planimetry. After the 6-week treatment, the healing
rate was discretely improved in ulcers receiving silver sulfadiazine (2–7%) or chlorhexidine digluconate (–1 to 5%).
By contrast, it was significantly increased (p ! 0.01) in
PVP-I-treated ulcers.
Compared to controls, time to healing was significantly
reduced by 2–9 weeks (p ! 0.01) in PVP-I-treated ulcers,
but it only showed a trend of reduction without reaching
significance in the silver-sulfadiazine- and chlorhexidinedigluconate-treated ulcers.
Histological Assessment
Ulcers looked similar at inclusion with high densities
in fibroblasts, dendrocytes, small vessels and inflammatory cells. Clumps of bacteria were dispersed inside the
granulation tissue of 39/102 ulcers. In their vicinity, small
abscesses and neutrophilic vasculitis were focally present.
Comparative data after the 6-week treatment are presented in table 4. Compared to the control ulcers, those lesions
receiving antimicrobials showed decreased bacterial density inside the living tissues. Vascular margination of
inflammatory cells was less prominent, and the neutrophilic vasculitis was almost cleared. The comparison between the ulcers treated by the antimicrobials indicated

that the densities in microvessels and dendrocytes were
higher in PVP-I-assigned lesions than in those receiving
silver sulfadiazine or chlorhexidine digluconate. The two
latter antimicrobials appeared to alter the superficial microvasculature and to induce focal dendrocytoclasis.
Discussion
The treatment of leg ulcers aims to boost the repair
process in order to achieve optimal healing. Keeping adequate moisture at the surface of the wound supports epidermal repair. In many instances when exudation is not
too prominent, a hydrocolloid dressing is acknowledged
to be beneficial [4, 5]. Such a treatment was used as a positive control in the present study.
Despite the absence of clinical signs of infections, all
chronic leg ulcers harbor an abundant polymicrobial flora
[1, 9]. Those microorganisms present in the exudate and
at the surface of leg ulcers probably play an insignificant
role in the healing delay. Indeed, swab results are inconsistent and misleading. By contrast, a critical bacterial
colonization inside the wound may hinder healing
through local toxin release and elicits an inflammatory
reaction leading to segmental vasculitis [10, 22, 26].
Keeping the wound microorganism content as low as possible calls for antimicrobials. However, this has been one
of the most controversial issues in wound care over the
past two decades. Opponents claimed one of two opposite
and exclusive arguments, arguing either the weakened
antimicrobial activity in vivo [27, 29] or the toxic inhibition of granulation tissue formation and epithelialization
[11–17]. These concepts were based primarily on in vitro
studies and experimental in vivo models. The wisdom to
extrapolate these findings to human leg ulcers is questionable [24]. As far as PVP-I is concerned, one important
potential factor regarding in vivo toxicity is oxygen tension and, unless this was controlled, many of the cytotoxic
studies may appear irrelevant. As a matter of fact, the
human skin tolerance for PVP-I formulations is good [37].
In addition, lipodermatosclerosis and all ulcer beds contain too many vessels, fibroblasts, macrophages and other
cells [22, 38, 39]. Hence, moderate cytotoxicity might
somewhat regulate such an excess. As a result, this situation has been interpreted as a paradoxical beneficial toxicity [24].
Although the presently tested topical antimicrobials
may achieve similar activity on many bacterial species,
the healing rate of ulcers and the histological changes differed according to these agents. PVP-I appeared to be the
most efficient compound in these respects. At least part of
the activity is attributed to the antimicrobial effect even if
the gradient of the iodine concentration below the wound
surface is unknown. However, it is possible that the compound decreases the amount of bacteria present superficially and thus hinders the deeper tissue invasion. The
reduced density in deep-seated microorganisms may help
the natural host defenses to eradicate them.
Beyond mere antimicrobial activity, iodine released
into the wound environment may enhance the healing of
chronic leg ulcers [40]. Modifications in the redox environment may be beneficial. In addition, the effects on
macrophages and dendrocytes may also be important.
Indeed, PVP-I provides a stimulus by activation of the
resident and mobile macrophage populations. Iodine enhances the TNF-· production by macrophages costimulated by suboptimal levels of bacterial lipopolysaccharides [38]. It has been shown that the level production of
cytokines including TNF-· does not impair healing [41],
but they rather trigger the healing phase. Dermal dendrocytes enriched in factor XIIIa which are stimulated by
TNF-· are particularly involved in the process of fibrosis
[42]. However, any release in factor XIIIa may also stabilize the pericapillary fibrin cuffs found in venous leg
ulcers [43]. The partial destruction of dendrocytes under
the form of dendrocytoclasis identified by cytoplasmic
fragmentation [44] was present at sites treated by chlorhexidine digluconate or silver sulfadiazine. This could be
interpreted as a sign of cytotoxicity.
Further, besides these biological functions, iodine may
also interfere with the release and activity of matrix
metalloproteinases. These enzymes are involved in dermal remodeling found in lipodermatosclerosis and venous ulcers [45, 46]. They further modulate the activities
of cytokines and their receptors at the cell surface and also
modify other molecules that interact with them.
In conclusion, antimicrobials, particularly PVP-I, exhibit a beneficial effect on leg ulcers when healing is
impaired by a critical colonization by a polymicrobial flora. The positive effect is probably not merely bound to the
direct antimicrobial potency. Other biological mechanisms could also well be positively affected by the sustained iodine release.
