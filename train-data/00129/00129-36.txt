Abstract: Client perceptions of wound treatments represent an important but often overlooked aspect of research which principally focuses on the clinical effectiveness of treatments. In a large multi-site randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing a nanocrystalline silver dressing and cadexomer iodine dressing, which were used in conjunction with multi-layer compression bandaging, client perceptions about the acceptability of these antimicrobial products and compression bandaging were evaluated. The paper does not seek to explore effects between antimicrobials or between the two types of compression bandaging, which would focus the reader on the patient satisfaction with the products used. Data from 207 participants were analysed, representing a 74% response rate of the 281 RCT recruits. Both antimicrobial dressings were rated highly, with the majority of respondents willing to use their randomised treatment in the future if the need should arise. There was no significant difference in ratings of the acceptability of the nanocrystalline silver dressing and cadexomer iodine dressing. The acceptability of compression bandaging was high as was willingness to use compression bandaging again. Though adherence to compression bandaging was significantly associated with higher satisfaction ratings, acceptability of the treatment remained high, even for those clients not adhering to compression bandaging regimes. This result challenges the perception that a lack of client willingness to use compression bandaging is a principal driver of non-adherence to this treatment. Clearly other factors influenced adherence and these require further investigation if the benefits of this best practice treatment are to be realised.
