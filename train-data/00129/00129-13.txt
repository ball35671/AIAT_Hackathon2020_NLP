Abstract
﻿The aim of this work was to study the safety and effectiveness of silver foam dressing (Contreet® Ag, Coloplast, Humlebaek, Denmark) in promoting the healing of infected venous ulcers over 9 weeks of treatment. Forty-two patients with infected venous ulcers were included and randomized into two groups. Group A had 21 patients (12 women and 9 men, mean age 61.2 years) who were treated with the silver foam for 9 weeks. Group B also had 21 patients (14 women and 7 men, mean age 58.7 years) who were treated with a nonadhesive foam (Biatain®, Coloplast, Humlebaek, Denmark) for 9 weeks. In both groups, ulcer size and depth, intensity of pain, wound exudation, bacterial load, side effects of both materials, and ulcer healing were documented and compared. There was no significant difference at the initial assessment in both groups regarding ulcer size, ulcer depth, grade of exudation, pain intensity, or bacterial load. However, group A ulcers had a significantly greater healing (P = 0.02) compared to group B. Pain intensity was significantly less in group A patients at several time points. After 9 weeks of treatment, the silver foam dressing was found to be a safe material that promotes rapid healing of venous ulcers and relieves pain. ﻿﻿﻿.
