Abstract
In a multicenter trial (comprising 258 patients in eight centers) three topical preparations for enzymatic debridement, which are widely used in our country, have been compared in the treatment of leg ulcers. Preparation A is a combination of bovine fibrinolysin and desoxyribonuclease (but without antibiotic); preparation B is a combination of clostridiopeptidase and chloramphenicol and preparation C of trypsin and framycetin sulphate. The results showed no significant difference in the effects of treatment between the preparation. Preparation A however was much better tolerated; preparation B and C induced a lot of side effects. This means that antibiotics in preparations for enzymatic debridement are not of real advantage.
