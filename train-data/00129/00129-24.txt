The prevalence of leg ulcers varies from 0.6% to
1.15% in women 65 to 84 years of age and from 0.3%
to 0.5% in men of similar age.' Most of the leg
ulcers (80% to 90%) are of venous origin. Because
local treatment is not always effective.r" uncomplicated leg ulcers (ulcers without cellulitis or osteomyelitis) are often treated with systemic antimicrobial agents. Although short-term antimicrobialtherapy is ineffective.P preliminary evidence indicates
that long-term ciprofloxacin therapy may be beneficial. 6 However, placebo-controlled trials with standardized local treatment, including compression
bandages, have not been performed.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Thirty-six outpatientswith a venous leg ulcer for longer
than 3 months withoutsignificant healing were admitted
to the trial.
Enrollment criteria included age of 18 years or more,
body weight exceeding 50 kg, no antimicrobial treatment
within 2 weeks before the study, no current warfarin or
theophylline treatment, and no allergy to the antimicrobial agents to be used. The patients had to be able to administer local treatment regularly either by themselves or
with assistance. Patients with an arteriosclerotic ulcer
were excluded."
The patients were randomly assigned to groups of 30
patientsf and treated in a double-blind manner with ciprofloxacin (750 mg twice daily), trimethoprim (160 mg
twice daily), or placebo (twice daily) for 12 weeks. CipFrom the Department of Dermatology," and the Department of MOOicine,"Turku University Central Hospital, and Antimicrobial Research Laboratory," National Public Health Institute, and Department of Public Health," Universityof Helsinki.

rofloxacin was chosen because of earlier experiences with
this drug in the treatmentofleg ulcers.f and trimethoprim
was used as a control antibiotic. These drugs share several
characteristics, including broad-spectrum antibacterial
activity (especially against staphylococci and coliforms)
and excellent tolerability.?
Of the 36 original patients, five were eventually excluded. In the trimethoprim treatment group three patients had side effects (rash, mild vertigo and nausea,
chest pain). In one patient osteitis developed during placebo treatment, and one patient receiving ciprofloxacin
discontinued the treatment for personal reasons.
Most patients examined were women (26/31), and age
varied from 38 to 90 years. After patients were randomly
assigned to groups, the average duration of the leg ulcers
was 72 months (range, 3 to 216 months) in theciprofloxacin group, 67 months (range, 4 to 252 months) in the
trimethoprim group, and 29 months (range 3 to 96
months) in the placebo group. The average size of the ulcer at the beginning of the study was 53 ern? (range, 1to
475 cm-), 31 cm2 (range, 1 to 145 cm-), and 27 ern?
(range, 1 to 154 em"), respectively.
All patients were encouraged by a specialist nurse to
use Comprilan elastic bandage (Beiersdorf AG, Hamburg, Germany) and local therapy (Varitube sock, Kabi
Pharmacia Ab, Uppsala, Sweden; 0.2 gm zinc in I gm
petrolatum-paraffin-based ointmen t).
Each patient was examined six times during the
16-week study period. The size of the ulcer was measured
on each visit by drawing the shape of the ulcer on commercially available double-layer plastic (OpSite, Smith
& Nephew Medical Ltd, Hull, England). The plastic was
cut along the drawn margins and weighed; the weight was
used to calculate the ulcer area.
Bacterial culture of the ulcer flora were obtained at 0,
4, 12, and 16 weeks and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)suscepti bility determinations were made. 10-12
Forstatistical analysis we used the Kruskal-Wallis test
for continuous variables, Fisher's contigency table test for
nominal scale data, and Fisher's Exact Test for 2 X 2 tables. 13
RESULTS
The rates at which the ulcers decreased in size did
not differ significantly between the study groups.

rofloxacin was 42% (5 of 12), 33% (3 of 9) with trimethoprim, and 30% (3 of 10) with placebo. The
rate of reduction in ulcer size was also not significantly faster in the ciprofloxacin group than in the
others (Fig. 1).
Ciprofloxacin-resistant (MIC:> 4 ,Ltg/ml)ll or
trimethoprim-resistant (MIC:> 8 fLg/ml) ulcer
flora emerged during the treatment in two thirds of
the patients both in the ciprofloxacin-treated group
(8/12 patients) and in the trimethoprim-treated
group (6/9). In the placebo group trimethoprimresistant flora emerged in only one of nine patients
(p =0.011; P =0.02 compared with the treatment
groups).
At the end of the study 94% of the bacterial species isolated from the ulcers were resistant to ciprofloxacin in the ciprofloxacin group; the corresponding figures in the trimethoprim and placebo groups
were 12% and 4%, respectively (p < 0.000l). During ciproftoxacin treatment isolates resistant to trimethoprim also emerged; 63% of the isolates were
resistant to trimethoprim. This proportion equals
that observed in patients treated with trimethoprim
(65%). Only 8% of the isolatesin the placebo group
were trimethoprim resistant (p = 0.004 and p = 0.0003 compared with the treatment groups).
Staphylococcus aureus was present in 84% (26/
31) of the ulcers at the beginningofthe study. At the
end of therapy S. aureus was present in only one of
the seven open ulcers in the ciprofloxacintreatment
group compared with five of the six and all seven
open ulcers in the trimethoprim and placebo groups,
respectively (p =0.03 and p = 0.004). Healing of
the ulcers was not, however, dependent on the eradication of S. aureus.
DISCUSSION
This study is the first double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the long-term antimicrobial treatment of uncomplicated venous leg ulcers. Although
it is a small pilot survey, we decided not to continue
with a larger patient group. This decision was based
mainly on the fact that at least 163 patients would
be needed in both the ciprofloxacin and placebo
groups to show a possible 15% difference in the
treatment effect in terms of complete cure at a significance level of 5% and a power of 80%.
In addition to the poor therapeutic effect, a
remarkable increase in bacterial resistance was detected in the treatment groups. Although the resistant strains were mainly coagulase-negative staphylococci, Pseudomonas species, and diphtheroids,
these may complicate further therapy of the patient. 14Resistant strains may also be transferred to
other patients or in some instances act as a reservoir
for resistance genes.
The high cost of the antimicrobial treatment
should also be considered. In Finland the cost of 12
weeks' treatment is $600 with ciprofloxacin and
$120 with trimethoprim.

benefit of long-term antimicrobial treatment of un-

Superior vena caval syndrome presenting as periorbital edema
Jason R. Dyken, MD, Joseph P. Pagano, MD, and Vera Y. Soong, MD Fairfield, Alabama
The superior vena caval syndrome describes a
constellation of physical findings resulting from obstruction of the superior vena cava and subsequent
engorgement of collateral veins of the thorax, neck,
and head. The increased blood flow through these
collateral vessels produces periorbital edema and
facial suffusion. 1 In addition, nasal congestion,
epistaxis, tongue swelling, dysphagia, visual disturbances, and headaches have been described. The
complications of cerebral edema and laryngeal
edema have long been known but the urgency for
intervention has been questioned. 2
The obstruction causing the superior vena caval
syndrome may result from any benign or malignant
mediastinal mass, but most commonly occurs with
bronchogenic carcinoma. The manifestations may

occur from external compression, local invasion, or
intraluminal obstruction. Their degree and time
course usually depend on the underlying cause. In
slow-growing benign cases the signs may progress
for months, allowing collaterals to form. Acute
thrombus formation causing obstruction may produce a medical emergency.
We describe a patient with bilateral periorbital
edema resulting from superior vena caval syndrome.
CASE REPORT
A 74-year-old whitewomanwithmetastaticsmall-cell
carcinoma of the lung had the acute onset of altered
mental status, pain in the right shoulder, dyspnea, and
marked periorbital edema. Initial physical examination
revealed marked periorbital edema, decreased breath
sounds in the right lung field, and slurred speech.
On further questioning the patient admittedto marked
facial edema for 2 weeks. She had no history of angioedema, allergic reactions,new medications, thyroiddisorders,lupuserythematosus, orother autoimmunediseases.
Her medications included cimetidine, captopril, and
dipyridamole. Examination revealed bilateral lower lid
edema, distended superficial veins of the chest and head,
