T
he prevalence of leg ulceration remains
relatively constant and continues to affect
0.14–2% of the population, depending on
the methodology used.1-4 Approximately
70% of leg ulcers are of venous aetiology.
Chronic venous leg ulcers are associated with protracted treatment, a high recurrence rate, high associated health-service costs and a reduced quality of
life.5,6 Approximately 50% of venous ulcers heal
after 12 weeks of compression therapy.7 The two
most positive predictors of healing within 24 weeks
are a wound size of less than 5cm2 and a duration of
less than six months at the initial presentation.8.9
A recent systematic review of 42 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving 3001 patients evaluated the effect of dressings on healing outcomes for
venous leg ulcers.10 This concluded that there is
insuffi cient evidence that any one type of dressing
heals ulcers more quickly than others. It highlighted
the poor methodological quality and small sample
sizes of many of the studies. A further limitation of
many studies on topical agents for venous leg ulcers
is the lack of information on the condition of the
wound bed at the start of treatment and its potential infl uence on healing outcomes.
Slough provides a nidus for infection, prolongs
infl ammation, increases metabolic load and impairs
visualisation of the wound bed.11-13 As venous ulcers
can harbour up to four different pathogens,14-16 the
presence of slough in the wound bed increases the
potential for infection. The ongoing presence of
virulent microorganisms prolongs the infl ammatory response, which eventually contributes to host
injury. There is persistent production of infl ammatory mediators and a steady migration of neutrophils, which release proteolytic enzymes and
oxygen-free radicals.17 Localised thrombosis and
the release of vasoconstricting metabolites can lead
to tissue hypoxia, promoting further bacterial proliferation and tissue destruction.17 The destructive
action of bacteria on wound tissue can therefore
increase the production of slough. As such, it could
be argued that wounds in which slough is the predominant tissue will heal more slowly than clean
granulating wounds.
Honey is not a generic agent and in vitro studies
● Objective: To determine the qualitative bacteriological changes that occurred during a four-week
treatment period with either manuka honey or a hydrogel dressing. This was the secondary outcome of
a randomised controlled trial (RCT) that compared the effi cacy of the two treatments in desloughing
venous leg ulcers.
● Method: This was a prospective open label multicentre RCT with blinded microbiological outcome
analysis. Randomisation was conducted via remote telephone. To be included, the wound bed needed to
comprise at least 50% slough. Wound swabs were taken at the start of treatment and after four weeks.
● Results: In all, 108 patients (35 males, 73 females) aged 24–89 years (mean 68) enrolled into the study.
Both groups were comparable at baseline. Eighteen patients (17%) were withdrawn due to a wound
infection: six in the honey group and 12 in the hydrogel group. Staphylococcus aureus was the most
common isolate, being identifi ed in 41 wounds (38%). At baseline, meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
was identifi ed in 16 wounds (10 honey versus six hydrogel). After four weeks 70% (n=7) of the manukahoney treated wounds versus 16% (n=1) of the hydrogel treated wounds had MRSA eradicated.
Pseudomonas aeruginosa was reported in 14% (n=16) of all wounds at baseline. After four weeks 33% (n=2)
treated with honey and 50% (n=5) treated with hydrogel had this eliminated. The number of wounds
(n=11 at baseline; n=15 at week 4) with ≥3 bacteria species remained constant over the four weeks.
● Conclusion: Manuka honey was effective in eradicating MRSA from 70% of chronic venous ulcers.
The potential to prevent infection is increased when wounds are desloughed and MRSA is eliminated.
This can be benefi cial to prevent cross-infection.
● Declaration of interest: None.

have demonstrated that manuka honey has antibacterial properties against a wide range of wound-colonising organisms including Staphylococcus aureus,
Pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptococcus,18,19 the
fi rst being one of the most common pathogens colonising venous ulcers.14,16
Many reports have verifi ed the antimicrobial properties of honey, but its mechanisms of action have
only been partially studied.18,20,21 The antimicrobial
activity of different honeys can vary by up to 100-
fold.22,23 Studies have demonstrated that manuka
honey has high antibacterial activity associated with
a non-peroxide, unidentifi ed, phytochemical component.18,22-25 In vitro studies on manuka honey,
where its antibacterial potency was near the median
level, showed the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was 2–3% for Staphylococcus aureus, 3.3–
4% for coagulase-negative staphylococci, 5.5–9% for
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 2.7–3% for MRSA and 3.8–
5% for vancomycin-resistant enterococcus.18,19,26,27
Condon28 argued that the antimicrobial effect of
honey lies in its physical properties rather than its
chemical composition. Honey is hyperosmolar and
so restricts the availability of environmental water
to bacteria and other organisms.28 Additionally,
because bacterial cells are largely impermeable to
sucrose and similar sugars, honey also osmotically
withdraws water from bacteria.28 This simple process could contribute to the management of the bacterial burden in the wound.
The benefi ts of this antibacterial activity remain
speculative, and as yet no published clinical studies
have determined the effect of honey on wound bacteria. Although many reports and trials have documented the bacterial fl ora present, they have not
correlated healing times with the reduction in bacterial load.29
The high osmolarity of honey stimulates the outfl ow of fl uid from the deeper wound compartments
to the surface, thus aiding wound cleansing and
contributing to wound debridement. However, our
knowledge of the effi cacy of honey as a debriding
agent is based on case studies20,30,31 as this has not
yet been tested in a RCT.
We conducted a RCT to compare the effi cacy of
manuka honey (WoundCare 18+, Comvita, New
Zealand) with hydrogel therapy (Intrasite Gel, Smith
& Nephew, UK) in desloughing venous leg ulcers.32
The primary outcome measures were to determine
the ability of manuka honey to deslough venous leg
ulcers over four weeks and measure its effects on healing rates after 12 weeks, when compared with the
standard agent. These will be published elsewhere.
A secondary outcome measure was to monitor
changes in the qualitative bacteriological analysis of
culture swabs taken from sloughy venous ulcers
over the four-week treatment period. This paper
focuses on the secondary outcome.
Method
This prospective open-label multicentre RCT was conduced between February 2003 and January 2006.
Patients presenting with venous leg ulcers where
>50% of the wound area was covered in slough and
who were able to provide written informed consent
were considered for inclusion.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria were based on an
ankle brachial pressure index (ABPI) of >0.8 where
no other causative aetiology was present and the
ulcer appeared to be venous on clinical examination. Patients were excluded if the wound was greater than 100cm2, they had a current wound infection
or an infection elsewhere on the body requiring
antibiotics, were taking steroids or they were allergic
to any type of honey or hydrogels.
Approval was gained from the ethics committees
representing study sites.
A priori calculation determined that 156 patients
were required to show a 20% difference between the
treatments for the primary outcome at a two-sided
signifi cance level.
Patients were enrolled from 10 sites which included vascular and specialist wound clinics and community leg ulcer clinics. Baseline data collection
included ulcer size and duration, ulcer location and
history of recurrence, history of deep venous thrombosis (DVT), hypertension, trauma or surgery to the
affected limb, diabetes, immunosuppression therapy and current medications. Randomisation was via
remote telephone.
Compression therapy was continued in all cases.
Patients were treated with the allocated treatment
for four weeks and then followed up at week 12 to
determine if their ulcer had healed. Treatment was
applied weekly as follows: manuka honey 5g/20cm2
and hydrogel 3g/20cm2. The dose differential was
accounted for by the viscosity of the agents.
At the fi rst assessment visit (before randomisation), two culture swabs were taken after the wound
was cleansed with warm tap water; two swabs were
taken to safeguard against loss or damage to the
swab or the result. A cotton-tipped swab was rotated
360° in the wound bed. To emulate routine clinical
practice, the swabs were placed in transport media
and transported immediately to the laboratory for
routine qualitative culture. Repeat swabs were taken, using the same procedure, after one week and
four weeks of treatment. The laboratory was blinded
to treatment allocation.
Wound size was recorded weekly using digital
planimetry (Visitrak, Smith & Nephew). Pain was
assessed weekly using a validated fi ve-point visual
analogue scale, where 0 = no pain and 5 = severe or
worst ever pain.33
The bacteria are presented in the results section as
reported on the laboratory report forms, to show
similarity with routine clinical practice.

Statistical analysis
Data were entered into SPSS version 14. The primary
analysis was conducted on an intention-to-treat
basis. Non-parametric two-sample Mann-Whitney
U test was used to investigate the signifi cance of the
differences observed between the two interventions
in relation to pain. Statistical signifi cance was considered when p values were 0.05 or less. The logrank test for equality of survival functions was used
to determine if there was a signifi cant difference
between the two groups in the number of patients
who were withdrawn from the study because of a
wound infection. The outcome variable was the
week of withdrawal. The chi-square test was used to
compare categorical demographic and baseline variable data. Baseline differences between groups were
examined using the independent samples t-test for
independent groups.
Results
A total of 108 patients, allocated to two groups of
54, were enrolled over 34 months. Baseline patient
characteristics were comparable in the two groups
(Table 1).
During the four-week treatment period, 18
patients (17%) were withdrawn due to a wound
infection (six in the honey group versus 12 in the
hydrogel group). Infection was diagnosed on clinical presentation and included factors such as
increased pain, increased wound size, increased exudate and surrounding cellulitis. This difference was
clinically but not statistically different (χ2=3.11,
p=0.077). No differences or trends were noted, based
on the week of withdrawal or bacterial species
reported.
At baseline, the two groups were comparable in
terms of the number of bacterial species (χ2 5.152,
p=0.27) (Table 2). This comparability was maintained throughout the treatment period (Table 2).
None of the ulcers or their surrounding skin showed
signs of infl ammation at baseline.
Table 3 reports on the bacterial species identifi ed
at baseline and at the end of week 4, based on treatment allocation and their frequency of occurrence.
Interestingly, wounds with a longer duration had
more bacterial species than those with a shorter
duration (Table 4).
Staphyloccocus was the most common wound
isolate at baseline, being found in 38% (n=41) of all
wounds. At baseline, meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was isolated in 10 ulcers in the
honey group and six in the hydrogel group. After
four weeks a ‘case-by-case’ review showed that this
reduced to 3/10 ulcers in the honey group compared
with 5/6 in the hydrogel group. The mean age of
patients with MRSA was 76 years (range 52–86,
median 78), which is higher than that of the entire
study population (mean 68 years).
At baseline Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated in
six ulcers in the honey group and 10 ulcers in the
hydrogel group. Of those individual wounds with
Pseudomonas aeruginosa at baseline, only 33% (n=2)
treated with honey and 50% (n=5) treated with
hydrogel had this eliminated by week 4. The mean
wound area of all ulcers colonised with Pseudomonas
aeruginosa at baseline was 15.9cm2, which was 50%
greater than that of the overall study population
(10.1cm2).
At baseline, wounds colonised with Pseudomonas
aeruginosa had a mean surface area of slough of 83%,
which reduced to 60% after four weeks. This was
lower than the mean reduction in the percentage of
slough (82–36%) for the entire study population.
Mean baseline pain scores were 1.41 (SD 1.05) in
the honey group compared with 1.39 (SD 1.15) in
the hydrogel group. This difference was neither statistically or clinically signifi cant (p<0.82). After one
week mean pain scores were 0.67 (SD 1.18) for the
honey group versus 0.81 (SD 1.89) for the hydrogel
group; again, this was not statistically signifi cant
(p<0.42). However, there was a difference between

the groups in the mean percentage reduction in
wound pain at week 1: honey reduced by 52% versus 34% for hydrogel; this was statistically signifi -
cant in favour of honey (p<0.05). No further statistically signifi cant differences were found between the
groups at weekly intervals or from baseline to the
end of each week. An increase in the intensity or
nature of pain may indicate that a chronic wound
has become infected.34
Regarding the 18 infected ulcers, during the treatment period pain increased in seven (39%), remained
unchanged in six (33%) and decreased in fi ve (28%).
In addition, 11 of these 18 ulcers (61%) increased in
size, two remained unchanged (11%) and fi ve
reduced in size (28%).
Discussion
This is the fi rst randomised in vivo study to compare
the effi cacy of manuka honey with a comparator on
the bacterial burden of sloughy venous ulcers. The
hydrogel dressing was used as the comparator
because it is a standard desloughing agent; IntraSite
Gel was chosen because it was the most commonly
used hydrogel in the study sites.
Wound infection was the most common reason
for withdrawal from the study (n=18). This is an
important clinical fi nding as the literature has not
identifi ed the rate of infection that can be expected
in patients with chronic venous leg ulcers. However,
chronic venous leg ulcers are persistently colonised
subclinically.14,35 We did not include subclinical colonisation as an exclusion criteria, and it could be
that the infection rate refl ected the severity of
wound colonisation at baseline. As slough was the
predominant tissue in the wound bed at baseline,
this rate of infection was not unexpected.
While there was no statistically signifi cant difference in the infection rate between the two groups,
more cases were reported in the hydrogel group
(n=12) than in the honey group (n=6). This may be

attributed to differences in the antimicrobial properties of the two treatments. We therefore hypothesise that topical desloughing agents used on chronic
wounds, such as venous ulcers, should have antimicrobial properties, although further research is
needed to support this.
The polymicrobial nature of the ulcers reported in
the present study was similar to that reported elsewhere.14,16,35 In our study, 13 ulcers (12%) had ‘no
bacterial growth’ at baseline, which, given the condition of the wound bed, is a high number as over
50% of the wound bed was covered in slough, which
harbours bacteria.
Staphylococcus aureus was the most common
wound isolate. However, its prevalence was much
lower than the 54–88% reported in studies involving patients with lower limb ulceration.15,16,35 This
may be due to differences in sampling techniques
and methods of analysis.15,35,36
Sixteen patients had MRSA at baseline. This is an
important fi nding as it indicates the prevalence of
this bacterium in the venous leg ulcer population.
However, this may be an underestimation as patients
with chronic wounds take 10 times more courses of
antibiotics than the general population, increasing
the risk of resistance.15 The mean age of patients
with MRSA was 76 years, which is higher than the
overall study population mean, supporting the fi nding that MRSA is more prevalent in older people.37
Manuka honey effectively eradicated MRSA in 70%
of cases. In vitro studies have confi rmed the effi cacy
of manuka honey against Staphylococcus aureus,
including MRSA.18,24,38
Before this study, evidence on the effi cacy of honey (varying types) in eliminating MRSA from chronic wounds was limited to in vitro studies and a few
case studies.19,39-41 MRSA has been removed from
colonised leg ulcers,30,40 chronic wounds of patients
undergoing maxillofacial surgery42 and wounds in
paediatric oncology patients.43 Blaser et al.44
described how Medihoney (which contains manuka) eradicated MRSA in the chronic wounds of different aetiologies in seven patients. The infection
had persisted for up to fi ve years in some cases,
despite the selected use of topical antiseptics, topical antibiotics and systemic vancomycin.44 Further
research is needed to test our fi ndings in a larger
cohort of MRSA-positive wounds. This could have
implications for wound management, particularly
in the acute hospital setting where there is a greater
risk of cross-contamination.
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, was present in 14% of all
wounds at baseline, and is associated with non-healing in up to 60% of wounds.35 This is within the
prevalence range of 6.6–19% reported by Tammelin
et al. and Hansson et al.,15,16 but lower than the
40–50% reported by Trengove et al. and Bowler.35,45
It is interesting that the hydrogel performed better
in this aspect of microbiological control as it does
not have antibacterial properties and both agents
promote a moist environment. The presence of
Pseudomonas aeruginosa was also associated with
larger ulcers and less effi cacious removal of slough.
In an in vitro analysis, Cooper and Molan proposed that manuka honey may inhibit growth
of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, even if the honey was
diluted more than 10-fold by wound exudate.26
However, this was not supported in two case studies31,46 or the present study. Furthermore, in an in
vitro study Willix et al.24 noted that, of all organisms
tested, Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the least sensitive to manuka honey.
Limitations
The main study limitation was the failure to recruit
the predetermined number of participants. However, the sample size of 108 still represents the largest
study on sloughy venous ulcers and the effi cacy of
manuka honey in the management of bacterial burden. Quantitative bacteriological analysis may have
provided more in-depth analysis but, as bacterial
changes were not the primary outcome, this method was not justifi ed. The small numbers in each
group mean that statistical interpretation of fi ndings was limited. However, we hope that the fi ndings may add to the body of knowledge on the use
of manuka honey in chronic wounds. The fi ndings
are only truly applicable to sloughy venous ulcers
and to manuka honey.
Conclusion
Sloughy venous ulcers harbour a wide range of pathogens. The effi cacy of honey in eliminating MRSA
in such wounds is a positive fi nding that may have
implications for wound management and infection
control. The use of manuka honey was associated
with a signifi cant reduction in wound pain after one
week. Future clinical studies are warranted to determine optimal dosage regimens for antimicrobial
effi cacy. ■

Education reduces
infection
A n innovative project in
Hull, UK has demonstrated
that healthcare-acquired
infections (HCAI) can be reduced
through a programme of
education of link nurses, rather
than the usual approach of
clinical intervention. By
improving technical skills
andequipping link nurses with
the skills to challenge senior staff
and take ownership of HCAI, the
programme reduced infections
on participating wards and raised
awareness of infection control
among staff and visitors.
New diagnostic test
Ark Therapeutics has
launched neuropad® in
the UK, an innovative,
cost-effective and objective
diagnostic test to detect the early
warning symptoms for diabetic
foot syndrome.
neuropad® is an adhesive dressing applied to the plantar surface
of the foot to assess the function
of the sweat glands by measuring
the moisture status of the foot,
indicated by colour change. An
abnormal sweat gland response is
closely correlated with the onset
of peripheral autonomic neuropathy in the feet.
