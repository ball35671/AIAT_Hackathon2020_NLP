SUMMARY
Ninety-three patients with treatment-resistant venous ulcers were included in a multicentre
randomized trial to compare cadexomer iodine and the standard treatment used in each centre
combined with compression bandages, in healing venous ulcers. The mean duration of ulcers
before the trial was more than 2 years. With standard treatment the mean ulcer size increased
slightly during the 6-week trial whereas with cadexomer iodine the ulcer size was significantly
reduced. Cadexomer iodine was more effective than standard treatment for reduction of pain,
removal of pus and debris, removal of exudate, stimulation of granulation and reduction of
surrounding erythema. Bacterial infection of ulcers increased or did not change during
treatment with the standard therapy whereas cadexomer iodine significantly reduced infection
with Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other pathogenic organisms. A
correlation was seen between the time taken to reduce or eliminate infection with Staphylococcus
aureus and rate of ulcer healing. Four patients complained of transient pain in the ulcer after
application ofthe cadexomer iodine. It is concluded that cadexomer iodine increased the rate of
healing of infected chronic venous ulcers.
Leg ulcers associated with venous hypertension are common (Coon, Willis & Keller, 1973;
Gjores, 1956). Almost any bland dressing together with compression bandages may be

efficacious for the treatment of venous ulcers, but there exists a population of patients whose
ulcers do not heal with currently available therapy. We have studied a new treatment,
cadexomer iodine (Iodosorb^', Perstorp AB), in a ten-centre randomized trial in chronic venous
ulcers. Cadexomer iodine is a dry powder consisting of biodegradable spherical microbeads.
These are insoluble but hydrophilic and contain 09",, iodine physically immobilized within
their matrix. Exudate is absorbed and particulate matter is removed from the ulcer surface by
the action of the microbeads and simultaneously iodine is released. It is claimed that this system
maintains a combined debriding and bactericidal effect at the ulcer surface.
METHODS
Ninety-three male and female out-patients with chronic infected venous ulcers were selected for
the trial. Ulcers were required to have a minimum diameter of 2 cm and minimum area of 3 cm^
and to have failed to respond to current treatments. Patients with a history of iodine sensitivity
and patients with peripheral arterial disease evidenced by clinical appearance of the limb,
peripheral pulses and in doubtful cases, reduced toe or ankle pressures, were excluded.
Ulcers were classified as deep, superficial or very superficial based on clinical assessment. The
ulcer size was measured by planimetry after tracing the outline of the ulcer or measuring the
greatest diameters. All ulcers were photographed against a ruler scale before treatment
commenced. Swabs were taken from the edges ofthe ulcers for bacterial culture. Bacteria were
quantified as absent, +, -I- -I- or -I- 4- -I- according to standard plating techniques for each
organism type. Patients were allocated blindly and at random to the standard treatment or to
cadexomer iodine. Assessments were performed after 1,2,4 and 6 weeks of treatment. At each
visit the ulcer was measured and photographed, swabs were taken for bacterial culture and an
assessment was made on an analogue scale of the quantity of pus and debris on the ulcer surface,
quantity of exudate and of granulation tissue in the ulcer base and the degree of oedema and
erythema of the surrounding skin. At each centre the same observer always made these
observations. Ulcer pain was recorded on a similar scale.
Treatment
All patients were treated with compression bandages applied by a visiting nurse at home or at a
hospital clinic. Some patients were trained to apply their own bandages.
Cadexomer iodine. After the ulcer had been gently washed in running water cadexomer iodine
powder was applied to a depth of approximately 3 mm and covered with a dry dressing.
Standard treatment. Before entry to the trial a large variety of local treatments was in use
including enzyme preparations, dextranomer, fucidic acid, trypure powder, polymyxin and
silver nitrate. The ulcers had failed to respond to these and for the duration ofthe trial a different
regime of management was used. Each day the ulcers were gently cleaned with dilute hydrogen
peroxide or dilute potassium permanganate baths and non-adherent dressings were applied.
Paraffin-impregnated dressings were most commonly used, but saline dressings and bland
ointments were also used occasionally. In the event of specific difficulties or failed response the
physician was permitted to modify the regime of standard treatment depending upon the
appearance of the ulcer and condition of the surrounding skin. Additional agents employed
included merbrominc, Salvstrumpa" (this consists ofa specially designed support stocking, the
inner layer of which contains ointment with a base of lanolinj vaseline and paraffin containing

zinc and sodium borate) and systemic antibiotics. In both treatment groups, during the first few
days ofthe trial when exudate was heavy, the dressing could be changed twice daily, but this was
seldom necessary and for the remainder ofthe trial dressings were changed daily.
RESULTS
Ninety-five sets of patient data were received for evaluation, of which twenty-one were excluded
from the statistical analysis (Table i). Evaluation of the results of excluded patients from the
standard group showed a mean increase of ulcer size of 10-9 cm^ and in the cadexomer iodine
group a mean decrease of 43 cm^.
No significant pre-treatment differences were observed between the groups (Table 2).
The mean ulcer size was significantly reduced after i week of treatment with cadexomer
iodine and continued to decrease during the 6 weeks ofthe trial. With standard teatment a small
decrease in ulcer size was observed during the first week of treatment which was not maintained.
The percentage decrease of ulcer area was significantly greater with cadexomer iodine at each
observation time (Fig. i). After 6 weeks of treatment the mean ulcer size in the cadexomer iodine
group had reduced by 34",, and in the standard group it had increased by 5",,.
Both treatments were associated with a significant reduction of pain during the trial but the
effect of cadexomer iodine occurred earlier and was significantly greater (P < 001) than that of
the standard treatment.
A significant debriding effect on the ulcers was apparent in each group within i week of
starting treatment. The cleansing effect of cadexomer iodine was significantly greater than that
of the standard treatment (P < 0005) (Table 3).
The effect of cadexomer iodine on stimulating granulation and reducing erythema of
surrounding skin was significantly greater than the standard treatment. Both treatments
significantly reduced oedema ofthe surrounding skin although the effect of standard treatment
was observed later.
Bacteriology
The most frequently isolated organism was Staphylococcus aureus which was present before
treatment in 77",, of the patients. In two patients of the standard group this organism was
reduced or eliminated during treatment compared with seventeen patients from the cadexomer
iodine group (P< oooi, Chi-square test with Yates' correction).

A colony count of -I- -I- + using a standard plating technique was defined as infection. In the
standard group in no case was staphylococcal infection cleared and in eighteen cases infection
persisted or new infection occurred during treatment. With cadexomer iodine in sixteen
patients itifection was cleared and in seven patients existing infection was not cleared or a new
infection occurred (P < 0001, chi-square test with Yates' correction). There were six patients
in the standard group in whom infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa occurred during
treatment or in whom existing infection persisted, whilst in one patient infection improved.
With cadexomer iodine no new infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa occurred and in all three
infected cases pre-treatment infection improved or cleared during treatment (P < 0.05, Fisher's
exact test).
The other most commonly occurring pathogenic organisms were beta-haemolytic Streptococcus, Proteus, Enterobacteria and Klebsiella. Cadexomer iodine was significantly more
effective than the standard treatment against these organisms (P < 0001, chi-square test).
Side effects
One patient on standard treatment and four on cadexomer iodine complained of pain after
application of the dressing which commenced between 10 min and 2 h after changing the
82 E.Skog et al.
dressing and which subsided after 30-60 min. One patient had itching around the ulcer which
subsided after 2 weeks without interruption of treatment. One other patient dropped out of the
study because ofa skin rash. Skin tests showed she was not sensitive to cadexomer iodine but to
coal tar derivatives probably present in her soap.
Routine laboratory tests including haematology, urea and electrolytes and Hver function
tests were performed before treatment and after 6 weeks. No significant changes were seen other
than in the white cell count, which was reduced in both groups in relation to the healing ofthe
ulcers. Thyroxine, tri-iodothyroninc, serum thyroxinc binding protein and thyroid index did
not change significantly during the study in either group.
DISCUSSION
The published literature is devoid of properly controlled studies on the healing of chronic
venous ulcers and the absence of any reliable methods for assessment of ulcer healing has been
stated as a reason for not performing controlled trials (Allen & Turner, 1979). However, it was
found in this trial that direct measurement of ulcer size by tracing and planimetry and with a
rule, confirmed for the record by photography against a centimetre scale, permitted the
demonstration ofa significant reduction in ulcer size within 1 week of starting treatment and a
significant ditference between the treatment groups. In general, venous ulcers which have been
present for only a short time heal within a few weeks with currently used treatments, while
ulcers which have been present for several months are usually much more resistant to healing. In
this trial the duration of ulcers before treatment did not correlate with ulcer size, and the size of
ulcer before treatment did not correlate with healing; the best ten responders in each group in
terms of absolute and percentage change of ulcer size had a mean ulcer size before treatment
higher than the mean size for the total population, and some ofthe smaller ulcers were among the
most resistant to treatment. A number of factors have been examined for relationships with
response to treatment; ulcer duration has proved the most significant (unpublished information).
The significance of bacteria in chronic ulcers has not been clearly defined and it is generally
considered that many of the organisms found in ulcers have no adverse effect on healing. A
significant correlation was observed between clearing of infection with Siaphylococcits aureus
and rate of ulcer healing suggesting that its presence delays healing. Animal studies have
demonstrated a relationship between infection with Psettdomonas aeruginosa and rate of healing
of standard burns (J.C.Lawrence, personal communication).
The effect of cadexomer iodine on pain and its ease of application and removal, even by elderly
patients, gave high acceptance by patients and nurses. However, transient pain in the ulcer after
application of cadexomer was reported by four patients.
Before embarking on this trial the protocol was discussed at length, in particular concerning
choice of the standard treatment. Experience with topical iodine had shown that its bactericidal
action in solution is only transient and the other logical choice for control treatment,
dextranomer, had already been used without success on many of these patients and did not meet
the criterion of best local treatment for any ofthe participants. The regime eventually chosen
was remarkably similar to that recommended in a recent editorial (British Medical Journal,
1982).
The major objectives in the local treatment of venous ulcers are to prevent accumulation of
exudate and crusts and to create an infection-free environment so that epithelial cells can cover
the ulcer. Any dressing should not become incorporated into the wound unless it is
Management of chronic venous ulcers 83
biodegradable and it should not tear off fragile new epithelium when removed. Moreover, the
dressing should provide a stable, non-adherent contact layer which allows humidity as well as
gas exchange, and a better absorptive mass superficially (British Medicat Journal, 1979). Any
system for preventing or treating local infection should not be susceptible to development of
resistant organisms and it should not involve chemicals which are toxic or which kill or inhibit
the formulation of new cells.
Cadexomer iodine powder consists of spherical microbeads. One gram can absorb up to 7 ml
of fiuid. Pore size increases with uptake of fiuid and iodine is slowly released at the wound
surface. Iodine has been used for many years for the local treatment of wounds and ulcers but its
bactericidal effect is transient because it is rapidly inactivated by protein. A local slow release
system provides a prolonged antibacterial action. The antibacterial action, biodegradability and
greater absorptive capacity distinguish cadexomer iodine from dextranomer (Debrisan), with
which viable organisms may persist in the dressing at a higher concentration than in the ulcer
(Dagher, Alangi & Smith, 1978).
Many physicians concerned with the treatment of venous ulcers feel that with appropriate
dressings, venous support and instructions on everyday activities most ulcers will heal.
However, this study revealed a substantial population of patients with ulcers which had been
present for a mean duration of more than 2 years and which had a mean area of more than 20 cm^.
With the standard treatment almost half of the ulcers increased in size despite compression
bandages and local treatment, whereas 84",, responded to cadexomer iodine. These results
suggest that in out-patient treatment of chronic venous ulcers, despite adequate compression
bandages, the choice of topical agent may significantly infiuence healing.
