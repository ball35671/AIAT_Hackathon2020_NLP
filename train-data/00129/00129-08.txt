Summary
One hundred and twenty venous ulcers with a mean duration of 26.25 ±
2.6 months were treated as out-patients using a standard graduated
compression bandage. To assess the effects of different types of dressing
they were randomized to either a non-adherent dressing (NA, Johnson &:
Johnson, D =60), an occlusive dressing (Granuflex, Squibb Surgicare, D = 30) or a dressing with silver sulphadiazine added (Flamazine, Smith &:
Nephew, D =SO). Ulcer size, duration and the patient's age were similar in
the three groups. There was no significant difference in healing between
the groups with 47 out of 60 (78%) with NA dressings, 22 out of SO (75%)
with Granuflex and 19 out of SO (65%) treated with Flamazine healed
within 12 weeks. Neither topical antimicrobial agents or occlusive
dressings improved the excellent rate of healing achieved by carefully
applied graduated compression bandaging.
Keywords: venous ulcers, compression bandaging, wound dressings.
Introduction
Venous ulcers are extremely common in the elderly with a prevalence of 1-2% I.
They consume considerable resources within the NHS in terms of finance and
medical and nursing time. Many topical preparations are claimed to improve
ulcer healing, but as non-medicated dressings are not considered to be medicines,
proof of clinical efficacy is not currently required for product licencing", Local
applications and dressings for venous ulcers may be divided into three broad
categories: non-adherent simple dressings, occlusive dressings and antibacterial
preparations. It is suggested that occlusive dressings prevent dessication and they
have been shown in animal models to increase the rate of re-epithelialization of
granulating wounds". Cellulitis may delay ulcer healing, although the presence of
bacteria themselves does not necessarily delay healing although Pseudomonas may
have adverse effects". Silver sulphadiazine (Flamazine, Smith & Nephew) is a
potent topical antibacterial agent particularly useful in Pseudomonas infections".

Like many other topical agents it has not ~reviously been studied in a controlled
trial, with efficacy based on case reports'" .
Venous or gravitational ulcers are due to either a failure of the calf muscle
pump with venous incompetence, or paralysis and immobility. The resulting
venous and capillary hypertension increases permeability producing tissue
oedema and perivascular fibrin deposition". In order to achieve healing,
compression needs to be applied to reverse the effects of both venous and capillary
hypertension", Therefore, if the additional effects of different dressings are to be
studied, the compression applied needs to be standardized. In this study we
treated 120 chronic venous ulcers with either a simple non-adherent dressing, an
occlusive dressing or Flamazine cream, having standardized all other aspects of
management. The number of ulcers completely healed in a 12-week period of
study have been recorded.
Patients and methods
One hundred and twenty consecutive venous ulcers were studied in two phases.
During the first period, 60 ulcers were randomized to either a simple
non-adherent and non-occlusive dressing (NA, Johnson & Johnson) or to an
adherent occlusive dressing (Granuflex, Squibb Surgicare). Subsequently, a
further 60 ulcers were randomized to either the 'NA' dressing or to silver
sulphadiazine (Flamazine, Smith & Nephew).
Only ulcers up to 10em" in area were included as larger ulcers are best treated
with skin graftingIll. A full history and examination with non-invasive arterial and
venous assessment was recorded prior to randomization and those patients with
arterial insufficiency shown by an ankle/brachial pressure index of less than 0.8
on Doppler were excluded. All patients were treated as out-patients with
dressings and bandages changed weekly in a venous ulcer clinic. The ulcers were
cleaned with saline and the dressing applied according to randomization using a
sequential system of sealed envelopes with treatment allocation by random
number table.
A standard high pressure graduated compression bandage was applied over the
dressing. This consisted of an initial layer of Velband (johnson & Johnson) to
redistribute pressure away from bony pressure points, and to act as an absorbant
layer. This in turn was compressed with a crepe bandage so that the elasticity of
the main pressure bandage, Elset (Seton Products Limited), was not wasted in
compressing the wool. Finally, a fourth and elastic layer of Coban (3M Health
Care Limited) was applied to keep the bandage in place and maintain the
pressure for at least 1 week. This graduated pressure bandage has been shown to
produce a mean initial ankle pressure of 42 mmHg which was sustained at a mean
of 37 mmHg at I weeki I.
Follow-up and analysis
The surface area of each ulcer was measured weekly by tracing the perimeter of

all ulceration on the affected leg onto cellophane. This tracing was transferred
Onto card of known weight-to-area ratio and the area calculated after precise
weighing. Bacteriology swabs were taken for culture at fortnightly intervals.
Patients were studied for 12 weeks and the number of ulcers healed in each
group were compared using a chi-squared test with Yates' correction.
Results
The three treatment groups were similar in composition suggesting successful
randomization with a mean age of69 years and a range of 30-92 years. The mean
(± s.e.m.) time since the ulcer was last healed was 26.2 ± 2.6 months, and the
initial ulcer size was 3.4 ± 0.4 em" (Table I).

In the comparison of Granuflex (occlusive) and 'NA' (absorbant and
non-occlusive), rapid healing was achieved in both treatment groups with 22 out
of 30 (73%) on Granuflex and 23 out of 30 (77%) on 'NA' healed completely
Within 12 weeks (Fig. I). During the first 6 weeks the healing rate was a mean of
15.6% per week for 'NA' and 11.4% per week for Granuflex, During the second 6
Weeks when many ulcers were healed and the mean area much smaller, the
healing rate fell to 2.8% per week for 'NA' and 3.7% per week for Granuflex.
These differences were not significant.

tncluded diphtheroids, E. Coli, Proteus and Pseudomonas. In both the Flamazinc
and NA groups bacterial contaminants continued throughout the study, with
only three ulcers at any stage having no bacterial growth. The presence of

organisms did not appear to delay healing, but three patients deteriorated due to
cellulitis (two in the Flamazine group, and one in the NA group) and the
predominant organism in these patients was beta haemolytic Streptococcus,
Lancefield group G. There was no significant difference in the number of
organisms on culture between the two groups either as a whole, or for any
particular organism.
In the comparison of Flamazine and NA rapid healing occurred in both groups
with 19 out of 30 (63%) Flarnazine treated, and 24 out of 30 (78%) NA treated
ulcers healing by the end ofthe 12-week study period (Fig. 2). This difference was
not significant, however, four patients randomized to receive Flamazine (13%)
developed local skin reaction with erythema and pruritis, and treatment with
Flamazine had to be stopped compared to no similar events with 'NA'. Healing
rates were similar with a mean reduction in size per week during the first 6 weeks
of II % for Flamazine and 12.8% for 'NA'. This reduced to 1.7% for Flamazine
and 2.5% for 'NA' during the last 6 weeks.
There was no statistical difference between the healing rates for Flamazine,
Granuflex or NA with a total of88 out of 120 ulcers (73%) healed in 12 weeks.

Do dressings influence Ihe healing ofchronic venous iucersr I""
Discussion
Chronic venous ulcers are reported to be notoriously difficult to heal with
approximately 80% healing over 12 months in centres with a special interesr'",
The results of our study compare favourably as a similar healing rate has been
achieved in only 3 months. Factors involved in delayed healing included infection
and it was therefore disappointing that topical Flamazine did not influence
healing rate. However, in the majority of ulcers, bacterial contamination did not
prevent healing and therefore the relevance of attempting to achieve a
bacteria-free ulcer is questionable. In practice this was not achieved by topical
silver sulphadiazine. Furthermore, healing was delayed due to skin reaction in
four patients on Flamazine. Granuflex also failed to improve the healing rate
achieved with simple NA non-adherent dressings despite the experimental
findings on the effects of occlusive dressings on collagen synthesis and
re-epithelialization3•
There have been no randomized studies on the use of Flamazine in treating
venous ulcers, although it was reported to be useful in II patients't", Granuflex
has been more extensively studied with 43% healing in 12 weeks in one open
study of patients!".
In a randomized study of72 patients to Granuflex or Zincoband bandaging, 13
patients were withdrawn because of an increase in ulcer size and in the remainder
a greater reduction in ulcer size was found in the Granuflex group; but no data on
healing rates were given!", In a further study comparing Granuflex with
compression bandage to zinc oxide paste with similar compression, there was no
difference in healing rate with 47% healed in 12 weeksl 5• These reports underline
the need for well controlled trials in the management of venous ulcers, and also
indicate how little evidence there is that dressings or applications have any
important effects on ulcer healing.
We attribute the improved healing rate in this study to the higher pressures
achieved by the four layer bandaging technique!'. There was no further benefit
derived from either antibacterial applications or occlusive dressings. Simple
cheap non-adherent dressings with weekly cleansing of ulcers is recommended as
adequate compression maintained over the week is all that is required to heal
most venous ulcers.
