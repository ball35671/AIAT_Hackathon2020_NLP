A total of.67 patients with treatment resistant chronic venous ulcers
were admitted to hospital for 6 weeks of bed rest and daily dressings.
The patients came from a rural area in Poland with poor socioeconomic conditions. They were randomized to treatment with either
standard dressings or with cadexomer iodine. After 6 weeks all but
four patients had shown a clear reduction of ulcer area; the mean
reduction was 54% within the former group and 71% with cadexomer
iodine. The latter treatment was significantly more effective than the
standard hospital dressings in debriding the ulcer, accelerating healing
and reducing pain. Elevation of serum concentrations of proteinbound iodine occurred after treatment with cadexomer iodine in
patients with large ulcers, but tests of thyroid function showed no
changes associated with the use of cadexomer iodine. It is concluded
that cadexomer iodine significantly accelerates the healing of chronic,
infected, treatment-resistant, venous ulcers in hospitalized patients.

INTRODUCTION

rupture. Leakage of blood into the tissues
and hypoxia result in dermatitis, inflammation and, eventually, ulceration. Correction
or reduction of these haemodynamic disturbances through the use of compression
bandages or surgery and appropriate treatment ofthe area usually results in healing
of venous ulcers. Certain patients, however, do not respond to this orthodox
method of treatment and their ulcers may
persist for many years. Admission to
hospital for bed rest will often result in
healing of such ulcers. Additional, localized treatment is frequently required,
however, to prevent the formation of
exudates and crusts, and to stop infection
so that epithelial cells can regenerate and
cover the ulcer.
Cadexomer iodine (Iodosorb'") consists
of spherical beads of modified biodegradable starch. These form a three-dimensional lattice which is held together with
covalent bonds and is insoluble in water.
Iodine is trapped within this lattice at a
concentration of 0.9% w/w. The starch has
a considerable affinity for water or body
fluid and can absorb about five times its
own volume oftissue exudate. During this
process, as the starch becomes wet iodine
is released and an iodine concentration
gradient is established between the ulcer
surface and the cadexomer iodine.
Iodide is normally inactivated in a few
minutes by protein. This form, however,
allows slow release of this ion, thus
conferring a prolonged antiseptic action.
The starch gel acts to extract microorganisms and debris from the wound, and
the iodine produces an environment on the
dressing which prevents their culture.
The patients in the present study were
from a rural area with poorer socioeconomic conditions than those of
previously performed studies in the UK and

Sweden. 1-5 The part of Poland where the
present study was executed has a large
population of small farm workers and the
extent to which surgery is performed on
varicose veins of the legs is much less than
in the UK or Sweden. The daily activity of
these farm workers often results in cuts and
abrasions on the legs. Combined with their
relatively dirty working environment, such
as potato fields, severely infected venous
ulcers may occur and these are often
neglected for a long period.
The purpose of the present study was to
evaluate the effect of hospitalizationof such
patients on healing of chronic venous ulcers
which had failed to respond to appropriate
out-patient treatment. This was then to be
assessed by comparison of the standard
treatment regime with treatment using
cadexomer iodine. Since iodine applied to
an open wound is absorbed systemically,
thyroid function was also investigated.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Patients
A total of 67 patients with chronic venous
ulcers which had failed to respond to outpatient treatment using compression
bandages and dressings were recruited for
the study over the course of 1 year. The
duration of ulcers on entry to the trial
ranged from 3 months to more than 30
years. Patients with ulcers having a
diameter of <2 em, a history of iodine
sensitivity, or with evidence of severe
peripheral arterial disease were excluded.
All patients were informed of the purpose
and procedure of the investigationand gave
their written consent to participation. The
project was approved by the local ethics
committee.
Treatment techniques
Patients were randomly allocated to treatment with either cadexomer iodine or the
standard local dressing regime. Cadexomer
iodine was applied once daily in a 3-4 mm
layer. Standard dressing techniques were
429

also applied daily. This consisted of
cleansing with dilute hydrogen peroxide
and covering with a zinc paste dressing.
Additional applications, which included
saline dressings, dilute potassium permanganate and Gentian violet were also used
occasionally if, in the opinion of the trial
physician, they were indicated. In both
treatment groups, a light elastic bandage
was applied to keep the dressing in place.
Patients rested in a hospital bed for the
complete 6 weeks' duration of the trial,
although they were allowed out of bed for
meals and visits to the toilet.
Evaluation techniques
Ulcer size was measured by tracing and
planimetry. They were subjectively
evaluated by the same observer as deep,
superficial, very superficial or healed. The
quantity of pus and debris, exudate and
granulation tissue in the ulcer, surrounding
oedema and erythema were assessed on a
10 em visual analogue scale. A single
observer made all the assessments in every
patient throughout the trial and the
treatment code was not broken until the
study was completed. The ulcers were
assessedat 1, 2, 4 and 6 weeks after the start
of treatment and at each assessment the
ulcers were photographed.
Patients were also asked to assess the
level of pain due to ulceration on a visual
analogue scale. Possible side-effects,
including signs'of iodine hypersensitivity,
were also recorded.
In order to determine the degree of
systemic absorption ofiodine and possible
effects on thyroid function, venous blood
samples were obtained before, 2 weeks
after, and at the end of the 6 weeks'
treatment period. Serum concentrations of
protein-bound iodine, triiodothyronine
(T3) and thyroid stimulating hormone
(TSH) were determined in these samples.
Statistical analyses
The results were analysed statisticallyusing
Student's r-test for comparisons between
groups and the two-tailed Wilcoxon's
signed rank test for matched pairs for
within group comparisons. Statistical
analysis of ulcer depth was carried out
using the l(2-test. Significance was taken as
P<O.05. Means and SEs were calculated
for all measures.

RESULTS
Two patients in each treatment group,
dropped out of the trial before the first
assessment. In three instances this was due
to social reasons and in one case because of
cardiac failure not due to treatment but
necessitating transfer to another hospital.
The remaining 63 patients completed the
trial.
The results obtained from three patients,
Treatment of varicose venous ulcers
all of whom responded to treatment, were
excluded from the analysis; in two patients,
one in each group, ulcer size was so large
that it was very difficult to measure, its area
being more than 10 times greater than the
mean of the remainder. The third patient
had an ulcer associated with severe rheumatoid arthritis which interfered with
assessment.

patients at the start of the trial are shown in
Table 1. There were slightly more females,
greater body weights, larger and deeper
ulcers, and a shorter duration of ulcers in
the group treated with standard dressings
compared with the group treated with
cadexomer iodine. None of these differences was statistically significant.
In both the standard dressing and
cadexomer iodine treatment groups, mean
ulcer area, expressed as a percentage ofthe
area before treatment, was reduced significantly (P<O.OI and P<O.OOI versus baseline, respectively) within 1week of starting
the trial (Fig. 1). After 6 weeks, this
reduction was significantly (P<O.OI)
greater in the group given cadexomer
iodine than in the group given the standard
treatment. All but four patients showed a
reduction of the ulcer area, the mean
reduction being 54 % with standard
dressings and 71%with cadexomer iodine.
In the group treated with standard
dressings, nine out of 16 patients with
ulcers classified as deep before the trial
were still in this category after 6 weeks'
treatment compared with one out of 13 so
classified in the group receiving cadexomer
iodine. This difference was statistically
significant (P<O.05). After 6 weeks of
treatment seven ulcers in the group given
standard treatment were healed or very
superficial compared with 16 in the group
given cadexomer iodine (non-significant
difference). Ulcers which had been present
for more than 1 year tended to heal less
rapidly, but this was not a significant
relationship.
The extent of debris, exudate,
granulation, erythema and oedema
improved in both groups but did so more
rapidly in the group receiving cadexomer
iodine (Fig. 2). After 2 weeks' treatment
the differences between groups were
significant (P<O.05 to P<O.OOI) for all of
these five measures (Fig. 2).
The level of pain due to ulceration was
reduced throughout the trial with both
434
treatments. The effect with cadexomer
iodine was more rapid and, in comparison
to the group treated with standard dressings, significantly (P<O.OI) less pain was
reported within 1 week of commencing
treatment (Fig. 2).
Five patients receiving cadexomer iodine
and one patient on standard treatment
complained of stinging sensations in the
ulcer on application of the dressings. One
other patient on cadexomer iodine during
the trial had erythema around the ulcer for
about 1 week. This disappeared with
continued treatment.
Iodine uptake into the blood occurred
during application of cadexomer iodine in
some patients and, when large ulcers were
treated, this resulted in elevated serum concentrations of protein-bound iodine
(Fig. 3). Serum concentrations of T3 and
TSH did not change during the trial in either
treatment group and remained within
normal physiological limits (Fig. 3). There
were also no substantial changes in these
measures in individual patients.
DISCUSSION
In both cadexomer iodine and standard
dressing treatment groups, hospitalization
resulted in rapid re-epithelializationof most
ulcers. Healing was more effective, however, in patients given cadexomer iodine
than with the standard treatment. Indeed,
a significantly greater reduction in ulcer
area occurred after 6 weeks' treatment.
Subjective assessments, measured using
visual analogue scales, produced a good
immediate visual impression of response to
treatment. This followed healing quite
closely and consistent differences emerged
between the two treatment groups within
the first 2 weeks of treatment. Only minor
variations were evident in the pre-clinical
status of the two groups and these did not
influence the statistical analysis of the
results.
The cadexomer iodine dressing could be
washed off easily with water or saline when
it needed replacement, without disturbing
the delicate newly-formed layer of epithelium ..This property together with the
antibacterial action of the iodine and
absorption of pus, debris and exudateby the
starch component appear to be major contributory factors to the difference in healing
rate observed between the two treatment
groups. This study also showed for the first
time that, although the treatment of very
large ulcers resulted in some iodine
absorption, there was no disturbance of
thyroid function in these patients and no
other significant side-effects occurred.
When treating very large ulcers over longer
periods than in the present study (>6
weeks), it may be of value to monitor the
plasma concentration of protein-bound
iodine.
Very few controlled clinical trials of the
treatment of venous ulcers were published
before cadexomer iodine became
available.v? Studies using cadexomer
iodine have been performed recently on
out-patients in the UK and Sweden. 1-5 All
but one" of these demonstrated that
cadexomer iodine was an improved treatment compared with standard dressings. A
controlled study ofthe effect of cadexomer
iodine in the treatment of bed-sore ulcers
also showed it to have a superior effect over
standard therapy. 8
The present study demonstrated the
superiority of cadexorner iodine compared
with standard treatment in the treatment of
hospitalized patients from a rural area
having poorer socio-economic conditions
Treatment of varicose venous ulcers
than in the other studies mentioned. The
combination of an iodine based disinfectant
with a wide antibacterial spectrum and the
cleansing action of cadexomer iodine
appears to be of value in the treatment of
varicose venous ulcers in these patients.
