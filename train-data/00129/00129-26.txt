Background: The efficacy of honey as a treatment for venous ulcers has not been evaluated, despite
widespread interest. This trial aimed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of honey as a dressing for
venous ulcers.
Methods: This community-based open-label randomized trial allocated people with a venous ulcer to
calcium alginate dressings impregnated with manuka honey or usual care. All participants received
compression bandaging. The primary outcome was the proportion of ulcers healed after 12 weeks.
Secondary outcomes were: time to healing, change in ulcer area, incidence of infection, costs per healed
ulcer, adverse events and quality of life. Analysis was by intention to treat.
Results: Of 368 participants, 187 were randomized to honey and 181 to usual care. At 12 weeks, 104
ulcers (55·6 per cent) in the honey-treated group and 90 (49·7 per cent) in the usual care group had
healed (absolute increase 5·9 (95 per cent confidence interval (c.i.) −4·3 to 15·7) per cent; P = 0·258).
Treatment with honey was probably more expensive and associated with more adverse events (relative
risk 1·3 (95 per cent c.i. 1·1 to 1·6); P = 0·013). There were no significant differences between the
groups for other outcomes.
Conclusion: Honey-impregnated dressings did not significantly improve venous ulcer healing at 12 weeks
compared with usual care. Registration number: ISRCTN 06161544 (http://www.controlled-trials.com).

Introduction
Leg ulcers are defects in the epidermis, below the knee,
which are present for more than 4–6 weeks1. Typically,
leg ulceration is a chronic, relapsing condition; venous
insufficiency is the most common cause, accounting for
most leg ulcers2,3.
The standard treatment of venous ulcers is compression
of the lower leg by tight bandaging or hosiery to reduce
hydrostatic pressure in the leg4. This treatment has been
known since the 17th century, and few other adjuvant
treatments have been found to be effective5,6. Lack of
evidence for other treatment options has not stopped both
patients and health workers advocating a cornucopia of
interventions; one currently gaining popularity is honey.
Honey has been used in wound healing for thousands of
years, with the first record of it in the Edwin Smith papyrus
(2600–2200 BCE)7. Interest is undergoing a revival8, with
an eightfold growth in the number of studies, reports and
letters on the therapeutic potential of honey for treating
wounds in the past decade. In vitro and animal studies
indicate that honey has antibacterial properties, stimulates
cytokine release and may stimulate cell growth, thereby
facilitating wound healing9. Animal model evidence and
case reports on chronic wounds suggest honey has a
beneficial effect, but they do not offer reliable evidence
on which to base treatment decisions.
A systematic review found seven randomized trials of
honey in wound care, six of which were in patients with
moderate burns10. The review could not assess whether
honey was beneficial in wound healing, largely because of
the poor quality of the reports. In addition, findings from
acute wounds may not usefully be extrapolated to chronic
wounds11.

Given the lack of trial information to guide decisions
on the use of honey for treating venous ulcers, the
increasing use of honey by patients and practitioners, and
the evidence from in vitro and animal studies suggesting
plausible mechanisms of action, the Honey as Adjuvant Leg
Ulcer Therapy (HALT) trial was undertaken to evaluate
the effectiveness of honey in the management of venous
leg ulcers.
Methods
This open-label, multicentre randomized controlled trial
was conducted between May 2004 and September 2005.
Patients were eligible if they were 18 years or older,
had been diagnosed with venous ulceration (clinical
presentation and ankle : brachial pressure index greater
than 0·8) or mixed venous and arterial ulceration (clinical
presentation and ankle : brachial pressure index greater
than 0·7), were able to tolerate compression and were
able to give informed consent. Patients were excluded
if they had a history of diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis
or peripheral arterial disease, had an allergy to calcium
alginate or manuka honey, or were already using honey to
treat their leg ulcer. Participants were recruited from four
community-based district nursing services in the Auckland,
South Auckland, Waikato and Christchurch regions of
New Zealand. The study was approved by the Northern
Regional Health and Disability Ethics Committee.
Randomization
Eligibility was assessed and consent obtained by the study
research nurses. Participants were randomly assigned to
one of two groups by an independent central telephone
service. The allocation sequence was stratified by study
centre and the Margolis index12 using minimization. The
Margolis index is a prognostic score for venous ulcer
healing derived from dichotomous categorizations of ulcer
area and duration of the current ulcer (Table 1). Where
more than one leg ulcer was present, the largest ulcer was
used as the reference ulcer and all ulcers were treated with
the allocated treatment.
Interventions
Participants in the treatment group received manuka honey
dressings (ApiNateTM UMF 12+; Comvita New Zealand,
Te Puke, New Zealand) that were changed each time
the compression bandaging was changed, with frequency
determined by clinical need. All the honey was from the
same batch, and it was impregnated into calcium alginate
dressings. Participants in the usual care group received
dressings that the district nurse deemed appropriate at the
time of each visit. The dressing choices reflected the normal
range of choices available to nursing services at each study
centre (alginate, hydrofibre, hydrocolloid, foam, hydrogel,
non-adherent, iodine or silver dressings).
All participants received compression bandaging as
standard background therapy. The range of compression
bandaging reflected what was normally available in the
study centres, with the choice determined by participant
or district nurse preference.
Outcome measures
The primary outcome measure was the proportion of
participants with a completely healed reference ulcer
at 12 weeks, as determined by the research nurse. The
research nurse was not blind to allocation. Healing was
defined as complete epithelialization of the ulcer with
no scab. Secondary outcome measures included time
to healing (determined from forms returned weekly by
the district nurse), change in ulcer area from baseline
(calculated by a blinded reviewer from a digital photograph
obtained at baseline and at 12 weeks by the research
nurse)13, incidence of clinically determined infection
(defined as the presence of signs and symptoms of infection
or a wound swab being obtained, and treatment with
antibiotics), adverse events, health-related quality of life
(HRQoL) and cost effectiveness. HRQoL was measured
at 12 weeks using the Short Form 36 health survey (SF36)
14, the Charing Cross Venous Ulcer Questionnaire
(CXVUQ)15 and the EuroQol 5D (EQ-5D)16. A health
services perspective was used for determining cost
effectiveness.
Statistical analysis
A sample size of 360 people was calculated as necessary
to detect a 30 per cent relative increase (relative risk (RR)
1·30) in the proportion of healed ulcers in the intervention
group at 12 weeks, with 90 per cent power and an α of
5 per cent. The sample size was inflated to 400 to allow
for 10 per cent loss to follow-up. The relative increase
equated to an absolute increase in healed ulcers from 55 to
approximately 71 per cent at 12 weeks, a benefit that had
been suggested by the most conservative of the honey for
burns trials17.
All statistical analyses were specified a priori and were
two-tailed; P < 0·050 was considered significant.
The primary analysis was by intention to treat, with
all participants included, and participants lost to followup deemed treatment failures. Adjusted analyses were

conducted using logistic regression for dichotomous
outcomes or linear regression for continuous outcomes.
Correlations between co-variates were checked to prevent
highly correlated variables being included in the adjusted
models.
Three sensitivity analyses for the primary outcome were
specified a priori. First, healing state identified by blinded
review was used to test whether the level of agreement
between the research nurses and a blinded reviewer had
an impact on the outcome. Second, the last healing state
reported by the district nurse was carried forward to test
the assumption that participants lost to follow-up were
treatment failures. Third, crossovers between treatment
groups and loss to follow-up were excluded to test the
effect of participant withdrawals from treatment.
Time to healing was analysed using Kaplan–Meier
curves, the log rank test and Cox proportional hazards
regression analysis. The assumption of proportionality for
each co-variate was reviewed using formal testing and
visual assessment of scaled Schoenfeld residuals plots.
Change in ulcer area was analysed using linear regression.
Incidence of infection was compared using Fisher’s exact
test for comparison of episodes between groups. Quality
of life scores were compared using the Student’s t test and
adjusted for baseline imbalance using linear regression. RRs
and 95 per cent confidence intervals (c.i.) were calculated
for adverse events. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio
(ICER), the ratio of the difference in the mean total costs
and the difference in proportion healed in each group were
calculated by the standard method18.
Results
Recruitment achieved 92·0 per cent of the planned target.
Of 392 people approached, 368 agreed to be randomized to
honey or usual care (Fig. 1). The baseline characteristics of
those randomized did not differ from those of patients
registered but not eligible. Baseline data were similar
for both study groups. Ulcer area and duration were
highly correlated with the Margolis index (results for

the Margolis index was retained in adjusted analyses.
Loss to follow-up was similar between the two groups,
although withdrawal from the study differed significantly
(31 participants in the honey-treated group compared
with none in the usual care group). In almost twothirds of those withdrawing (20 of 31), it was because
of problems at the ulcer site, including pain, infection,
bleeding and wound deterioration. The other main reason
was practitioner or patient choice, although details were
not recorded. All participants who withdrew were followed
up at 12 weeks.
Complete healing at 12 weeks
At 12 weeks, 104 ulcers (55·6 per cent) in the honey-treated
group had healed compared with 90 (49·7 per cent) in the
usual care group, giving a 5·9 (95 per cent c.i. −4·3 to
15·7) per cent absolute increase in healing at 12 weeks
with honey (P = 0·258). The findings were similar when
adjusted for stratification factors (study centre, Margolis
index) and in the sensitivity analyses.
Time to healing
Mean time to healing was 63·5 days in the honeytreated group and 65·3 days in the usual care group
(mean difference −1·8 (95 per cent c.i. −7·7 to 4·1) days,
P = 0·553). Time to healing (hazard ratio 1·1 (95 per cent
c.i. 0·8 to 1·5); P = 0·451) did not change when adjusted
for stratification factors (Fig. 2).
Change in ulcer area
There was no significant difference between the treatment
groups for percentage change in ulcer area from baseline.
The mean reduction from baseline ulcer area was
74·1 per cent in the honey-treated group and 65·5 per cent
in the usual care group, giving a mean difference in
percentage reduction of ulcer area between the groups
of 8·6 (95 per cent c.i. 23·9 to −4·7) per cent; P = 0·186).
The findings were similar when adjusted for stratification
factors.

Incidence of clinically determined infection
In the honey-treated group, 32 participants (17·1 per cent)
had episodes of infection compared with 40 (22·1 per cent)
in the usual care group. The difference was not significant
(absolute decrease 5·0 (95 per cent c.i. −3·1 to 13·1) per
cent; P = 0·228). The difference in the number of episodes
of infection between the two groups was also not significant
(37 versus 49 respectively; P = 0·449).
Adverse events
In the honey-treated group, 111 participants reported one
or more adverse events compared with 84 in the usual care
group (RR 1·3 (95 per cent c.i. 1·1 to 1·6); P = 0·013).
There were significantly more reports of ulcer pain in the
honey-treated group (Table 2), although pain intensity was
not recorded.
Health-related quality of life
At 12 weeks, 360 participants (97·8 per cent) completed all
three HRQoL questionnaires (186 in the honey-treated
group and 174 in the usual care group). There were no
significant differences between the groups in the summary
component scores for the SF-36, the overall scores for
the CXVUQ, or the visual analogue scores for the EQ-5D
(Table 3).
Cost effectiveness
The ICER was (in New Zealand dollars) −$9·45
(95 per cent c.i. −$39·63 to $16·07) in favour of honey
when all costs were considered (Table 4). This finding
was driven by the difference in hospitalization rates for a
very small number of participants (three were hospitalized

Discussion
In this trial, honey-impregnated dressings did not improve
venous ulcer healing at 12 weeks. They were sometimes
painful and probably more expensive. Furthermore, these
dressings did not significantly improve time to healing,
change in ulcer area, incidence of infection or quality of life.
A large number of adverse events were observed, as
participating centres were required to report any untoward
event, whether considered related to the treatment or not.
Significantly more events were reported in the honeytreated group, as would be expected in an open-label trial.
Pain is a known side-effect of using honey; 35 per cent
of patients in the largest case series reported transient
or continuous pain associated with honey19. The pain is
reportedly due to the acidity of honey20. In the HALT
trial, 25 per cent of the honey-treated group reported one
or more episodes of pain as an adverse event, but only
four participants gave pain as the reason for withdrawing
from treatment, suggesting that the pain was short-lived
or tolerable. Any further trials of honey in wounds
should record detailed information on ulcer pain, including
intensity and duration.
The HALT trial had a number of strengths. To date,
it remains the only one to have investigated the effect
of honey on venous leg ulcer healing as the primary
outcome. Healing is a hard outcome of direct relevance
to patients and clinicians. Participants were randomly
allocated, and balanced for key prognostic indicators
ensured by minimization. Allocation was concealed up
to the point of randomization by using a central telephone
service. Intention-to-treat analysis was undertaken with the
inclusion of all participants randomized, and follow-up was
virtually complete, with less than 2 per cent of participants
lost. With almost 400 people recruited, this study had the

power to conclude that honey did not have a large enough
effect for the authors to consider it clinically relevant.
Some may argue that the trial should have been powered
to detect a more modest difference, but at the time of
designing the study the most conservative estimate from
previous honey for wound trials suggested a 16 per cent
absolute difference was plausible. Furthermore, powering
the study for a smaller difference would have required a
much larger sample size (for a 10 per cent difference, a
sample size of 1030 would have been necessary).
There were, however, some limitations. First, the
trial recruited fewer participants than anticipated, despite
extending the recruitment period. It did recruit enough
participants to retain 90 per cent power, as the anticipated
loss to follow-up did not occur. Second, funding limitations
precluded longer follow-up. Although the 12-week
outcome has been standard in previous trials5,21 – 24, longer
follow-up would have been ideal to assess the possibility
of a delayed effect. Third, outcome assessment could not
be blinded as honey stains wound margins and leaves an
odour. However, re-analysis of the primary outcome using
healing state determined from blinded review of ulcer
photographs did not affect the study findings.
A usual care comparison was the most pragmatic trial
design. A calcium alginate control was considered, but
alginate dressings are absorptive and adhere to the wound
bed, producing less exudate. Ulcer size could therefore
be influenced by the removal of adherent dressings. It is
possible that a treatment effect may have been diluted by
allowing a range of dressings in the control comparison.
However, such an effect appears unlikely, as three
systematic reviews have found little evidence to support
the view that dressings have an impact on venous leg ulcer
healing25 – 27. Similarly, a Cochrane review of compression
systems did not find one type of multilayer system to
be more effective than any other23. In the HALT trial,
95 per cent of participants had multilayer compression,
with balance between the remainder with respect to type
of compression. Compliance with compression was also
similar across both groups.
Honey-impregnated dressings are a moist wound
dressing marketed without specific indication and therefore
were used to treat all venous ulcers in this trial, irrespective
of clinical presentation. The results should therefore be
considered as generalizable to all venous ulcers, regardless
of wound bed appearance, until further evidence suggests
otherwise. Similarly, the results should be considered as
applying to all types of honey. The effect of different
honeys on healing has not been compared in vivo in either
the animal or the human model. However, the activity of
jelly bush honey, manuka honey and New Zealand pasture
honey on cytokine expression has been compared with that
of artificial honey28. Although jelly bush honey did produce
significantly greater cytokine expression, all three honeys
increased tumour necrosis factor (TNF) α, interleukin (IL)
1β and IL-6 expression compared with artificial honey.
The results of this trial conflict with the generally
positive results of previous trials. This discrepancy is
possibly due to publication bias. Of 18 trials identified in a
systematic review, 13 reported findings in favour of honey,
despite having small sample sizes. A funnel plot found no
positive and few negative studies scattered around the base
of the funnel when chance effects should have produced
such results in underpowered trials. Another possible
explanation is that almost three-quarters of previous trials
have focused on the use of honey for acute wounds, in
particular burns. Although the cytokines TNF-α and IL1β are necessary for the inflammatory response, levels are
significantly increased in chronic wounds29, with greater
levels in non-healing venous ulcers compared to healing
venous ulcers30,31. These cytokines cause imbalance in
favour of the proteinases normally responsible for tissue
degradation29. Manuka honey has been found to increase
TNF-α and IL-1β expression in cell lines28,32, and it is
possible that this feature of manuka honey could delay
healing in venous ulceration where the cytokines are
already overexpressed.
There was no additional benefit from using honeyimpregnated dressings for venous ulceration. The focus
of venous ulcer management should remain on high
compression and treatments that have demonstrated
efficacy as adjuvants to compression.

This trial was principally funded by a grant from the
Health Research Council of New Zealand. Comvita New
Zealand provided a small unconditional grant and supplied
the honey dressings. USL Medical provided the wound
tracing grids. The sponsors had no role in the collection
or interpretation of data, or the decision to submit for
publication. P. Molan also received some funding from
Comvita New Zealand.
This trial received support from the HALT collaborative
