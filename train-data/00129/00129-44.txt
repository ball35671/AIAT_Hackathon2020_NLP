Preface
There is an irony in the fact that a class of antimicrobial agents that was considered to be
of minor therapeutic use has suddenly the potential to become an important part in
chemotherapy. The first member of the quinolone family, nalidixic acid, although active
against a number of urinary tract pathogens, frequently failed in the treatment of urinary
tract infections either because of development of bacterial resistance or because of
superinfection with intrinsically resistant species such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococci, or enterococci. Newer quinolones-norfloxacin, enoxacin, ofloxacin, pefloxacin
and ciprofloxacin-have now been introduced in clinical medicine and offer several
advantages over the older quinolones.
In these proceedings, the antibacterial spectrum of ciprotloxacin and the in vitro activity
data from Scandinavia are presented as are the pharmacokinetics of ciprofloxacin. Laboratory and animal model studies with ciprofloxacin have shown that the agent has an impact
on different cell-types including lymphocytes, monocytes and granulocytes. Ciprofloxacin
has been proven effective in a variety of infections due to susceptible microorganisms. Its
most attractive features are its efficacy in infections due to multi-resistant bacteria
(especially many enterobacteria and nonfermentative Gram-negative rods) and its effectiveness in many clinical situations where only more toxic drugs (aminoglycosides) or
exclusively parenteral alternatives (expanded-spectrum penicillins and cephalosporins)
exist. The initial use of ciprofloxacin is likely to be greatest in urinary tract infections,
gonorrhea, and osteomyelitis. Use in the respiratory tract and in the skin and soft tissues
should probably be limited to infections caused by multi-resistant microorganisms or to
situations where equally effective, safe alternatives are not an option. The adverse effects
reported so far are few and mild.
The major limitations of ciprofloxacin are lack of activity against anaerobes and some
nonfermentative Gram-negative rods and marginal activity against Gram-positive cocci,
and some strains of P. aeruginosa.
Potential uses of ciprofloxacin include treatment of (I) carriage of salmonella and
meningococci; (2) nongonococcal urethritis; (3) diarrheal diseases; (4) prostatitis; and (5)
infections due to chlamydia. In addition, the drug appears effective in selective decontamination of the intestinal tract.
This supplement has provided an overview of the setting and the manner in which
ciprofloxacin should be used in the coming decade. In an era of cost-awareness in
medicine, ciprofloxacin will be an important means to reduce the length of hospitalization
for infection and will provide a means to manage more difficult-to-treat infections in the
outpatient setting.

Antibiotic Consumption in Sweden 1975 to 1987:
Changes in Prescription Patterns
S. RAGNAR NORRByl and HANS JOHANSSON2
'Departmem ofInfectious Diseases. University ofLund. Lund, Sweden and
2Apoteksbolaget AB. Stockholm. Sweden
The antibiotic consumption in Sweden was evaluated during the period 1975 to 1987.
Consumption was measured in terms of defined daily doses (DDDs), that is, the normally
prescribed daily adult doses. During the study period the total consumption varied between
49 and 51 million DDD, indicating a considerable over-use of antibiotics in Sweden. In the
various groups of antibiotics, considerable ftuctuations were seen. The cephalosporin use
increased from 477000 DDDs 1975 to 1795000 DDDs in 1987, which can be explained by an
increased use of cefaclor for treatment of respiratory tract infections and by the fact that
cefuroxime is tbe dominant injectable antibiotic in Sweden. Markedly increased usage during
the study period was also seen for erythromycin and penicillinase resistant penicillins. There
were no obvious medical reasons for those increases. Among the folate inhibitors, sulphonamide usage has been almost completely abandoned during the period and the sulphonamides
haw been replaced by pivmecillinam, trimethoprim and, lately, norftoxacin for the treatment
of urinary tract infections. Reduced usage was also seen for sulphonamide/trimethoprim
combinations, probably due to an increased awareness of the risk for side effects to these
antibiotics. During the entire period the use of tetracyclines, and especially doxycycline, was
extenshe-elmost 10 million DDDs in 1987. The reason for that remains unclear but there are
reasons to assume that these antibiotics are prescribed too frequently.

INTRODUCTION
There are several reasons why antibiotic prescription patterns and total antibiotic consumption change; new drugs are licensed, older antibiotics lose their usefulness due to
emergence of resistance, adverse reaction reports lead to decreased usage etc. It is also
important to note that, contrary to many other groups of drugs, antibiotics are in most
patients used for short-term treatment. The prescribing physician is also likely to chose a
new antibiotic in a patient with a recurrent infection even if the initially used drug was
effective. Other factors affecting the choice of antibiotics are an increasing price consciousness among physicians and hospital administrators as well as marketing activities by
the pharmaceutical industry.
The present investigation was undertaken to analyse the antibiotic consumption in
Sweden during 12 consecutive years and to relate fluctuations in that consumption to
factors which could affect the prescription pattern.
METHODS
The Swedish statistics for antibacterial drugs for systemic use (oral. rectal or parenteral) were made
available by Apoteksbolaget AB, Stockholm, Sweden. In these statistics, consumption is expressed
as defined daily doses (ODDs), one DOD being the normal adult daily dose as decided when a product
is licensed for use in a Scandinavian country. For some antibiotics, additional statistical sources were
used to define indications for prescription of oral antibiotics to out-patients.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Table I lists the antibiotic consumption for the years 1975, 1982 and 1987 as well as the
amount of each antibiotic defining a DDD. Since the DDDs are normally not changed with
time, even if the prescribed doses change, the number of DDDs used does not always
adequately reflect the number of patients treated. Antibiotics for which there are major
discrepancies between the DDD and the normally used dose are listed in Table II.
Benzylpenicillin doses have gradually increased during the 1970s and the 1980s. Few
physicians use less than 6 g a day and most give 9 g a day. This means that the 718000
DDDs in 1987correspond to about 160000 days of treatment. Assuming a mean treatment
time of seven days, about 23000 patients would have been treated. Cefuroxime was
introduced at a relatively low daily dose; 0.75 g t.i.d. but in 198685% of all packages sold
were 1.5 g ones. The cloxacillin DDD of 2 g represents the normal oral dose. However,
since the introduction of the better absorbed derivatives, dicloxacillin and flucloxacillin,
only 3% of the consumption of oral penicillinase resistant penicillins are cloxacillin and
almost 90% of the parenteral cloxacillin units sold were 2 g ones in 1986.Thus, the normal
daily dose is at least 6 g since cloxacillin is administered three or four times daily. With the
above exceptions, the DDDs seem to be surprisingly close to the doses actually prescribed.
The total antibiotic consumption has changed little over the study period. Relating it to
the population size in Sweden, eight millions, the annual consumption per capita has
varied between 6.0 and 6.4 DDDs per person. Taking into account that DDDs always are
adult doses and that approximately 12% of the population are children who receive lower
doses, a mean of more than seven days of antibiotic treatment is given to every inhabitant
per year. It seems unlikely that bacterial infections which require the use of systemic
antibiotics are that common. Therefore, it must be assumed that there is a considerable
over-use of antibiotics in Sweden. In comparison to other Scandinavian countries, which
all use the same DDD definitions as Sweden, the antibiotic consumption (excluding
tuberculostatics) was higher in Sweden 1986 with 18.2 DDD/l 000 inhabitants/day than in
Norway and Denmark with 13.5 and 11.5 DDD/1 000 inhabitants/day, respectively (Nordic
Statistics on Medicine, 1988). In Finland and Iceland, on the other hand, the antibiotic
consumption was higher than in Sweden with 20.1 (statistical data for 1985) and 24.8
DDD/l 000 inhabitants/day, respectively.
Looking at the individual groups of antibiotics, the aminoglycoside consumption was
constant during the study period (Table I). However, recommendations were issued in the
beginning ofthe 1980s to increase the doses of gentamicin, netilmicin and tobramycin from
1mg/kg/dose to 1.5 mg/kg/dose in patients with normal renal function. This was done when
it became obvious that most patients receiving doses of 1 mg/kg only rarely reached
therapeutic serum levels (1). Thus, there has in reality been a considerable reduction of the
number of patients treated with aminoglycosides during the study period. Within the
aminoglycoside group, streptomycin has been taken off the market and is now available
only on a special license. Due to a favourable situation with regard to aminoglycoside
resistance in Sweden, amikacin is used only in few patients and the market is dominated
b)l gentamicin, netilmicin and tobramycin.
The use of oral cephalosporins has increased markedly between 1982and 1987(Table I).
That is almost entirely due to more frequent prescriptions of cefaclor to children with otitis
media. The reasons for chosing cefaclor instead of an aminopenicillin seem to be partly the
improved activity of cefaclor against Haemophilus influenzae and partly the fact that the
cefaclor mixture has a taste which is accepted by most children. Parents tend to ask for
cefaclor prescriptions since they found it easy to administer to their children. Since DDDs

Antibiotic use in Sweden 1975 to 1987 11
are given as adult doses, a total of about one million paediatric doses of cefaclor is used
every year.
Among the parenteral cephalosporins, cefuroxime dominates with more than 400000
DDDs per year corresponding to about 220000 adult doses if corrected for a too low DDD
(Tables I and II). The two other ,8-lactamase resistant cephalosporins, cefotaxime and
ceftazidime, are looked upon by many physicians as antibiotics which should be reserved
for patients with hospital acquired infections. The increasing use of cefuroxime has been
paralelled by a decreased in the use of parenteral ampicillin (parenteral amoxicillin is not
licensed in Sweden). Contrary to what could have been expected, there has been no
increase of the frequency of Gram-negative bacterial isolates resistant to cefuroxime but
rather a marked decrease which has been explained by the decreasing use of ampicillin (2).
Of ,8-lactams with activity both against Gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes, cefoxitin
reached a wide-spread use during its first years on the market and imipenem/cilastatin,
which was licensed in Sweden in the end of 1985, has been used restrictively and mainly in
intensive care and infectious diseases units during the first two years on the market. The
reason for the decline of cefoxitin use seems to be the introduction of metronidazole for
treatment of anaerobic infections. More than 60000 DDDs per year of parenteral nitroimidazole derivatives have been consumed since 1982. The most common combination of
antibiotics in patients with mixed aerobic and anaerobic infections, such as abdominal and
deep gynaecological infections, has been cefuroxime plus metronidazole.
Contrary to many other countries the Swedish use of folate inhibitors has decreased
drastically. This is due mainly to widely publised reports on adverse reactions; first to
sulphonamides and later to co-trimoxazole. In fact, we found that 13% of women who
were asked to participate in a comparative trial in which the control was co-trimoxazole,
claimed that they were hypersensitive to sulphonamides (3). Other factors contributing to
the decreased use of these drugs were reports on increasing frequencies of sulphonamide
resistant Enterobacteriaceae in urine isolates and the introduction of pivmecillinam for
treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections. However, even with these factors in
mind, the use of antibiotics intended for treatment of urinary tract infections has declined
with more than 50 % during the study period since the nitrofurantoin consumption has
been reduced with more than 90%. This is due to decreased treatment times in patients
with uncomplicated infections, to reduction of doses of nitrofurantoin and to a changed
attitude towards prophylactic use of antibiotics for prevention of bacteriuria. Such prophylactic use is today rare in Sweden and is employed mainly in patients scheduled for
urological surgery and in a small number of females with frequently recurring infections.
During the study period, main changes ofthe choice of antibiotics for treatment of urinary
tract infections have occured. Sulphonamides and nitrofurantoin were replaced first by
trimethoprim/sulphonamide combinations and subsequently by trimethoprim plain and
pivmecillinam. A tendency towards a rapidly increasing use of norfloxacin, the first
licensed fluorinated 4-quinolone derivative can be seen in the statistics for 1987 which
covers its first full year on the market. Statistics on the second fluoro-quinolone to be
registered in Sweden, ciprofloxacin, are not yet available since registration was granted
during 1988.
Among the oral penicillins, phenoxymethylpenicillin dominates while the consumption
of ampicillin, ampicillin esters and amoxycillin is lower than in most other countries. This
is due to a tradition in Sweden to use phenoxymethylpenicillin as the drug of choice for
treatment of streptococcal upper respiratory tract infections, acute otitis media and acute
sinusitis. In 1984, a survey of prescriptions for phenoxymethylpenicillin showed that 24%
of the prescriptions were for otitis media, 23% for acute tonsillitis, 12% for acute sinusitis,
7% for non-specified upper respiratory tract infections, 4 % for bronchitis and 2% each for

than 2% per diagnosis (4). The only antibiotics which seem to be used as an alternative to
phenoxymethylpenicillin in patients with upper respiratory tract infections are erythromycin, the consumption of which has increased markedly over the study period, and tetracyclines (see below). However, it is important to notice that the prescriptions surveys by
necessity are performed as open studies in which the physicians know that they are being

Table I demonstrates a dramatic decrease of the use of tuberculostatic drugs between
1975 and 1987. This is mainly the result of a decreasing incidence of tuberculosis and also
of the trend towards shortened treatment times in patients with that infection. Of the
tuberculostatic drugs, streptomycin and cyclosporin have been abandoned and in 1987the
three dominating agents were isoniazide, ethambutol and rifampicin. The use of rifampicin
on indication other than tuberculosis is still very limited in Sweden. However, an increasing use of rifampicin in patients with infections caused by multi-resistant staphylococci,
mainly Staphylococcus epidermidis has been seen during the later part of the 1980ies.
The Swedish consumption of tetracycline derivatives especially doxycycline, is very
high. According to an annual survey of prescriptions to out-patients in which the physicians are required to give a diagnosis on each prescription, the main indications for
tetracyclines are bronchitis, acute sinusitis, genital infections in females, acne, urethritis
and prostatitis with 19%, 11%, 7%, 6 %, 5 % and 4%, respectively, of the prescriptions
(4). This leaves about half of the prescriptions unaccounted for and it seems that many
physicians prescribe tetracyclines for upper respiratory tract infections. Ifthe tetracycline
consumption in Sweden, 3.1 DDD/looo inhabitants/day in 1986, is compared to those in
other Scandinavian countries, it was even higher in Norway, Finland and Iceland with 4.0,
5.7 and 5.9 DDD/looo inhabitants/day, respectively while Denmark had a very much
lower use with 1.3 DDD/looo inhabitants/day.
CONCLUSIONS
Statistics of this type are difficult to interpret but have a great value in that they offer
possibilities to compare the consumption of individual antibiotics from year to year. It
then becomes possible to get indications of markedly increased or decreased sales of a
specific antibiotic. Such trends could be the result of either reports on resistance or
adverse reactions or effects of marketing activities by the pharmaceutical industry. The
data can also be used for education purposes; most physicians realize, for example, that
the Swedish use of tetracyclines comes close to abuse. Finally, the data are useful for
relating effects of increased or decreased consumption on the resistance pattern of clinical
isolates.

Overview of Scandinavian in Vitro Studies
with Ciprofloxacin
ARNE FORSGREN

Hospital. Malmo. Sweden
Scandinavian studies have confirmed that ciproDoxacin is highly active against most Gramnegative bacterial species with extremely low minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC-vaIues)
except for Pseudomonas aeruglnosa. The antibacterial activity is approximately four times
higher than that of norDoxacin. Gram-positive cocci are less sensitive with MIC-vaIues of 0.5
to 1 mglI. For pneumococci the ciproDoxacin concentration inhibiting 90 % of clinical isolates
(MIC90) is approximately 2 mglI. The antibacterial activity of ciproDoxacin is influenced very
little by an increased inoculum and culture conditions. However, urine reduces the antibacterial activity. Resistance to ciproDoxacin occurs extremely rarely among E. coli, but development of resistance among species like P. aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus may be more
frequent. CiproDoxacin is a bactericidal antibiotic but killing of staphylococci was poor when
studied kinetically. CiproDoxacin plus piperacillin act synergistically against strains of P.
aeruginosa. CiproDoxacin has a post-antibiotic effect (PAE) of approximately 2 h against both
Gram-negative rods and Gram-positive cocci.

INTRODUCTION
Nalidixic acid and cinoxacin have been available for many years and is primarily used in
the treatment of urinary tract infections caused by Gram-negative enteric bacilli 0, 2).
Recently a new group of fluorinated quinolone derivatives structurally related to nalidixic
has been developed. The potency of the new quinolone derivatives is much greater than
that of the predecessor nalidixic acid. They are effective against a wider range of bacteria-even against such bacteria as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Gram-positive cocci
which are considered resistant to nalidixic acid. Among the new fluorinated quinolones
ciprofloxacin has been recorded to be the most effective drug against several bacterial
species (3, 4).
The purpose of this report is to present an over-view of Scandinavian studies on the
antibacterial effect of ciprofloxacin.
MINIMAL INHIBITORY CONCENTRATIONS (MIC)
The antibacterial spectrum of ciprofloxacin is presented as MICso and MIClJ(), which is the
drug concentration inhibiting 50 and 90% of clinical isolates tested respectively (5-12).
Table I demonstrates MIC-values for ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin against Gram-negative
rods. As can be seen the activity of ciprofloxacin is approximately four times higher than
that of norfloxacin (5, 6). The highest MIC90-value was against Pseudomonas aeruginosa,
approximately 1 mg/l.
MIC-values for enteropathogenic bacteria are generally very low (7) (Table II). Campylobacter and Yersinia which were not included in Dr Bergan's study also have low MICvalues (13).

In vitro activity 17
Table III shows the antibacterial effect of ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin against Grampositive cocci. The values are considerably higher than for the Gram-negative rods.
Clinical isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae which was not included in any of the
Scandinavian studies have even higher MIC-values. The MIC90 for pneumococci has been
reported to be approximately 2 mg/l. The MIC90 for Listeria monocytogenes is approximately 0.5 mg/l (13).
In contrast to the intermediate effect of ciprofloxacin against Gram-positive respiratory
tract pathogens the effect against Gram-negative respiratory tract pathogens is excellent
(8-10) (Table IV).
The marked susceptibility of Neisseria gonorrhoeae including penicillin resistant strains
(whether they produce penicillinase or not) and tetracycline resistant strains renders
ciprofloxacin a promising alternative in the treatment of gonorrhoea (Table V) (11).
However, the effect against Chlamydia trachomatis is less obvious with a MIC90-value of
1-2 mg/l (13).

The effect of ciprofloxacin against anaerobes is very limited (Table VI). For the two
important species Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium difficile MIC90-values of 16 mg/l
have been reported (6, 8, 12).
INFLUENCE OF TEST CONDITIONS ON ANTIBACTERIAL ACTIVITY
Ciprofloxacin is very stable under normal laboratory conditions and experimental results
obtained in different laboratories are usually very similar for ciprofloxacin. The MICvalues presented above is a summary of 8 studies in which overnight bacterial cultures
were studied by an agar dilution technique (5-12). The inocula were 5x 103_105 bacteria.

In vitro activity 19
The media used were IsoSensitest Agar, Muller-Hinton Agar, Paper Disc Medium
(PDM)+5% horse blood and GC Medium Base with haemoglobin and IsoVitalex. When
the same species were tested on different media in different laboratories almost identical
results were obtained.
Several in vitro studies show that the effect of inoculum size is very small. When the
number of bacteria is increased 10-or 100-fold there is only a small increase in MIC-values
(6). However, the effect of ciprofloxacin is reduced in urine. This is because acidic
conditions and cations such as Mg++ antagonize 4-quinolones including ciprofloxacin (14).
DEVELOPMENT OF RESISTANCE
Resistance to the new 4-quinolones has been reported extremely rarely for clinical isolates
of E. coli (15, 16). The modem 4-quinolones are so potent that their achievable serum
levels easily exceed the MIC-values of mutants of E. coli. However, nalidixic acid
resistant mutants of E. coli may develop resistance also to ciprofloxacin (17).
In contrast ciprofloxacin resistance during treatment of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and
Staphylococcus aureus infections was reported early (18, 19). Development of resistance
to ciprofloxacin among those species have been quite elegantly studied in Odense,
Denmark (20, 21). When eight clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa were investigated four
strains were homogenously sensitive while mutants at different levels and frequencies
could be detected for the four other strains. Repeated population analysis of these four
showed that bacteria harvested from the agar plate with the highest ciprofloxacin concentration were 8--16 times more resistant than the parenteral strain. By repeating this

procedure (selection from the plate with the highest ciprofloxacin concentrations) 3 times a
P. aeruginosa strain resistant to 362 mg/l of ciprofloxacin was selected. Also for S. aureus
and S. epidermidis the selected strains had 4 to 8-fold higher MIC-values than the
parenteral strains (Table VII).
BACTERICIDAL EFFECT AND SYNERGY
Ciprofloxacin is a bactericidal antibiotic. Usually the minimal bactericidal concentrations
(MBCs) are equal to the MICs or 2- to 4-fold higher. However, some Gram-positive cocci
like Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis might be exceptions from this rule (22).
When killing kinetic studies were done with inocula of approximately 106 cfu/ml and
various ciprofloxacin concentrations the killing effect was low (less than 3 10glO in 6 h) and
regrowth was seen after 24 h in at least one S. aureus strain. After 48 h incubation mutants
with MICs eightfold that of the parenteral strain had grown to a number of 1010 cfu/ml. It
was concluded by Gahrn-Hansen et aI., that according to the definitions used, ciprofloxacin could not be said to act bactericidally at a concentration similar to that obtainable in
serum (22). However, other investigators have found a somewhat higher killing effect of
ciprofloxacin against staphylococci than was reported in the Danish study (23, 24).
Pseudomonas aeruginosa is included in the broad spectrum of ciprofloxacin. However,
resistant strains of P. aeruginosa have frequently been produced both in vitro (23, 25-27)
and in vivo (28-32). Thus, for the treatment of systemic P. aeruginosa infections a
combination of ciprofloxacin with another anti-Pseudomonas antibiotic could be justified.
Fuursted and Gerner-Smidt (33) made time-kill studies with 13 strains of P. aeruginosa
comparing the activity of ciprofloxacin plus piperacillin with the combination of tobramycin and piperacillin. Ciprofloxacin plus piperacillin showed synergism against 5 of 13
strains while an additive effect or indifference was obtained against the remaining 8. No
antagonism was demonstrated and similar results were obtained with the tobramycin-piperacillin combination. Thus, a combination of ciprofloxacin and piperacillin seems worth
trying in systemic P. aeruginosa infections (33).
POST-ANTIBIOTIC EFFECT
In 1944it was demonstrated that S. aureus exposed to penicillin and then transferred to a
drug-free medium did not resume growth in several hours (34). This has been called postantibiotic effect (PAE). Aminoglycosides have been shown to produce a consistent PAE
against Gram-negative rods but a minimal or no effect against Gram-positive cocci (35,36).
Beta-lactam antibiotics on the other hand have shown PAE against Gram-positive cocci
but not against Gram-negative rods, with the exception of imipenem for which a PAE also
has been reported against P. aeruginosa (37,38). Fuursted (39, 40) could in very convincing experiments with ciprofloxacin demonstrate PAE against both P. aeruginosa and S.
aureus of approximately 2 h.

Influence of Age on the Pharmacokinetics
of Ciprofloxacin
INGRID NILSSON-EHLE and BENGT LJUNGBERG
Department ofInfectious Diseases, University ofLund, Lund, Sweden
Data from 4 previously published reports on kinetics after oral ciprofloxacin administration
are reviewed. Preliminary results from a study with oral and intravenous administration in
elderly and young, healthy males are presented. The total clearance of ciprofloxacin is
maintained in the elderly, while the renal clearance is reduced as a consequence of the agerelated, physiological reduction of kidney functions. After oral administration there is,
furthermore, an increased AVC and C...., which are explained by a higher bioavailability of
an oral dose in the elderly (72.4 %) as compared to young volunteers (58.4 %).

INTRODUCTION
The pharmacokinetic behaviour of drugs in the elderly is a field of study which previously
has been neglected. The past decade has seen an increased interest in this topic as the
awareness of the hazards of drug use in the older population has become greater. It is now
understood that in otherwise healthy elderly subjects, physiological changes associated
with the normal aging process will exert profound effects on the handling of several drugs
in the body. It is also a fact, that the large majority of drug prescriptions is made to people
of more advanced age (1); this holds true also for antimicrobial agents. It is therefore
imperative that drugs are studied with respect to their pharmacokinetic behaviour not just
in young volunteers and in certain patients, e.g. those with renal insufficiency, but also in
different age groups to ascertain effective and safe dosage regimens.
The fluoroquinolones is a new group of antimicrobial substances with a broad spectrum
including excellent activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The absorption from the
gastrointestinal tract is adequate to make oral therapy of many difficult infections possible.
Elimination from the body is by excretion into urine, faeces and bile and, for most of the
compounds, via metabolism of the parent drug. The fluoroquinolones generally have a
very large volume of distribution, by far exceeding the volume of the extracellular fluid.
Thus, the pharmacokinetics are rather complex and many physiological mechanisms play
a role in determining the kinetic variables: absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, the
renal and biliary function, the state of the metabolizing enzyme systems and the transport
mechanisms between the different compartments in the body. All these mechanisms may
conceivably be influenced by the physiological changes in the aging individual and warrant
a careful examination of the pharmacokinetic behaviour of these drugs in elderly subjects.
This presentation deals with the influence of aging on the kinetic variables of ciprofloxacin. Previously, four studies concerning this question have been published (2, 3, 4, 5) and
data from these studies are presented together with some preliminary data from an
investigation undertaken at our own laboratory (Ljungberg & Nilsson-Ehle, to be published). All but one of the studies (2) include a control group of young, healthy volunteers.
All previous studies were performed with oral administration of ciprofloxacin, which
makes it impossible to calculate accurately some important kinetic variables, namely the
volume of distribution, the total body clearance and thus also the non-renal clearance.

These variables all demand knowledge of the absolute bioavailability for each individual,
and this is not possible to calculate without intravenous administration. The data given for
the above-mentioned variables have been estimated assuming a certain bioavailability and
thus do not reflect the true kinetics. Variables determined in this manner are not included
in this presentation. An earlier review of the pharmacokinetics of quinolones in elderly
subjects (6) accepted the assumed variables which led to some erroneous conclusions. In
our own study an intravenous dose of ciprofloxacin has been administered with the
intention of calculating accurately the basic kinetics for oral and intravenous administration.
In three of the earlier published reports, some of the studied individuals have abnormal
renal function even if the normal physiological aging of the kidney is taken into account.
Guay et al. (2) have included four patients with estimated creatinine clearances below 30
mIJmin. Ball et al. (3) do not give clearance values, but include individuals with serum
creatinine up to 150 umol/l, values which, especially in the elderly, indicate a low
clearance. Among the aged volunteeers studied by LeBel et al. (5), five have a creatinine
clearance below 30 mIJmin. Thus, not only the normal aging of the kidney but also renal
disease influence the results in these studies. However, these subjects have not been
excluded in the present analysis, since individual data are not possible to discern.
For comparison, some data from previous reports have been recalculated to other units
than those given in the original publication. All clearance values are given in ml/rnin,
concentrations in mg/l, times in hours, AVC's in mgxh/l and urine recoveries in % of
administered dose.
ABSORPTION
The gastrointestinal absorption of an orally administered drug may be influenced by many
variables. The pH of the ventricle is higher in older people because of atrophic changes in
the gastric mucosa. This can result in impaired absorption of several drugs but may
enhance the absorption of others, depending on the physicochemical properties of the
compounds. Other physiological changes include decreased splanchnic blood flow, reduction of active transport mechanisms across membranes and a reduction of the number of
absorbing cells. No reliable data exist on the influence of these factors on absorption and
on their relation to changes with age.
The information on oral ciprofloxacin in the elderly is very limited. Since the blood
samples are few during the absorption phase of the kinetic curve, the exact times (Tmax) to
maximal serum concentration (Cmax) are uncertain as are the Cmax values. Table I shows

the absorption data from the six studies. There are no discernible differences between
elderly and young individuals with regard to Tmax • The areas under the serum concentration curves (AUC) vary between the different studies due to the fact that different doses
have been employed; however, it seems to be a constant finding in the five studies with a
young control group, that the elderly group has a larger AUC. There is, furthermore, a
clear tendency towards higher Cmax values in the aged. The higher AUC and Cmax values
could indicate a better absorption, but other kinetic changes may explain the data: a lower
total clearance, whether due to slower elimination via liver and kidneys or to impaired
metabolism, would give a larger AUC as would a reduced volume of distribution.
DISTRIBUTION
With advancing age there is a reduction in total body water and lean body mass and an
increase in body fat; this implies that lipid soluble drugs would have a larger volume of
distribution and the reverse would be true for water-soluble drugs. Since ciprofloxacin is
water-soluble, one would expect differences in the volume of distribution between young
and elderly subjects. In the previous studies (2, 3, 4, 5), it is claimed that the volume of
distribution is unchanged; however, the calculation has been made assuming that the
bioavailability is the same in old and young subjects. Large errors in the calculation of the
volume of distribution may thus be present in these data, which therefore cannot be relied
upon. The kinetic analysis after an intravenous dose indicates that there is actually no agerelated difference in the volume of distribution (Ljungberg & Nilsson-Ehle, to be published). The fluoroquinolones generally have a very large volume of distribution, which
exceeds the volume of the body water. An active transport mechanism across membranes
has been postulated. Apparently this mechanism is not influenced by the physiological
changes in aging.
ELIMINATION
Ciprofloxacin is eliminated from the body via the kidneys, via excretion into bile and
faeces and via metabolism of the parent compound (7, 8).

It is well established that the normal physiological aging of the kidneys influences the
clearance of compounds whose main elimination pathway is by glomerular filtration with
or without tubular secretion (9, 10). Ciprofloxacin is excreted via both glomerular filtration
and tubular secretion, as evidenced by a renal clearance far exceeding the creatinine
clearance. It seems clear from all the studies (Table II) that there is a reduction in the renal
clearance of ciprofloxacin in elderly subjects as compared with young volunteers (3, 4, 5).
However, this is most pronounced in studies where individuals with renal impairment
beyond the normal physiological aging are included (3, 5). The two investigations with
healthy elderly males (4, Ljungberg & Nilsson-Ehle, data to be published) show a much
less pronounced reduction in the renal elimination rate.
The total serum clearance has been calculated in the earlier studies, again assuming an
equal bioavailability for young and old subjects. On this ground it has been claimed that
there is a marked reduction in the elimination rate of ciprofloxacin from the circulation in
older age groups; this has been explained by a reduction in renal clearance and by a
markedly reduced non-renal clearance. Data obtained after intravenous dosing, however,
show no significant change in total clearance between elderly and young volunteers. The
renal clearance is reduced but there is no indication of impaired non-renal clearance.
ABSOLUTE BIOAVAILABILITY
Table I clearly shows that the AUC after oral doses of ciprofloxacin was larger in the
elderly subjects, also in studies where only subjects with healthy kidneys were included (4,
Ljungberg & Nilsson-Ehle, data to be published). This difference in AUC cannot be
explained by differences in clearance or volume of distribution (Ljungberg & NilssonEhle, to be published). After an intravenously administered dose it is possible to calculate
accurately the absolute bioavailability of the oral dose of 250 mg. In the elderly it is 72.4 %
as compared to 58.4% in the young volunteers. This significantly larger bioavailability in
the older subjects may be due to a better absorption from the gastrointestinal tract,
perhaps because of lower intestinal motility with more complete absorption. It is, however, also possible that the first-pass metabolism or the biliary excretion is reduced in the
elderly; the increased bioavailability of an oral dose could just as well be due to one or
both of these mechanisms.
CONCLUSION
The physiological changes of advancing age seem not to affect the distribution and
elimination of ciprofloxacin to any significant extent. However, the absolute bioavailability of an oral dose is considerably greater in elderly, healthy subjects as compared to
young volunteers. This, taken in conjunction with the generally higher frequency of
adverse reactions, justifies extra careful dosing in the elderly. High oral doses of ciprofloxacin may cause drug accumulation. Thus, dose reduction of oral ciprofloxacin is advisable
at advanced age.

Does Ciprofloxacin Affect the Inner Ear?
A Preliminary Report
DAN BAGGER-SJOBACK and MARIE-LOUISE SpANGBERG
Department of Otolaryngology, Karolinska Hospital, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden
Ciprofloxacin, a 4-quinolone antibiotic wastested regarding its possible influence on the inner
ear sensory epithelia. Adult guinea pigs were injected intraperitoneally with ciprofloxacin in a
dosage of 25, 50, 100 and 150 mg/kg body weight per day. The animals in the high dosage
ranges stopped eating and consequently lost weight quite rapidly. After sacrifice, the inner
ear sensory epithelia were removed for ultrastructural analysis. The general outline of the
vestibular sensory epithelia as well as the cochleae were normal. Mild changes in the sensory
hairs of the third row of cochlear outer hair cells were noted in the specimens obtained from
the high dose animals. These changes were discrete and did not resemble any previously
known pattern of ototoxic damage. At present no data indicate that ciprofloxacin has a toxic
effect on the inner ear.

INTRODUCTION
Ciprofloxacin is a 4-quinolone antibiotic with a broad antibacterial spectrum. The drug has
been shown to be effective in the treatment of infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus
and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These two bacteria are potent pathogens occurring in
chronic middle ear infections and in conjunction with middle ear surgery directed against
cholesteatoma or granulation tissue.
Ciprofloxacin can be used either in a systemic way with peroral or parenteral administration, but topical application directly into the middle ear has also been tested. Thus the
drug can be given as eardrops for chronically discharging ears infected with Pseudomonas
aeruginosa or Staphylococcus aureus. In view of this indication for the drug, it is of great
interest to see whether ciprofloxacin can influence the inner ear function or structure in
any way. The following study was designed in order to investigate if administration of
ciprofloxacin can affect the inner ear of guinea pigs. The guinea pig was chosen since
several previous investigations on aminoglycoside antibiotics and loop diuretic ototoxicity
have been performed in this species (l, 2, 3, 4).
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Forty-six pigmented female guinea pigs with an initial weight of approximately 300 g were utilized in
the study. In the first phase of the study three different dosages of ciprofloxacin were utilized i.e. 150
mg/kg, 100 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg body weight given as an intraperitoneal injection once daily for 14
days. In the initial protocol 10 animals were entered in each of the three groups. Thereafter each
group was divided into two subgroups, where five of the animals were meant to be sacrificed directly
after the last injection while the remaining five were left with no additional treatment for another 14
days before sacrifice. Due to technical reasons as stated in the Results, a fourth group of 10 animals
was included in the study. These animals were only given 25 mg ciprofloxacin/kg body weight once
daily by an intraperitoneal injection. As in the previous groups, five of the animals were sacrificed
directly after the 14 injections while the remaining five were left for another 14 days without any
additional treatment. Six animals were given the vehicle of the ciprofloxacin preparation by an
intraperitoneal injection for 14 days in a similar way as the treated animals. These animals were all
sacrificed after the last injection.

rows of outer hair cells. Some of the stereocilia appear somewhat lax and point from the general orientation of the
hair bundle. In the center of the second row of outer hair cells a single hair cell is missing.
After sacrifice the temporal bones were rapidly dissected out and the inner ear was opened and
fixed with a perilymphatic perfusion of 3% glutaraldehyd in phosphate buffer. The majority of the
specimens were microdissected for scanning electron microscopy, dried and sputter coated with gold
after having been mounted on specimen holders . These specimens consisted of both the cochlear and
vestibular partitions of the inner ear. The specimens were viewed and photographed in a Philips 505
scanning electron microscope.
The remaining specimens were dehydrated in graded ethanols and embedded in epon agar. They
were then microdissected and prepared for light and transmission electron microscopy. The light
micrographic specimens were photographed in a Zeiss photomicroscope and the transmission electron
microscopy ones photographed in a Philips 400 transmission electron microscope.
RESULTS
During the course of the treatment in the three groups of animals with the highest dosage
of ciprofloxacin administered, i.e . ISO mg/kg, 100 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg body weight, a large
number of the animals died. Already in the initial phase of the injections, the animals
stopped eating thereby loosing weight rapidly. Due to the rapid deterioration in general
status, none of these animals received all 14 injections as planned. Thus only five animals
in the ISO mg group, two animals in the 100 mg group and one animal in the 50 mg group
were decapitated and the temporal bones processed for morphological analysis. These
animals received ciprofloxacin between 9 and 13 days. In contrast, all the 25 mg
animals were injected according to the settled administration plan as described in Material
and Methods.

organ of Corti from an animal having
received 25 mg of ciprofloxacin. While
the first and second rows of outer hair
cells appear normal the third row at the
level of approximately 10 mm from the
round window membrane presents with
moderate hair bundle changes. Thus,
the sensory hairs are limp and some lie
collapsed on the surface of the organ of
Corti. No hair cell loss is evident at this
particular site.
None of the control animals examined showed signs of severe morphological changes in
their cochlear or vestibular partitions. A notable finding was however, a slight irregularity
in the sensory hair bundles of the third row of outer hair cells. This was usually observed
in the area of the cochlea situated approximately 9-10 mm away from the round window
membrane. No signs of entirely lost hair cells were seen in the control group .
Similar findings were noted in the 25 rng/kg body weight injected animals (Fig. I). Thus
signs of mild to moderate stereociliar disarray were observed in the second and third rows
of the outer two hair cells in the area of the organ of Corti situated approximately 9-10 mm
away from the round window membrane (Fig. 2). The stereocilia appeared limp and were
sometimes pointing away from each other. In some instances they had collapsed on the
reticular lamina and in some hair cells the cilia were more or less entirely lost. This type of
changes was usually localized to a small area of the organ of Corti and hence no signs of
stereociliar disarray or loss were noted in the further basal or apicalward locations of the
sensory end organ . Due to the small number of collected specimens from the 50 and 100
rng/kgbody weight treated groups, no conclusive data could be derived from these groups.
However, a similar type of mild stereociliar disarray in the same location as in the 25
rng/kg body weight treated group was noticed also here.
In the five animals that were injected for 9 or 10 days respectively with 150 mg
ciprofloxacin/kg body weight, the sensory hair changes in the third row outer hair cells
were somewhat more pronounced than in the groups of animals having received smaller
doses of the drug. Thus some outer hair cells presented with total or subtotal loss of
stereocilia while others displayed limp stereocilia that were spread apart or had collapsed
onto the surface of the organ of Corti (Fig. 3). As in the case of the previous groups ,
however, the lesions were quite localized to small patchy areas of the organ of Corti in the
9-1) mm range from the round window membrane. Each such patchy area usually had an
extension of a few hundred urn. The inner hair cells did not display any morphological
changes in general throughout the entire material.
The plastic embedded specimens designated for cross sectioning in light microscopy did
not reveal any obvious changes as regards the cochlea. Thus the organ of Corti and the
stria vascularis displayed normal outlines and no signs of endolymphatic hydrops were
seen (Fig. 4). The hair cell bodies were intact and the stereociliary hair bundles, as judged
in the light microscope, were normal. No gross abnormalities were noted in the inferior

portion of the organ of Corti including the neural elements and the basilar membrane. The
myelinated nerve fibres underlying the osseous spiral lamina were also present in normal
amount and configuration.
As judged from the scanning electron micrographic examination, the vestibular sensory
epithelia appeared normal with intact hair bundles and normal sensory hairs. No signs of
hair fusions or loss of stereocilia were observed in these specimens.
DISCUSSION
Several drugs have been correlated to transient or permanent inner ear changes. These
changes are often functional in nature, but may also be expressed as morphological
changes in the sensory organs. Ototoxicity is defined as a tendency of a compound to
specifically bind to inner ear tissue there causing functional or morphological changes.
Several drugs have been shown to possess such effects. The largest single group is
constituted by the aminoglycoside antibiotics that have been in clinical use since the
forties (5, 6). Other groups of drugs with known ototoxic effects are salicylates and loop
diuretics (7, 8). In order to fully evaluate whether a drug has an ototoxic potential or not,
standardized test procedures are presently being utilized. Thus a careful morphological
assessment with both light and electronmicroscopic technique is required. Functional

testing with electrocochleography or auditory brainstem response can also be used in
attempts to further illuminate possible functional impairment. The present study was
focused on a careful morphological assessment of the sensory partitions of the inner ear of
the guinea pig after systemic administration of ciprofloxacin. In the initial test protocol,
three doses of ciprofloxacin were chosen, i.e. 150, 100and 50 mg/kg body weight in a daily
intraperitoneal injection. These doses were chosen as they correlated well with earlier
investigations on aminoglycoside ototoxicity where for example gentamicin was given in a
similar dosage to guinea pigs. As it turned out, however, it seemed that these doses were
too high, since the LD 50 of the animals was exceeded. Thus the animals stopped eating
and consequently lost weight with following rapid deterioration in general status. None of
the animals given the high doses could thus fulfil the criteria for the initial protocol and in
order to save some specimens, eight of these animals were sacrificed and processed for
morphological analysis prior to having received the planned doses. After this experience, a
fourth series of animals that were only given 25 mg ciprofloxacin/kg body weight per day
was introduced into the study. All these animals survived the full treatment period in spite
of bad appetite and some weight loss. No other behavioural abnormalities were observed
in these animals.
The guinea pig organ of Corti is usually quite regular with a single row of inner hair cells
and three rows of outer hair cells along the entire course of the organ of Corti. It is a wellknown fact that slight irregularities occur in the upper portion of the cochlea where single
hair cells may be missing and sensory hairs may show minor abnormalities. This is
particularly pronounced in older animals, but also present in young animals to some extent
(9).

The control group revealed slight alterations in sensory hair morphology in the third row
of outer hair cells in the region situated approximately 10 mm away from the round
window membrane. No missing sensory hair cells or more severe changes of the organ of
Corti were observed.
The 10 animals having been treated with 25 mg ciprofloxacin presented with quite
similar appearance. There was no difference between animals that were sacrificed directly
after the last injection and those having been left for an additional 14 days without any
further treatment. Minor hair cell changes in the third row and sometimes also in the
second row of outer hair cells was noted in the 9 to 11 mm area from the round window
membrane. These changes consisted of mild stereociliar disarray or even loss in some
cells. The number of totally missing hair cells did not exceed that seen in the control
animals. These findings are not similar to those described after intoxication with aminoglycoside antibiotics where sensory hair fusion into giant hairs followed by severe hair cell
degeneration and loss is common (10, 11)or loop diuretic ototoxicity (12). Comparable but
slightly more marked changes were seen in the five animals treated with 150mg ciprofloxacin/kg body weight for 9 or 10 days. Small patchy areas of the organ of Corti displayed
sensory hair changes, most prominently noticed in the outer two rows of outer hair cells,
whereas the inner hair cells appeared normal. These changes included spreading of the
sensory hair bundle or collapse of the sensory hairs onto the surface of the organ of Corti.
In some cases, the sensory hairs were lost in such a way that they seem to have been
broken at the base close to the cuticular plate. Such changes may be due to dissection
artifacts but also to an increased brittleness or susceptibility to physical forces. The patchy
areas with these changes were quite small, not exceeding 100 urn and the remaining areas
of the organ of Corti basal or apical to these changes presented with normal outlines. Due
to the few analysed specimens in the 50 mg and 100mg groups, no conclusive data can be
made but as judged from the few specimens, a comparable morphological pattern was
evident in the cochleae of these specimens.
The light microscopy examination of cross sections of the organ of Corti obtained from
the area 9 to 11 mm from the round window membrane in all animals did not reveal any
gross morphological changes. Due to the limitation of resolution, only gross changes in the
sensory hairs can be visualized at the light microscopical level, but no gross changes were
present. The stria vascularis also displayed normal outlines with no signs of severe
abnormalities.
The vestibular sensory epithelia that were examined in the 150 mg group and the 25 mg
group did not reveal any gross morphological changes as seen in the scanning electron
microscope. Thus the general outline of the sensory epithelia was normal with intact
sensory cells and sensory hair bundles. This is well in line with the fact that the animals did
not display any signs of functional vestibular disorder such as ataxia, spinning behaviour
or loss of balance.
It cannot be concluded that the minor alterations observed in this investigation are due
to a primary effect of ciprofloxacin on the organ of Corti. It is evident that the animals with
the most severe changes were sacrificed after having deteriorated markedly in general
status. It is possible that these changes could be due to an unspecific increased susceptibility to physical forces that can occur in the general preparation process. Further light
microscopical investigations combined with transmission electron microscopy are in progress and will be reported later. In order to fully elucidate whether ciprofloxacin has any
effect on the function of the cochlea, electrophysiological assessment with electrocochleography or auditory brainstem response must be carried out. Such studies are also under
way.

A reproducible experimental model of intraabdominal infections in rats has been developed in
order to stimulate intraabdominal sepsis in patients. Preoperatively, the rats were fed with
lean ground beef for two weeks in order to change the intestinal Dora to one similar to that of
humans. A I-cm segment of ileum was isolated on its vascular pedicle. The intestine was then
divided at each end of the segment and intestinal continuity was re-established by an end-toend anastomosis. The segment of ileum was then returned to the abdominal cavity. This
experimental model was used to compare the efficacy of ciproDoxacin alone and in combination with clindamycin with the combination gentamicin and c1indamycin in the treatment of
intraabdominal infections. Eighty per cent of the untreated animals died within four days.
Within six days, 30 % of the animals receiving ciproDoxacin died. Animals treated with
ciproDoxacin plus clindamycin or gentamicin plus clindamycin had a significantly decreased
mortality and increased cure rates during the experimental period. Only 5 % of these animals
died. Thus the combination of ciproDoxacin and clindamycin seems to be as successful as
gentamicin plus ciproDoxacin in the treatment of intraabdominal infections.

INTRODUCTION
It is now accepted that most intraabdominal infections involve both aerobic and anaerobic
bacteria. The polymicrobial flora at the infected sites has led to the use of an array of
antimicrobial agents. The antimicrobial therapy should be based on controlled clinical
trials. However, many available data are difficult to interpret because of host differences,
variables in underlying disease, the role of surgery and the lack of untreated controls.
The experimental infection in animal models offers an alternative method for testing of
antimicrobial agents and has the advantage of allowing evaluation under controlled conditions. An experimental model has therefore been designed which simulates postoperative
intraabdominal infections in patients (1). The gastrointestinal microflora has been changed
to be simular to that of humans and a surgical technique making traumatic injuries
resembling the clinical situation has been used.
Ciprofloxacin in a new quinolone agent which possesses a broad spectrum antibacterial
activity including both aerobic Gram-negative rods and Gram-positive cocci (2). The
anaerobic activity is reported to be lower.
The purpose ofthe present study was to compare the efficacy of ciprofloxacin alone and
in combination with clindamycin with the combination gentamicin and clindamycin in the
treatment of experimental intraabdominal infection in rats.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Animals

Surgical procedure
Throughout the experiments a standard method of producing intraabdominal sepsis described by
Lahnborg et al. (I) was used. Each rat was fasted for 24 h before surgical procedure and then
anaesthetized with pentobarbital given intraperitoneally at a dosage of 15 mg. The rats were shaved
and a midline incision was made. The caecum and terminal part of the ileum were mobilized out of the
abdomen. A I cm segment of ileum, 5 em from the ileocaecal junction, was isolated on its vascular
pedicle, which was interrupted with a single ligature. The intestine was divided at each end of the
segment, and intestinal continuity was re-established by a one-layer end-to-end anastomosis of the
two ends of the ileum with 6-0 Dexon sutures. The defect in the mesentery was then closed with
interrupted 6-0 Dexon sutures. The anastomosis was checked for leakage and passage before the
intestine and devascularized segments of ileum were returned to the abdominal cavity. The abdominal
wall was closed in two layers. Gross pathological changes were noted immediately after death.
All surving rats were sacrificed after two weeks. An autopsy and microbiological cultures from the
abdomen were performed in all animals.
Administration of antimicrobial agents
Four groups (each group consisting of 20 animals) were used. Antimicrobial agents were given by
injection, initially one hour after surgery and then at 12 hour intervals for 10 days. The regimens and
amounts of agents given per dose were: ciprofloxacin 20 mg, gentamicin I mg and clindamycin 60 mg.
The control group received 0.9% sterile saline.
Microbiological procedures
Specimens were taken with dry cotton-tipped sterile swabs and immediately placed in a carbon
dioxide filled glass tube which was transported to the laboratory. The specimens were then immediately streaked on different agar plates. Each specimen was streaked on two blood agar plates and ten
selective media as described by Nord et al. (3). All manipulations of the anaerobic bacteria were
carried out in an anaerobic chamber (Forma, Philadelphia, USA) under 10% hydrogen (v/v) in
nitrogen. The aerobic agar plates were incubated for 24 h and the anaerobic agar plates for 48 h at
37°C. The plates were then examined and different colony types were isolated in pure culture. The
isolated microorganisms were identified by morphological, biochemical and immunological tests as
described by Nord et al. (3). The minimum inhibitory concentrations of ciprofloxacin, gentamicin and
clindamycin were determined by the agar dilution method.
Evaluation ofresults
The antimicrobial treatment was evaluated according to the following scheme: mortality rate, time of
death, incidence and number of abscesses in the surviving animals.
RESULTS
Control group
Half of the rats died within 24 hand afterfour days 80% ofthe animals were dead (Fig. I).
At autopsy these animals showed typical signs of peritonitis and abscess formation. A
polymicrobial microflora consisting of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus feacalis, and Clostridium perfringens was isolated from the peritoneal fluid.
Ciprofloxacin group
Within six days, 30% of the rats were dead (Fig. I). At autopsy three rats had abscesses,
from which B. fragilis and C. perfringens were isolated. No signs of peritonitis were seen.
Ciprojloxacin plus clindamycin group
All animals except one survived in this group (Fig. I). From the abscess in the nonsurviving rat, E coli, Proteus mirabilis and K. pneumoniae were isolated.
Gentamicin plus clindamycin group
One rat in this group died (Fig. I). E. coli, P. mirabilis, S. faecalis and B. fragilis were
cultured from an abscess found in this animal.

Antimicrobial susceptibility pattern
The in vitro activity of ciprofloxacin, gentamicin and clindamycin against the isolated
bacterial strains is shown in Table I. All strains identified as E. coli, P. mirabilis, K.

similar to that of humans and a surgical technique has been used producing traumatic
injuries resembling the clinical situation in man.
Ciprofloxacin is mainly active against aerobic bacteria, while clindamycin is active
against anaerobic bacteria, streptococci and staphylococci. Ciprofloxacin reduced the
mortality rate significantly in the present investigation but had no effect on the abscesses
caused by B. fragilis and C. perfringens. The combination ciprofloxacin and clindamycin is
active against both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and all rats but one survived. Similar
results were obtained when the combination gentamicin and clindamycin was used. Thus
the combination ciprofloxacin and clindamycin seems to be as useful as the combination
gentamicin and clindamycin in the treatment of intraabdominal infections and deserves
further clinical investigations.

4-Quinolones affect mammalian ceUular functions in vitro in several ways. Inhibition of ceU
proliferation Mer widely among 4·quinolones. Ciprotloxacin is one of the most antiproliferative inhibiting cell growth with about 30 % at 20 mg/l. Genotoxocity tests with 4-quinolones
are probably "false" positive due to an increased [~].thymidine uptake not related to DNA
damage. Ciprotloxacin at 10 mg/l and up causes significant DNA strand breaks which
seemingly are quickly repaired and not causing mutations or cancerogenesis. Ciprotloxacin at
5 mg/l inhibits immunoglobulin production but the growth factor interleukin 2 (IL-2) is
increased by 4-quinolones at the same concentration and hyperinduced at higher concentrations. Thus the effects are very contradictory. Increased IL-2 may contribute to CNS side
effects.

INTRODUCTION
After the discovery of bacterial DNA gyrase, a member of the type II topoisomerases, by
Gellert and coworkers in 1976 (1), this enzyme was shown to be a target of nalidixic acid
(2). Mutations in the gyr A genes encoding subunits of DNA gyrase result in a gyrase
which is not inhibited by nalidixic acid (3). However with the synthesis of radiolabelled 4-
quinolones, it was possible to study drug interactions directly at molecular level. Shen and
Pernet demonstrated binding of radiolabelled norfloxacin to DNA from E. coli (4). Thus
details of the interaction between 4-quinolones, DNA and DNA gyrase in bacteria are not
fully understood.
MAMMALIAN IDPOISOMERASES
We know much less of what the new 4-quinolones do to human cells. It is wellknown that
the new 4-quinolones in contrast to most antibiotics penetrate well and accumulate in
mammalian cells (5). On the evidence of toxicity studies it seems implicit that these
antibiotics are much less toxic against human cells than they are against bacteria, but we
have no concept of any subtle effects at therapeutic levels.
In the light of the close evolutionary relationship between the eucaryotic type II
topoisomerases and bacterial gyrase it was important to investigate ifthe new 4-quinolones
interfere with elements of eucaryotic DNA replication. Data by Hussy et al. (6) demonstrate that the new 4-quinolone antibiotics in high concentrations are able to inhibit DNA
topoisomerase I and II and that ciprofloxacin is the most potent inhibitor and ofloxacin the
weekest inhibitor of the topoisomerases (Table I). The minimum concentration to inhibit
topoisomerase I in vitro was determined to be about 50 mg!l with the electrophoresis assay
used (6). However, it is possible that also in eucaryotic cells individual genes are sensitive
also to lower concentrations of quinolones than those having effect as detected by
electrophoresis (7).
Mitochondria are often considered to originate from bacteria and since the new 4-
quinolones penetrate human cells they might hypothetically act on mitochondria which

secondarily could effect cell growth and other cell functions. However, DNA-gyrase has
not been isolated from mitochondria (8) and DNA or protein synthesis in isolated rat liver
mitochondria are not inhibited by 100 mg/! of ciprofloxacin (unpublished results). This
probably excludes that a gyrase in mammalian mitochondria is a target for the new 4-
quinolones.
CELL GROWTH
Ciprofloxacin inhibits growth in vitro of PHA stimulated human lymphocytes and of all
cell lines tested. Growth was inhibited to 30--50%at 20 mg/Iand totally at 80--160 mg/I (Fig.
1) (9, 10). The growth inhibitory effect is clearly reversible since cells exposed during 24
hours for 80 mg/l of ciprofloxacin and then washed were not inhibited. Ciprofloxacin also
inhibited cell cycle progression and cell size. Similar results were obtained by Hussy et al.
(6) when testing the effects of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin on several Iymphoblastoid cell
lines. In vivo growth inhibition of allogenic bone marrow grafts has also been reported for
animals treated with high doses of ciprofloxacin and pefloxacin (11).
THYMIDINE UPTAKE
Measurement of [3H]thymidine uptake into DNA is widely used to estimate cell proliferation. However, the 4-quinolones in spite of an antiproliferative effect cause an increased
uptake of radiolabeled thymidine into DNA in PHA stimulated normal human lymphocytes (9, 10, 12). This could be detected after 3 days incubation of PHA stimulated human

lymphocytes but was more apparent after 5 days. An increased thymidine uptake was
shown for all the new 4-quinolones in the concentration range of 1.56 to 25 mg/l (Table II).
Nalidixic acid had no effect at the same concentrations. Not only thymidine but also
deoxyuridine and uridine are increasingly taken up in the presence of ciprofloxacin (Fig.
2). Exogenous thymidine, deoxyuridine and uridine are precursors of pyrimidine nucleotides in different salvage pathways. Leucine which is incorporated into proteins and
hypoxantine which is incorporated into purins are however not increasingly taken up.
These data could suggest that the 4-quinolones inhibit de novo pyrimidine synthesis at an
early step and that such an inhibition result in the increased uptake of pyrimidine
nucleotide precursors. However, ciprofloxacin has no inhibitory effect on enzymes involved in the early pyrimidine biosynthesis (13). The induction of DNA breaks with repair
could not explain the largely increased incorporation of [3H]thymidine and other pyrimidine precursors in the presence of 4-quinolones. In most cell types the amount of DNA
synthesized during excision repair involves replacement of small segments of the genome
and [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA. The result of excision repair would therefore
contribute little to the total thymidine uptake in a proliferating cell population. Thus the
increased thymidine incorporation in lymphocytes is not due to increased lymphocyte
proliferation, DNA repair or direct inhibition of enzymes involved in de novo pyrimidine
metabolism. It seems more likely that the increased thymidine uptake is caused by some
kind of disturbed balance between pyrimidine de novo metabolism and different salvage
pathways.

TESTS FOR GENOTOXICITY
An increased [3H]thymidine uptake not related to DNA damage may be the explanation for
genotoxicity tests which have been interpreted as "false" positive (14, 15). The hepatocyte primary culturelDNA repair test has been extensively validated and has been shown
to be a reliable indicator of genotoxicity. Ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin and pefloxacin were all reported by McQueen and Williams to induce DNA repair i.e. an increased
uptake of radiolabeled thymidine but not in cells exposed to nalidixic acid (Table III).
Ciprofloxacin was evaluated further to determine if in vivo exposure would also induce
DNA repair. However, when rats were treated with high doses of ciprofloxacin for 4 to 24
h and subsequently hepatocytes were isolated and tested in vitro no DNA repair could be
detected. Similar findings were also obtained by Schluter who interprets these results as
"false" positive because of the negative results with hepatocytes in the in vivo/in vitro test
and that false positive in vitro test have occurred as a result of changes in the ionic
strength of the test medium (14). However, at the low concentration of 5 mg/I ciprofloxacin
causes unscheduled DNA synthesis (DDS) when normal human unstimulated lymphocytes
are incubated with hydroxyurea which blocks replicative DNA synthesis (13). At this low
concentration of ciprofloxacin it seems unlikely that the ionic strength of the incubation
medium is changed to any crucial extent.
Other tests to reveal DNA damage includes alkaline elution to reveal DNA strand
breaks (15). Cells are after radiolabeling and culture in the presence of 4-quinolones for 24
h deposited and lysed on a filter. Thereafter the two strands of DNA are separated from
each other and single stranded DNA slowly eluted. The presence of DNA strand breaks
has been shown to lead to an increase in the amount of DNA finding its way through the
filter. Interestingly enough clearly standing out from the other 4-quinolones was ciprofloxacin giving significant evidence of DNA strand breakage at a concentration of to mg/I(Fig.
3). At higher concentrations there was a dose dependent increase and at 100 mg/l of
ciprofloxacin the elution rate was higher than the effect reached by 300 rads of X-rays.
Significant increase in the elution rate was detected at 80 mg/l of ofloxacin and 160 mg/l of
norfloxacin (10, 13). The effect of ciprofloxacin was clearly reversible since cells which
had been incubated with 80 mg/I of ciprofloxacin and then incubated for 15 min in
ciprofloxacin-free medium gave a completely normal elution pattern (13).
Induction of DNA breaks and repair is a normal part of the DNA replicative process and
does not necessarily lead to mutations and cancerogenesis. This is supported by several
tests for detection of point mutations and chromosomal aberrations which have been
negative (15, 17). None of several patients treated with ciprofloxacin during long time have
shown signs of chromosomal aberrations (18). Furthermore none of the 4-quinolones

IMMUNOGLOBULIN AND INTERLEUKIN 2 (IL-2)
When lymphocytes were stimulated in vitro with mitogens and the immunoglobulin
secretion in the culture medium was assessed a pronounced inhibitory effect was found
with ciprofloxacin (9). At 5 mg/l of ciprofloxacin the IgG and IgM secretion was inhibited
to approximately 50% (Fig. 4).
IL-2 has been described as a lymphokine of utmost importance for DNA synthesis and
proliferation of lymphocytes. Considering the antiproliferative and immunoinhibitory effect of 4-quinolones it was quite unexpected that 4-quinolones have a dramatic increasing

effect on IL-2 production in lymphocytes (19). Fig. 5 shows that ciprofloxacin causes a
dose-dependent increase in the recovery of IL-2 in lymphocyte culture supernatants. The
peak level of IL-2 in the presence of 80 mg/l of ciprofloxacin was approximately 50 times
higher than the IL-2 level in the antibiotic-free controls. Similar curves were observed
with other new quinolones, but the highest levels were obtained with ciprofloxacin,
enoxacin and pefloxacin. There were significantly increased IL-2 levels with all new 4-
quinolones at 5 mg/l, a concentration that is achievable in serum during treatment.
To provide increased direct evidence of an increased IL-2 production IL-2 mRNA has
been measured. The concentration of RNA hybridization to a human IL-2 cDNA was
intensively elevated 16 to 32 times in PHA stimulated lymphocytes exposed to ciprofloxacin (80 mg/l).
IL-2 has a role as transient signal in the immune system. In unstimulated lymphocytes
IL-2 mRNA is undetectable but stimulation with mitogens causes a rapid accumulation of
IL-2 mRNA followed by a rapid decline (20). This decline is inhibited by cycloheximide
and actinomycine D. It is quite possible that the 4-quinolones in a similar way are
disturbing the IL-2 regulation and that this leads to superinduction.
IL-2 has been quite widely used as a therapeutic drug in cancer patients. The high doses
used have caused frequent side effects including hypotension and neuropsychiatric effects
such as sornmolence, coma and disorientation. Considering that 4-quinolones at the
clinically achievable concentration 5 mg/l increase the IL-2 level and at higher concentrations dramatically influence IL-2 production it is possible that this might contribute to the
side effects reported for 4-quinolones.
The contradictory effects of ciprofloxacin on human lymphocytes are summarized in

CONCLUSIONS
4-Quinolones cause a variety of effects in mammalian cell systems. Additional studies are
required to understand the mechanisms and the clinical relevance of most of these.
However, increased IL-2 levels may contribute to side effects.

When ciproOoxacin was introduced on the Swedish market the recommended interpretive
standards for disk diffUsionsusceptibility testing using a 10 Ilg disk were: Sensitive ,.,24 mm
(MIC.,;I mglI) and Resistant <18 mm (MIC>4 mglI), except for enterococci where S,.,18 mm
and R<14 mm were recommended. A quality control study revealed that the accuracy of the
routine susceptibility testing of ciproOoxacin was low. 50 % of the strains of Staphylococcus
aureus and 90 % of Streptococcus agalactiae strains were falsely assigned to the intermediate
instead of the sensitive category, and the test missed to detect true resistance in Pseudomonas
maltophilia. Newspecies-specific breakpoints were determined by the SRA method. Separate
breakpoints were required only for the pseudomonas species. Streptococcus faecalis was
found to belong mainly to the intermediate group and it is suggested that these strains are not
categorized as sensitive. The breakpoints that gaveacceptable accuracy in routine susceptibility testing of ciproOoxacin were S,.,20 mm, R<13 mm for all relevant bacteria except
Pseudomonas aeruginosa for which S,.,27 mm, R<18 mm is proposed, and Pseudomonas
maltophilia where S,.,3Omm, R<23 mm are adeadequate breakpoints. The 10 Ilg disk gave
acceptable inhibition zones for all strains with MICs within the clinically interesting MIC
range.

INTRODUCTION
Ciprofloxacin is a broad spectrum antimicrobial agent of the new fluoroquinolone group.
In vitro tests show MIC90 values of less than 1 mg/l for enterobacterial species, Staphylococcus species, and some Streptococcus species 0, 2, 3, 4, 5). Serum levels above 1 mg/l
are achieved both by parenteral and oral administration (6, 7, 8, 9). On the basis on this
information minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) limits and tentative corresponding
zone size breakpoints for susceptibility testing were established by the Swedish reference
group for antibiotics (SRGA) before ciprofloxacin was introduced on the Swedish market.
Interpretive standards established in other countries were not applicable because of the
use of different testing methods.
There are several problems connected with the setting of interpretive standards for
susceptibility testing of new antibiotics. Strains of different relevant species with an
acceptable range of MICs may not be available for regression analysis. Problem combinations of the drug and certain species may not have been identified, and it has not been
established if the drug or one or more combinations of the drug and bacterial species are
more liable to interlaboratory variations in the result of the disk diffusion susceptibility
testing. Such problems are usually identified after the drug has been introduced on the
market and the results of routine susceptibility testing of different species have been
analysed. Often the interpretive breakpoints need to be adjusted.
The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the zone diameter breakpoints issued
by SRGA for susceptibility grouping of ciprofloxacin in our laboratory. The Single strain

regression analysis SRA method (10) was used to establish the breakpoints for separate
bacterial species.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Bacterial strains. Before the introduction of the new quinolones on the Swedish market, 50 consecutive isolates of each of the following species were collected from urine specimens with significant
bacteriuria (~105 colony forming units CFU per ml; for Staphylococcus saprophyticus ~104 CFU per
ml): Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Streptococcus faecalis, Streptococcus agalactiae.
Only 7 strains of Pseudomonas maltophilia were collected during the study period. Control strains
were Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Staphylococcus aureus
ATCC 25923, and Streptococcus faecalis ATCC 29212.
Identification criteria/or bacterial species. Enterobacterial species were identified by the API 20E
biochemical tests (API System S.A., France), streptococci by API 20 Strep (API System S.A.,
France) and by Streptex (Wellcome Diagnostics, England). Pseudomonas aeruginosa was identified as
gram negative non-fermentative oxidase positive rods resistant to cetrimid. Strains which did not
show a greenish pigment on the primary isolation plates, and strains of Pseudomonas maltophilia were
further identified by the API 20NE biochemical tests. Coagulase positive strains of staphylococci
were designated as Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative and novobiocin resistant strains as
Staphylococcus saprophyticus.
Disk diffusion susceptibility testing. Susceptibility testing was performed by the disk diffusion
method (11) on PDM Antibiotic Sensitivity Medium (AB Biodisk, Sweden). The SRGA recommended
the use of a 10 jtg disk and the following MIC limits and corresponding zone diameter breakpoints for
ciprofloxacin: S~l mg/l corresponding to ~24 mm, 1=2-4 mg/l corresponding to 18--23 mrn, and R>4
mg/l corresponding to <18 mm. These zone size breakpoints were considered applicable to all
bacterial species except for enterococci, where species-specific breakpoints were established as S~18
mm, 1=14-17 mm, and R<14 mm.
MIC determination. MIC determination were performed by the agar dilution method (11) on the
same media as used for disk diffusion, containing two-fold dilution steps ranging from 0.002 to 32
mg/l. The plates were inoculated by a Steers applicator delivering approximately 104 CFU, and
incubated for 18--24 h at 37°. MIC was determined as the lowest concentration that permitted growth
of no more than one colony within the area of inoculation. For strains used in the SRA calculations
more accurate MICs were determined by adding one intermediate diluton step, by repeating the test
five times and calculation of geometric means. MICso and MIC90 were calculated by using probit
analysis (12).
Histogram analysis. Zone diameters from disk diffusion and MIC values from agar dilution
susceptibility testing were displayed graphically as histograms by computer aid. The MIC values on

the x-axis were reversed so that for increasing zone values decreasing MIC values were displayed.
The results from the two susceptibility testing methods were combined for each species to illustrate
the relation between zone diameter and MIC values (Fig. I).
Singel strain regression analysis (SRA) and Standard curve regression analysis (SeA). The SRA
method (10) is based on the regression analysis of the correlation between zone size and disk content,
using one single strain as a reference strain. The SRA equation Z2=A log Q-A log MIC+B (Z =
inhibition zone in mm, Q = disk content in ug) was derived from earlier studies of factors influencing
the formation ofthe zone of inhibition in the disk diffusion test (13). The SRA equation is based on the
assumption that the MICs of the strains are constantly related to the critical concentration at which
the zone edge is formed. This might not be true for all combinations of bacteria and antibiotics and the
SCA equation was worked out to compensate: Z2=A log Q-C log MIC+D (14). As a consequence of
introducing new constants the SCA equation requires two strains to be solved.
The strains were tested by the disk diffusion method using five different disks containing 0.5, 1.5, 5,
50, and 150 ug of ciprofloxacin. The tests were repeated five times and the SRA and SCA constants
were calculated using the least squares method. From the constants, zone diameters corresponding to
the MIC limits for susceptibility grouping S:s;1 mgll and R>4 mgll were calculated for each species.
The constants were also used to calculate the consequence of different disk potencies in terms of zone
diameters for strains with different MICs, even if strains with these MICs were not available for
testing.
RESULTS
Susceptibility by MIC determination. The results of MIC determination of the clinical
isolates of nine different species are shown in Table I. Only two species had MIC90 above
the MIC limit for sensitive 1 mg/l. Streptococcus faecalis had MIC90 of 1.45 mg/l with MIC
range 0.5--8.0 mg/l and corresponding zone diameter range of 12-24 mm. Pseudomonas
maltophilia had an MIC range of 0.5-32.0 mg/l and corresponding zone diameter range of
13-32 mm (only seven strains).

diameter breakpoints corresponding to MIC I mg/l and 4 mg/l are shown. The possibility to
test the validity of the SRA equation over a span of MIC values was limited since so few
ciprofloxacin resistant strains were available. Only for Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas maltophilia could the SCA equation be carried out. The strains with the lowest and
highest MIC values were chosen as reference strains for SCA. For all species except the
Pseudomonas the corresponding zone values were fairly equal, ranging from 19-22 mm for
MIC I mg/l and for 10-13 mm for MIC 4 mg/l. Only the Pseudomonas species had a
different MIC-zone relationship with the much greater zones of 27-30 mm corresponding
to MIC 1 mg/l and 18-23 mm corresponding to MIC 4 mg/l. This is also illustrated in Fig. 1
where Escherichia coli and Streptococcus faecalis show the same relationship between
MIC and zone values while Pseudomonas aeruginosa is different with greater zones
corresponding to MIC values. The breakpoints chosen were the mean values: For all

diffusion susceptibility testing were compared (Table III). By using the zone diameter
breakpoints issued by the SRGA the susceptibility grouping of Escherichia coli, Proteus

faecalis strains were in the intermediate category by the MIC determination. By the
species-specific breakpoints of the SRGA eight of the strains were misinterpreted as
sensitive, and by the new calculated breakpoints the misinterpretation went in the opposite
direction with twelve of the sensitive strains misinterpreted as intermediate. For the other
three species all new calculated breakpoints adjusted the susceptibility grouping in the
correct direction. Streptococcus agalactiae were adjusted from 91 to 15% misinterpretation, and Staphylococcus aureus from 52% to 8 % misinterpretation as intermediate
instead of sensitive. For the seven strains of Pseudomonas maltophilia misinterpretation
was reduced from four to one strain.
Evaluation ofdisk potency. The calculated zones corresponding to different MIC values
are shown in Table IV. The reference strains Escherichia coli and Streptococcus faecalis
gave smaller zones corresponding to MICs than Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Disks loaded
with 1 I-tg of ciprofloxacin will not give any zone of inhibition for most strains with an MIC
of 1 mg!l, and the 5 ug disks will not give any zones for most strains with an MIC of 4 mg!l.
The 10 ug disk will give acceptable zones for all species in the important range of MICs of
1-4 I-tg!l, which are the limits for sensitive and resistant categories. The 30 I-tg disk provides
no advantage in this respect.
DISCUSSION
Interpretive zone diameter standards for susceptibility testing are established for each
approved methodological modification of the disk diffusion method. Also the choice of
appropriate disk potency must be considered so that the disks produce acceptable zones of
inhibition for all strains with MICs within the clinically interesting range. One way to
select disk potency is to test a large selection of strains against disks of different potencies.
This method requires that strains with MICs corresponding to the sensitive and resistant
levels are available. Another method of selecting an appropriate disk potency is to use a
few reference strains for calculation of constants for regression lines between disk potencies and inhibition zone sizes. With this SRA method the corresponding zone size can be
predicted even for strains with MICs not available at the time, for instance before a new

drug is introduced and resistant strains have not yet been found. Our analysis shows that
the 5 IJ.g disk used in other countries (17) would not regularly produce zones of inhibition
for strains with MIC values of 4 mg/l which is the limit between intermediate and resistant
categories, but that the 10 IJ.g disk recommended by SRGA will give acceptable zones for
all species within the interesting MIC range.
When routine susceptibility testing of a new drug is started in a laboratory it is important
to monitor the accuracy of susceptibility reporting. The performance of susceptibility
testing of ciprofloxacin in our laboratory was not satisfactory. Looking at the results of the
reference method MIC determination and interpretation using the zone diameter breakpoints of the SRGA, there were two problems. First of all the accuracy of the test was too
low. The most important fact is that we missed to detect true resistance in Pseudomonas
maltophilia. But it is also unacceptable that nearly all of the strains of Streptococcus
agalactiae and half ofthe strains of Staphylococcus aureus were assigned to the intermediate instead of the susceptible category. The other problem was that many of the Streptococcus faecalis strains belong to the intermediate category with MIC90 of 1.45 mg/l. This
could lead to inconsistency in reporting the susceptibility group of the same strain as either
sensitive or intermediate, and thus reduce confidence in laboratory reports.
To solve the problems it was important first of all to improve the accuracy of the disk
diffusion test by establishing the correct relation between MIC and corresponding zone
diameters. This was done by the SRA method calculating zone size interpretive breakpoints for each species. The results show that the enterobacterial species, the staphylococci and streptococci had roughly the same relationship between MIC and zone, and the
same zone diameter breakpoints would be applicable for all these species. Pseudomonas
species are different for ciprofloxacin as for some other antibiotics (15, 16) and separate
breakpoints are therefore required. For Pseudomonas maltophilia the zones corresponding
to the MIC limits are much greater than for other bacteria and the use of breakpoints
assigned for other bacteria would lead to a high proportion of false susceptibility. Also for
Pseudomonas aeruginosa there is a risk for false susceptible interpretations when using the
zone diameter breakpoints valid for non-Pseudomonas species. One advantage of ciprofloxacin is its efficacy against multiply resistant bacteria as replacement for more toxic and
exclusively parenteral drugs, and it is therefore of special importance to have high
accuracy in ciprofloxacin susceptibility testing of the clinically significant Pseudomonas
aeruginosa. Separate breakpoints were chosen for this organism. The even higher breakpoints of Pseudomonas maltophilia could not be used since this would lead to reports of
false resistance. For other Pseudomonas species data are missing and to avoid the risk of
reporting these strains as false susceptible it would probably be wise to apply the
breakpoints calculated for Pseudomonas maltophilia.
The problem of the intermediate susceptibility of Streptococcus faecalis is not only a
question of the clinicians confidence in laboratory reports, but the more important
question of the clinical effectiveness of ciprofloxacin. Until more clinical data are available
we suggest that strains of Streptococcus faecalis are categorized as either resistant or
intermediate susceptible.
In conclusion, the interpretive criteria giving acceptable accuracy in susceptibility
reporting of ciprofloxacin in our laboratory are: S;;:!:20, R<13 mm for all relevant bacteria
except Streptococcus faecalis I;;:!:13 mm, R<13 mm, Pseudomonas aeruginosa S;;:!:27 mm,
R<18 mm, and Pseudomonas maltophilia S;;:!:30 mm, R<23 mm. These breakpoints should
also give correct interpretations when resistance occurs. However, further evaluation of
the disk diffusion susceptibility testing and more clinical experience with infections caused
by bacteria marginally susceptible to ciprofloxacin like Streptococcus faecalis might give
other clinically relevant guidelines both for MIC limits and interpretation breakpoints.

The high in vitro activity of ciproftoxacin against most urinary tract pathogens and its
favourable pharmacokinetics suggests considerable potential for use in therapy. The published controUed cHnical trials show that ciproftoxacin has few adverse reactions and is at
least as effective as the drugs with which it was compared.

INTRODUCTION
Urinary tract infection (UTI) is defined on the basis of the results of urine culture. UTI
covers, however, a broad range of clinical entities from non-complicated asymptomatic or
sympotmatic bacteriuria in women to symptomatic complicated renal infections in patients
with a foreign body such as a stone or a catheter (l; Table I). In the case of bladder
infection located superficially in the mucous membrane, the consequences are not serious
and the treatment easy, since it is possible to obtain very high concentrations of antibiotics
in the urine. Management is more difficult in the case of complicated UTI, especially if the
kidneys are involved. Prolonged intensive therapy may be required to eradicate such
infections which are often caused by antibiotic-resistant bacterial species (Table I; I). As
UTIs are frequent and in most cases do not require hospitalization, treatment with inexpensive oral drugs is preferred (Table II). Ciprofloxacin and other fluoro-quinolones are
excellent agents for UTI having high bactericidal activity against most UTI pathogens and
long terminal serum halflife (111'1{3) (Table III & IV; 2-7). Although the fluoro-quinolone are
several times more active at pH 7.4 than at pH 5.5-6.0, their concentrations in acid urine
far exceed the MIC for most pathogens (8).
COMPARATIVE CLINICAL TRIALS WITH CIPROFLOXACIN
The compiled data of clinical trials on efficacy of ciprofloxacin in UTI show 93%
bacteriological cure rate and 96% clinical success (9). Ciprofloxacin has also been used
successfully in a few patients with chronic prostatitis (9, 10). Such data are, however,

give a reliable evaluation of the efficacy of new drugs. Table V shows the outcome of 9
small comparative clinical trials of ciprofloxacin and other drugs in uncomplicated and

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
It is neither surprising nor very interesting that ciprofloxacin and many other drugs are
effective in the treatment of uncomplicated UTI. The clinician's need for ciprofloxacin and
other fluoro-quinolones is mainly in treatment of UTI caused by multiresistant problembacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus species. In such cases one would
expect ciprofloxacin and other fluoro-quinolones to qualify as major therapeutic improvements. Larger comparative trials are needed to determine their role in clinical practice.

In a randomized study 100 patients, 78 males and 22 females, with uncomplicated gonorrhoea
were treated with either a single oral dose of 250 mg of ciproDoxacin or a single oral dose of 3
g of amoxycillin and 1 g of probenecid. Three of the gonococcalstrains produced penicillinase
and, in addition, nine strains had MIC-vaIues of amoxycillin ranging between 0.6 and 1.2
mg/l and five other strains MIC-vaIues higher than 1.2 mg/l. Twenty-two patients had a
concomitant infection due to Chlamydia trachomatis. All patients treated with ciproDoxacin
were cured, while two patients treated with amoxycillin had treatment failures. Neither
treatment regimen had any effect on the chlamydial infections. No adverse effects were
observed. It was concluded that ciproDoxacin is the drug of choice in the treatment of
uncomplicated infections due to Neisseria gonorrhoeae.

INTRODUCTION
The treatment of gonorrhoea has gradually become more difficult because ofthe increasing
incidence of penicillinase-producing Neisseria gonorrhoeae (PPNG), and of non-PPNG
strains highly resistant to penicillin. Up to now penicillins have been the drugs of choice in
the treatment of gonorrhoea. However, the present change in the sensitivity of the
gonococci has urged a search for other more effective alternatives. In vitro studies have
shown that the quinolones are highly active against the gonococcus and that ciprofloxacin
is the most active of this class of antimicrobial agents (I). This observation correlates well
with the high cure rates found in several recent studies (2--6).
Since both PPNG and non-PPNG strains highly resistant to penicillin have increased
rapidly in Finland during the last years, we found it important to compare the standard
amoxycillin treatment with ciprofloxacin in a series of patients with uncomplicated urogenital gonococcal infections.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
One hundred consecutive patients with acute, uncomplicated gonorrhoea attending the Out-Patient
Department for Venereal Diseases, University Central Hospital, Helsinki were enrolled in the study.
Seventy-Eight of the patients were males and 22 females (Table I). N. gonorrhoeae was isolated from
the urethra in 96 cases, from the cervix in 22, the rectum in five and from the pharynx in one case.
Twenty-two patients had a concomitant C. trachomatis infection. The patients were randomized to a
single dose of 250 mg of ciprofloxacin (50 patients) or 3 g of amoxycillin and I g of probenecid as a
single oral dose (50 patients). The study was open controlled. Oral consent was in all cases obtained
before start of treatment. Clinically the two groups compared well with each other (Table I).
The primary diagnosis of gonorrhoea was made by microscopical examination of Gram-stained
smears from the urethra and/or endocervix. Samples for culture were obtained from the urethra and
pharynx in males and from the urethra, endocervix, rectum and pharynx in females. A sample for
culture of C. trachomatis was obtained from the urethra in males and from the urethra and cervix in

females. The culture methods used have been described elsewhere (7). The sensitivity testing of the
gonococci to ciprofloxacin and amoxycillin were carried out by the plate dilution method (8). Followup examination were carried out one and two weeks after the treatment. The same diagnostical
procedures as prior to treatment were used at both re-examinations. The study was approved by the
Ethical Committee of the hospital.
RESULTS
The mean inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of ciprofloxacin and amoxycillin for the
isolated gonococci are presented in Table II. All strains were highly sensitive to ciprofloxacin. Nine strains had a MIC-value of 0.6 to 1.2 mg/l of amoxycillin and eight strains a
MIC-value higher than 1.2 mg/l, Three strains produced penicillinase.
The results of the treatment are presented in Table III. All 50 patients treated with
ciprofloxacin took part in the first re-examination, while two patients of the amoxycillin

group defaulted. N. gonorrhoeae was eradicted in 49 patients in the ciprofloxacin group.
One male patient was found to still harbour gonococci in the urethra and he admitted a
possible re-infection three days before the re-examination. The MIC ofthe initial gonococcal strain was 1.2 mg/l amoxycillin, while the strain isolated at the re-examination had an
MIC-value of 0.36 mg/l. He was retreated with a single oral dose of 250 mg of ciprofloxacin
and was cured one week later. Two patients in the amoxycillin group still had gonococci in
the urethra at the first re-examination. Both were males with strains with an MIC-value
higher than 1.2 mg/l of amoxycillin. One of the two strains produced penicillinase. Both
patients were retreated with a single oral dose of 250 mg of ciprofloxacin and were cured
one week later.
Eight patients in the ciprofloxacin group and 14in the amoxycillin group had a concomitant C. trachomatis infection. Seventeen of these patients had signs and symptoms of
postgonococcal urethritis at the first re-examination. All 22 patients were treated with
tetracycline for 10 days and were dropped from further re-examinations regarding gonorrhoea.
Forty-one in the ciprofloxacin group and 27 in the amoxycillin group took part in the
second re-examination. All these patients were cured. One patient in the ciprofloxacin
group and three in the amoxycillin group defaulted (Table III).
No adverse effects were observed in any of the treated patients.
DISCUSSION
This study compared the clinical effect of a single oral dose of 250 mg of ciprofloxacin with
a single oral dose of 3 g of amoxycillin and I g of probenecid for the treatment of patients
with uncomplicated infections due to' N. gonorrhoeae.
The results showed that a cure rate of 100% was obtained with a single oral dose of 250
mg of ciprofloxacin, while a few treatment failures were observed in the group treated with
a single oral dose of 3 g of amoxycillin and I g of probenecid. Although the difference was
not statistically significant, ciprofloxacin seems superior to amoxycillin in the treatment of
gonorrhoea. This was further stressed by the finding that a high proportion of the
gonococcal strains in the present series were either penicillinase-producing or highly
resistant to penicillin without producing penicillinase. These results confirm those of

previous studies (1, 5, 6). As found earlier, a single dose of ciprofloxacin does not cure
concomitant C. trachomatis infections (1) nor does it prevent the development ofpostgonococcal urethritis.
The results of the present study indicate that a single oral dose of ciprofloxacin is the
treatment of choice for uncomplicated infections due to N. gonorrhoeae.

Two-hundred patients with confirmed Chlamydia trachomatis infection of the urogenital
region were treated with either ciprofloxacin 1.5 glday or doxycycline 100 mglday for seven
days. One-hundred and fifty-seven patients were males and 43 females. C. trachomatis was
isolated prior to treatment from urethra alone in 155 patients, from cervix alone in 27 and
from both urethra and cervix in 15. The first re-examination was carried out at the end of
treatment and the second one week later. Six patients in the ciprofloxacin group and three in
the doxycycline group never returned for the rll'Stre-examination. At the second re-examination there were seven defaulters in the ciprofloxacin group and 11 in the doxycycline group.
Altogether there were 12 bacteriological failures in both groups. Clinical failure despite
bacteriological cure occurred in 20 patients in the clprofloxacin group and eight in the
doxycycline group. The total number of treatment failures was 32 in the ciprofloxacin group
and 20 in the doxycycline group. The results suggested that neither treatment was efficient
enough in the treatment of uncomplicated urogenital infections caused by C. trachomatis.

INTRODUCTION
Nongonococcal urethritis (NGU) is the most common sexually transmitted diseases (STD)
in Europe and North America (I). Chlamydia trachomatis is the aetiological agent of -this
condition in more than 50% of the cases and also causes a high proportion of cervicitits in
females. Tetracycline and erytromycin are considered the first and second line drugs for
treatment ofthese conditions. Usually, 90% of the patients will show an initial response to
therapy, but a high proportion (30 to 40%) will have recurrence within six to eight weeks
after treatment (2, 3). However, at this time, it is not clear what proportion of the
recurrences is reinfection rather than relapse.
There is a need to investigate new agents for the treatment of uncomplicated C.
trachomatis infections in both males and females. The ideal would be to fine a drug that
gives satisfactory cure rates in both gonococcal and C. trachomatis infections. Tetracycline can be used to treat combined infections, but the increasing incidence of tetracyclineresistant Neisseria gonorrhoea may limit its usefulness in the future.
Ciprofloxacin, a new quinolone derivate, has been shown to be highly effective in vitro
and in vivo against penicillin-sensitive and penicillin-resistant strains of N. gonorrhoeae
(4-6). The drug also appears to have in vitro acitivity against C. trachomatis (7, 8).
In the present study, 200 patients, both males and females, with a positive culture for C.
trachomatis were treated with either ciprofloxacin or doxycycline for one week. The study
was carried out in a double-blind fashion.

PATIENTS AND METHODS
This study enrolled 200patients (I8 years or older) attending the Out-Patient Department of Venereal
Diseases, University Central Hospital, Helsinki. The study design was approved by the Ethical
Committee of the hospital. At this department all new visitors are screened for C. trachomatis; men
from the urethra and women from both urethra and cervix. Because of the study the patients did not
receive any treatment at the first visit. One week later patients with a positive culture for C.
trachomatis were enrolled in the study, which was carried out in a double-blind fashion. Before the
treatment started oral consent was obtained. Clinical data of the enrolled patients are presented in
Table I. One hundred and fifty-seven were males and 43 females. A new culture for C. trachomatis
was carried out at start of treatment and 197 patients had a positive result. In all patients cultures for
N. gonorrhoeae were taken at pretreatment and at all follow-up visits. The first follow-up visit was
carried out one week and the second three weeks after the start of treatment. At each visit a
microscopical examination of a smear from urethra and lor cervix was carried out. The presence of
more than 5 leukocyteslHPF was considered pathological. The methods for culture of N. gonorrhoeae
and C. trachomatis have been described earlier (9).
The patients were in a double-blind fashion randomly assigned to receive either ciprofloxacin 750
mg twice daily or doxycycline 100mg twice for the first days and then 100 mg and a placebo capsule
daily. Both groups were treated for seven days.
Cure was defined as resolution of symptoms and discharge and a reduction of the number of
leukocytes to less than 5IHPF, and a negative culture for C. trachomatis.
Analysis of the patients' responses to treatment was done before the randomization code was
broken. Statistical analyses were done by chi-square analysis with Yates' continuing correction or by
the two-tailed Fisher's exact test and chi-square test two-tailed.
RESULTS
Before treatment C. trachomatis was isolated from urethra alone in 155 patients, from
cervix alone in 27 patients and from both cervix and urethra in 15 patients (Table I). At the
first follow-up examination at the end of treatment, 94 of the 100 ciprofloxacin treated
patients and:97 of those treated wit doxycycline returned for re-examination. Six of the
patients treated with ciprofloxacin (6.5 %) and 10 of those treated with doxycycline
(10.3 %) still had a positive isolate of C. trachomatis (Table II). In addition, 10 patients
treated with ciprofloxacin (10.6 %) and four treated with doxycycline (4.1 %) still had

C. trachomatis. Two of the 72 doxycycline-treated patients had a positive C. trachomatis
isolate (2.8%) and four (5.6%) were defined as clinical failures.
In both treatment groups 12 patients were bacteriological failures, in the ciprofloxacin
group 20 patients and in the doxycycline group eight patients were defined as clinical
failures, despite eradication of C. trachomatis (Table IV). Thus, altogether 32 patients in
the ciprofloxacin group and 20 patients in the doxycycline group were either true relapses
or reinfections. Accordingly, doxycycline proved more effective than ciprofloxacin in the
present study although both treatment regimens were unsatisfactory.
No patient in either treatment group spontaneously reported any adverse effects attributable to the treatment.
DISCUSSION
Ciprofloxacin and other new quinolone derivatives have high in vitro acitivity against N.
gonorrhoeae, including penicillin- and tetracycline-resistant strains, and almost 100% of
the strains are inhibited by 0.008 mg/l (5).
The in vitro activity of ciprofloxacin against C. trachomatis and the MIC-values have
been reported to be 1.0 to 2.0 mg/l (10). Compared with tetracyclines and erythromycin
(MIC-values 0.05 to 0.2 mg/l) ciprofloxacin is much less active against C. trachomatis.
The results of the present study correlate well with the data on in vitro activity of the
two drugs. The doxycycline dosage was rather low and the treatment period only one
week instead of 10 days which may explain the high rate of bacteriological and clinical
failures. The ciprofloxacin dosage was the same as used in other trials, which also have
shown a high rate of non-responders (8). It has also been reported earlier, that ciprofloxacin is less effective than doxycycline in the treatment ofNOU caused by C. trachomatis as
compared with treatment of NOU caused by Ureaplasma urealyticum (10). In conclusion,
ciprofloxacin has proved to be excellent for the treatment of urogenital gonococcal
infections, but on the basis ofthis and other reports it cannot be recommended as the drug
of choice for the treatment of urogenital infections caused by C. trachomatis.

We studied the clinical and microbiological response to two treatment regimens in 36 patients
with acute pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). All patients were hospitalized and underwent
laparoscopy and endometrial biopsy. Cervical, endometrial, tubal and peritoneal cultures for
Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, genital mycoplasmas, facultative and anaerobic bacteria and Herpes simplex virus were obtained. The patients were randomly assigned to
two treatment groups: 16 women received ciproOoxacin 200 mg b.Ld. iv. for two days,
followed by oral administration with 750 mg b.i.d. to complete a 14-day course of treatment.
Twenty women received the combination of doxycycline and metronidazole according to a
similar scheme of administration. The response was evaluated with repeated clinical examinations, monitoring of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and serum C-reactive protein concentration, and repeated microbial culture from the cervix. CiproOoxacin treatment was successful in all nine patients with chlamydial or gonococcal PID and in six of seven with nonchlamydial nongonococcal PID. Doxycycline plus metronidazole regimen was successful in five of
sevenpatients with chlamydial or gonococcal PID and in nine of 13 patients with nonchlamydial nongonococcal PID. Thus, the overall success rate was 94 % (15 of 16) with ciproOoxacin
and 70 % (14 of 20) with doxycycline plus metronidazole. Our study suggests that ciproOoxacin is a promising new alternative for the treatment of acute PID.

INTRODUCTION
Acute pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) refers to the acute clinical syndrome attributed to
the ascent of microorganisms from the vagina and endocervix to the endometrium,
fallopian tubes, and contiguous structures. Etiological agents include Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, anaerobic bacteria, facultative Gram-negative bacilli, and
genital mycoplasmas (1-4). Recent Scandinavian studies have demonstrated that C. trachomatis is currently the most important agent causing PID and it has been implicated in
20% to 50% of cases with PID (1, 4, 5-7).
The therapeutic goals in the management of acute PID are prevention of infertility and of
chronic residua of infection. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial to the preservation
of fertility (8). However, the microbial etiology of acute PID is not usually known when
early antimicrobial treatment is instituted. Thus the optimal antimicrobial regimen should
cover all common causative organisms.
Ciprofloxacin is a new broad-spectrum antibiotic belonging to the group of fluoroquinolones. The antimicrobial spectrum of ciprofloxacin covers most aerobic and facultative Gram-negative bacteria including N. gonorrhoeae (9). It also has in vitro activity

against C. trachomatis and genital mycoplasmas (10--13). Thus, ciprofloxacin is a suitable
candidate for monotherapy of PID.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of ciprofloxacin in the treatment of
acute PID verified by laparoscopy, endometrial biopsy and microbiological sampling from
multiple anatomical sites, and to compare this single drug regimen to a conventional
combination regimen; doxycycline plus metronidazole.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Forty women referred to the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Tampere University Central
Hospital, Finland, with suspected PID were enrolled between March 1987 and April 1988. Clinical
criteria for the diagnosis of acute PID included history of lower abdominal pain of <3 weeks duration,
and the presence of cervical motion tenderness, uterine, and adnexal tenderness on bimanual
examination. In addition, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), serum C-reactive protein (CRP)
concentration, white blood cell count (WBC), and body temperature were recorded in each patient.
Pelvic sonography was used when necessary to strenghten the diagnosis of PID. Women were
excluded from the study if they had taken antibiotics, had had any gynecological operation or
instrumentation of the upper genital tract in the preceding month, had systemic disease or epilepsy, or
if they were pregnant or had suspected allergy to any of the drugs used. Women with puerperal
infections were also excluded in this study. All women were in-patients. The study protocol was
explained to the patients and a signed informed consent was obtained. Laparoscopy was performed
within 20 h.
Collection ofspecimens
Culture specimens for isolation of C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae, Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum and Herpes simplex virus (HSV) were taken from the cervix, endometrium,
fallopian tubes and posterior cul-de-sac. The specimens from the endometrium, fallopian tubes and
posterior cul-de-sac were also cultured for facultative and anaerobic bacteria. Vaginal specimens
were obtained with cotton-tipped swabs and cultured for Gardnerella vaginalis, Trichomonas vaginalis and yeasts. Endometrial specimens were obtained under general anesthesia by transcervical
aspiration as described previously (I). Intrauterine contraceptive device was removed if present. An
endometrial biopsy specimen was obtained transcervically using a disposable Vabra<!!l (Ferrosan Co.,
Denmark) endometrial suction curette equipped with a 3 mm metallic tip (14). The biopsy specimens
were fixed in 10% neutral formalin and processed by routine histological methods. The cul-de-sac
specimens were obtained during laparoscopy by aspirating peritoneal fluid from the posterior cul-desac through the laparoscope. Successive tubal culture specimens were obtained with dacron-tipped
aluminium swabs (Labsystems Inc., Finland) through the fimbriated ends of the patent fallopian
tubes. The swab was rotated several times within the tube before withdrawing. If the tubal orifices
could not be seen or reached, the tubes were punctured and the aspirates from the tube was used for
culture.
Microbiological studies
C. trachomatis was isolated on cycloheximide-treated McCoy cells (15). Culture specimens for N.
gonorrhoeae were transported in Stuart's media and were inoculated on Thayer-Martin agar plates on
the same day. Oxidase positive colonies were identified as N. gonorrhoeae by an immunofluorescence
technique using fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) conjugated rabbit anti-No gonorrhoeae antibodies
(Difco Laboratories, USA). Specimens for isolation of M. hominis, U. urealyticum, facultative and
anaerobic bacteria were handled as described previously (I). Bacterial growth was semiquantitated
using an arbitrary scale of 1 to 3. Specimens for isolation of HSV were placed in viral transport media
(Orion Diagnostics, Finland) and inoculated onto human embryonic fibroplast and African green
monkey kidney cell monolayers (16). The isolated strains were typed by using commercial FITC
conjugated monoclonal antibodies to either HSV-l or HSV-2 (Mikrotrak, Syva Co., USA).
Classification ofPID
The histological diagnosis of endometritis was based on the identification of plasma cells. Endometritis was classified as mild, moderate, or severe as described previously (14). The presence of
salpingitis was assessed using laparoscopic criteria of mild, moderate and severe salpingitis as
described earlier (17). The minimum criteria for salpingitis included the presence of erythema and
oedema of the fallopian tubes, and mucopurulent exudate expressed from the fimbrial end of one or

68 P. K. Heinonen et al.
both tubes. All cases were classified according to the culture results for C. trachomatis and N.
gonorrhoeae as follows: chlamydial PID if C. trachomatis but not N. gonorrhoeae was isolated from
any site; gonococcal PID if N. gonorrhoeae but not C. trachomatis was isolated from any site; mixed
chlamydial gonococcal PID if both organisms were isolated; and nonchlamydial nongonococcal PID if
neither organisms was isolated.
Antimicrobial treatment regimens
Antimicrobial treatment was started immediately after laparoscopy. Patients were randomly assigned
to one of the two treatment groups. Group 1 received ciprotloxacin, 200 mg intravenously every 12 h
for the first two days, followed by oral administration at 750 mg every 12 h to complete a 14-day
course of therapy. Group 2 received doxycycline, 100 mg intravenously every 12 h, plus metronidazole, intravenously 500 mg every eight hours for the first two days, followed by doxycycline, 150 mg
orally every 24 h, plus metronidazole, 400 mg orally every eight hours to complete a 14-day course of
therapy.
Assessment of therapeutic response
The clinical response was evaluated by using clinical severity score, determined by grading the
presence of cervical excitation, uterine and adnexal tenderness in a scale from 0 (absent or normal) to
3+ (severe) as previously described (18). The clinical severity score was determined on admission
and at days 3, 6, 14 and 21 after the antimicrobial treatment was started. ESR and serum CRP were
measured on admission and at days 3, 6, 14 and 21. Cervical cultures for C. trachomatis and N.
gonorrhoeae were repeated at days 14 and 21. The case was defined as treatment failure as based on
the presence of one or more of the following criteria: no improvement in the clinical severity score at
day 3 after the microbial treatment was started; a CRP level of >20 mg/l or a decline of less than 50%
in the initial CRP level at day 6; positive cervical culture of N. gonorrhoeae or C. trachomatis at days
14 or 21; or the need for additional antimicrobial agents or surgical intervention.
Evaluation ofsafety and adverse effects ofthe drugs
Adverse reactions and side-effects were recorded daily. The laboratory tests included complete blood
count, platelet count, electrolytes, serum creatinine, liver transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, and
urinanalysis. The tests were performed pretreatment and repeated at days 6, 14 and 21.
RESULTS
Of 40 patients initially enrolled into the study, 36 had PID. Four patients had no signs of
salpingitis in laparoscopy or histophathological signs of endometritis or positive microbiological findings. Their final diagnoses were: toxoplasmosis (one case), urinary tract
infection (one case), periappendicular abscess (one case) and one case without pathological
findings. Subsequent analyses were limited to the 36 women with verified PID. The two
treatment groups did not differ with regard to age, parity, contraceptive use, history of
previous episodes of PID, clinical severity score on admittance, or hospital stay (Table I).
Three patients had no salpingitis according to laparoscopic criteria but they had histopathological endometritis and/or positive microbiological findings in the upper genital
tract. Mild salpingitis was verified in 53% of patients (Table II). In the group with severe
salpingitis, a tuboovarian abscess was found in one patient on ciprofloxacin and in two on
the combination regimen. Laparoscopy revealed perihepatitis (Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome, that is an inflammatory reaction of the liver capsule and the peritoneum of the
adjacent abdominal wall) in two cases both with chlamydial salpingitis. Histopathological
evidence of plasma cell endometritis was found in 22 (61%) of 36 women (Table II). Severe
plasma cell endometritis was found in 11 (31%) cases, and in nine (82%) of them C.
trachomatis was also isolated from the upper genital tract.
Table III shows that C. trachomatis was the most frequently recovered organism from
the genital tract. It was recovered from the upper genital tract in 11 (73%) of 15cases with
chlamydial PID. In seven of these 11 cases isolation of C. trachomatis was also positive
from the fallopian tubes. N. gonorrhoeae was found from the upper genital tract in four

response with ciprofloxacin treatment. One patient with nonchlamydial nongonococcal
PID failed. She had a tuboovarian abscess and Escherichia coli and Bacteroides fragilis
were isolated from the peritoneal cavity. Furthermore, acute appendicitis complicated this
case leading to laparotomy. The overall clinical success rate was 94% (15/16) among
patients treated with ciprofloxacin.
Table V shows that all three patients with chlamydial PID responded to doxycycline
plus metronidazole treatment. One case with gonococcal PID and one with mixed chlamydial gonococcal PID failed to respond; the former was treated with spectinomycin since a
tetracycline-resistant strain of N. gonorrhoeae was isolated. The latter patient also had a
positive cervical culture of N. gonorrhoeae at the follow-up visit 14 days after treatment
had been started. Four patients with nonchlamydial nongonococcal PID also failed to
respond. Two had tuboovarian abscess with Peptostreptococcus sp. and E. coli isolated
from the endometrium and the posterior cul-de-sac, respectively. One patient had genital
herpes (HSV type 2 was isolated from the cervix and the endometrium), and p-hemolytic
streptococci was isolated from the endometrium. The fourth treatment failure case had E.
coli isolated from the endometrium and the posterior cul-de-sac. Thus, the overall clinical
response rate was 70% (14/20) among patients treated with doxycycline plus metronidazole (Table V).
Ciprofloxacin was well tolerated. Two patients had transient skin reaction and one had
nausea and vomiting at the beginning oftreatment. Increased liver transaminase levels was
found in one patient with perihepatitis. One patient had a transient increase in serum
creatinine level. None of the patients discontinued treatment because of adverse effects.
Six patients in the doxycycline plus metronidazole group reported pain at the infusion site,
one had nausea and vomiting, one had diarrhoea, one had vertigo, and two women, one of
whom had perihepatitis (Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome), and one had transient increases of
liver transaminase levels.
DISCUSSION
In this trial, therapy with ciprofloxacin was successful in all nine women with chlamydial
or mixed chlamydial-gonococcal PID. In vitro, ciprofloxacin has been shown to be active
against C. trachomatis with minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of 1-2 mg/l (10-13).
Following both oral and intravenous administration concentrations of ciprofloxacin in
gynecological tissues above the MICs of C. trachomatis can be achieved (19, 20). However, failure rates of 14% have been reported after seven days of treatment of chlamydial
infections in the female urogenital tracts (21). Hoyme et al. reported that a dosage of 750
mg orally twice a day for 10 days cured 82% (14/17)of women with salpingitis; five of them
had chlamydial infection with favorable clinical response (22). It thus seems likely that
seven days treatment is too short in chlamydial infection, and in general from 10 to 14days
treatment with a high dose seems to be necessary in the treatment of chlamydial PID with
ciprofloxacin.
In this and previous studies, doxycycline plus metronidazole were effective for the
treatment of chlamydial PID (23). However, the treatment of two patients with gonococcal
PID failed with this regimen. The emergence of gonococcal strains resistant to tetracycline
has greatly reduced the usefulness of this drug in the treatment of gonorrhea (24). High
failure rates with tetracycline treatment of women with gonococcal infection have been
reported in the USA (25). On the other hand, ciprofloxacin had high in vitro activity and
low (0.01 mg/l) MIC values against N. gonorrhoeae (9-11). The treatment with ciprofloxacin was successful in all three cases with gonococcal PID in the present study.
Bacteria other than gonococci and chlamydia were also frequently recovered from the

upper genital tract. Most of these bacteria can be considered as pathogens in PID. In
agreement with our previous studies, we found a low prevalence of anaerobic bacteria in
the endometrial and tubal specimens (I, 23). Similarly, Brihmer et al. (4) have recently
reported isolation of Bacteroides species from the fallopian tube in only 5% of cases with
PID. In previous studies indicating high prevalence of anaerobic bacteria in the upper
genital tract of women with PID, the culture specimens have been obtained by culdocentesis and can thus be suspected of contamination with the vaginal flora (26, 27). The
bacteriologic results of specimens obtained by culdocentesis differ considerably from
those obtained via laparoscopy (2).
In the present study, the cases with mild and moderate nonchlamydial nongonococcal
PID were successfully treated with ciprofloxacin. Since ciprofloxacin has a poor effect on
anaerobic bacteria (9), this finding also supports theory that anaerobic bacteria play a
minor role in mild and moderate salpingitis. Hagele and Chysky (28) reported a complete
cure in 16 (76%) and a clear improvement in 4 (19%) of 23 patients with PID treated with
ciprofloxacin, although they did not identify anaerobes or C. trachomatis from any site of
the genital tract.
Anaerobic bacteria are found most frequently in cases with tuboovarian abscess (29). In
the present study, treatment with ciprofloxacin failed in one case with tuboovarian
abscess from whom B. fragilis was isolated from the peritoneal cavity. In the combination
treatment group, two severe cases with tuboovarian abscess and anaerobic bacteria
isolated had poor therapeutic response. These treatment failures can probably be explained by the poor response to any antimicrobial treatment in cases with tuboovarian
abscess. The high bacterial content, low pH, and avascular wall of the abscess are known
to lessen possibilities of any antimicrobial treatment in these cases and surgical intervention is frequently necessary (29, 30). In these cases it is probably necessary to combine
ciprofloxacin with an antibiotic that covers also anaerobic bacteria.
In conclusion, this study demonstrates that ciprofloxacin was effective in the treatment
of chlamydial and gonococcal PID. Our study suggests that ciprofloxacin can be used as a
monotherapy of uncomplicated PID. However, in the treatment of cases with complicated
PID another antimicrobial agent which is more effective against anaerobic bacteria should
probably be added. Most PID cases are treated as out-patients. Thus, further studies are
needed to evaluate ciprofloxacin for the out-patient treatment of PID.

Ciprofloxacin in the Treatment of Acute and
Chronic Osteomyelitis: A Review
S. RAGNAR NORRBY
Department ofInfectious Diseases, University of Lund, Lund, Sweden
The clinical and bacteriological efficacy and safety of ciprofloxacin given as oral doses of 500
to 1500 mg (normally 750 mg) twice daily for treatment of Gram-negative bacillary osteomyelitis are reviewed. In 182 patients of whom a majority had Pseudomonas aeruginosa or
mixtures of Ps. aeruginosa and other bacteria as the causative agents, clinical cure or
improvement wasachieved in 75 %. Data from 85 patients with Ps. aeruginosa as the infecting
pathogen could be analysed and showed that 20 strains persisted and that nine of them
became resistant to ciprofloxacin during treatment. In patients with Staphylococcus aureus as
a copathogen, that organism was eradicated during ciprofloxacin treatment in more than
90 % of the cases. Despite very long treatment times (up to 476 days), the safety of ciprofloxacin seemed comparable to that reported with shorter treatment times and lower doses.
However, it was noted that three patients developed photosenzitation during treatment and
that reversible renal failure related to ciprofloxacin occurred in one patient. In conclusion,
ciprofloxacin offers a weD tolerated and efficaceous alternative to injectable antibiotics for the
treatment of Gram-negative osteomyelitis.

INTRODUCTION
Osteomyelitis is normally caused by staphylococci, most commonly Staphylococcus
aureus. Such infections are easily treated with isoxazolylpenicillins unless tha causative
agent is a methicillin resistant strain when drugs like vancomycin, rifampicin, fusidic acid
and clindamycin are employed. Gram-negative bacterial species as aetiology of osteitis are
rare but cause considerable problems in that there are few therapeutic alternatives,
especially for oral treatment. This is especially true when the causative agent is Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Such infections have previously been treated mainly with combinations
of aminoglycosides and acylureidopenicillins or with third generation cephalosporins with
pseudomonas activity, for example ceftazidime. This has created many problems; the
drugs are often toxic, especially when used during long periods in high doses and they
must be administered in multiple daily doses, requiring the hospitalisation of the patients.
Against the above background, the introduction of the fluoro-quinolones with their
excellent activity against Gram-negative pathogens and their oral availability, offered a
possibility to treat patients with osteomyelitis ambulatory. Of the fluoro-quinolones so far
investigated, ciprofloxacin is the one with the highest antipseudomonal activity (1). It has
also been shown to be significantly more effective than tobramycin in the treatment of
experimental Ps. aeruginosa osteomyelitis in the rabbit (2). That study also showed levels
in diseased bone tissues which were about 50% of those obtained in serum. Similar bone
levels were demonstrated by Etesse et al. (3) who biopsied normal human bone tissue.
Several studies have been published on the use of ciprofloxacin in patients with Gramnegative osteitis and are reviewed here.

STUDY DESIGN
Most studies of ciprofloxacin in osteomyelitis are open ones. The only exception is one
trial by Greenberg et al. (4) in which patients with Gram-negative osteomyelitis were
randomized to either ciprofloxacin or various other antibiotics. In that study, 15 different
regimens were used in the 16 patients allocated to the control group. The reasons for
chosing an open, uncontrolled study design in most studies of ciprofloxacin for the
treatment of gram-negative osteomyelitis are several: (i) The disease is rare and even a
small study requires a multicentre or multi-clinic (multiple independent trial) design.
Even if such designs are used, the number of patients recruited within a reasonable time
will be too small to allow a comparison between two regimens with a type II error which is
below 0.5. (ii) The disease is not constant from one patient to another; the location varies
as does the state of disease (acute or chronic). This leads to a need for stratification,
further emphasizing the futility in trying to compare two regimens with a small type II
error. (iii) Treatment of osteomyelitis includes not only antibiotics but also surgical
interventions. Stratification for such factors further increases the need for very large
groups in a comparative trial. (iv) The ethics in asking a patient to give consent to enter a
trial in which there is a choice between long-term treatment in hospital with potentially
toxic injectable drugs or treatment with a presumably safe oral antibiotic as an outpatient,
is doubtful. In our trial (5) we initially used a randomized design, allocating patients to
either ciprofloxacin orally or to a combination of an aminoglycoside and an acylureidopenTable I. Clinical results in trials ofciprofloxacin therapy ofosteomyelitis caused by Gramnegative bacteria

icillin. However, already at the onset of the trial it became evident that neither the
physicians nor the patients accepted this choice but all wanted to try the ciprofloxacin
arm.
CLINICAL RESULTS
Table I summarizes the clinical results obtained in published trials of ciprofloxacin in
Gram-negative osteomyelitis. The analysis was complicated by the fact that many trials do
not give data on pathogens. However, overall 75% of treated patients were cured or
improved at the follow-up controls, which were performed between a few weeks and more
than a year post-treatment. Of 57 patients in whom Ps. aeruginosa could be identified as
the pathogen, either alone or with other organisms, 46 (81%) were classified as cured or
improved and 14 (19%) as failures or relapses. These data must be considered highly
satisfactory. It is also interesting to note that in more than 20% of the patients included in
these trials, Gram-positive bacteria, most commonly Staph. aureus or Staphylococcus
epidermidis, were found in conjunction with the Gram-negative ones. These organisms
were eradicated in more than 90% of the cases and clinical cures were achieved.
BACTERIOLOGICAL RESULTS
Bacteriological results, when possible to extract from the publications, are summarized in
Table II. Development of resistance was seen mainly in Ps. aeruginosa; 11 % of all strains,
corresponding to 45% of persisting strains emerged as resistant during treatment. This is
not surprising since Ps. aeruginosa tends to become resistant to all antibiotics used as
monotherapy, especially when the infections are located to the lower respiratory tract,
bone tissues or soft tissues. Probable explanations for this phenomenon are high inocula at
the sites of infection, slow growth rate of the organisms and difficulties to achieve
sufficiently high concentrations of drug in tissues and tissue fluids. Importantly, the
frequencies of development of resistance against ciprofloxacin in this series seem not to be
higher than those expected with other antibiotics if used as monotherapy.
SAFETY
Studies in patients with osteomyelitis are unique in that they require treatment times
which are considerably longer than those normally employed with antibiotics. These

studies therefore offer a possibility to evaluate side effects in patients receiving high doses
for prolonged times. Table III summarizes the safety data from papers reviewed here. A
total of seven patients (3.5 %) were reported to have discontinued treatment due to
adverse effects. Some adverse reactions should be mentioned. Photosenzitation has
previously been reported in low frequencies but appeared in three patients in these
studies. Two of the cases occurred in our trial (5). Both patients were exposed to sunlight
during the late spring when they were sunbathing on snow, that is, the ultraviolet light
exposure was intense. Renal failure was reported in a patient in whom there was no other
obvious reason for renal impairment and was reversible when treatment with ciprofloxacin
was discontinued (7). Crystalluria was reported in three patients in one trial (4) and in
another one(ll) occasional small crystals were noted in some patients. These observations
call attention to the fact that in osteomyelitis, ciprofloxacin is used at higher doses than are
normally given and the risk of crystalluria may therefore increase, especially in patients
with alkaline urine. The possible effects on chromosomes were studied in consecutive
samples from some of our patients (5) during prolonged periods of treatment and no signs
of chromosomal damage were seen (13). In general, the adverse effects of ciprofloxacin
treatment reported in these studies, did not differ from those compiled in large reviews of
trials performed in the USA or Europe (14).
CONCLUSIONS
The studies reviewed here, stongly indicate that oral ciprofloxacin treatment of osteomyelitis caused by Gram-negative bacteria is a safe and efficaceous alternative to other, and
normally more toxic, antibiotics. The optimal dose seems to be 750 mg twice daily and
treatment times should be prolonged.

Twenty-six elderly patients with chronic leg ulcers infected by Pseudomonas aeruginosa or
other aerobic Gram-negative rods were randomised to two treatment groups. The control
group (eight patients) received conventional local therapy and the other group (18 patients)
wastreated with oral ciproftoxacin for three months in addition to conventional local therapy.
In the beginning of the study both groups were comparable with the age of the patients and
the associated diseases including impairment of arterial and venous circulation in the lower
legs. Also the size, duration and the severity of the inftammation reaction in the leg ulcers
were comparable before the start of the therapy. Ciproftoxacin was clinically more effective
than the standard therapy in reducing the size of the ulcer (p<O.05). Also the need of extra
systemic antibiotics decreased significantly in the ciproftoxacin group compared with the
controls. In three out of eighteen ciproftoxacin treated patients the leg ulcers disappeared
completely during the three months' study period compared with none in the control group.
However, ciproftoxacin resistant strains, mainly staphylococci, appeared in the leg ulcers in
67 % of the ciproftoxacin treated patients compared with 0 % in the control group (p<O.OI).
No significant side-effects due to ciproftoxacin except the resistant strains were noticed. We
conclude that oral long-term ciproftoxacin therapy is effective in the treatment of chronic leg
ulcer infections due to Gram-negative rods but selection of ciproftoxacin resistant strains is a
problem in this patient group.

INTRODUCTION
Leg and foot ulcers are common diseases, especially in the elderly patient population (1).
The underlying cause of chronic leg ulcers is often impaired venous or arterial circulation
in lower legs. Leg ulcers tend to become chronic. The recurrence rate within a year has
been estimated to be as high as 69% (2) and in a Swedish study only 24% of the leg ulcer
patients were free from recurrences during a three year follow-up period (3).
Leg ulcers easily become infected and Staphylococcus aureus is the most common
microbe isolated from leg ulcers (4). Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other aerobic Gramnegative rods are also common in chronic leg ulcers (4). The clinical significance of
bacterial growth in leg ulcers is often difficult to estimate and generally only local therapy
is used in the treatment of chronic leg ulcers (5, 6).
Ciprofloxacin is a new fluoroquinolone which has a good in vitro acitivity against
aerobic Gram-negative rods including Ps. aeruginosa (7). We have studied, using an open,
comparative study design, the efficacy of systemic long-term ciprofloxacin treatment and
conventional local therapy in patients with chronic leg ulcer infections caused by Ps.
aeruginosa or other aerobic Gram-negative rods.

PATIENTS AND METHODS
Patients. Altogether 27 patients with chronic lower leg ulcers were enrolled in the study. One patient
was excluded from analysis because of a malignant tumor in the leg ulcer. The inclusion criteria for
the study were as follows: adult patient who had at least two months' history ofleg ulcer and isolation
from the ulcer of either Ps. aeruginosa or some other aerobic Gram-negative rod susceptible to
ciprofloxacin. Previous antimicrobial treatment with other antibiotics was no exclusion criterion
provided that the isolated bacteria were still sensitive to ciprofloxacin.
The patients were followed at the Department of Dermatology, Helsinki University Central
Hospital as in- or out-patients depending on the clinical status during the three months study period.
The study protocol was approved in the ethical committee of the Department of Dermatology,
Helsinki University Central Hospital. The purpose of the study was explained to the patients and
informed oral consent was obtained.
The systemic antimicrobial treatment. The patients were randomised to two treatment groups. The
first (control) group received conventional local therapy. The second group received, in addition to
conventional local therapy, oral ciprofloxacin 750 mg b.i.d. for three months. The ciprofloxacin dose
was later decreased in seven patients to 250 or 500 rng b.i.d. to give the maximum serum level of 2-4
mg/l. If the patient developed invasive cellulitis with or without fever during the study period, the
physician in charge was allowed to start extra systemic antimicrobial treatment based on the antibiotic
resistance pattern of the bacteria isolated from the wound or other sites considered clinically as
significant infection.
Local treatment. The leg ulcers were bathed daily in warm water with desinfectants (chlorhexidine
or potassium permanganate). Necrotic debris was removed both mechanically and with enzymatic
digestion (clostridial peptidase or streptokinase-streptodornase under wet compresses). No local
antibiotic creams were used. The clean ulcers with granulation tissue were coated with dextranomer
paste or with artificial skin covering (Duoderm dressing).
Bacterial cultures. Bacterial cultures derived from chronic leg ulcers were sent to the Department
of Bacteriology, University of Helsinki in Stuart transport medium. Aerobic and anaerobic cultures
were performed and the bacteria were identified as described by Lennette et aI. (8). Susceptibility
tests of all infecting organisms to ciprofloxacin were performed using ciprofloxacin 5 ug susceptibility disc and the strains were considered susceptible if the zone of inhibition exceeded 19 mm.
Statistical methods. The r-test or Fischer's two-tailed exact test were used in the comparison ofthe
two groups.
RESULTS
The two study groups were comparable in the beginning of the study (Table I). No
significant differences were found in the size, duration or the severity of the inflammation
of the leg ulcers. Also the underlying diseases and associated illnesses were similar in both
groups. Pre-treatment, Ps. aeruginosa was isolated from the leg ulcers in 63% of the
control group patients and in 61% of the ciprofloxacin treated patients.
The clinical improvement defined either as a total disappearance of the leg ulcers during
the study period or significant decrease in the size of the leg ulcer 00% reduction of the
sum of the maximum lenght and width of the ulcer) was clearly more common in the
ciprofloxacin group compared with the control group (Table II). Sixty-seven percent of the
ulcers improved in the ciprofloxacin group compared with the 13% in the control group
(p<0.05). There was also significantly less need for extra systemic antimicrobial treatment
(Table II) in the ciprofloxacin treatment group. Major surgical treatment like amputation
or skin transplantation was also less frequent in the ciprofloxacin group although this
difference did not reach statistical significance (Table II).
Also bacteriological improvement, defined as the disappearance of the original aerobic
Gram-negative rods from the leg ulcers, was more common in the ciprofloxacin group
compared with the control group; 83% vs. 25% (p<0.05; Table III). However, in the end
of the study there were significantly more ciprofloxacin resistant strains in the leg ulcer
cultures from the ciprofloxacin treatment group compared with the controls where all the

isolated Ps. aeruginosa and other Gram-negative strains were still fully susceptible to
ciprofloxacin (Table III).
The major ciprofloxacin resistant leg ulcer flora consisted of Ps. aeruginosa (two
patients), Acinetobacter spp (three patients), Staphylococcus epidermidis (three patients)
and Staphylococcus aureus (four patients).
No significant side-effects related to ciprofloxacin were noticed except mild, transient
nausea in three patients receiving ciprofloxacin and the above mentioned resistant strains.
None of the side-effects caused discontinuation of ciprofloxacin treatment.

DISCUSSION
The present study shows that three months treatment with oral ciprofloxacin combined
with the conventional local treatment is clinically effective in reducing the size of chronic
leg ulcers infected with Ps. aeruginosa or other Gram-negative rods. In three out of 18
ciprofloxacin treated patients (17%) the leg ulcers disappeared completely compared with
none in the control group. This is a good clinical result when taking into account that the
leg ulcers were chronic (average duration of the ulcers was about 5 years in the ciprofloxacin group) and that the patients were old and suffered grave insufficiency both of arterial
and venous circulation of the lower legs.
The major disadvantage with the ciprofloxacin treatment was the selection of resistant
strains, mainly staphylococci in the leg ulcer bacterial flora. However, that did not
necessarily mean clinical failure and in addition the isolated Staph. aureus strains, although resistant to ciprofloxacin, remained susceptible to many other antibiotics including
p-lactams.
Conventional local treatment is not very effective in chronic leg ulcers infected with Ps.
aeruginosa as shown in the results of the control group. In addition, systemic antibiotics
had to be given often (in 75% of the cases) to the control patients during acute exacerbations of the leg ulcer infections or for the treatment of symptomatic urinary tract infections
which are common in this patient group. This should be taken into account when
economical aspects on the treatment are considered. The patients with chronic leg ulcers
need a lot of both in- and out-patients health care resources and are expensive patients.
Thus, even a small reduction in their numbers achieved with a new treatment modality
would be very important in the future when the population grows older. The number of the
patients with chronic leg ulcers will probably increase if only the current conventional
local treatment is used.
An important question is how to select the patients with chronic leg ulcers who benefit
mostly from long-term treatment with ciprofloxacin. The clinical significance of bacterial
growth in lower leg ulcers is difficult to determine and it does not correlate well with the
outcome of the treatment (5, 6). The patient material in the present study was too small to
address specifically the question which clinical parameters are best to predict the favourable outcome of the long-term treatment with ciprofloxacin in patients with chronic leg
ulcers. Small size of the ulcer probably means a good prognosis. Thus, earlier start or
longer duration of treatment with ciprofloxacin might give better results than in this study.
The tolerance of the long-term treatment with ciprofloxacin does not seem to be a major
obstacle in the treatment of the patients with chronic leg ulcers although the patients are
elderly. However, the above mentioned questions should be studied in more detail before
widespread treatment with ciprofloxacin can be recommended in patients with lower leg
ulcers.

Twenty patients (17-27 yr) with cystic fibrosis were given ciproftoxacin at 30 pulmonary
infectious exacerbations. AU patients were chronically colonized with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Twenty-five courses were completed, 13 orally (15 mglkg b.i.d.) and 12 intravenously
(4-6 mglkg b.l.d.). Clinical efficacy was excellent or good in 85-90 % of the courses and
growth of P. aeruginosa was markedly reduced in 33-46 %. Body weight and clinical score
improved significantly. White blood cell count decreased and pulmonary function was
improved. Reversible adverse effects, mainly rash and urticaria, appeared at seven occasions,
five severe enough to cause interruption of treatment. Clinical efficacy and tolerance were
better with oral than intravenous administration at the dosages used in this study. Excellent
bioavailability provides additional basis for oral treatment with ciproftoxacin in cystic fibrosis
patients.

INTRODUCTION
Antibiotic treatment of Pseudomonas aeruginosa exacerbations in patients with cystic
fibrosis (CF) usually results in clinical improvement but seldom in eradication of P.
aeruginosa from the sputa (1). The development of new quinolones, especially ciprofloxacin, with high activity against pseudomonas strains, have for the first time made oral
therapy possible to these patients (2, 3). Some studies in CF have shown that the clinical
results of treatment with oral ciprofloxacin are comparable to those obtained with conventional intravenously administered IJ-lactam antibiotics and aminoglycosides (4-6). However, some reports have also shown that oral ciprofloxacin especially in the severely ill
patients, was less efficacious than the conventional intravenous regimens (6, 7). Since
intravenous treatment generally is considered more efficient in patients with CF, we
performed a comparative study with orally versus intravenously administered ciprofloxacin in this group of patients. The clinical and bacteriological results are reported here.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Patients
Twenty patients with CF, II males and nine females, aged 17-27 yr (mean 22 yr) were studied on
occasions of mild clinical exacerbations of the chronic pulmonary infection (S). All patients had the
basic treatment of inhalation with mucous dissolving agents, pancreatic enzyme supplementation and
fat soluble vitamins in water dispersion. All patients had pathological sweat tests (CI>SO mmollI) and
were diagnosed in early infancy or childhood with a mean duration since diagnosis of 21 years (range
16.5-27 years). The patients had had pulmonary symptoms for a mean of 16 yr (range 8--22 years) and
all were chronically colonized with P. aeruginosa for 6-16 years (mean 11.2 years). Fourteen patients

had mucoid P. aeruginosa and 12 patients were also colonized with Staphylococcus aureus. Their
mean clinical score according to Shwachmann (9) was 70 (range 26-96). All patients except three had
normal height and weight. Two patients had diabetes mellitus, one patient had liver cirrhosis and one
was treated in the terminal stage of the disease.
The study was approved by the Ethical Committee of Karolinska Institutet and the University of
Lund and informed consent was obtained from the patients and in some cases also from the parents.
Dosage ofantibiotics
Ciprofloxacin (Ciproxinv, Bayer AB) was given orally (15 mg/kg body weight b.i.d.) or intravenously
(6 mg/kg body weight b.i.d., except two patients who received 4 mg/kg). The intention was that all
patients should receive both kinds of treatment. The intravenous administration was given as short
term infusion for 30 min.
Bacteriology
Sputum samples were collected before treatment, on day 5, at the end of treatment, and four weeks
after treatment and were cultivated as previously described (10). Dilution of the samples allowed
quantification of the bacteria (11).
Laboratory investigations
Blood and urine were examined for hematological, renal and hepatic function tests at beginning of
therapy, after five to six days, at end of treatment and at the follow up examination one month later.
Blood gas analyses and spirometry (Bernstein) were performed at start and end of treatment
according to routine.
Statistics
Student's paired r-test was used for statistical analysis.
RESULTS
Clinical outcome
Thirty treatments were initiated in the 20 patients, 17 courses intravenously and 13 orally.
Eight patients were given both kinds of treatments. Four intravenous courses (two in one
patient) had to be interrupted during the first day due to allergic reactions, mainly rash and
urticaria. One further intravenous course was terminated on the sixth day because of
itching. Thus, 25 courses were completed with a mean treatment time of 10 days (range
10-14 days). Eleven of 13 completed oral treatments were clinically successful. The other
two patients were treated with p-Iactams and aminoglycosides immediately after the study
period. Eleven of 12 complete intravenous regimens resulted in clinical improvement. One
girl had to start conventional treatment within two weeks after the end of the ciprofloxacin
course. One patient in terminal stage of the disease died four days after end of treatment
although clinical improvement was noticed during therapy.
Significant improvements were noticed in body weight, clinical score, lung function
tests and white blood cell eounts. Generally, the results with the oral regimen were better
than those obtained with the intravenous treatment (Table I). The differences were also
significant for patients treated both orally and intravenously (n=8). No changes were
noted in erythrocyte sedimentation rates, serum concentrations of alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) and alkaline phosphatases, serum electrolytes and blood urea concentrations.
Bacteriological outcome
Most patients harboured more than One strain of P. aeruginosa. Eradication of some
strains of P. aeruginosa was seen in five patients. Two mucoid and one non-mucoid strain
were eradicated after the oral courses and three mucoid and One non-mucoid strain
disappeared during the intravenous regimens. In two patients the bacteria were eradicated

treatments P. aeruginosa strains were reduced more than 2 log or eradicated. Ciprofloxacin thus resulted in partially successful bacteriological outcome in to of 25 completed
courses. Resistance to ciprofloxacin developed in one strain and decreased sensitivity in
another one during oral treatments, but the strains were again fully sensitive at follow up
one month later.
S. aureus was eradicated or markedly reduced (>2 log) in five of seven colonized
patients treated orally but only in one of eight colonized patients treated intravenously. On
the other hand, S. aureus appeared as a superinfection in two patients during oral
administration of ciprofloxacin.
Adverse reactions
Urticarial reactions were seen in four patients, two experienced generalized itching, one
had a rash and one developed thrombophlebitis. Therapy had to be stopped in five patients
because of the adverse reaction. The patient who developed thrombophlebitis completed
the treatment but new venous access had to be obtained daily. One patient developed
diarrhoea during the oral course but the treatment could be completed. Biochemically,
small but significant increases were noted in the serum concentrations of aspartate
aminotransferase (ASAT) and creatinine. All adverse effects were reversible and no
biochemical abnormalities were seen at the follow up one month later.
DISCUSSION
The clinical results were satisfactory in 85-90 % of the treatment courses with slightly
better bacteriological outcome in the orally treated group. Eradication or marked reducTable I. Clinical and laboratory data in patients with cystic fibrosis given ciprofloxacin intravenously or orally for ten days at pulmonary exacerbations. Mean ± SEM

tion of some pseudomonas strains were obtained in 46% as compared to 33% of the
intravenous treatment courses. The level of efficacy for ciprofloxacin therapy correlates
with earlier reports (4--6, 12-14). Oral treatment also seemed to reduce the growth of S.
aureus. The objective improvements were less marked in the intravenously treated group
(Table I), and the patients experienced a slower improvement than with conventional
antipseudomonal treatment. The dose difference between intravenous and oral regimens
may explain the difference in efficacy. When this study was planned, higher doses than 6
mg/kg intravenously had not been satisfactorily evaluated. Since the oral bioavailability of
ciprofloxacin had been reported to be about 60% in healthy volunteers (15), we expected
our intravenous and oral doses to be reasonably comparable. Preliminary pharmacokinetic
evaluation in 5 of our patients indicate, however, that the bioavailability is much higher
(81.5%) in the CF patients (Ljungberg et al, data to be published). Hence, the oral and
intravenous dose levels are not comparable. Despite this, the adverse reactions were
almost exclusively seen during intravenous treatment (Table I), making an increase of
intravenous dose questionable. The patients in this study have been subject to pharmacokinetic investigations (Ljungberg et al., data to be published), but only limited information
from 5 subjects (age 17-25 yr; mean body weight 56.0 kg) is available at present. The mean
glomerular filtration rate, determined by iohexol clearance (16) was 155 mlimin. At regular
intervals during 12 h after the first iv and oral doses, serum concentrations of ciprofloxacin
have been determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (17). Pharmacokinetic
variables have been calculated according to model-independent methods (18). The kinetic
observations should be treated with caution, since the number of subjects analysed are
few. It is notable, however, that total clearance of ciprofloxacin was higher (905 vs. 488
mli(minx 1.73 m2
» and Vd(ss) larger (219 vs. 132 l/l ,73 m2
) in these CF patients than in 8
healthy male volunteers given 250 mg intravenously in an earlier study at our laboratory
(19). The CF patients were smaller, but the described differences are only slightly changed
by omitting the correction of data to body surface area. The terminal half-life in our 5
patients was similar after iv and oral administration (3.22 and 3.05 h, respectively). Our
preliminary findings on distribution and elimination differ from the basically unchanged
kinetics previously obtained in "healthy" volunteers with CF (20). The state of disease in
our patients may explain this difference, but the kinetics must be further analyzed before
conclusions are drawn.
Adverse effects such as rash, urticaria and phlebitis have been noticed before and during
intravenous administration (21). Nausea was not experienced by our group of patients. All
adverse effects were reversible within hours after stopping the infusion. The transient
increase of serum concentration of liver enzymes have often been observed during
antibiotic treatments (11, 22).
Our study clearly shows that oral administration of ciprofloxacin is preferable in
treatment of CF. Preliminary data indicate interesting disease associated changes in the
absolute bioavailability of this drug.

Clinical Efficacy of Ciprofloxacin in Lower Respiratory
Tract Infections
SVEND STENVANG PEDERSEN
Statens Seruminstitut's Department ofClinical Microbiology at Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark
The sputum pharmacokinetics and clinical efficacy of ciproftoxacin in lower respiratory tract
infections is reviewed. FoUowingintravenous administration, ciproftoxacin penetrates rapidly
into bronchial tissue; the elimination half life is between 3 and 4 h and a dose dependency is
seen. FoUowing oral Intake, the time to reach maximal concentrations is approximately two
hours and after a dose of 750 mg the concentration may reach 1.7 mg/l in patients without
cystic fibrosis and range from 0.5 to 3.4 mg/lln cystic fibrosis patients. Coadministration of
ciproftoxacin increases serum levels and decreases total body clearance of theophylline. In
controUed comparative clinical trials, ciproftoxacin has been found to have similar clinical
efficacy as amoxyciUin, ampiciUin, cefalexin, doxycycline, co-trimoxazole, imipenem-cilastatin and ceftazidime for the treatment of a range of lower respiratory tract infections.
Ciproftoxacin has been found to be superior in clinical efficacy to cefaclor. Experimental
animal models suggest a role for ciproftoxacin in infections caused by Legionella pneumophila
and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. The clinical and bacteriological efficacy of ciproftoxacin is less
pronounced in lung Infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but is comparable to the
combination of beta-Iactams and aminoglycosides. Development of resistance is frequently
observed during ciproftoxacin treatment of Ps, aeruginosa. Because of the awilability of other
oral and effective agents, ciproftoxacin is not recommended for empirical treatment of
community acquired lower respiratory infections, but should be reserved for infections
caused by multiply resistant organisms.

INTRODUCTION
Respiratory tract infections are major causes of morbidity due to infectious agents and,
when caused by bacteria, they are usually amenable to treatment with oral antibiotics.
Amongst patients admitted for pneumonia Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus
influenzae are the most prevalent aetiologic agents of community acquired pneumonia
followed by legionella, mycoplasma and virus 0, 2, Table I). Likewise, acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis is frequently caused by S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae and
often Branhamella catarrhalis is implicated in the exacerbations (3). In Northern Europe, S.
pneumoniae stills remains sensitive to penicillin and the frequency of ampicillin-resistance
of H. influenzae is approximately 7% (4). Oral {3-lactam antibiotics active against these
agents are therefore commonly recommended for empirical therapy (5). Lower respiratory
tract infections acquired during admission to hospital is often caused by gram-negative
bacteria, the sensitivity pattern of which reflects the prevalent flora of the particular
hospital. Therefore, no general recommendation for choice of antibiotics can be forwarded
as each case must be treated individually following culture and sensitivity testing.
The fluoro-quinolones have excellent in vitro activity against H. influenzae, B. catarrhalis and Enterobacteriaceae (6), whereas activity against other respiratory tract pathogens
such as S. pneumoniae (7), legionella (8), mycoplasma (9), mycobacteria (0) and Ps.
aeruginosa (1) is more moderate.
This paper will review studies published on the pharmacokinetics of ciprofloxacin

the use of ciprofloxacin in respiratory tract infection in order to assess the future role of
ciprofloxacin.
PHARMACOKINETIC STUDIES
In order to predict the clinical efficacy of a drug it is crucial to consider the concentrations
which are attainable at the site of infection. However, even within the lung that site may
differ, for example Legionella pneumophila is found intracellularly whereas Ps. aeruginosa
is located endobronchially in the small airways in cystic fibrosis patients (12). Comparisons of published data may be difficult because of differences in technique; samples may
be obtained as expectorated sputum (13, 14, 15), bronchial biopsy (16, 17) or by fiberoptic
bronchoscopy (18); the sample may be processed by homogenization (16), sonication (19)

elimination half-life were found to be between three and four hours (15). The concentrations in sputum were dose-dependent (13, 15), reaching maximal levels of 0.56 to 1.3 mg/l
following a 500 mg dose (13, 18,21). The penetration calculated as the relation between the
area under the sputum and serum levels at two hours was 0.19 to 0.22 (18, 21). The
concentration in sputum declined at a slower rate than in serum, consequently the
sputum/serum ratio increased during the dosing interval (18). Following intravenous
administration the low serum concentrations account for the very high ratios seen (16). A
trend toward accumulation of ciprofloxacin was seen when multiple dose studies were
performed (15).
Ciprofloxacin penetrates well into phagocytic cells and is concentrated in human neutrophils to concentrations that are between four and seven times higher than the extracellular
ones (22).
Table III shows a summary of six pharmacokinetic studies in patients with cystic
fibrosis (CF). HPLC seems to give higher levels than bioassays, indicating that the
bioactivity of ciprofloxacin in purulent sputum might be lower than the total amount
present. Surprisingly, Stutman et al. did not observe any difference in sputum concentrations when using either 750 mg b.i.d. or 1000 mg b.i.d., but found that drug concentrations
increased until four hours after administration (25). The penetration into bronchial secretions at two hours ranged from 10% to 49% of serum levels (14, 19, 23) which is in
accordance with studies in patients without CF (18, 21). The sputum concentration
following an oral dose of 750 mg ranged from 0.2-1.31 two hours after intake to 0.9-3.4
four hours after intake. CF-patients have malabsorption due to pancreatic insufficiency,
but this does not seem to affect absorption of ciprofloxacin.

The sputum concentrations often exceed the concentrations necessary to inhibit respiratory tract pathogens (Table I). However, the concentration may be borderline for treatment of S. pneumoniae, Staph. aureus, M. pneumoniae, L. pneumophila and Ps. aeruginosa. During treatment of Ps. aeruginosa the MIC often increases (26). In a comparative
study of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin it was found that at two hours after administration the
concentration of ciprofloxacin in sputum was lower in 13 out of 18 patients than the MIC
of ciprofloxacin tested against the most resistant Ps. aeruginosa isolated from each patient.
There was no statistically significant difference to ofloxacin (14).
INTERACTION WITH THEOPHYLLINE
Many patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) receive bronchodilating treatment with theophylline and, unexpectedly, during clinical trials with quinolones it
was observed that the serum concentration of theophylline increased in some patients. In a
clinical trial of oral ciprofloxacin 750 mg b.i.d. Raoof et al. found that the mean serum
theophylline level in 33 patients increased from 7.8 mg/l before treatment to 14.6 mg/l
following treatment. Sixty-one percent had increased serum levels during treatment (mean
increase 10.5 gil) and in nearly one-third of these the theophylline concentrations were in
the toxic range (27). Wijnands et al. found that significantly increased plasma theophylline
concentrations and decreased total body clearance of theophylline was seen during coadministration of enoxacin, ciprofloxacin or pefloxacin in that order of interaction, whereas co-administration of ofloxacin and nalidixic acid did not change the pharmacokinetics of
theophylline suggesting that the interaction is due to the 4-oxo-metabolite of enoxacin,
ciprofloxacin and pefloxacin (28). These data have been confirmed by Stille et al. when
they investigated caffeine elimination during co-administration with 4-quinolones (29).
Serum levels of theophylline should be monitored in patients who also receive ciprofloxacin.

Ciprojloxacin in respiratory tract infections 93
COMPARATIVE CLINICAL TRIALS
Table IV summarizes the results of 12 comparative clinical trials of ciprofloxacin in a
variety of lower respiratory tract infections, including acute bronchitis, acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, other COPD and rather few pneumonias. Ciprofloxacin
showed significantly better clinical efficacy than cefaclor (33) and similar clinical efficacy
as amoxycillin (30, 39), ampicillin (36, 37, 41), cephalexin (31), bacampicillin (32), cotrimoxazole (34) doxycycline (35), imipenem/cilastatin (38) and ceftazidime (40). The
infections were caused by a wide range of different pathogens. In the studies where
bacteriological evaluation were performed the eradication ·rate following ciprofloxacin
treatment ranged from 73 to -100% and for the comparative drugs from 31 to 100%.
However, in several of the studies, the percentage of the initially isolated pathogens that
were resistant to the treatment with ampicillin or amoxycillin were very high, 30 and 45%
respectively (37, 41), whereas all pathogens were sensitive to ciprofloxacin. The data
published in the comparative trials do not permit analysis of the efficacy of ciprofloxacin
in respiratory tract infections (RTI) caused by S. pneumoniae or any other single agent.
Several trials have found a similarly good clinical efficacy of low-dose ciprofloxacin (250

found that low-dose ciprofloxacin did not increase theophylline levels (41).
ATYPICAL PNEUMONIA
No comparative clinical trials have been published concerning treatment of RTI caused by
legionella, chlamydia or mycoplasma. However, there are some experimental animal data
indicating that ciprofloxacin may be useful in these infections.
Aerosol or intraperitoneal administered ciprofloxacin prevented death in L. pneurnophila infected guinea pigs and caused marked reduction in the number of bacteria (42, 43).
Ciprofloxacin was equally effective as rifampicin (42,43), and superior to erythromycin in
preventing death and reducing bacterial counts (42).
Ciprofloxacin was able to reduce the histopathological lesions in an experimental model
of Mycoplasma pneumoniae in golden syrian hamsters, but the number of colony forming
units of M. pneumoniae remained unaltered. Similar results were obtained with erythromycin and tetracycline (9).
The MIC of Mycobacterium tuberculosis is ,,;;;0.5 mg/l (10). In a model of tuberculosis,
animals were treated for 90 days with ciprofloxacin alone, isoniazid alone or a combination
of the two. The combination showed greater efficacy that either drug alone (44).
RESPIRATORY TRACT INFECTIONS CAUSED BY PS. AERUGINOSA
The quinolones offer the first possibility of oral treatment of Ps. aeruginosa infections at
sites other than the urinary tract. Several noncontrolled trials have been published and the
overall results are generally not as favourable as for other pathogens. In non-CF-patients
with Ps. aeruginosa infection of the respiratory tract Scully et al. (45) found a clinical
efficacy rate of 69% and a bacteriological failure rate of 88%. In another study eight of
nine patients responded clinically but only five patients showed bacteriological eradication
(46). A major problem in the treatment of Ps. aeruginosa infections is the frequent
emergence ofresistance (45, 47,48) which may limit the usefulnes of ciprofloxacin.
In patients with CF and chronic Ps. aeruginosa lung infection, short-term treatment with
ciprofloxacin was comparable to azlocillin combined with gentamicin (49), azlocillin plus
tobramycin (50) and ofloxacin (26, 51) in terms of clinical efficacy. Chronic Ps. aeruginosa
infection is a slowly progressive pulmonary infection and clinical efficacy must therefore
also be evaluated over a long period. In a 20 months study, Jensen et al. found that
quinolone monotherapy could not replace conventional antipseudomonal chemotherapy
consisting of f3-lactams plus tobramycin (52).
CONCLUSIONS
Quinolones like ciprofloxacin have high in vitro activity against a wide range of bacteria,
which are otherwise difficult to treat with orally administered antimicrobials. In order to
preserve the activity of the quinolones they should be used only when prior culture and
sensitivity testing has shown that no other equally effective oral agent is available. The
quinolones should therefore not be used for empirical therapy of community-acquired
pneumonia or acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, where a f3-lactam drug should be
prescribed, but may prove useful for treatment of nosocomial pneumonia caused by
multiply resistant gram-negative bacteria.
Furthermore, ciprofloxacin may have a role in the treatment of respiratory infections
caused by M. pneumoniae and L. pneumophilia as animal experiments have shown

favourable results, but clinical data are still lacking. The concentrations of ciprofloxacin
which can be obtained in the broncial secretions are just marginal against these pathogens
and because of that, the use of low-dose ciprofloxacin does not seem attractive for the
treatment of respiratory tract infection in those patients. In patients with CF, ciprofloxacin
has already become a very useful supplement to the antimicrobial armamentarium. The
interaction of ciprofloxacin with theophylline metabolism warrants caution in the treatment of patients receiving theophylline.

Suppression of the Oropharyngeal and Gastrointestinal
Microflora by Ciprofloxacin: Microbiological
and Clinical Consequences
CHARLOTTA EDLUND and CARL ERIK NORD
Department ofMicrobiology, Karolinska Institute, Huddinge University Hospital
and National Bacteriological Laboratory, Stockholm, Sweden
The impact of ciproDoxacin on the human oropharyngeal and gastrointestinal microDora has
been studied by several authors during the last years. The use of ciproDoxacin for selective
decontamination in immunocompromised patients has also been investigated. This review
article summarizes the published data concerning these studies. The results show that the
impact on the oropharyngeal microDora is minor. Administration of ciproDoxacin leads to a
rapid elimination of the major components of the aerobic Gram-negative intestinal microDora, The aerobic Gram-positive Dora is partly affected, while the impact on the anaerobic
microorganism is minor. Oral ciproDoxacin given prophylactically to immunocompromised
patients during severe granulocytopenia prevented colonization with potentially pathogenic
aerobic Gram-negative rods, and reduced the incidence of infections caused by these microorganisms. There was no effect on the incidence of aerobic Gram-positive or fungal infections.
Administration of ciproDoxacin seems not to predispose to the development of resistant
microorganisms.

INTRODUCTION
The normal microflora of the gastrointestinal tract is a major source of microorganisms
causing infections in immunocompromised patients (l, 2). The natural colonization resistance provided by the endogenous microflora is disturbed by frequent use of antimicrobial
agents in these patients (3-5). Prolonged periods of low neutrophil counts and disruption of
mucosal barriers by irradiation and various chemotherapeutical agents facilitates for
potential pathogenic microorganisms of the normal flora and the hospital environment to
cause systemic infections. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacteria and yeasts are common organisms causing severe and often lethal infections in granulocytopenic patients.
Selective decontamination of the gastrointestinal tract by different antimicrobial agents
have been successfully used to prevent infections in compromised patients (6, 7). The
antimicrobial spectrum of such a drug should be directed against aerobic Gram-negative
rods, while the activity against anaerobic microorganisms should be minimal.
Ciprofloxacin is highly active in vitro against aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, including
Ps. aeruginosa. It has a moderate activity against aerobic Gram-positive microorganisms,
while very poor activity against anaerobic microorganisms has been reported (8). Ciprofloxacin is well absorbed after oral administration. In spite of this, very high concentrations of ciprofloxacin are obtained in intestinal content, probably due to transintestinal
secretion (9).
This review summarizes the published data on the suppression of the gastrointestinal
microflora by ciprofloxacin. The use of ciprofloxacin for selective decontamination in
immunocompromised patients is also reviewed.

EFFECT OF CIPROFLOXACIN ON THE OROPHARYNGEAL
AND GASTROINTESTINAL MICROFLORA
Brumfitt et al. (10) studied the influence on the faecal flora in twelve male healthy subjects
given 500 mg ciprofloxacin tablets every 12 h for seven days (Table I). Marked changes in
the aerobic colon microflora were observed. Enterobacteria were absent on Day 7, and the
numbers of streptococci and staphylococci were significantly reduced. Anaerobic bacteria
were little affected quantitatively but acquired resistance to ciprofloxacin. One week later
the colon microflora had returned to pretreatment levels. On Day 7 the faecal concentrations of ciprofloxacin were high-185-22oo mg/kg.
Enzenberger et al. (11) studied the faecal microflora in 12 volunteers receiving 400 mg
ciprofloxacin orally every 12 h for seven days (Table I). Faecal samples were taken prior
to and several times after the initiation of treatment, and qualitative and quantitative
analyses of the microflora were performed. Escherichia coli was eliminated in all volunteers after two days of treatment. No selection of resistant enterobacteria was seen. The
numbers of anaerobic microorganisms remained unchanged during the trial.
Holt et al. (12) studied the effect of ciprofloxacin on the faecal flora of six volunteers
(Table I). Faecal specimens were cultured before, during and after a five-days course of
ciprofloxacin. There was a marked reduction of Enterobacteriaceae strains in all volunteers during the administration period. Two volunteers were colonized by resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci or corynebacteria, but these strains were not detected after
the eighth day. Anaerobic bacteria were almost unaffected in five of the volunteers,
although in the sixth volunteer the total count fell from 1012 to 109 colony forming units
(CFU) per gram faeces.
The pharmacokinetics of ciprofloxacin and the effect of repeated dosages on the
oropharyngeal and colon microflora in 12 volunteers were studied by Bergan et al. (13;
Table I). The volunteers received 500 mg ciprofloxacin orally b.i.d, for five days. In the
oropharyngeal microflora, only the aerobic Gram-negative cocci were affected. In the
colon aerobic microflora, the numbers of enterobacteria and enterococci decreased markedly, whereas the changes in the anaerobic microflora were minor. Fourteen days after the
drug was discontinued, the oropharyngeal and colon microflora were normalized in all
aspects. No new colonization of ciprofloxacin-resistant bacteria was observed.
Van Saene et al. (14) investigated the impact of ciprofloxacin on the intestinal microflora
with regard to colonization resistance (Table I). Twelve volunteers received 50 mg
ciprofloxacin every six hour for six days. Enterobacteriaceae strains were eliminated from
faeces in all volunteers after two to three days of ciprofloxacin administration. Enterococci were slightly affected and only minor increases of Candida spp. were noticed. No
ciprofloxacin resistant bacteria were acquired by the volunteers. One week after the
treatment had stopped, the flora had returned to normal state.
Esposito et al. (15) evaluated 14 patients with liver cirrhosis treated with ciprofloxacin
for intercurrent urinary tract infections or respiratory tract infections with regard to the
effect on faecal flora (Table I). The doses were 250 mg twice daily or 500 mg once daily for
five to ten days. From day three to six of therapy, the enterobacteria disappeared
completely, and returned to normal levels two weeks after termination of treatment. The
aerobic Gram-positive microflora and the anaerobic microflora were not significantly
affected.
De Vries-Hospers et al. (16) studied the influence of ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin on
the oral and faecal flora (Table I). Ten healthy volunteers received three different oral
doses of either ciprofloxacin (50, 100 and 200 mg) or norfloxacin (100, 200 and 400 mg)
b.i.d. for five days. The oral microflora was not influenced by either quinolone. On day
five, Gram-negative rods were eliminated in all volunteers. Enterococci were suppressed

in some volunteers. All ciprofloxacin treated volunteers became colonized with yeasts in
their faecal flora. As measured by total microscopic counts and by the appearance of f3-
aspartylglycine in faeces, neither of the two quinolones appeared to decrease the anaerobic flora.
Daikos et al. (17) investigated ciprofloxacin, amoxicillin and cefixime for the treatment
of urinary tract infections and the alterations of faecal flora (Table I). Treatment of 11
patients with 500 mg ciprofloxacin b.i.d, for ten days markedly decreased the growth of
the aerobic Gram-negative faecal bacterial flora, while treatment with amoxicillin or
cefixime did not significantly affect the aerobic Gram-negative flora. Only one isolate
(Pseudomonas maltophilia) was resistant to ciprofloxacin (MIC>2 mg/l) after ciprofloxacin
treatment. That strain did not persist during the post-treatment period. There was no
relapse of urinary tract infection one week following ciprofloxacin treatment, while six of
nine patients had a relapse following treatment with amoxicillin or cefixime.
The effect of ciprofloxacin on the faecal flora of patients with cystic fibrosis or
infections with resistant bacteria was studied by Scully et al. (18) (Table I). Eleven patients
received either 500 mg ciprofloxacin b.i.d, or 750 mg ciprofloxacin t.i.d. for seven to 42
days. Stool samples were evaluated before, during and after therapy. Enterobacteriaceae
were eliminated within three days. Occasionally, ciprofloxacin-resistant staphylococci and
streptococci were found in the faecal flora. None of these bacterial species caused
systemic infections.
CIPROFLOXACIN FOR SELECTIVE DECONTAMINATION
OF THE GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT
IN IMMUNOCOMPROMISED PATIENTS
Rozenberg-Arska et al. (19) studied the effect of ciprofloxacin for selective decontamination of the gastrointestinal tract in patients with acute leukemia (Tables I and II). The
effect on the faecal flora was also evaluated. Ciprofloxacin was given prophylactically for
a mean duration of 42 days as a 500 mg dose every 12 h to 15 patients during remission
induction treatment. A rapid elimination of enterobacteria within three to five days was
observed. The numbers of anaerobic non-sporeforming Gram-positive rods and anaerobic
cocci were decreased, while Bacteroides and Clostridium species were not affected. Nine
ciprofloxacin-resistant pseudomonas and acinetobacter strains were recovered but without
coloization or subsequent infection. Four of the five infections diagnosed were caused by
Gram-positive cocci: two by Staphylococcus epidermidis (catheter-related infections) and
two by Streptococcus sanguis (originating from the oropharynx). One infection was caused
by a bacteroides strain associated with lesions in the oropharynx.
Dekker et al. (20) compared ciprofloxacin versus co-trimoxazole plus colistin for infection prophylaxis in patients with severe granulocytopenia (Table II). Twenty-eight adult
patients received 500 mg ciprofloxacin b.i.d, and 28 patients received 160 mg and 800 mg
co-trimoxazole + 200 mg colistin t.i.d. for prevention of infections during remission induction treatment for acute leukemia. Both groups were also treated with amphotericin B as
antifungal prophylaxis. Quantitative cultures from oral washings and faeces were done
twice weekly. Five bacteriologically documented infections occurred in 28 patients receiving ciprofloxacin compared with 14 patients receiving co-trimoxazole plus colistin. No
infections caused by Gram-negative rods were seen in the ciprofloxacin group compared
with seven infections in patients treated with co-trimoxazole plus colistin (p<0.02). These
results suggest that ciprofloxacin is a promising drug for the prevention of infections in
patients with granulocytopenia. Dennig et al. (21) also evaluated the antimicrobial prophylactic efficacy of ciprofloxacin in reducing the frequency of infections in 34 granulocytoDownloaded by [La Trobe University] at 20:19 03 February 2016

penic patients (Table 11). The dose was 500 mg ciprofloxacin b.i.d., and the median
duration of treatment was 17 days (range four to 60 days). There was no infection in 61%
of the treatment courses. Fever about 38°C occurred in 39%. Six patients had a fungal
pulmonary infecton, one patient a supposed viral pneumonia, and two patients had a
docmented bacterial infection. In one patient, there was a septicaemia with Enterobacter

cloacae and in another patient, a urinary tract infection with Klebsiella pneumoniae. There
were no severe side effects. The authors concluded that ciprofloxacin is a potent drug for
prophylaxis of bacterial infections in cancer patients with therapy-induced granulocytopenia.
CONCLUSIONS
The studies reviewed have shown that the administration of ciprofloxacin leads to a rapid
elimination of the major components of the aerobic Gram-negative gastrointestinal microflora. The aerobic Gram-positive flora is affected to various degrees, while the anaerobic
microflora is not significantly reduced. Administration of ciprofloxacin does not seem to
predispose to the development of resistant strains of potentially pathogenic bacteria.
Colonization with yeasts, mostly C. albicans, was seen in some patients during the
ciprofloxacin administration.
Oral ciprofloxacin given prophylactically to immunocompromised patients during severe granulocytopenia prevents colonization with potentially pathogenic aerobic Gramnegative bacteria, and reduces the incidence of infections caused by these microorganisms. However, the incidence of Gram-positive infections in these patients is not reduced.
The favourable ecological properties of ciprofloxacin imply that the colonization resistance provided by the indigenous microflora is preserved. According to the articles
reviewed, ciprofioxacin seems to ue a promising agent for selective decontamination in
immunocompromised patients, since the incidence of Gram-negative infections in these
patients is markedly reduced by administration of ciprofloxacin. However, more effective
prophylaxis of Gram-positive and fungal infections may be needed.

Use of Ciprofloxacin in Patients Undergoing
Transurethral Prostatic Surgery
SVERKER HELLSTEN,I ARNE FORSGREN,2 THOMAS BJORKI and MAGNUS GRABEl

Malmo General Hospital, Malmo, Sweden
The efficacy of a short (Group I) and a prolonged (Group II) course with ciprofloxacin was
assessed in patients undergoing transurethral prostatic resection and compared with that of
controls without antibiotic (Group Iff), Both regimens significantly reduced the frequency of
post-operative bacteriuria (p<O.OI) and of severe infectious complications (p=O.OO4) compared to the controls. Both regimens were equally effective in preventing peri-operative and
post-operative acquisition of bacteriuria in patients without bacteriuria at surgery. In patients
with bacteriuria before surgery, bacteriuria was found post-operatively in 35 % in Group I
and in 9 % in Group II (p=O.OI2), but in 82 % of the patients in Group III. Ciprofloxacin
inhibited all but 7 of 176 bacterial strains at an MIC of ~I Jlg/m1. Given orally, ciprofloxacin
is a valuable alternative antimicrobial for use in conjunction with transurethral prostatic
resection. A short course is sufficient for prophylaxis, and adequate therapy is achieved with
a prolonged regimen.

INTRODUCTION
Transurethral resection (TUR) is the most common operation to relieve patients from
obstructive prostatic hyperplasia and cancer. Bacteriuria is common pre- and post-operatively and severe infectious complications such as septicaemia and upper urinary tract
infections (UTI) is a hazard in the post-operative period. Several investigations have
demonstrated the efficacy of short peri-operative antibiotic courses to reduce the frequency of post-operative bacteriuria through a prophylactic and a therapeutic effect and to
prevent infectious complications (I, 2).
Ciprofloxacin has an antimicrobial activity (3) that is appropriate for treatment of most
bacteria isolated in urine of patients with bladder outflow obstruction. The aims of the
study were (i) to analyze the efficacy of a short (three to four days) peri-operative oral
course of ciprofloxacin given to patients undergoing TUR, as prophylaxis in patients
without bacteriuria at surgery or as therapy in those with bacteriuria at surgery, compared
to a control group without antibiotics, (ii) to determine whether a prolongation of the
course for an additional five days would enhance its efficacy, especially in terms of
eliminating post-operative bacteriuria in pre-operatively bacteriuric patients and (iii) to
examine the bacteria isolated pre-operatively and post-operatively during six weeks of
follow-up after surgery and determine their sensitivity to ciprofloxacin and other antimicrobial agents.
MATERIAL
The study comprised 222 patients; 76 men received a three to four days short peri-operative course of
ciprofloxacin (500 mg orally every 12 h (group I), 75 men an eight to nine days course (group II) and 71
patients who served as controls received no peri-operative antibiotic treatment (group III). The
clinical and per- and post-operative data were comparable in the three groups. The design of the study
Downloaded by [La Trobe University] at 20:19 03 February 2016

was approved by the Ethical Review Committee at the University of Lund and by the Swedish
National Board of Health.
RESULTS
Septicaemia and upper UTI were observed in four and six patients, respectively; all but
two of them in the control group (P<O.OO4; Table I). Post-operative bacteriuria was
significantly lower in both group I and group II as compared with group III (P=O.OO4).
Post-operative bacteriuria recurred in 35% of the patients with pre-operative bacteriuria in
group I but only in 9% in group II (P=O.OI2), the corresponding frequency was 92% in the
controls (spontaneous cure in only 8%). Bacteriuria was acquired post-operatively in 3%
(group I), 2.5% (group II) and 19% (group III) in the patients without bacteriuria before
TUR (Table II).
Ciprofloxacin was effective against both the Gram-negative (58.5%) and the Grampositive (41.5%) flora in our patients. Except for seven enterococci and one acinetobacter
strain, all isolates were inhibited at an MIC 0::;;1 mg/l of ciprofloxacin (Table III). No
emergence of resistant strains was seen post-operatively.

DISCUSSION
Antimicrobial agents are used in conjunction with TUR as therapy in patients with
bacteriuria before surgery, an undisputable indication nowadays, or as prophylaxis, which
is a more controversial issue.
In the present study we evaluated whether the frequency of post-operative urinary tract
infections could be further reduced in a group of patients receiving ciprofloxacin for an
additional five days after catheter removal (group II). The patients without bacteriuria at
TUR were found to do as well as those in group I, (short course) having no additional
advantage of the prolonged course. However, the post-operative refurrence rate in the preoperatively bacteriuric patients was only 9%, a significantly lower proportion. This was
also confirmed by the markedly lower number of patients requiring additional antibiotics.
No emergence of resistant strains was seen post-operatively. A prolongation of the
antibiotic course seemed therefore to be advantageous in this category of patients despite
the potential for increased influence on the microbial flora and adverse reactions. Since
the patients were discharged at an average of 3.5 days after operation, the medication being
continued at home, the risk of nosocomial spread of resistant organisms should be low. No
side effects were registered during the study, although unspecified side effects could easily
be concealed after surgery.
In conclusion, our study showed that oral ciprofloxacin is a valuable alternative antimicrobial for use in conjunction with transurethral prostatic resection. As regards the
efficacy of a short course as compared to a prolonged course with ciprofloxacin we found
that a short course was sufficient for prophylaxis and that adequate therapy was achieved
with a prolonged regimen.

Ciprofloxacin in Meningococcal Carriers
RISTO VISAKORPI
Medical Section, General Headquarters. Finnish Defence Forces, Helsinki, Finland
Chemoprophylaxis of meningococcal disease is stiD necessary in spite of the availability of an
effective vaccine against group A, C, Y and W135 strain meningococci. Aller emergence of
sulphonamide resistant meningococcal strains, rifampin has been the drug used for chemoprophylaxis. Development of rifampin resistance in meningococci during short term prophylactic
treatments makes this treatment less suitable. At present, there are several studies where
ciproOoxacin has shown good effect in eradication of meningococci from nasopharyngeal
carriers. It also seems obvious that one single dose of ciproOoxacin is enough for the purpose.
CiproOoxacin can be recommended for chemoprophylaxis of meningococcal disease in adults.

INTRODUCTION
It is a well-known fact that close contacts lead to clearly increased risk of contracting
meningococcal disease. Experiences and studies from garrisons show an increase in
meningococcal carriers during the beginning of military service and clinical cases often
occur when carrier rates are high. Secondary cases are also common and are not always
close contacts. For these reasons there is a general agreement that meningococcal prophylaxis in close contacts to an index case is necessary. In military units and other similar
populations, a more wide-spread prophylaxis is needed to reduce high carrier rates and
transmission of meningococci.
Vaccination against meningococcal disease offers an effective prophylactic tool especially in larger populations (I). So far there is no vaccine against group B Neisseria
meningitidis and therefore meningococcal disease is still encountered even in populations
vaccined with tetravalent (A, C, Y, W135) vaccine such as recruits in the Finnish Defence
Forces. In many countries the endemic rate of meningococcal disease is so low that
probably it is not worth while to vaccinate regularly the population or part of it. Meningococcal vaccination has little value in preventing disease in close contacts, because of the
rapidity with which secondary cases occur. Furthermore, vaccination is not very effective
in reducing throat carrier rates. Sulphonamides have used to be effective both for reducing
carrier rates and for prevention of secondary cases (2). The emergence of sulphonamide
resistant meningococci during the 1960s significantly lowered their value. Moreover,
during the last years much attention has been paid to the side effects of sulphonamides.
Several studies have shown that minocycline and rifampin are effective in reducing
carrier rates (3, 4). However, with neither of these drugs the efficacy has been satisfactory. Minocycline causes high incidences of side effects and therefore rifampin has
generally been used for prophylaxis of meningococcal disease especially in areas where
sulphonamide resistant strains are common. Resistance against rifampin has been detected
in meningococci after prophylactic treatments (5) and a highly rifampin resistant strain of
Neisseria meningitidis has been isolated from a child contracting meningococcal disease
three days after prophylactic rifampin course (6). Thus there seems to be a need for new
prophylactic drugs for meningococcal disease.

Ciprofloxacin in meningococcal carriers 109
CIPROFLOXACIN STUDIES
The sensitivity ofN. meningitidis to ciprofloxacin in vitro has been high. MIC-values from
0.0005 to 0.008 mg/l have been reported (7). Ciprofloxacin concentrations in saliva after oral
doses of 250 mg have exceeded 0.4 mg/l two hours post-dose (8). In tonsillary tissue
ciprofloxacin concentrations 1.5 times the serum concentrations have been reported (9).
Ciprofloxacin has also been shown to be very effective in the treatment of N. gonorrhoea
infections (10).
At present there are some studies where ciprofloxacin has been used for eradication of
N. meningitidis from nasopharyngeal carriers (Table I). In the study of Renkonen et al.
(11) meningococci were searched for in 552 healthy recruits using throat cultures taken
about one month after the beginning of their military service. The overall carrier rate was
38.6%. All strains were susceptible to ciprofloxacin with minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) 0.004 mg/l in 64% of the strains and 0.008 mg/l in the remaining ones. From
these carriers, 120 of the colonized men were selected for treatment. The treatment was
carried out as a placebo-controlled double-blind comparative trial. Treatment was started
two days after throat culture and consisted of 250 mg ciprofloxacin tablets b.i.d, or
placebo for two days.
Follow-up samples were taken four days after treatment. From the 120men who entered
the study 112 follow-up samples were obtained. Three recruits had an incomplete treatment. The carrier rate was reduced by 96% in the ciprofloxacin group in which only two
men had positive meningococcal throat culture after treatment. In one of them the followup strain was different from the primary strain and in the other case a non-groupable strain
was found in both samples but the ciprofloxacin MIC of the two strains was changed. Also
in the placebo group the carrier rate was reduced but only by 13%. MIC-values were very
similar both before and after treatment in the placebo group. Since only a small part of
carriers are meningococcal carriers for a prolonged time, one can assume that a reduction
of carrier rate and colonization with new meningococcal groups will occur in army
recruits. Three recruits in each group reported slight diarrhoea. In addition, one ciprofloxacin recipient experienced nausea and one reported "flu"-like symptoms.
Pugsley and co-workers have reported two different treatment trials in meningococcal
carriers. In the first trial (12) they treated 42 persons with ciprofloxacin or placebo for five
days. In the ciprofloxacin group there were no carriers during or until 13 days after
treatment. In the placebo group only a slight reduction of the carrier rate was registered. In

their other study (13) a single 750 mg dose was evaluated in an uncontrolled study. Twelve
subjects who had two consecutive positive throat cultures of N. meningitidis were given
the medication and followed for two weeks. Eleven of them remained culture negative
during the whole follow-up. One was culture negative in the first post-treatment sample
but was positive on days 7 and 14.
Gaunt and Lambert performed an uncontrolled trial in an epidemic situation (14). During
an outbreak of group C meningococcal disease in a naval training centre as many as 2100
persons were studied by throat culture and were given a single dose of 500 mg of
ciprofloxacin. A few subjects who refused ciprofloxacin were given a sulphonamide. In the
pre-treatment sample, the prevalence of meningococcal throat carriers was 19.1%. From
the initially positive men, 336 control samples were collected on the fourth post-treatment
day. Ten of those subjects still had positive meningococcal throat cultures (3%). Also at
two months post-treatment follow-up low frequencies of carriership were reported. Side
effects were rare in this study.
CONCLUSIONS
Vaccination is an effective way to prevent meningococcal disease but there are situations
where it is not practical. Thus chemoprophylaxis is still needed for prevention of meningococcal disease. While all the older medications used seem to have drawbacks, it now
seems clear that ciprofloxacin can be recommended as the treatment of choice for this
purpose. A single dose of ciprofloxacin is probably sufficient but controlled studies are not
yet available. The fact that ciprofloxacin is so far not recommended for children restricts
its use in family-contacts and in schools. Further information is needed in this respect.
In military units the use of ciprofloxacin opens new possibilities in handling the prophylaxis after index case since one dose treatment is easy to administer when a large number
of people must be treated and since the efficiency of ciprofloxacin appears to be very high.

Ciprofloxacin in the Elimination of Enteric Salmonella
Carriage Stage
JUHANI LAHDEVIRTA
Aurora Hospital, Helsinki, Finland
According to the present experience, ciprotloxacin seems to be a new promising drug for the
treatment of enteric salmonella carriage stage. This paper reviews results with ciprotloxacin
and older drugs. While the cure rates in previous studies were about 70 %, it was at least 90 %
with ciprotloxacin although the treatment time was shorter and the rate of side effects was
lower. However the final place of ciprotloxacin on this indication needs to be investigated
further.

INTRODUCTION
The carriage stage with chronic salmonella infections is dominated by the intestinal
infections. Urinary carriers and chronic osteomyelitis cases are very rare. Elimination of
salmonella carriership is indicated mainly by preventive epidemiological aspects since the
carriers are potentially infective, especially if they are food handlers or have contacts with
infants or in-patients. There are also economical aspects on lost working days.
The chronic enteric carriage stage is defined as excretion of salmonellae for more than
12 months after the acute infection. Excretion for less than 12 months but more than two
months is called convalescence carriage. It is known that 2% to 3% of patients with
Salmonella typhi infections and less than 1% with other salmonella species develop
chronic carriership (1). The carriage may be biliar, in which case the patients usually have
gallstones or other disorders of biliary tract, or intestinal when the bile is free from
salmonellae.
Normally elimination of the most common non-typhi salmonellae after an acute infection is seen in 16% to 18% after eight weeks, and in 4% to 8% after 12weeks. At 6 months
0.3 % to 2.5 % of the patients are still carriers (1). This natural elimination is the basis for
decisions on medical interventions. Naturally, costs to society resulting from lost working
days, repeated cultures and other medical expences must be considered.
CIPROFLOXACIN AND OTHER TREATMENTS OF ENTERIC
SALMONELLAE CARRIAGE STAGE
In patients with biliary carriage of salmonella, extirpation of the gallbladder has been
successful in 65% to 80% of the patients but has caused a certain post-operative mortality.
During the era of chemotherapy, many antimicrobials, alone or in combinations, have
been used for this purpose. A summary of earlier experiences is presented in Table I. It
shows that chemotherapy did not improve the results since the mean cure rate has
remained about 70%. Thus, the need of better chemotherapeutic agents is obvious.
The third generation cephalosporins have shown good effect against S. typhi and nontyphi salmonella species and the clinical results in the treatment of acute infections have
been promising (11, 12). Little is known about the effect of these drugs on carriage state;
obviously because the new fluoro-quinolones were developed almost simultaneously. The
Downloaded by [La Trobe University] at 20:19 03 February 2016 
Ciprojloxacin salmonella carriage 113
effect of these quinolones against bacterial enteric pathogens is high (13). In addition to
clinical trials in acute infections there are now some results from studies on the treatment
of carriage state with ciprofloxacin. A summary of these studies is presented in Table II.
The cure rates in Table I vary between 21% and 92% and the mean cure rate was
approximately 70%. The studies differ in several aspects, for example criteria for inclusion
and exclusion, bacteriology and follow-up times. The experience with ciprofloxacin is still
much smaller but it promises cure rates in the order of 90%. The high degree of efficacy
could be due to the low MIC values and to the good tissue and intracellular penetration.
Side effects to ciprofloxacin have not been reported. Importantly gallstones did not
prevent cure with ciprofloxacin as they have been reported to do with other treatments (6).
The optimal dosage of ciprofloxacin and duration of treatment have not yet been
defined. As shown in Table II, doses have varied from 750 mg/day to 1500 mg/day and
treatment time from two to four weeks. Two weeks with 1500 mg/day gave a cure rate of
90% but failure in one case with gallstones (18). Four weeks seem to be an unnecessary
long time but two to three weeks with 1500 mg or 1000 rng/day should suffice.

SUMMARY
In the treatment of enteric salmonella carriage, ciprofloxacin has the following advantages:
The efficacy seems to be better than with earlier treatments (90% vs. 70%).
Side effects are rare.
Ciprofloxacin without cholecystectomy may be effective in carriers with biliary disease.
There seems to be no differences in efficacy against various salmonella species, for
example Salmonella paratyphi and S. enteritidis.
The treatment time is shorter with ciprofloxacin than with previously used antibiotics.
Oral administration makes ciprofloxacin suitable for the ambulatory treatment.
The experience with ciprofloxacin in the treatment of enteric salmonella carrier is still
limited but based on the available results, it seems to be a new promising "drug of choice"
for this type of infections. It cannot yet be recommended for children, in whom the third
generation cephalosporins may be equally effective as ciprofloxacin.

Available information about the safety of intravenous (i.v.) administration of ciproOoxacin is
reviewed. No Increased incidence of systemic toxicity is apparent over the oral route. CNS
side effects occur, but at a low rate and they are mild. Caution is indicated in patients with
tendency for seizures. Laboratory changes are minimal, mainly mild elevations of liver
enzymes. No increased risk of crystalluria has been seen. Local side effects in the form of
erythema and burning are relatively common in some volunteer studies and are also seen in
clinical studies, infusion phlebitis also occurs. It is recommended that i.v. ciproOoxacin is
administered in slow infusion through a large or preferably central vein.

INTRODUCTION
One of the advantages of the new quinolones is that many serious infections can be
effectively treated orally. Not all patients can, however, take drugs per mouth for a variety
of reasons. It is therefore important to have available intravenous formulation of these
agents to be able to utilize them in seriously ill patients unable to swallow tablets or when
absorption is deemed questionable. The safety of such administration has to be established, however. Considerable experience has been accumulated in usingciprofloxacin
intravenously and in this review this experience will be summarized. Only safety issues
will be addressed, efficacy will not be discussed.
USE OF LV. CIPROFLOXACIN IN INFECTED PATIENTS
Several articles have been published on the i.v. use of ciprofloxacin (I, 2, 3) and many
studies have recently appeared as abstracts (4-14). Most are primarily devoted to the
efficacy of such treatment rather than specifically evaluating the incidence of side effects.
Because of the heterogeneity of these studies it is unwise to pool these data since the result
would be unlikely to reflect the true incidence of side effects. The systemic side effects
mentioned in these papers are listed in Table L The dose of ciprofloxacin varied from
200-600 mg/day and the duration of treatment was also quite variable but at least several
days. Most of the adverse effects were rare and almost never necessitated the cessation of
therapy. Nausea and/or vomiting were relatively common in two studies (2, 10) but not
mentioned in others (3, 6). Nausea and vomiting are, however, important side effects since
they are almost certainly induced by central nervous system (CNS) effects of the drug.
CNS toxicity of the quinolones has been widely publicized, sometimes manifesting with
hallucinations and they are also believed to reduce the threshold for seizures. No case of
seizure induction from i.v. ciprofloxacin could be found but cases of mild confusion are
documented (14). It seems prudent to be careful in administering ciprofloxacin to patients
with epilepsy or other conditions with increased likelihood of convulsions, the danger
would seem a priori to be increased with i.v. therapy due to higher serum levels. It can not
be seen from the literature that the danger of other systemic side effects are increased by

the intravenous administration. Ciprofloxacin is a remarkably safe antimicrobial agent
regardless of route of administration. Diarrhea is distinctly uncommon compared to other
agents with comparable antibacterial spectrum. Superinfections have been seen which is
not unexpected, the offending organism in most frequently yeast (2, 13).
Changes in laboratory parameters are also rare with the exception of elevation of liver
enzymes, which is relatively common in some studies (3, 5) but usually the elevation is
mild.and reversible. The significance of this is uncertain and the finding is often unspecific
and related to the underlying infection rather than the treatment. No case has been
described where i.v, ciprofloxacin treatment has led to clinical liver disease. Eosinophilia,
another non-specific finding, has been described. Although isolated instances of elevated
serum creatinine and/or urea have been seen (I), it is so rare that it is very unlikely that any
intrinsic nephrotoxicity is associated with i.v. ciprofloxacin therapy. The possibility of
drug interactions should be born in mind. It can be expected that i.v. ciprofloxacin, due to
higher blood levels, would increase the serum concentration of theophylline and related
compounds more readily than when given orally. Based on considerable experience it can
be concluded that the intravenous administration of ciprofloxacin in infected patients does
not carry an extra risk of systemic toxicity compared to the oral route.
Local toxicity in patients
In many ofthe studies reviewed no mention is made oflocal intolerance or side effects. In
others the incidence of infusion phlebitis is rather high. In three studies a total of 15
patients out of 131 or 11.5% developed such phlebitis (2, 9, 10). Rash and pain at injection
site are also mentioned but do not seem to be commonly observed (5, 7).
SAFETY STUDIES IN HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS
We have in a series of studies given healthy individuals ciprofloxacin intravenously in
doses ranging from 200-400 mg twice daily for four days (15, 16, 17). Careful monitoring of
local side effects as well as laboratory and clinical side effects was maintained throughout
the studies and in one study EEG was done prior to the study and repeated on the last day
of treatment.
Systemic safety in healthy 'volunteers
Virtually no systemic side effects were observed in our studies. Mild nausea was seen on
few occasions and one subject complained of eye irritation but only when wearing soft
contact eye lenses during the administration of the drug; this happened repeatedly. No

changes were seen in the EEGs and there was no increased risk of drug crystalluria, which
is solely seen when the urine is alkaline (18). No laboratory abnormalities were observed
except for mild elevation in eosinophil count in few individuals. No liver enzyme elevations were seen in these studies.
Local tolerance in healthy volunteers
Local side effects were fairly common as can be seen from Table II. The cutaneous
reactions consisted of erythema which usually began over the vein used for infusion. The
rash spread centripetally was well demarcated but not elevated. The erythema was rapidly
reversible usually within minutes of the end of infusion. Itching and burning at the site of
infusion also tended to begin early after the start of infusion; not infrequently these
changes stopped before the end of administration. These symptoms were uniformly rather
mild and it was never necessary to stop the infusion. In contrast, on two occasions when
inadvertently some infusion fluid was given subcutaneously, a fairly intense burning pain
developed, this lasted for approximately 10 min and was accompanied by local erythema.
We believe that the cutaneous reactions are caused by non-immunological release of
histamine or histamine-like . vasoactive substances.
.
The size of the vein employed for infusion played a considerable role in determining the
incidence of local side effects. The larger the vein the lesser likelihood of reactions. The
rate of infusion also seemed to be of importance. One hour infusion or longer was less
likely to cause symptoms than 30 min infusion but prolonging the infusion to 2 h offered
only marginal benefit (Table II) (17). Two patients developed thrombophlebitis in the
forearm that took approximately two weeks to resolve completely.
Our conclusions were that symptoms of local intolerance were relatively common when
ciprofloxacin in rather high dosage was given. These symptoms were uniformly mild and
rapidly reversible and it was never necessary to stop the infusion because of them. We
recommend that large veins, preferably central veins, should be used and that infusion
time should be at least one hour.
DISCUSSION
There appears to be discrepancy between the lack of reported local side effects in patients
compared to the fairly high incidence of symptoms in healthy volunteers that we have
observed. Several possible reasons that can explain this phenomenon. Firstly tolerance
studies where close monitoring of subjects is maintained will undoubtedly result in higher
rate of side effects particularly when mild as is the case here. Secondly many of the
patients have received the medication through central vein cathether although not specified in the papers and thus avoiding the cutaneous manifestations. Thirdly it has been

suggested that sick, infected patients might have less vasoactive substances present in
their vessels and skin than healthy subjects and would therefore be less likely to suffer
from erythematous reactions.
It can be concluded from these studies that ciprofloxacin given intravenously has some
irritating effect on the vein used for infusion and can result in infusion phlebitis. This risk
can be significantly reduced by using large veins and avoiding too rapid infusion. Systemic
tolerance is, on the other hand, excellent and adverse effects do not seem to be more
common than associated with oral administration.

Bayer AG, Wuppertal, Federal Republic of Germany
In clinical trials phase U and ill world wide 8861 courses of ciprofloxacin were entered into
the data base for safety evaluation. The following adverse reactions were observed-gastrointestinal 5 %, metabolic and nutritional 4.6 %, central nervous system 1.6 %, skin 1.4 %,
hemic and lymphatic 1 %, cardiovascular 0.4 %, body as a whole 0.4 %, urogenital 0.3 %,
special senses 0.3 %, musculo-skeletal 0.1 %, respiratory 0.08 %. Total incidence of adverse
reactions was10.2 %. Ciprofloxacin interacts with theophylline and certain antacids. Caution
should be exercised in treating patients with known history of convulsions. Crystalluria does
not appear to be a problem. Ciprofloxacin is welltolerated and side effects are usually mild or
moderate in intensity. However, unusual and unexpected reactions have to be watched for.

INTRODUCTION
The marketability of a drug, especially of an antimicrobial agent is highly dependent on its
safety profile. Adverse reactions may be categorized as predictable or idiosyncratic.
Predictable reactions from known pharmacological action of a drug should be avoided by
appropriate measures or at least readily recognized. Idiosyncratic rections, when uncommon, pose a greater problem as their occurrence is unexpected.
This is a review of the tolerance of ciprofloxacin in man and its possible effects on target
organs including the juvenile joints, the kidney and the central nervous system. An
attempt is made to elucidate the clinical implications of various in vitro and animal
toxicological findings reported in the literature.
SAFETY DATA FROM DATA POOL
World-wide 8861 courses from phase II and III studies of ciprofloxacin treatment were
evaluated for drug safety (l, 2). Also included in this evaluation are data from 283 patients
who received ciprofloxacin only by the intravenous route, and 169 who received sequential i.v.Ioral ciprofloxacin.
In 902 patients, 1356 side effects considered by the investigator to be drug related were
reported that is, 10% of the patients experienced adverse events. Some patients reported
more than one side effect. Of the adverse events, 94 % were mild or moderate in intensity
and 6% were serious. Using the Co-START (Co-START coding symbols for thesaurus of
adverse reaction terms-2nd edition-FDA) classification reference the side effects were
classified into the following organ systems: Gastro-intestinal, metabolic and nutritional,
central nervous system, skin, haematological and lymphatic, cardiovascular, urogenital,
respiratory, special senses, musculoskeletal and general complaints or body as a whole.
The reactions are shown in Tables I-VIII.
Adverse events of the gastro-intestinal type occurred most frequently (Table I). The
most frequent complaints were nausea, diarrhoea, dyspepsia, abdominal pain and anorexia. More than one third of all reported events in this pooled data are in this category. The
reactions tended to be dose related.

Metabolic and nutritional type reactions included liver enzyme changes (Table II).
These changes were not related to symptoms and were transient and reversible. Central

had a previous history of epilepsy. We recommend that such risk patients be observed
carefully while on ciprofloxacin and the risk benefit ratio evaluated in each case. The
seizures in these two cases resolved without sequelae.
Skin reactions were observed 122times and were dominated by rashes (Table IV). None
of these reactions were serious or life threatening. In the intravenous treatment group local
skin reactions following infusion were seen.
Eosinophilia was the most frequent observation in the hemic and lymphatic system
(Table V).
Weakness and fever were the most commonly reported adverse event in the group for
reactions in the body as a whole (general complaints) (Table VI).
Among cardiovascular adverse events, the most frequently occurring reactions were
phlebitis and thrombophlebitis attributed to parenteral ciprofloxacin, especially in early
clinical trials (Table VII). These findings became less frequent when an improved galenic
preparation was introduced as infusion solution. A large vein should be chosen for
infusions of ciprofloxacin and infusion should last over 30 minutes for a 200 rng dose.
Despite results from animal studies, crystalluria clearly related to ciprofloxacin was
rarely observed in man. This was usually associated with a higher urinary pH.

DOSE RELATIONSHIP TO ADVERSE REACTIONS
The daily doses studied were 500 mg, 1000 mg and 1500 mg. Only few patients received
more than 1500 mg per day.
There appears to be a higher incidence of adverse reaction with higher doses, especially
with regard to gastro-intestinal and digestive reactions. This is probably due to gastric
irritation. There appears to be no dose relationship as far as CNS reactions are concerned
(Table IX).
SAFETY IN JUVENILE AND THE ELDERLY
All quinolones tested so far can damage articular cartilage in juvenile animals. There are
still many open questions concerning the mechanism, the target, and the relevance for
humans of this toxic effect (3, 4, 5).
Although nalidixic acid is known to cause extensive damage to the cartilage of young
animals, such adverse reactions have not been reported in nalidixic acid treated patients
despite frequent administration to children.

Ciprofloxacin was administered after riskfbenefit evaluation to some children. Table X
shows the adverse reactions reported in 83 patients aged less than 18 years, including
those with cystic fibrosis who received a mean daily dose of 26.2 mg/kg for a mean
duration of 26 days. The reactions seen in this group did not vary significantly from those
in a comparative group of adult patients. Arthralgia was seen in two patients in the juvenile
group and in five patients in the adult group. In none of these patients were radiological
changes found. It should be noted that most health authorities have not approved the use
of ciprofloxacin in patient below 18 years.
Table XI shows the adverse reactions in 375 patients over the age 65 years. The pattern
and incidence of reaction did not differ from a group below 65 years of age. It should be
noted that renal elimination is the major route of elimination of ciprofloxacin. Age
dependent reduction of kidney functions and a possible need for dose adjustments should
therefore be kept in mind. Serum creatinine in elderly patients may not reflect the actual
renal function since the serum creatinine may be normal due to decreased muscle mass in
the elderly (6). Caution should also be exercised in elderly patients with reduced CNS
function.

COMPARISON OF SAFETY
Adverse reactions were not more frequent in ciprofloxacin treated patients than in those
receiving comparative drugs such as co-trimoxazole, amoxicillin, ampicillin and cefotaxime (Table XII). With the quinolones (norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin) adverse
reactions were seen in 6.5 % to 9.2 % of treated patients. Table XIII shows the reactions
seen with various quinolones (7). The group that received ciprofloxacin therapy were
taken from world-wide clinical trials and these patients were carefully monitored for
adverse drug reactions (1).

DRUG INTERACTIONS OF CLINICAL IMPORTANCE
Antacids containing magnesium hydroxide or aluminium hydroxide may interfere with the
absorption of most of the quinolones, resulting in markedly decreased serum and urine
levels. Concurrent administration of ciprofloxacin and these drugs should be avoided (8).
Concurrent use of theophylline and the newer quinolones including ciprofloxacin may
lead to elevated plasma concentrations of theophylline and prolongation of its elimination
half-life. These effects may result in increased risk of theophylline-related adverse reactions. If concomitant use cannot be avoided, plasma levels of theophylline should be
monitored (9).

experiences
a Fromclinical trials only-patients were carefully observed for adverse drug reactions.
It has been reported from animal studies that combined administration of high doses of
quinolones and fenbufen may cause convulsions (10, 11). These interactions have not been
observed in humans treated with ciprofloxacin up to date.
PRECAUTIONS AND CONTRAINDICATIONS
Due to the drug induced arthropathies in juvenile animals, ciprofloxacin should not be
administered to pregnant or lactating women or to children or adolescents whose growth is
not yet complete. Ciprofloxacin should be used with caution in patients with known or
suspected CNS disorders such as severe cerebral arteriosclerosis or epilepsy. A previous
history of hypersensitivity to a quinolone is also a contraindication to use of ciprofloxacin.
Animal studies have shown that at high doses ciprofloxacin causes mild interstitial
nephritis, crystalluria, occult haematuria-as a result of foreign body type reaction (10).
Changes of the renal parameters during clinical trials were rare in patients with normal
renal function who received normal daily dose of ciprofloxacin. However, caution should
be exercised and dose adjustments are recommended in patients with reduced renal
function especially those with a glomerular filtration rate below 20 ml/min. (12, 13).
CONCLUSIONS
Ciprofloxacin has been shown to be a safe and effective addition to the armamentarium of
antibacterial drugs. A majority (94%) of the reported adverse reactions were mild or
moderate in intensity and were reversible. The main advantage of ciprofloxacin over the
standard drugs having similary antimicrobial activity is the lower incidence of serious toxic
reactions as compared for example to the aminoglycosides. However, as with all new
drugs, ciprofloxacin and all other quinolones must be watched for unexpected and unusual
adverse events. If postmarketing monitoring of adverse effects is assured, the true safety
profile of this group will be established within a few years.
