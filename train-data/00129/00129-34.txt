Chronic wound infection is a major cause
of delayed healing and can lead to signifi cant local and systemic complications. Precise prevalence and incidence
rates are unknown, although studies
suggest a range of 2–7%.1,2
The presence of bacteria alone does not indicate
infection and is not a risk factor for impaired wound
healing.3-6 All chronic wounds are contaminated and
the progression to local infection seems to occur in
stages,7
 including colonisation (where bacterial proliferation reaches a certain load but without causing
tissue damage) followed by critical colonisation.
While this concept is controversial and may be
regarded as an intellectual construct, it is supported
by clinical and bacteriological evidence. High bacterial levels in wound tissues and failure to heal is
directly correlated:8,9 wounds with >105 colonyforming units (CFU) per gram of tissue are associated with healing failure10 and it has been suggested
that healing is possible only when bacterial counts
are maintained at 105 CFU/g.11
It is therefore likely that reducing the bacterial
load, particularly during ‘critical colonisation’, may
prevent both infection and failure to heal.
Debridement and cleansing minimise colonisation,
● Objective: To evaluate the clinical impact of using a silver-releasing hydroalginate dressing to
minimise the risk of local infection in colonised chronic wounds.
● Method: This was a randomised (stratifi cation according to wound type) open-label multicentre
comparative two-arm parallel-group study. Thirteen centres recruited 99 patients with either a venous
leg ulcer or a pressure ulcer. None of the wounds required systemic antibiotics or were associated with
lymphangitis and/or fever, but at least two of the following criteria had to be present: continuous pain;
erythema; oedema; heat; and moderate to high levels of serous exudate. Patients were allocated to
receive either a silver-releasing hydroalginate dressing (Silvercel, the test group) or a pure calcium
alginate dressing (Algosteril, the control group). Wounds were assessed daily over 14 days to complete
a modifi ed ASEPSIS index to evaluate risk of infection, and then weekly for two additional weeks. A
global wound severity score and area tracings were recorded weekly.
● Results: Fifty-one and 48 patients were randomised in the test and control groups respectively: 28
pressure ulcers and 71 venous leg ulcers. The total mASEPSIS score over 14 days did not differ
signifi cantly between groups: 95.4 ± 62.2 and 104.2 ± 72.8 in control and test groups respectively
(p=0.791). Of the patients who completed the total four-week study duration, four out of 38 (10.5%) in
the control group and none of the 40 in the test group were treated with systemic antibiotics at the
fi nal visit (p=0.053). According to the investigators, fewer wounds developed a clinical infection over
the four-week follow-up in the test group (33% versus 46%; p=0.223). Overall, the four-week closure
rate was statistically greater in the test group (0.32 ± 0.57cm2
/day versus 0.16 ± 0.40cm2
/day; p=0.024).
Compared with baseline, the absolute decrease in wound severity score at week four was higher in the
test group (-5.6 ± 3.2 versus -4.1 ± 4.3; p=0.063); this was also true of the percentage reduction (-32 ±
17% versus -23 ± 25%; p=0.034). Poor dressing acceptability and/or tolerability was noted in fi ve out of
48 patients (10.4%) in the control group and in fi ve out of 51 (9.8%) in the test group.
● Conclusion: This study suggests that the use of silver-releasing dressings in the management of
wounds at high risk of infection may have a clinically favourable infl uence on wound prognosis; the
dressings also appeared to be well tolerated. However, the evaluation of these advantages in controlled
clinical trials is complex and requires potent studies and the development of more specifi c endpoints
than those currently used.
● Declaration of interest: This study was funded by a grant from Johnson and Johnson Wound
Management.

but the effectiveness of prophylactic local antimicrobial agents in reducing bacterial load has not
been demonstrated in controlled trials.12,13 Indeed,
as some of these agents have antibacterial and cytotoxic properties, they may inhibit healing.14
This article reports a controlled clinical trial that
evaluated the clinical impact of an antibacterial
agent in minimising the risk of local infection in
colonised chronic wounds. The trial compared a
simple alginate dressing (Algosteril, Brothier Laboratories SA, France) (control dressing) with a new
silver hydroalginate dressing (Silvercel, Johnson &
Johnson) (test dressing) (Box 1).
The study protocol and documents were submitted to and approved by the Comité Consultatif de
Protection des Personnes dans la Recherche Biomédiale of the Hôtel-Dieu University Hospital (Paris,
France). All subjects received detailed information
about the study and gave written consent.
Design and procedures
This was a randomised open-label multicentre comparative two-arm parallel-group study. Two a priori
randomisation lists were prepared and balanced by
blocks of six: one list was for venous leg ulcers and
one list for pressure ulcers (stratifi cation). Each participating centre was provided with at least one
block for each type of wound.
Modifi ed ASEPSIS Index Score
In the absence of other suitable tools, a modifi cation
of the ASEPSIS score was proposed for assessing the
wounds and to determine the sample size (Table 1).
The ASEPSIS scoring system, a well-validated
tool,14–21 was developed to quantify postoperative
wound infections and evaluate the effectiveness of
antibiotic prophylaxis prior to cardiac surgery.14
The modifi ed ASEPSIS index prolongs ASEPSIS use
over 14 days without changing its scoring rate. This
modifi cation was proposed by the European Multicentre Study Leukocyte Depletion of Autologous Whole
Blood LDAWB 2001.
22 The modifi cation refl ects the
fact that chronic wounds take longer to heal than
acute postoperative wounds.
Before the study, the suitability of the modifi ed
score (mASEPSIS) was examined at four of the 13
participating centres in 26 patients with chronic
wounds (15 pressure ulcers, nine venous leg ulcers
and two diabetic foot ulcers). In none of these cases
was it necessary to isolate bacteria or perform
debridement under general anaesthesia. Purulent
exudate was drained in one patient under local
anaesthestic.
While the average global score — 56.9 (SD) ±27.6
— did not differ between the groups, the values for
the different items varied according to wound type.
Scores for the items serous exudate and erythema
were higher for patients with leg ulcers than for
those with pressure ulcers. However, scores for the
item ‘duration of inpatient stay’ were higher for
pressure ulcers. Three items (serous exudate, erythema and separation of deep tissue) encompassed
83% of the global mASEPSIS score.
When the mean mASEPSIS subscale (the mean of
the total daily wound scores) was plotted against
time, there was a clear trend in favour of a decrease
in scores, while the wound status improved. This
suggests that the mASEPSIS can detect global wound
evolution over a relatively short time period.
None of the team of investigators reported diffi -
culties in using this coding scale.
Sample size determination
Using the highest observed variance (256) for
ASEPSIS in published studies of post-surgical wound
management and hypothesising that it might be
similar for mASEPSIS in chronic wounds, the
required number of subjects per group was determined to be 50 (bilateral test, power 0.8, alpha risk
0.05) to detect a maximal between-group difference
of 8 to 10 points on this index.
Endpoints
The primary endpoint was the mASEPSIS index
score obtained in the fi rst two weeks of treatment.
Study sample
A total of 101 subjects were enrolled by 13 centres
between April 2003 and May 2004. One patient was
incorrectly included (erroneous >0.7 ankle brachial
pressure index [ABPI] value due to mediacalcinosis,
with radiographic confi rmation of the arterial origin
of the leg ulcer and need for amputation). Another
died suddenly (gastrointestinal haemorrhage) three
days after randomisation and was not evaluated.
The intent-to-treat (ITT) population thus comprised 99 subjects: 51 in the test group (13 pressure
ulcers and 38 leg ulcers) and 48 in the control group
(15 pressure ulcers and 33 leg ulcers).

Inclusion criteria
The study sample comprised hospitalised adult
patients or patients who could be seen every day for
14 days by the investigators and who had one of the
following:
● A leg ulcer >2cm in one dimension but no larger
than 20cm
● An ABPI >0.7 within the previous six months
● A grade III–IV (NPUAP system) pressure ulcer
located on the ischium, sacrum, trochanter or heel
● In the investigators’ opinion, there were no clear
signs of infection requiring the use of systemic antibiotics or lymphangitis and/or fever. However, at
least two of the following criteria had to be present:
continuous pain; erythema; oedema; heat; moderate to high levels of serous exudate
● At least 50% of the wound covered with yellow
slough, discoloured or friable granulation tissue,
pocketing or undermining at the base of the wound,
or foul odour.
Exclusion criteria
● Patients who had received systemic antibiotics
during the previous fi ve days for any reason
● Patients with a very poor life expectancy or with a
clinical condition that might interfere with wound
healing such as active carcinoma, vasculitis, use of
systemic corticosteroids, immunosuppressive
agents, radiation therapy or chemotherapy within
the past 30 days
● Patients who had received a topical chemical debriding agent within the previous seven days.
Method
At the inclusion visit, patients’ demographic details
and medical and surgical history were recorded. A
Norton score was calculated to verify that the risk
level was balanced between the two treatment
groups and the ABPI was measured where appropriate. The target wound was assessed and an acetate
tracing of its perimeter was performed.
Patients were stratifi ed according to wound type
and randomly allocated to receive one of the two
dressings. All venous leg ulcers were treated with
class II–III (French classifi cation) compression bandaging.
The target wound was assessed and its condition
recorded daily (Monday to Friday) over 14 days
beginning the day after enrolment in the study. The
mASEPSIS was completed during these assessments.
Patients were followed up whenever possible for an
additional two weeks to evaluate wound surface

reduction and to continue monitoring dressing
acceptability and tolerability.
Medical evaluations were performed each week
during the four-week study period. At each visit the
following were noted:
● Details of the wound appearance and closure
(closed, improved, unchanged or worsening)
● Whether or not complete wound debridement
had been performed (including by the dressing)
● The occurrence of all adverse events except those
indicative of a topical reaction to the applied
dressings
● Any changes to the subject’s medication.
The target wound was then measured (planimetry) and photographed.
All subjects received at least one application of
the allocated dressings and had at least one clinical
evaluation (ITT population).
Dressings and local care
Any necrotic plaques were removed on entry into
the study by surgical or mechanical debridement.
Thereafter, this was the only method of debridement
used, and was given on an as-required basis. As all
of these wounds were at high risk of developing
frank local infection, it was expected that slough or
necrotic tissue would reappear during the course of
the study. Skin emollients and/or moisturisers were
permitted provided they did not come into contact
with the wound bed or edge.
Both the test and control dressings were alginate
based, which enabled us to evaluate the clinical
benefi t of the addition of silver. In both groups sterile pads (Topper, Johnson & Johnson) were used as
secondary dressings; these were secured with hypoallergenic adhesives. Wounds were cleansed with
sterile saline (CDM, Lavoisier, France).
During the fi rst two weeks of the study dressings
were changed at each mASEPSIS index evaluation
(at least fi ve changes per week). Thereafter, changes
were performed at least every two to three days as
needed. The daily use of the mASEPSIS tool during
the fi rst 14 days necessitated this frequency of dressing change.
Wound cultures, either qualitative or quantitative, were taken at the investigators’ discretion.
These wounds were at very high risk of developing
frank local infection. If the wound became infected
and the investigator believed intervention was
appropriate, systemic antibiotic therapy was permitted. It was decided to do this rather than exclude
these patients from the trial in order to achieve the
most accurate picture of wound evolution.
Data processing and statistical analysis
Data analysis was conducted using SPSS 11.5 software. Comparability of groups was verifi ed using
univariate ANOVA for continuous variables and
Chi-square test for categorical variables.
Group comparisons used an univariate general linear model (GLM) procedure (type III) with dressing
(test or control) and wound (leg or pressure ulcers) as
fi xed factors. For variables evaluated at weekly intervals, a GLM procedure for repeated measures was
performed. To deal with missing data, the last
observed value was carried forward (LOVCF).
The main effi cacy parameter was the two-week
global mASEPSIS score calculated on the ITT population. A second analysis was conducted for the perprotocol (PP) population, defi ned as all randomised
subjects without a major protocol violation who
completed the 14 days of treatment (at least 10 daily
evaluations of the mASEPSIS index).
The reduction of the use of systemic antibiotics
was examined using the chi-square test (or Fisher’s
exact test), while the proportion of wounds that the
investigators regarded as defi nitely infected at any
time during the four-week study period were compared using the chi-square test. The proportion of
totally debrided wounds at week 4 was compared
using the chi-square test. Changes in wound surface
area were calculated from wound tracings obtained
at baseline and each week over the four weeks.
All tracings were assessed by two experienced clinicians using a validated method.23,24 The percentage reduction in wound surface area compared with
baseline was calculated for each week (Wn–Wo/Wo).
Wound closure rate (the rate of reduction in the
open area of the wound) was calculated per week as
(Value Wn - Value Wn-1)/t, where t was the number
of days between the two measurements. The results
are expressed as cm2/day. Log-transformed data were
used for statistical analysis.
The proportion of closed/improved wounds at
week 4 were compared using the chi-square test by
regrouping the original ‘closed’ and ‘improved’
groups as ‘improved’ and ‘worsening’, and

‘unchanged’ as ‘non-improved’. To evaluate the
condition of the surrounding skin, the level of exudate, wound odour, the wound severity score and
the percentage reduction at the last clinical evaluation as compared with baseline (ANOVA procedure)
were all calculated. The system used to calculate
wound severity score is given in Table 2.
Results
Baseline characteristics
There were no statistically signifi cant differences in
baseline demographics between the two groups;
these data are given in Table 3.
Wound type (leg or pressure ulcer) was balanced
between the groups, as was the total number of
wounds per subject. There was a non-signifi cant
trend of wounds with a longer duration in the test
group compared with the control (Tables 4). While
global wound areas did not differ signifi cantly
between groups for each of the two wound types,
the wound surface area of leg ulcers was on average
larger in the test group (44.8 ± 46.3cm2 versus 24.5
+ 21.3cm2 in the control group).
Mean wound severity scores at baseline were 16.9
± 3.0 in the control group and 17.5 ± 2.5 in the test
group (p=0.289). Similarly, there were no signifi cant
differences between the groups within the two
wound-type strata.
There was a non-statistically signifi cant trend for
test wounds having more clinical signs of critical colonisation compared with control wounds (Table 5).
With the exception of a higher percentage of maceration in the test group, no other difference was detected between groups for peri-wound aspect. A similar
percentage of local adverse events in the weeks preceding enrolment was observed in both groups.
Modifi ed ASEPSIS index
Regardless of the population concerned (ITT or PP) or
the calculation procedure (LOVCF or not), no signifi -

6). For the ITT population, the mean mASEPSIS score
was 95.4 ± 62.2 and 104.2 ± 72.8 in the control and
test groups respectively (p=0.791). The mASEPSIS
score was lower, on average, in the test group for
pressure ulcers than in the control group. The reverse
was the case for leg ulcers.
Use of systemic antibiotics
Over the four-week study period, systemic antibiotics were administered to fi ve subjects (10.4%) in the
control group and four (7.8%) in the test group.
This difference was not signifi cant (p=0.736). However, evaluation of the subpopulation that completed the four weeks showed that four of the 38 subjects (10.5%) in control group and none of the 40 in
the test group were treated with systemic antibiotics
at that fi nal visit (p=0.053).
According to the investigators, fewer wounds
developed a clinical infection during the four-week
follow-up in the test group than in the control group
(33% versus 46%), but this difference was not statistically signifi cant (p=0.223).
Wound area
Compared with baseline, the absolute reduction in
surface area (Table 6) was -8.9 ± 16.0cm2 in the test
group and -4.4 ± 11.3cm2 in the control group
(p=0.117). Expressed in terms of percentage woundarea regression over the four weeks, this was -23.7 ±
43.6% and -24.0 ± 41.6% in the test and control
groups, respectively (p=0.923). While not statistically signifi cant, mean wound areas differed substantially between the groups at inclusion.
To account for this difference, closure rate (CR)
was calculated. At each week CR was greater in the
test group (Table 7). Overall, the four-week closure
rate was statistically greater in the test group (0.32 ±
0.57cm2
/day versus 0.16 ± 0.40cm2
/day; p=0.024 by
ANOVA on log-transformed data).
Evolution of wound severity score
Compared with baseline, the absolute decrease in
wound severity score at week 4 was higher in the
test group than in the control group (-5.6 ± 3.2
versus -4.1 ± 4.3; p=0.063) (Fig 1 and Table 6). In
terms of percentage reduction, the score signifi cantly decreased in the test group compared with the
controls (-32 ± 17% versus -23 ± 25%; p=0.034).
According to the investigators, 47.1% of wounds
were noted as totally debrided at the fi nal evaluation in the test group compared with 35.4% in the
control group (p=0.308).
Global wound evaluation at the fi nal visit
Over the four-week study period, no silver staining
was detected in the test group. One wound in each
group closed and 33 and 25 wounds in the test and
control groups respectively were noted as improved.

The percentage of improved/closed wounds was
higher, but not signifi cantly so, in the test group
(67% versus 54%; p=0.425).
Adverse events
Nineteen (19.2%) out of the 99 subjects (10 and
nine patients in the test and control groups respectively) did not complete the four-week study for reasons other than their wound (Table 8).
Poor local acceptability and/or tolerability (Table
9) was noted in fi ve out of 48 patients (10.4%) in the
control group (all leg ulcers) and fi ve out of 51
patients (9.8%) in the test group (four leg ulcers and
one pressure ulcer). In four patients (three in the
test group and one in the control), the investigator
was ‘certain’ there was a relationship between the
applied dressing and the adverse event. The allocated dressing was discontinued, and a foam dressing
was used instead.
Discussion
This randomised trial was designed to evaluate the
clinical impact of using a new silver-releasing dressing in the management of critically colonised chronic wounds. The principal objective was to verify if
the silver dressing was able to prevent the occurrence
of frank clinically recognised local infection.
Critical colonisation is not a well-defi ned concept.
Indeed, classic signs of infection may not be present
in chronic wounds despite high bioburdens. Conversely, continued tissue injury can trigger infl ammatory responses that mimic these signs of infection in the absence high bioburden, causing false
positive diagnoses of chronic wound infection. Cutting and Harding25,26 suggested using symptoms of
secondary wound infection, such as serous drainage
with concurrent infl ammation, delayed healing,
discoloured granulation tissue, pocketing at the
wound base, foul odour and wound breakdown, as
diagnostic signs of infection.
However, it has been suggested that critical colonisation may be identifi ed where bacterially induced
host injuries are not yet apparent.27-31 Integration of
this concept into clinical practice may help clinicians to decide when to aggressively reduce bacterial
load to prevent infection. Nevertheless, identifi cation of critical colonisation is not easy and there is
as yet no consensus on the subject. In this study, we
used a pragmatic approach to defi ne critical colonisation by combining two criteria:
● The presence of at least two local signs that are
indicative of local infection
● The clinical decision of the physician not to prescribe systemic antibiotics.
Thus, while some selected wounds might have
been regarded as locally infected, in all instances
signs were of insuffi cient severity to induce systemic
antibiotic treatment. A posteriori, study results support the relevance of selecting wounds on such simple clinical criteria. Indeed, the various assessments
of the enrolled wounds clearly suggest a high risk of
developing infection, with 79.8% presenting erythema, 87.9% moderate or strong exudate, and
77.8% having yellow slough covering more than
50% of their area. Furthermore, 41.4% of the
patients experienced spontaneous pain, 35.4%
increased local warmth and 36.4% discolouration of
granulation tissue with foul odour.
On average, per wound, more than four local
signs compatible with critical colonisation were
observed. However, due to their local status, the
selected wounds were relatively heterogeneous
and, despite stratifi ed randomisation, the distribution of risk to developing infection was not optimally balanced.
In the test group the wound area was greater and
of a longer duration, with more local signs of colonisation, and maceration was more frequently

observed on inclusion compared with the control
group. While not statistically signifi cant (with the
exception of maceration), the magnitude of these
differences might be regarded as clinically relevant
as an infl uence on wound outcome.
We compared a simple alginate dressing
(Algosteryl) with a new silver-releasing hydroalginate (Silvercel). As these wounds were not aggressively debrided at inclusion, the selection of an alginate dressing is largely regarded as appropriate.7
While the two dressings are not similar, the chemical
structures of these calcium salt alginate polymers are
not too disparate, with a guluronic:manuronic ratio
greater than one in both cases. The silver-releasing
properties of Silvercel have been extensively evaluated in vitro and validated as suffi cient to reduce bacterial load.31
Our main study endpoint was the modifi ed
ASEPSIS index. An advantage is that it is based on
clinical evaluation, requiring only daily local inspection of wounds. Furthermore, each of the evaluated
items is directly related to local signs of colonisation, and its evolution might be expected to correlate with bacterial load changes. Therefore, it was
appropriate for the study, and neither the investigators nor the nurses encountered major diffi culties in
using the index.
Overall, this study did not detect any betweengroup differences in the mASEPSIS index over two
weeks. Given that the relationship between bacterial
burden and wound closure is fairly well established,
there are two potential explanations for the failure
of the mASEPSIS index to demonstrate differences:
● Silver is an ineffective antimicrobial agent
● This index is not suffi ciently sensitive to measure
changes in chronic wounds.
As it is well known that silver is an effective
antimicrobial agent,32 it seems more reasonable
that the tool itself is inadequate. First, the variance
of the mASEPSIS index score in this study of
chronic wounds is considerably greater than that
observed in postoperative wound studies.14,16,18,21
This may be related to the more heterogeneous
aspects of chronic wounds, resulting in the tool
having a low sensitivity to changes in bacterial
load in these settings.
Second, despite wounds in the test group having
a worse baseline evaluation, the four-week closure
rate was signifi cantly better in this group. Furthermore, compared with baseline, there was a signifi -
cantly greater decrease in the wound severity score
in the test group, and fewer test subjects required
antibiotic therapy during the study. In addition,
while not statistically signifi cant, more test wounds
were totally debrided at the study endpoint, and
more were noted as improved or closed.
Overall, the contradiction between differences in
wound outcome over four weeks and the lack of difference in the two-week mASEPSIS score demonstrates that this index cannot adequately capture
the global chronic wound evolution, even if this is
related to infection risk. In addition, a single parameter may not be suffi cient to document the interest
of a bacterial load-decreasing agent when treating
chronic wounds, and only composite outcomes
including healing rate, severity scores based on
wound aspects and need for antibiotics may be relevant from a methodological point of view for
future clinical trials.
Microbiological evaluation was not used as the
correlation between microbiological results and the
risk of infection has not been extensively evaluated
due to technical diffi culties.
Conclusion
This study suggests that the use of silver-releasing
dressings in the management of wounds at high
risk of infection may have a clinically favourable
infl uence on wound prognosis and are well tolerated. Silver-releasing dressings may help to promote
cleansing, control bacterial load and improve
healing rate while preventing use of systemic antibiotics. However, the evaluation of these advantages
in controlled clinical trials is complex and requires
potent studies and the development of more
specifi c endpoints. ■
