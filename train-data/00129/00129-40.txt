Controlled trial of Iodosorb in chronic venous ulcers
M C ORMISTON, M T J SEYMOUR, G E VENN, R I COHEN, J A FOX
Abstract
Cadexomer iodine (Iodosorb) is a hydrophilic starch
powder containing iodine, which is a suitable dressing for
granulating wounds such as venous ulcers. A total of 61
outpatients with chronic venous ulcers participated in a
randomised optional crossover trial using cadexomer
iodine or a standard dressing for their ulcers. The trial
lasted for 24 weeks or until the ulcer had healed. Two
patients withdrew during the course of the trial. Both
treatments were highly effective, but the epithelium of
ulcers dressed with cadexomer iodine grew again
significantly faster (p <0 001). At the midpoint of the
trial (12th week) 13 of 30 patients receiving standard
treatment were changed to cadexomer iodine, while
only three of 29 receiving cadexomer iodine changed to
the standard dressing (p <0 02). In most cases ulcers
were dressed and rebandaged daily by the patients
themselves after instruction and supervision. This may
be better than having dressings and bandages applied by
professionals less regularly.
Introduction
Chronic venous ulcers occur in 1-3°' of the population' and
present a relapsing or intractable problem that places a heavy
demand on nursing and medical resources. A well applied compression bandage is the mainstay of treatment in ambulant
patients. Though numerous local dressings are available,
there have been few controlled trials that compare them.2-4

powder with iodine incorporated within its matrix. It absorbs
exudate and particulate matter from the surface of granulating
wounds. As it becomes moist the iodine is released. Thus it is
designed to clean the wound and, at the same time, exert a
bactericidal action. Furthermore, it can be washed off without
disturbing delicate new epithelium when the wound is dressed.
Once saturated it is no longer effective, so wounds must be
redressed regularly.
In an international multicentre study cadexomer iodine was
compared with various local favourite dressings in treating
chronic venous ulcers.3 The preliminary results of the study
carried out in this hospital have already been presented,5 and
we now analyse the results in 61 patients.
Patients and methods
Outpatients with chronic venous ulcers that had not healed for at
least three months were asked to participate in the study. In all cases a
medical history was taken and a physical examination, including
Doppler ankle pressure index, performed. A full blood count,
erythrocyte sedimentation rate, Wasserman reaction, blood glucose
concentration, tests of liver function, and analysis of urine were carried
out. Almost all patients selected were capable of dressing and bandaging their own ulcers. In the few exceptional cases a relative or nurse was
available to dress the ulcer. Patients were excluded from the study
if there was clinical or laboratory evidence that their ulcer was of
non-venous aetiology. Particular care was taken not to include
patients with peripheral vascular disease suggested by examination
or a pressure index of the dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial to brachial
artery of less than 0 70. Patients in whom compliance was expected to
be poor due to concomitant physical or mental disability or travelling
problems were also excluded from the study.
At the first visit the size and appearance of the ulcer were recorded
by outline tracing, planimetry, and photography. Bacterial culture
swabs were taken. Subjective criteria including pain, oedema, erythema,
exudate, slough, and the proportion of the surface of the ulcer covered
by granulation tissue were recorded on linear scales (0-100). Pain was
assessed by the patient and the other criteria by the same observer at
each visit. Patients were then allocated a code number according to the
sequence of selection for the trial. For each number there was a double
sealed envelope that contained a paper stating which treatment the
patient should receive. The sequence of treatments was randomised,
and the code of randomisation was not available to the investigators.
The comparative treatments were cadexomer iodine or a standard

dressing, which in this study was gentian violet and Polyfax
(polymyxin and bacitracin) ointment.
The ulcer was cleaned with saline and dressed. Cadexomer iodine
powder was sprinkled on to the ulcer in a layer 0 3-0 5 cm deep.
Polyfax ointment was applied in a generous layer after painting on
gentian violet. Each dressing was covered with a similar sized pad to
keep it in place. Pilot studies showed a gauze pad to be most suitable
for cadexomer iodine while a non-adherent (Melolin) pad was best
for the standard dressing. The legs were then bandaged identically to
below the knee with a crepe bandage followed by a cotton crepe
(STD) compression bandage.
A nurse specially attached to the study taught the patients how to
dress and bandage their ulcers, supervising them by visiting their
homes until she was satisfied that they had mastered the technique.
At first unider her instruction and subsequently on their own patients
in each stage of the study redressed and bandaged their ulcers every
day. They were reassessed at regular intervals until the ulcer had
healed or for up to 24 weeks. On each occasion the variables of ulcers
described above were measured. At the 12th week each case was
reviewed by a clinician not associated with the routine assessment of
the ulcer to see whether it was healing satisfactorily. If it was the
patient continued with the dressing originally allocated, if not he or
she was changed to the alternative treatment.
At the end of the study the blood tests were repeated. Patients
whose ulcers had healed were given a tailored support stocking to help
prevent relapse and were considered for definitive treatment of the
underlying venous problem.
Analysis of covariance was used to assess differences in the rate of
healing and the linear scale variables. This statistical analysis applied
only to the first 12 weeks of the trial as thereafter the populations
were conditional on the optional crossover. Student's t test, Fisher's
exact test, or the Z2 test was used for all other calculations. Based on
pilot studies and assuming variability of estimates of healing slopes
as <0 35 and difference between treatments as - 0 25, on a two
tailed test for cx = 005 and 1 - 0 9, n = 29 per group.
Results
Sixty one patients entered this study. One patient receiving
cadexomer iodine was admitted to hospital for routine surgery and
his ulcer was dressed inappropriately. He was withdrawn from the
trial. This left 30 in each group. Two patients, both receiving
cadexomer iodine, failed to complete the study. One died of a
perforated ulcer and the other had difficulty removing the cadexomer
iodine from the ulcer. The data on these two patients were included
in the analysis. The groups receiving cadexomer iodine and standard
treatment were reasonably matched for age, sex, and size of ulcer
(table I). Ulcers in the group receiving cadexomer iodine had not
healed for a mean of 46 months, compared with 16 months for the
standard group. This discrepancy was largely because the ulcers of

four patients in the group receiving cadexomer iodine had been
present for over 10 years.
During the first 12 weeks 12 of the ulcers treated with cadexomer
iodine and seven with the standard dressing healed completely (not
significant). Overall, however, ulcers in the group receiving cadexomer
iodine healed significantly faster during this time as judged by both
planimetry and change in area as a function of circumference (p < 0 001,
table II). The responses of men and women were similar. The optional
crossover figures at the 12th week were also in favour of cadexomer
iodine (p <0 02, table III). The ulcers of 10 out of 13 patients who
changed from standard treatment to cadexomer iodine had healed or
had almost healed after 12 weeks, and only one failed to reduce in
area by more than 5000. One patient died from a perforated duodenal
ulcer 11 days after changing treatments. Among the remaining 12
the mean reduction of area after 12 weeks was 870o. For the three
patients who crossed from cadexomer iodine to standard treatment the
area of two ulcers decreased by roughly 500/0 and one increased. The
mean reduction of area of ulcers after 12 weeks in these three patients
was 35U,.
An obvious improvement in granulation, oedema, exudate, pus and
debris, and erythema was seen after both treatments (p < 0 001), but,
although trends favoured cadexomer iodine, the difference between
the two groups was not significant in these subjective variables
(table II). Bacterial cultures grew a wide and changing variety of
organisms, and there was no consistent trend towards eradicating
particular pathogens irrespective of the treatment or response of the
ulcer.
Two patients had difficulty removing the cadexomer iodine from
the ulcer. Three patients complained of stinging or itching when
cadexomer iodine was applied, but this was not severe enough to
make them withdraw from the study. Two patients receiving standard
treatment and five receiving cadexomer iodine developed eczema,
pruritus, or rashes. These all resolved despite continued treatment.
Beclomethasone dipropionate (Propaderm) ointment was applied
to the eczematous skin in two of the patients receiving cadexomer
iodine. All repeat blood tests were normal.
Discussion
In this study both cadexomer iodine and the standard dressing
proved to be highly effective. Ulcers treated with cadexomer
iodine healed nearly twice as quickly during the first 12 weeks
of the study, a finding in keeping with other reported trials of
cadexomer iodine.3 6 Side effects attributable to cadexomer
iodine were not frequent or serious, and it has been shown not
to affect thyroid function, although iodine concentrations bound
with protein can increase.6
This trial was designed as an optional crossover study so that
patients whose ulcers did not respond well would not be obliged
to continue with an ineffective treatment for 24 weeks. As the
results of planimetry were not immediately available the decision
whether to cross over had to be made on clinical criteria and

visual assessment of the tracings and photographic records.
On reviewing the planimetry the reasons for deciding whether
or not to change were unclear in four cases. Furthermore,
traces of the dressing could often be seen, and the decision was
thus not "blind." The crossover figures must, therefore, be
viewed critically. It is noteworthy that when the four cases
mentioned were excluded from the analysis the results still
favoured cadexomer iodine (p <0 05).
Contrary to the findings of Skog et al3 we did not observe any
significant effect on bacterial colonisation. Studies using a simulated wound model, however, have shown that although
cadexomer iodine may not eliminate organisms, it does suppress
growth for almost 18 hours and thereby significantly reduces
bacterial mass.' The action of bacteria in inhibiting the healing
of wounds may relate to the production of cytotoxic chemicals,, 9
and reduction of bacterial mass for a substantial proportion of
the day may be one of the mechanisms by which cadexomer
iodine accelerates regrowth of the epithelium.
Ulcers in both groups healed well. This study shows that selected patients (average age 68 years) can manage their own ulcers
effectively. Patient compliance was remarkably good.
Our former opinion, in common with that of many others,
was that weekly dressing and bandaging provides adequate
support for ulcers with minimal disturbance of new epithelium.
On the basis of this study we suggest that daily bandaging and
renewal of a non-adherent dressing may have distinct advantages
over less demanding regimens. Bandages reapplied daily
probably provide better support than those changed less
regularly. Furthermore, many of our patients remarked how
much the reduction in odour had improved their social lives.
Although it takes time and patience to teach patients how to
dress and bandage their ulcers-that is, five two hour sessionsthis seems to be repaid in terms of both healing of ulcers and,
eventually, a reduction in demands on the doctor and nurse.
Cadexomer iodine seems to be useful in this context.

SHORT REPORTS
Gastric emptying in chronic
renal failure
Gastrointestinal symptoms almost invariably accompany advanced
chronic renal failure, but little is known about the mechanisms
responsible. Abdominal distension and nausea occur in patients with
reflux oesophagitis, a condition known to be associated with delayed
gastric emptying.' As there have been few investigations into the
effect of uraemia on gastric motility we compared gastric emptying
in patients with uraemia with that in healthy controls.
Patients, methods, and results
We studied 14 patients with uraemia (eight women), whose ages ranged
from 21 to 61 (mean age 37). All had a glomerular filtration rate of less than
5 ml/min, and serum creatinine concentrations ranged from 690 to 1560
,umol/l (7-8 to 17-6 mg/100 ml). Four patients had started regular haemodialysis six to 12 months previously; the 10 others were studied shortly
before joining the haemodialysis programme. The patients not undergoing
dialysis were receiving a diet containing 20 g protein, and those undergoing
dialysis consumed 60 g protein daily. All patients experienced intermittent
nausea and vomiting, although these symptoms were less severe in the four
undergoing haemodialysis. Barium meal studies in all patients showed no
evidence of peptic ulceration. No patient took any drug likely to influence
gastric motility-for example, metoclopramide or cimetidine-within 72
hours of the study.
Eleven healthy volunteers (seven women) aged 22-69 (mean age 44)
were also studied.
After a six hour fast each subject ate a meal consisting of 30 g instant
porridge, 8 g sugar, and 150 ml warm milk, to which 11 1 MBq (300 LCi)
technetium-99m tin colloid had been added.2 Each study began at 1500,
and the four patients undergoing haemodialysis were studied on the day
before a dialysis session. After eating the meal the subjects lay supine beneath
a gammacamera linked to an on line computer. Successive 90 second images
obtained over a 90 minute period were stored on magnetic discs. The gastric
images were then delineated, and the total counts within this area were
calculated for each of the 60 images. A curve showing gastric emptying was
produced after adjustment for radioactive decay. Counts were expressed as
a percentage of the maximum count.
No control subject experienced nausea or vomiting during the study, and
no patient with renal failure vomited, although most described mild nausea
and abdominal fullness.
The patients with uraemia showed significantly greater retention of isotope
in the stomach as judged by counts at 30 minutes (p< 0.01), 60 minutes,
and 90 minutes (p < 0 05) (Mann-Whitney U test). Three of the four patients
undergoing dialysis had normal gastric emptying patterns. When the four
