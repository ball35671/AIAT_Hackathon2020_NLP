Chronic wounds such as venous stasis ulcers have become a socioeconomic problem. Even
with successful initial management, the recurrence rate approaches 70%. With the advent
of new wound healing agents, nonoperative attempts to heal these wounds appear
indicated. This study reports a prospective randomized evaluator-blinded trial comparing
two potential wound healing agents to an inert vehicle placebo. Eighty-six evaluable
patients completed the trial. Silver sulfadiazine 1% in a cream proved to statistically reduce
the ulcer size compared with a biologically active tripeptide copper complex 0.4% cream
formulation or the placebo. There was no difference between the latter two treatments.
Silver sulfadiazine has been shown to allow keratinocyte replication and to have
antiinflammatory properties. In t]kis trial its antibacterial action was not used since all
ulcers had comparable bacterial levels (-< 10S/gm of tissue) before treatment. These results
suggest that the silver sulfadiazine cream used in this study may facilitate healing in
wounds healing largely by the process of epithelization. (J VAsc SURG 1992;16:251-7.)
Chronic cutaneous ulceration of the lower ex-
~emity can result in an indolent nonhealing wound.
Mthough the causes of such ulcerations can be varied
and often multifactorial, the most common cause
(70% to 90%) is venous insufficiency. 1,2 These
venous stasis ulcers persist, with approximately 50%
of the patients having an ulcer history of 10 years. 2
Mthough treatment of 62% to 83% of the patients
can be managed in a nonhospital setting, 3-s the costs
of caring for venous stasis ulcers is immense, including evaluation, diagnosis, treatment, dressings, time
off work, and disability. 6
Treatment of venous stasis ulcers varies from
multiple surgical procedures to the use of various
topical agents combined with external pressure support to the legs. Despite these modalities, the
recurrence rate remains at nearly 70%. 2,s Because of
this high recidivism rate, multiple wound healing

agents and growth factors have been used to determine if closure of these and other chronic wounds can
be facilitated without operative intervention.
The purpose of this study was to evaluate two
potential wound healing agents for the nonoperative
treatment of venous stasis ulcers in an ambtflatory
outpatient setting. The drugs chosen were a tripeptide (glycyl-L-histidyt-L-lysine) complexed to copper
with properties that accelerate wound healing processes in vitro and in vivo 6a and a 1% silver
sulfadiazine cream (Silvadene; [Marion Laboratories,
Kansas City, Mo.]). The study was to determine if
wound closure rate could be affected in a finite time
period (4 weeks) and did not evaluate long-term
efficacy of the treatments.
CLINICAL TRIAL METHODOLOGY
M1 patients admitted to the Plastic Surgery
Clinics at the University of Texas Medical Branch and
Washington University with lower extremity ulceration caused by venous stasis were screened by use of
the inclusion and exclusion criteria listed in Table I.
Screening included a history, physical examination,
and baseline laboratory tests (complete blood count
with differential, serum chemistries, and urinalysis).
Segmental limb pressures with pulse volume recordings were obtained to eliminate patients with arterial

Table I. Inclusion and exclusion criteria
used to screen patients
Inclusion Criteria
• Patients between 21 and 90 years of age
• Venous stasis ulcers of at least 3 months duration
• Ulcers with surface area 3 cm 2 to 50 cm 2
• Women of childbearing potential must have negative pregnancy test and use adequate contraceptive measures
Exclusion criteria
• Hypersensitivity to any components of the test medication
• > l0 s bacteria/gram of tissue in the ulcer
• Systemic sepsis or presence of bone infection
• Arm/ankle arterial perfusion index < 0.5
• Hypercupremia (Wilson's disease)
• Systemic immunosuppressive or cytotoxic therapy
• Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus
insufficiency. Venous duplex Doppler ultrasound
scanning-imaging was used to characterize the
venous cause of the ulcer. In addition, blood flow was
determined at four points around the target ulcer by
use of a laser Doppler. Since only patients with ulcers
were included, they were all considered to have class
III-severe, chronic venous insufficiency. 9 A complete
history of the duration of the ulcer and various prior
treatment modalities and their responses were recorded. For inclusion, the ulcers had to be venous in
origin, between 3 cm z and 50 cm 2 in size, and of at
least 3 months' duration.
Patients meeting the inclusion criteria and completing an informed consent were stratified by lesion
size (3 to 20 cm 2 or 21 to 50 cm 2) and randomly
assigned to one of three treatment groups. The three
treatment groups were 0.4% glycyl-L-histidyl-Llysine complexed to copper (GHK:Cu) in a cream
formulation, its vehicle, which is a widely used
petrolatum based cream (Unibase; [Parke-Davis,
Morris Plains, N.J.]), and Silvadene).
The scrcened target ulcer selected for evaluation
was traced and its area determined by digitized
planimetry. Standardized photographs were obtained and a biopsy of the lesion was obtained for
qualitative and quantitative bacterial analyses. Only
ulcers containing l0 s or fewer bacteria per gram of
tissue were entered into the study. Morphologic
characteristics of the ulcer were recorded by use of
degree of erythema, granulation, and character of
exudate. Selective symptomatology such as pain,
burning, and pruritus were also quantitated and
recorded. Edema was measured by circumference and
recorded.
Medication was dispensed weekly by a third
party, and the patient was instructed as to its once
daily application. Wound cleansing, limited to simply
removing residual medication with a normal saline
rinse, and drug application occurred daily followed
by application of a nonadherent dressing and elastic
wrap. The patient was instructed to keep the affected
extremity horizontally elevated when sitting. Ambulation was consistent with the performance of normal
daily activities, with no prolonged standing greater
than 2 hours. No other home supervision or specialized treatment was provided.
Patients were evaluated weekly during 4 weeks of
therapy. Before evaluation, all study medication was
removed and the ulcer cleansed to keep the evaluator
blinded. At each follow-up visit, the procedures
performed at the initial visit were repeated including
tracing of the unepithelialized ulcer area, planimetry,
photography, and description of erythema, granulation, and exudate characteristics. In addition, a global
score documenting the overall change in the lesion's
status relative to its pretreatment status was assigned.
A patient diary was assessed, and the returned
medicine was weighed to assess compliance. At the
final visit, evaluation of the patient's vascular status by
arterial and venous noninvasive studies and periulcer
laser Doppler determinations were repeated.
STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY
Group comparability of the patient groups at two
sites was tested for treatment, evaluator, and
treatment-by-evaluator interaction effects with use of
analysis of variance (ANOVA) for continuous variables. Pairwise comparisons of treatments were made
with the method of least square means. For categorical variables, Fisher's Exact Test was used to test for
overall treatment differences as well as for individual
palrwise comparison of treatments. Since the trial
was performed in two centers, demographic variables
were also analyzed separately for each evaluator by
use of one-way ANOVA tests and Fisher's Exact
Tests.
Analysis of variance methods were used to test
for treatment, evaluator, and treatment-by-evaluator
interaction effects. Pairwise comparisons of treatments were made by use of least square means. The
efficacy parameters were the lesion size, change in
lesion size, percent change in lesion size, the physician's global evaluation of clinical response, the
scores of the signs of disease (erythema, exudation,
and granulation), the total sign score (sum of
erythema, exudation, and granulation scores), the
nature of the exudate, and the symptom scores for
burning, itching, pain, and patient-perceived edema.
These analyses were performed for each visit as well
as the last study visit. Efficacy parameters were also

The poolability of the two centers was evaluated
by analyses of efficacy parameters to look for patterns
of treatment-by-evaluator interaction. A general
treatanent-by-evaluator interaction was not observed.
Therefore the data were considered poolable
(p > 0.20 at last study visit for all major efficacy
parameters).
RESULTS
It was planned to enter 90 patients into the trial.
Because three patients (1 assigned to the tripeptide
copper complex treatment, 2 to silver sulfadiazine)
were immediate dropouts and were excluded from
both safety and efficacy analyses, a total of 93 patients
were randomized to the three treatment groups. The
90 patients, excluding the three immediate dropouts,
were evaluated for safety (31 in the tripeptide copper
complex treatment group, 29 on silver sulfadiazine,
and 30 on placebo). Eighty-six of these were evaluable for efficacy having completed the trial. These 86
patients included 29 treated by the tripeptide copper
growth factor, 28 by silver sulfadiazine, and 29 by
placebo. ~sessment of patients' diaries and weighing
of returned medication tubes suggested these patients
complied with the protocol.
Results of the baseline demographiC analysis on
the 86 patients completing the study showed that
with the exception of gender distribution and height,
no overall differences between treatment groups were
detected (p _> 0.12) (Table II). Differences in gender
were primarily between the placebo and silver
sulfadiazine groups. The gender distributions were
not significantly different between the tripeptide
copper complex and silver sulfadiazine nor between
the tripeptide and placebo. Height differences are
directly correlated to the sex of the patients. Further
investigation of the impact of demographic factors on
treatment effects did not indicate a reiationship
between gender (or height) and outcome.
Insulin-dependent diabetes meUitus was an exclusion criteria for the trial. However, since the presence
of any diabetes might affect wound healing, all
patients being treated with oral hypoglycemic agents
were evaluated. Eight patients were diabetics being
treated with oral agents (4 tripeptide copper complex, 2 silver sulfadiazine, 2 placebo). No differences
were found in these patients compared with the
nondiabetic patients in their respective groups.
Treatment groups were comparable at baseline
with regard to target lesion size, duration of the
lesion, history of response to prior therapy, and
baseline disease characteristics (p _ 0.18) (Table
III). Fourteen patients had initial ulcer size greater
than 20 cm 2, and these were equally divided among
the treatment groups (5 tripeptide copper complex,
5 silver sulfadiazine, 4 placebo). There was a mean
improvement in lesion size for patients treated with
the tripeptide growth factor of 7.3% compared with
22.1% for patients treated with silver su!fadiazine
and 11.8% for those treated with placebo by day 8;
however, these differences did not reach statistical
significance. There were no statistical differences
among these groups at day 8. Within each treatment
group, improvement in lesion size progressed
throughout the study. At the time of their last
evaluation, patients treated with the tripeptide copper complex demonstrated a mean improvement of
18.7% compared with 44.0% for patients treated

silver sulfadiazine and the tripeptide copper complex
was significant at p = 0.03 and between silver
sulfadiazine and the placebo atp = 0.05. Ulcers on
six of the 28 patients treated with silver sulfadiazine
(21%) were completely healed by the end of the
study, whereas no patients treated by the tripeptide
copper complex demonstrated such a response (Fig.
1). One of the 29 patients treated with placebo (3%)
also healed. Five of the six patients receiving silver
sulfadiazine who achieved total healing were still
healed 1 year after completion of the study, as was the
single placebo-treated patient who completely
healed.
Results of the analysis of other efficacy parameters
were consistent with those seen for percent improvement in lesion size. The total physical sign score
comprised of the scores for erythema, exudation, and
granulation was best for the ulcers treated with silver
sulfadiazine at the end of the study (Table V). So too
were the individual scores for erythema and exudation. Those were most marked when comparing
silver sulfadiazine with the 0.4% tripeptidc copper
complex, but they were also marked comparing silver
sulfadiazine with the placebo. No differences occurred between the tripeptide copper complex and
the placebo group (Table V).
No statistical differences occurred among the
three treatment groups for burning, itching, pain, or
measured or perceived edema. After day 15, only
patients in the placebo group complained of any pain,
burning, or itching. On the scale of 0 to 3 +, all
means were less than 1 +. Since all patients were
treated with compressive therapy, the means for
edema never exceeded 1 + at any visit.
Statistical power to detect meaningful differences
is a Amction of sample size. Therefore within each
investigator center, the power to detect statistically
significant differences was somewhat lower than in
the pooled analysis. In spite of this, the results of the
analyses performed separately for each study site were
similar to those seen in the pooled efficacy analysis.
DISCUSSION
Because of the tremendous socioeconomic impact
of venous stasis ulcers and the high rate of recidivism,
new methods to facilitate the closure of these chronic
wounds are being investigated. In the present trial, a
new tripeptide having growth factor properties was
compared with silver sulfadiazine cream to evaluate
their potential roles as wound healing agents. The
tripeptide (glycine, L-histidine, and L-lysine) was
originally isolated from human blood and urine. 7
This peptide has a strong affinity for copper (+ + )
ions, and in preliminary animal and human trials
appeared to play a stimulatory role in wound
healing. 8 It was formulated in a hydrophilic cream
(0.4%) to provide topical treatment of skin ulcers. In
vivo, this tripeptide copper complex acts as a potent
chemoattractant for macrophages, monocytes, and
mast cells, as well as an inducer of capillary
growth.l°,tl Blood erythropoietin levels are increased

and a significant superoxide dismutase activity has
been observed, which could be linked to antiinflammatory properties. 12 Increased collagen secretion by
fibroblasts and induction of axonal and dendritic
growth from neurons have been reported. 11'I~ These
characteristics suggested that evaluation of this agent
in the treatment of venous ulcers would be warranted.

by a tissue level of bacteria.~4,15 Therefore it has been
recommended to use topical antimicrobial creams to
decrease the bacterial level in these wounds to
facilitate wound closure. 14,16 Silver sulfadiazine in a
1% water soluble cream is such an antimicrobial and
has been successful in decreasing bacterial counts in
burn wounds. Kucan and Smoot 17 have reported its
efficacy in nonburn chronic wounds. Because of these
reports, it was included in the present study as a
comparison against the growth factor-like tripeptide.
The inert vehicle of the tripeptide was included in a
third arm as a placebo control.
The results of the present trial showed that the
tripeptide copper complex was safe to use in humans.
However, at the 0.4% concentration and once daily
application, it was not an efficacious wound healing
agent. No statistically significant differences in
wound closure occurred between patients treated
with this agent and those treated with the control
vehicle alone (Table IV).
Silvadene cream by contrast was very effective in
this study. It significantly decreased the size of the
ulcer compared with the other two treatments (Table
IV). In 21% of the patients treated with Silvadene,
complete healing of the ulcer occurred (Fig. 1). Five
of six of these ulcers were still healed at follow-up
visits 1 year after treatment, with no further topical
therapy and only elastic support. The ulcers treated
with Silvadene also showed less erythema and exudate than ulcers in the other two groups (Table V).
Granulation tissue was less exuberant in these ulcers,
but this is probably a positive sign in a wound that
must heal chiefly by epithelization. Excess granulation tissue formation, which may be useful in deep
wounds such as pressure ulcers, may actually be a
detriment in surface wounds healing by
epithelization.
The effect of Silvadene in this study probably was
not due to its antibacterial properties. Inclusion in the
trial required that all ulcers had a bacterial count of
105 or fewer bacteria per gram of tissue. This number
of tissue bacteria has previously been demonstrated
not to interfere with wound healing or with wound
closure by wound approximation, skin graft, or
pedicled flap. 1416 Mthough it has not been completely excluded that the silver sulfadiazine cream did
not lower the bacterial level still further or change the
bacterial flora, there were no statistical differences in
the bacterial levels or species in the three arms of the
trial. Therefore it appears that the 1% silver sulfadiazine cream used in this trial (Silvadene) functioned
as a wound healing agent and facilitated wound
closure.
Some properties of the silver sulfadiazine cream
may suggest it could retard wound healing. McCauley et al. 18 have demonstrated that even at concentrations 100-fold less than those used clinically it is
toxic to human diploid fibroblasts in tissue culture.
However, venous stasis ulcers heal primarily by
contraction and epithelization, and fibroblast proliferation or collagen deposition are not the initiating
factors in achieving healing. Silver sulfadiazine does
not inhibit keratinocyte replication necessary for
epithelization. McCauley et al? 9 demonstrated that
keratinocytes could replicate in vitro in the presence
of silver sulfadiazine in contrast to other topical
antimicrobials.
There is evidence that Silvadene cream is beneficial to wounds healing by epithelization. Brown et
al.20 reported that epidermal growth factor added to
Silvadene facilitated the healing of split-thickness skin
graft donor sites. Lloyd 21 used Silvadene alone and
showed that donor site healing time was reduced.
Geronemus et al. 22 likewise demonstrated that
partial-thickness wounds were reepithelialized more
rapidly with Silvadene cream. They found that there
was a 28% increase in reepithelization rates with the
antibacterial cream and 21% with its base vehicle
alone, suggesting the improvement was not due to
the antibacterial effect of silver sutfadiazine.
The possibility that the accelerated healing in this
study was due to the base vehicle in Silvadene cream
is supported by Penneys 2s who reported that the
vehicle has antiinflammatory properties and can
inhibit production of thromboxane. Since it has been
shown that excess production of thromboxane can

cause local vasoconstriction and be detrimental to
epithelization and heating of the partial-thickness
burn wound, this may help to explain the healing seen
in venous stasis ulcers. 24,25
Although the mechanism is not entirely clear, it is
apparent from this study that topical treatment with
1% silver sulfadiazine cream (Silvadene) facilitates
wound closure of venous stasis ulcers compared with
the 0.4% tripeptide copper complex or the placebo
control. On the basis of this information, it may be
an effective wound healing agent in wounds in which
epithelization is an hnportant part of the healing
process.
