SummaryBackground Lower-respiratory-tract infection is one of the most common acute illnesses managed in primary care. Few  placebo-controlled  studies  of  antibiotics  have  been  done,  and  overall  eff  ectiveness  (particularly  in  subgroups  such  as  older  people)  is  debated.  We  aimed  to  compare  the  benefi  ts  and  harms  of  amoxicillin  for  acute  lower-respiratory-tract infection with those of placebo both overall and in patients aged 60 years or older.Methods  Patients  older  than  18  years  with  acute  lower-respiratory-tract  infections  (cough  of  ≤28  days’  duration)  in  whom  pneumonia  was  not  suspected  were  randomly  assigned  (1:1)  to  either  amoxicillin  (1  g  three  times  daily  for  7 days) or placebo by computer-generated random numbers. Our primary outcome was duration of symptoms rated “moderately bad” or worse. Secondary outcomes were symptom severity in days 2–4 and new or worsening symptoms. Investigators and patients were masked to treatment allocation. This trial is registered with EudraCT (2007-001586-15), UKCRN Portfolio (ID 4175), ISRCTN (52261229), and FWO (G.0274.08N).Findings  1038  patients  were  assigned  to  the  amoxicillin  group  and  1023  to  the  placebo  group.  Neither  duration  of  symptoms  rated  “moderately  bad”  or  worse  (hazard  ratio  1·06,  95%  CI  0·96–1·18;  p=0·229)  nor  mean  symptom  severity  (1·69  with  placebo  vs  1·62  with  amoxicillin;  diff  erence  –0·07  [95%  CI  –0·15  to  0·007];  p=0·074)  diff ered signifi cantly between groups. New or worsening symptoms were signifi cantly less common in the amoxicillin group than in the placebo group (162 [15·9%] of 1021 patients vs194 [19·3%] of 1006; p=0·043; number needed to treat 30). Cases of nausea, rash, or diarrhoea were signifi cantly more common in the amoxicillin group than in the placebo group (number  needed  to  harm  21,  95%  CI  11–174;  p=0·025),  and  one  case  of  anaphylaxis  was  noted  with  amoxicillin.  Two  patients  in  the  placebo  group  and  one  in  the  amoxicillin  group  needed  to  be  admitted  to  hospital;  no  study-related deaths were noted. We noted no evidence of selective benefi t in patients aged 60 years or older (n=595).Interpretation  When  pneumonia  is  not  suspected  clinically,  amoxicillin  provides  little  benefi  t  for  acute  lower-respiratory-tract infection in primary care both overall and in patients aged 60 years or more, and causes slight harms.Funding  European  Commission  Framework  Programme  6,  UK  National  Institute  for  Health  Research,  Barcelona  Ciberde Enfermedades Respiratorias, and Research Foundation Flanders.IntroductionAcute  uncomplicated  lower-respiratory-tract  infection  is  the most common acute illness managed in primary care in developed countries; most patients receive antibiotics, even   in   low-antibiotic-prescribing   countries.1–4   Many   patients  worry  about  severe  symptoms,5  and  clinicians  are keen to appropriately treat acute bacterial infections to avoid medicolegal consequences, provide symptomatic benefi t, and avoid complications (especially community-acquired  pneumonia).3,6–8  However,  the  pre  scription  of  antibiotics has costs, including the purchase of the drugs themselves,  dispensing  costs,  and  costs  asso  ciated  with  increased  reconsultation  because  of  the  med  icalisation  of  self-limiting  illness.9,10  Primary  care  prescribing  of  antibiotics is one of the main drivers of resistance, which is also a major threat.11Consensus  opinion  has  been  to  restrict  antibiotic  use  in acute lower-respiratory-tract infections.12–15 However, a Cochrane  review16  of  the  use  of  antibiotics  for  acute  bronchitis  showed  moderate  benefi  ts—eg,  a  number  needed to treat of 6 for cough, almost halving the number of patients not improving, and no signifi cant short-term harms. Thus, the debate about the balance of benefi t and harm continues, especially because of the scarcity of data from placebo-controlled trials for important symptomatic outcomes  for  patients,  such  as  the  number  of  days  feeling ill (fewer than 500 patients were included in the Cochrane  review16).  Which  sub  groups  of  patients  will  probably  benefi  t  from  treatment,  and  particularly  the  eff  ects  in  older  patients  (in  whom  most  complications  occur), are also debated.3 Most clinicians tend to prescribe antibiotics for older people with severe illness and major comorbidities, but the role of drugs in fi  tter older patients is unclear.We aimed to provide robust estimates of the benefi ts and harms of amoxicillin in acute uncomplicated community-Lancet Infect Dis 2013; 13: 123–29Published OnlineDecember 19, 2012http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(12)70300-6See Comment page 98Primary Care and Population Sciences Division, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK (Prof P Little FRCGP, B Stuart PhD, M Moore FRCGP, M Mullee MSc, G O’Reilly PhD); Centre for General Practice (Prof S Coenen DMSc), and Laboratory of Medical Microbiology(Prof H Goossens PhD), Vaccine & Infectious Disease Institute (VAXINFECTIO), University of Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium; Cochrane Institutes of Primary Care and Public Health (Prof C C Butler FRCGP), and South East Wales Trials Unit (Prof K Hood PhD), School of Medicine, Cardiff    University,  Cardiff  ,  UK;  Department  of  Family and Community Medicine, Medical University of Łódź, Łódź, Poland (Prof M Godycki-Cwirko PhD); Independent Laboratory of Family Physician Education, Pomeranian Medical University, Szczecin, Poland (Prof A Mierzecki PhD); Department of Family Medicine and Community Nursing, Medical University of Bialystok, Bialystok, Poland (S Chlabicz PhD); Pneumology Department, Clinic Institute of Thorax, Hospital Clinic of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain (Prof A Torres PhD); Insitut d’Investigacions Biomèdiques August Pi i Sunyer, University of Barcelona—Ciber de Enfermedades Respiratorias (Ciberes), Barcelona, Spain (Prof A Torres); Unitat de Cures Intensives, Hospital de Mataró, Mataró, Spain (J Almirall MD); University of Barcelona—Ciber de Enfermedades Respiratorias

Patients   were   recruited   between   Nov   15,   2007,   and   April  14,  2010  (the  predefi ned cutoff  defi  ned  by  the  trial  steering   committee),   at   primary   care   practices   in   16 networks in 12 European countries (Belgium, Eng land, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia,  Spain,  Sweden,  and  Wales).  Recruit  ment  rates  were low because of time pressures during the fi rst winter season,  so  further  networks  in  France,  Poland,  Slovakia,  and   Slovenia   were   recruited;   these   networks   joined   during  the  winter  of  2008–09.  Additionally,  two  of  the  original networks had diffi  culty obtaining approval from the  competent  authority,  so  did  not  start  recruting  until  the second winter. Trial procedures were all shown to be feasible and thus no changes in documentation or process were necessary.Eligible  patients  were  aged  18  years  or  older  and  consulting  for  the  fi  rst  time  with  either  an  acute  cough  (≤28  days’  duration)  as  their  main  symptom,  for  which  non-infective diagnoses were judged very unlikely, or an illness  in  which  cough  was  not  the  most  prominent  symptom   but   the   clinician   thought   acute   lower-re-spiratory-tract infection the most probably diagnosis.We  excluded  patients  in  whom  the  initial  clinical  diagnosis   was   community-acquired   pneumonia17   (ie,   complicated  lower-respiratory-tract  infection)  on  the  basis  of focal chest signs (focal crepitations, bronchial breathing) and  systemic  features  (high  fever,  vomiting,  severe  diar-rhoea). We did not use a formal clinical prediction rule for the  diagnosis  of  pneumonia  because  of  the  absence  of  consensus   about   which   rule   to   use.18–21   Patients   were   excluded  pragmatically  when  the  working  diagnosis  was  cough  of  non-infective  cause  (eg,  pulmonary  embolus,  left ventricular failure, oesophageal refl ux, allergy); anti-biotics had been used in the previous month; they were unable to provide informed consent or complete a diary (eg,  if  they  had  dementia,  psychosis,  or  severe  depres-sion);  or  they  were  pregnant,  allergic  to  penicillin,  or  had  immunological  defi  ciencies.  Previous  diagnoses  of  asthma,   chronic   obstructive   pulmonary   disease,   and   other comorbid disorders were not exclusion criteria, and thus acute infective exacerbations were included.The  study  was  approved  by  ethics  committees  in  all  participating  countries.  The  competent  authority  in  each  country also gave their approval. Patients who fulfi lled the inclusion criteria were given written and verbal information on the study and provided written informed consent.Randomisation and maskingTrial  drugs  were  block  randomised  by  Scott  Harris,  a  statistician in our research group who is independent of the GRACE consortium. The random code was sent as a password-protected   list   and   as   a   hardcopy   to   the   manufacturer,  Almac  (Armagh,  UK).  Both  clinicians  and   patients   were   masked   to   the   randomisation   sequence,  and  all  outcome  data  were  gathered  masked  to allocation status.Almac prepared containers with the contents (amoxicillin or  placebo)  determined  by  a  computer-generated  random  number list provided by a statistician who was independent of the trial statisticians. The amoxicillin and placebo were manufactured  to  be  identical  in  appearance,  taste,  and  texture.   The   random   isation   codes   for   amoxicillin   or   placebo were kept by the manufacturer and the designated pharmacist  at  the  University  Medical  Center,  Utrecht.  A  24 h unmasking service also had access to the list to break the  code  in  an  emergency.  Unmasking  was  acceptable  when requested by clinicians for clinical reasons, such as ad  verse  events—eg,  anaphylaxis,  hospital  admission  with  life-threatening illness (such as severe sepsis, meningitis, severe  pneumonia  necessitating  ad  mission  to  intensive-care unit), death.ProceduresPatients  were  recruited  consecutively  by  clinicians  in  each  practice  (to  the  extent  possible  within  the  time  constraints   of   daily   practice).   Those   who   agreed   to   randomisation were allocated (1:1) to receive three times daily  either  1  g  amoxicillin  or  placebo  for  7  days  by  the  clinician,     who     dispensed     sequentially     numbered     randomised   containers.   Recruiting   health-care   prof-essionals  had  to  keep  non-recruitment  logs  and  record  reasons  for  not  screening  patients.  The  dose  was  based  on  a  Monte  Carlo  simulation;  we  aimed  to  reach  a  minimum inhibitory concentration of roughly 1·5 mg/L to   cover   Haemophilus   infl uenzae   and   intermediately   resistant    pneumococci    for    90%    of    the    intended    population (taking into account countries with high rates of  antibiotic  use  and  well  documented  pneumococcal  resistance).   We   estimated   that,   to   achieve   bacterial   eradication, concen trations needed to be higher than the minimum  inhibitory  concentration  for  at  least  5  days.  We chose a 7 day course for acceptability to clinicians and to allow for poor compliance.The   responsible   clinician   recorded   comorbidities,   clinical  signs,  and  the  severity  of  baseline  symptoms  reported  by  the  patient  on  a  case  report  form.  Each  symptom  was  rated  as  “no  problem”,  “mild  problem”,  “moderate   problem”,   or   “severe   problem”.   Clinical   characteristics were compared with a recent observational study1  that  used  the  same  clinical  pro  forma  but  was  much   less   time   intensive,   and   so   recruited   eligible   patients more quickly.After  consultation  with  the  responsible  clinician,  pa-tients completed a daily symptom diary for the duration of the illness (to a maximum of 28 days). The diary items recorded  the  severity  of  cough,  phlegm,  shortness  of  breath,  wheeze,  blocked  or  runny  nose,  chest  pain,

Each  symptom  was  scored  on  a  scale  from 0 to 6 (0=no problem, 1=very little problem, 2=slight problem, 3=moderately bad, 4=bad, 5=very bad, 6=as bad as  it  could  be).  Patients  also  recorded  non-respiratory  symptoms,  such  as  diarrhoea,  skin  rash,  and  vomiting.  This diary has previously been val idated and is sensitive to  change  and  internally  reliable  (Cronbach’s  α  0·75).9,22All  study  materials  were  translated  into  relevant  local  languages.  Back  translations  were  checked  to  ensure  consistency of meaning between networks.1Members  of  the  research  team  telephoned  participants  after  4  days  to  off  er  support  and  answer  any  questions  about  completion  of  the  diary.  If  the  diary  was  not  returned  after  4  weeks,  we  collected  brief  information  with  either  a  short  questionnaire  or  a  standardised  telephone  call  about  symptom  duration  and  severity.  Participating   clinicians   registered   all   contacts   with   patients   for   4   weeks   after   the   initial   consultation,   including referral to hospitals and out-of-hours contacts.OutcomesWe specifi  ed three key outcomes, which were intended to capture  important  symptomatic  outcomes  for  patients,  before  the  trial.  These  outcomes  did  not  change  when  the trial began. Our primary outcome was the duration of symptoms rated by patients as “moderately bad” or worse after initial presentation. We chose this endpoint because it was easy for patients and physicians to understand.Symptom  severity  and  new  or  worsening  symptoms  were   secondary   endpoints.Symptom   severity   was   measured  as  the  mean  diary  score  for  all  symptoms  during days 2–4 after the index consultation.9We defi ned new or worsening symptoms as a return to the physician with worsening symptoms, new symptoms, new  signs,  or  illness  necessitating  admission  to  hospital  within  4  weeks  after  the  fi  rst  consultation  (established  from reviews of patients’ notes).Statistical analysisFor  symptom  duration  and  severity,  our  priority  was  to  estimate  the  probable  benefi  t  of  antibiotics.  The  null  hypothesis  was  that  antibiotics  provide  no  benefi t  for important  symptomatic  outcomes  for  patients,  neither  overall nor for people aged 60 years or older. We assumed an  α  of  0·01  (for  multiple  outcomes),  80%  power,  and  20%  loss  to  follow-up,  and  estimated  that  544  patients  would   be   needed   in   each   age   group   to   detect   a   0·33 standardised diff  erence between groups (equivalent to 1·5 days of symptoms rated “mod erately bad”, or one patient  in  three  rating  the  diary  components  “a  slight  problem” instead of “a moderately bad problem”). For the total cohort we estimated that 1110 patients overall would detect  a  0·23  standardised  diff  erence  between  groups,  equivalent  to  a  day  of  symp  toms  labelled  “moderately  bad”.

Thus,   our   minimum  sample  size  target  was  586  patients  in  each  age  group  and  1500  for  the  total  cohort;  our  maximum  target was 1500 patients in each age group.We  did  all  analyses  masked  to  treatment  allocation.  We did not do an interim analysis. Subgroup analyses of patients   aged   60   years   or   older   were   specifi ed   in advance.  We  decided  to  do  a  secondary  analysis  for  patients aged 70 years or older after com pletion of data collection.   We   used   linear   regression   models   that   controlled   for   the   severity   of   baseline   symptoms—specifi  cally, Cox regression for the duration of symptoms allowing  for  censoring,  simple  linear  regression  for  symptom     severity,     and     logistic     regression     for     deterioration  of  illness.  We  assessed  any  evidence  of  a  diff erence in benefi t for patients aged 60 years or older versus  the  younger  group  by  estimating  interaction  terms for each outcome. Separate estimates were made for  participants  aged  60  years  or  older  and  for  those  aged  70  years  or  older.  Our  primary  analyses  included  patients  for  whom  we  had  outcome  data  (ie,  complete  cases)  on  an  intention-to-treat  basis.  We  assessed  the  possible  eff  ects  of  loss  to  follow-up  by  estimating  the  change  in  hazard  ratio  (HR)  for  several  assumptions  about resolution of symptoms in patients with missing data.  Number  needed  to  treat  and  number  needed  to  harm  were  calculated.  No  per-protocol  analysis  was  done.  We  checked  that  the  groups  were  balanced  by  country, practice, and network. We  used  Stata  (version  11.2)  for  all  analyses.  For  interpretation we used a signifi cance threshold of 5% for the primary outcome and 1% for the secondary outcomes to  minimise  the  chance  of  type  I  error  with  multiple  outcomes.   The   trial   was   registered   with   EudraCT   (Eudract-CT  2007-001586-15)  in  November,  2007,  and  in  January,    2009,    we    obtained    an    ISRCTN    number    (ISRCTN52261229).  Trial  procedures  did  not  change  between the two registrations.Role of the funding sourceThe  funding  sources  had  no  roles  in  data  collection, analysis, or interpretation; report writing; or submission. PL,  MM,  and  BS  had  full  access  to  all  the  data  in  the  study and take responsibility for the integrity of the data and  the  accuracy  of  the  data  analysis.  All  authors  had  responsibility   for   the   fi   nal   decision   to   submit   for   publication.Results3108  patients  agreed  to  participate  during  recruitment;  2061  were  randomly  assigned—1038  to  the  amoxicillin  group   and   1023   to   the   placebo   group   (fi gure   1). Recruitment  took  more  than  30  min.  Because  of  time  pressures   during   winter,   not   all   potentially   eligible   patients    were    screened,    and    completion    of    non-recruitment logs was poor (data not shown). Lack of time was  the  main  reason  given  for  not  screening,  and  was  reported by 44 (92%) of 48 health-care professionals. Only three (6%) health-care professionals reported that patients’ clinical  state  restricted  recruitment.  595  (28·9%)  of  the  trial population were aged 60 years or older; 310 (15·0%) had  asthma  or  chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  disease;  and 1966 (95·8%) of 2052 had dyspnoea, sputum, or fever (nine  patients  had  missing  data).  Table  1  shows  the  baseline  clinical  characteristics  of  the  amoxicillin  and  placebo groups.Symptom     duration     was     documented     in     1799     (87·3%)     partici     pants     and     symptom     severity     in     1789   (86·8%).   New   or   worsening   symptoms   were   measured  in  2027  (98·3%)  participants;  356  (17·6%)  had  new     or     worsening     symptoms.     778     (92·4%)     of     842 participants in the amoxicillin group and 746 (90·1%) of 828 in the placebo group reported taking study drug at day 5 in their diaries (by which stage bacteria should have been eradicated).Symptoms  rated  “moderately  bad”  or  worse  lasted  a  median of 6 days in the amoxicillin group (IQR 3–11) and 7 days (4–14) in the placebo group; the diff erence between AmoxicillinPlaceboOdds ratio (95% CI)pNumber needed to treat (95% CI)Whole cohort162/1021 (15·9%)194/1006 (19·3%)0·79 (0·63 to 0·99)0·04330 (16 to 811)Age 60 years or older54/285 (18·9%)58/299 (19·4%)0·97 (0·64 to 1·47)0·890222 (17 to –15)Age younger than 60 years108/736 (14·7%)136/707 (19·2%)0·72 (0·55 to 0·95)0·02122 (13 to 128)Data are n/N (%) unless otherwise specifi  ed.Table 4: Worsening of illness in the amoxicillin group versus placebo groupnPlaceboAmoxicillinDiff  erence  (95%  CI)p  Whole cohort17891·69 (0·84)1·62 (0·84)–0·07 (–0·15 to 0·007)0·074Age 60 years or older5471·50 (1·02)1·47 (0·94)–0·03 (–0·17 to 0·11)0·676Age younger than 60 years12421·78 (0·85)1·69 (0·85)–0·08 (–0·18 to 0·01)0·073Data are mean (SD) unless otherwise specifi  ed.

Duration  of  symptoms  rated  “moderately  bad”  or  worsedid  not  diff er signifi  cantly  between  the  older  age  group  and  the  younger  age  group  (interaction  term  0·86;  p=0·116)  and  and  no  select  ive  benefit  was  noted  in  the  older age group. Symptom severity did not diff er between treatment  groups  (table  3),  and  no  selective  benefi t was detected  in  the  older  age  group  (interaction  term  0·06;  p=0·47).  In  the  266  participants  aged  70  years  or  older,  the  diff  erences  between  treatment  groups  for  symptom  severity  (–0·04,  95%  CI  –0·21  to  0·12;  p=0·614)  and  symptom   duration   (HR   0·96,   95%   CI   0·94–1·16;   p=0·432) were not signifi  cant (data not shown). Exclusion of patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease made little diff  erence to the estimates of duration of symptoms rated “moderately bad” or worse(HR 1·04).Signifi  cantly  fewer  individuals  experienced  new  or  worsened  symptoms  in  the  amoxicillin  group  overall  than  in  the  placebo  group  (table  4),  but  the  number  needed to treat was high (30). No signifi cant diff erences were noted in the older age group. Controlling  for  network  did  not  signifi cantly  aff ect fi   ndings.   Between   groups,   the   HR   for   duration   of   symptoms   was   1·06   (95%   CI   0·96–1·18;   p=0·229),   diff erence in symptom severity was –0·07 (–0·15 to 0·01; 0·085),  and  odds  ratio  for  new  or  worsening  symptoms  was 0·80 (0·63–1·02; 0·067).Nausea, rash, or diarrhoea was recorded by 249 (28·7%) of 867 participants in the amoxicillin group and 206 (24·0%) of  860  in  the  placebo  group  (number  needed  to  harm  21,  95%  CI  11–174;  p=0·025).  No  study-related  deaths  were  noted. Three patients (two in the placebo group and one in   the   amoxicillin   group)   were   acutely   admitted   to   hospital  for  respiratory  or  cardio  vascular  issues  during  the   month   after   randomisation.   One   patient   in   the   amoxicillin group had documented anaphylaxis.Assumptions   about   missing   study   data   did   not   signifi cantly  aff  ect  our  results  and  thus  our  inferences  remain acceptable (table 5).DiscussionTo  our  knowledge,  this  trial  is  the  largest  multicentre  randomised  placebo-controlled  study  of  antibiotics  for  acute,   uncomplicated   lower-respiratory-tract   infection   (panel).  We  noted  that  amoxicillin  did  not  signifi cantly reduce the duration of symptoms rated “moderately bad” or  worse  or  symptom  severity  compared  with  placebo.  Our   cohort   had   similar   clinical   characteristics   to   the   previous observational cohort recruited in these networks1and  other  cohorts  of  people  with  lower-respiratory-tract  infections.1,9,27,28The  applicability  of  our  fi  ndings  is  strengthened  by  the  international  nature  of  the  trial  and  the  broad,  pragmatic   inclusion   criteria.   These   properties   could   mean  that  our  population  is  heterogeneous,  but  such  demographics  represent  the  diagnostic  realities  of  daily  practice  because  no  accepted  diagnostic  algorithm  to  identify   patients   with   infection   is   available,   and   no   universally  agreed  defi  nition  exists  for  the  diagnosis  of  uncomplicated lower-respiratory-tract infection.16 We used criteria consistent with consensus exercises29 and similar to  those  of  previous  pragmatic  trials,  large  cohorts,  and  observational studies.1,28,30,31Most  patients  in  our  study  had  acute  cough  with  sputum. When we excluded key groups such as patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or those  aged  60  years  or  older,  our  results  were  little  aff  ected,  suggesting  that  our  fi  ndings  can  probably  be  generalised to most patients with clinically defi ned acute lower-respiratory-tract  infection  in  primary  care  (where  nearly all such infections are managed). Recruitment was slow,  and  feedback  during  and  after  the  study  clarifi ed that   this   rate   of   recruitment   was   because   of   time   pressures, which were very intensive for the acute setting. Although  roughly  a  third  of  patients  chose  not  to  be  randomly assigned, we noted no evidence of recruitment bias compared with the observational studies done in the same   recruiting   network,   which   used   very   similar   baseline  clinical  pro  forma  and  had  patients  with  very  similar  characteristics  (80%  had  sputum  and  15%  had  other lung disease).1 Our choice of antibiotic might have restricted  effi    cacy,  but  the  chosen  dose  of  amoxicillin  eff  ectively treated more than 90% of all isolates in Europe. The  size  of  the  older  age  group  restricted  the  power  to  assess  a  reduction  in  deterioration  in  illness.  Similarly,  some   other   clinical   subgroups   might   benefi t   from amoxicillin.   Poor   adherence   could   have   diminished   effi    cacy,  but  more  than  90%  of  patients  in  both  groups  reported taking the study drugs by day 5, and adherence is probably better in a trial than in routine care.32Our study provides further evidence for the long natural history  of  lower-respiratory-tract  infections.

Articles128 www.thelancet.com/infection Vol 13   February 2013for  more  than  a  week  before  presentation  and  severe  symptoms   for   about   7   days   afterwards   (and   milder   symptoms for even longer).Neither  duration  of  symptoms  nor  symptom  severity  was signifi cantly aff  ected by amoxicillin. Symptom se verity was  measured  as  the  mean  diary  score  for  all  symptoms  during  days  2–4  after  the  index  consultation  because  this  period is when symptoms are rated as the worst problem by patients. Before day 2, antibiotics will have had little chance to provide benefi t and after day 4, although some symptoms remain “moderately bad” or worse, mean diary scores for all symptoms tend to be rated less than “moderately bad”.Although   new   or   worsening   symptoms   developed   signifi  cantly  less  often  in  the  amoxicillin  than  in  the  placebo group, the number needed to treat was high, and three  patients  only  had  to  be  admitted  to  hospital.  The  defi  nition  of  new  or  worsening  symptoms  used  was  useful  and  workable  in  previous  studies  of  respiratory-tract   infection   in   the   community.33   Because   so   few   patients needed to be admitted to hospital, the outcomes eff  ectively  represent  symptom  control.  Our  fi ndings are consistent with those of a Cochrane review of anti biotics for   acute   bronchitis16   and   consensus   guidance,15   but   suggest that amoxicillin is even less benefi cial than was noted  in  the  placebo-controlled  trials  in  the  Cochrane  review  (possibly  because  of  diff  erences  in  setting  and  spectrum   bias).   Any   moderate   benefi   ts   need   to   be   balanced   against   the   probable   slight   harms   from   treatment  (number  needed  to  harm  was  about  20  for  rash, nausea, or diarrhoea in the amoxicillin group). The restricted benefi t of antibiotics might partly be because, for   most   acute   lower-respiratory-tract   infections   in   primary  care,  bacterial  pathogens  can  only  be  identifi ed in  a  few  patients.28,30  In  view  of  the  small  numbers  of  patients   who   benefi   t   from   antibiotic   treatment,   the   challenge is to identify these individuals.Previous  estimates  of  benefi  t  of  antibiotics  in  older  patients  have  varied;  one  study  of  doxycycline  showed  a  benefi t,33  but  another  of  amoxicillin  did  not.9  However,  the  numbers  of  patients  included  in  these  studies  were  small, and the CIs for the estimates of eff ect were wide.Our  results  suggest  strongly  that  for  older  patients  in  whom pneumonia is not suspected, amoxicillin has very little  eff  ect.  However,  severely  ill  older  patients  with  several    comorbidities    are    unlikely    to    have    been    approached  to  participate  in  the  trial,  so  these  fi ndings should be interpreted cautiously and not extrapolated to a generally unwell older population.15In  conclusion,  amoxicillin  provides  little  symptomatic  benefi  t  for  patients  presenting  in  primary  care  who  are  judged to have clinically uncomplicated lower-respira tory-tract infections. Any mild, short-term benefi  ts of antibiotic treatment  should  be  balanced  against  the  risks  of  side-eff ects and, in the long-term, of fostering resistance.ContributorsPL, TV, CCB, SC, and HG proposed the initial idea for the study.

Work in the UK was also supported by the National Institute for Health Research, in Barcelona by 2009 SGR 911 Ciber de Enfermedades Respiratorias (Ciberes CB06/06/0028), and in Belgium by the Research Foundation—Flanders (FWO; G.0274.08N). We are grateful to Zoe Crosby and Ian Williamson (who provided helpful support during the study and were part of protocol development in discussion with PL); key members of the GRACE consortium trial team whose hard work has made this possible, including Niels Adriaenssens, Zuzana Bielicka, Pascale Bruno, Jo Coast, Patricia Fernandez, Iris Hering, Anna Kowalczyk, Christina Lannering, Marieke Lemiengre, Katherine Loens, Christine Lammens, Greet Ieven, Bo-Eric Malmvall, Magdalena Muras, Nuria Sanchez Romano, Matteu Serra Prat, Igor Svab, Richard Smith, Jackie Swain, Paolo Tarsia, Frank Leus, Robert Veen, and Tricia Worby; all the clinicians and patients who consented to be part of GRACE; and the independent GRACE trial steering committee (Patrick Bindels, Gordon Taylor, and Mark Woodhead) for their help and suggestions.Panel: Research in contextSystematic reviewThe authors of a Cochrane review16 searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (including the Acute Respiratory Infections Group’s specialised register), Medline (for studies published between 1966, and week 4 of August, 2010), and Embase (for studies published between 1974, and September, 2010) for randomised controlled trials of antibiotics in patients with acute bronchitis (including acute cough with or without sputum production). The main search terms used were “exp bronchitis”, “bronchit*.tw.”, “(bronchial adj2 infect*).tw”, “exp respiratory tract infections”, and “exp anti-bacterial agents”; the appendix contains a full list of terms used. The placebo-controlled studies identifi  ed in the review provide little evidence of important symptomatic outcomes; at follow-up, patients given antibiotics were less likely to have a cough than were those given placebo (risk ratio 0·64, 95% CI 0·49–0·85; number needed to treat 6), but these results came from only four studies23–26 with 275 participants in total.Patients given antibiotics were also less likely to have a night cough (0·67, 0·54–0·83; 7), but this fi  nding  was noted in a population of only 538 participants.Numbers of patients were small for the outcomes of feeling unwell (n=435) or activity limitation (393). The review provided no data about the role of antibiotics in subgroups of patients—particularly the fi  t  elderly.InterpretationOur trial is the largest study so far of the use of antibiotics in acute lower-respiratory-tract infection, and adds much to the placebo-controlled evidence noted in the Cochrane review, especially data for patients aged 60 years or older.16 Compared with placebo, amoxicillin did not signifi  cantly  aff  ect the duration of symptoms rated “moderately bad” or worse in the fi  rst few days of infection, neither overall nor in patients older than 60 years. Symptom severity also did not diff  er  signifi  cantly between treatment groups. Amoxicillin prevented some patients from developing new or worse symptoms but the number needed to treat was high and matched by a similarly sized number needed to harm for side-eff  ects. Our data suggest, if anything, a smaller benefi  t from antibiotics for symptoms and a clearer estimate of harms than did the Cochrane review. Thus, unless pneumonia is suspected, antibiotics should not be prescribed for patients with acute lower-respiratory-tract infection.
