Summary
Background The value of azithromycin for treatment of acute
bronchitis is unknown, even though this drug is commonly
prescribed. We have investigated this question in a
randomised, double-blind, controlled trial.
Methods Adults diagnosed with acute bronchitis, without
evidence of underlying lung disease, were randomly assigned
azithromycin (n=112) or vitamin C (n=108) for 5 days (total
dose for each 1·5 g). All individuals were also given liquid
dextromethorphan and albuterol inhaler with a spacer. The
primary outcome was improvement in health-related quality
of life at 7 days; an important difference was defined as 0·5
or greater. Analysis was by intention to treat.
Findings The study was stopped by the data-monitoring and
safety committee when 220 patients had been recruited. On
day 7, the adjusted difference in health-related quality of life
was small and not significant (difference 0·03 [95% CI –0·20
to 0·26], p=0·8). 86 (89%) of 97 patients in the azithromycin
group and 82 (89%) of 92 in the vitamin C group had
returned to their usual activities by day 7 (difference 0·5%
[–10% to 9%], p>0·9). There were no differences in the
frequency of adverse effects; three patients in the vitamin C
group discontinued the study medicine because of perceived
adverse effects, compared with none in the azithromycin
group. Most patients (81%) reported benefit from the
albuterol inhaler.
Interpretation Azithromycin is no better than low-dose
vitamin C for acute bronchitis. Further studies are needed to
identify the best treatment for this disorder.

Introduction
Every year, more than ten million US adults visit
physicians for acute bronchitis, and most of them receive
antibiotics.1,2 Many experts condemn such treatment,
citing three main reasons: weak or conflicting
experimental evidence of clinical benefit, lack of a strong
biological rationale (the causative pathogens are viruses in
most cases), and increasing societal concern about
widespread antibiotic resistance.2–5
Nine randomised controlled trials of three different
antibiotics for acute bronchitis have been published;6–14
four demonstrated clinical benefit.9–12 Meta-analyses of
these studies15–18 have been beset by fundamental
problems:2,15–18 different studies measured different
outcomes; the reliability and validity of outcome
measurement was uncertain; and some outcomes had
questionable clinical significance (for example, duration
of purulent sputum). Equally important, no published
study has measured the effect of antibiotic therapy on
quality of life, although four studies8–11 reported on
limitations in work or other activities.18 Finally, no study
has assessed any of the newer antibiotics widely promoted
and prescribed today, including quinolones and the newer
macrolides.
Azithromycin is a macrolide antibiotic commonly
prescribed for acute bronchitis. It has a broad spectrum of
activity and infrequent adverse effects, and it is easy to
take (once daily for 5 days). However, it is also expensive,
and the only published evidence of its efficacy in acute
bronchitis comes from several small equivalence
studies19–22 and one large, open, uncontrolled, drugcompany-sponsored case series.23,24
In a randomised, double-blind, controlled clinical trial,
we tested whether patients prescribed azithromycin for
acute bronchitis returned to work (or other usual
activities) sooner and whether they experienced greater
improvements in health-related quality of life than
patients prescribed low-dose vitamin C.
Methods
Participants
After approval of the study protocol by the institutional
review board, we recruited adult patients without chronic
lung disease who presented with cough of 2–14 days
duration (with or without sputum production) and were
diagnosed with acute bronchitis by attending physicians in
the adult ambulatory screening clinic of Cook County
Hospital, Chicago, Illinois, USA, during weekdays from
December, 1999, until March, 2000. Patients were
enrolled after giving written informed consent. Reasons
for exclusion were: pregnancy; other infectious diseases
necessitating antimicrobial therapy; chronic lung
disease (including asthma) or current treatment with
bronchodilators or glucocorticoids; angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor started within the previous
4 weeks; antibiotic treatment within the previous 2 weeks;

need for hospital admission; allergies to macrolides,
bronchodilators, or vitamin C; duration of cough less than
2 days or longer than 2 weeks; or any clinical
characteristic suggesting pneumonia, including oral
temperature above 38·9°C (102°F), respiratory rate
greater than 25 per min, or infiltrates or other
abnormalities on chest radiograph.
Immediately before the study, physicians who would be
seeing patients with cough in the ambulatory screening
clinic during the study period took a 2-h training course
that covered the assessment of patients presenting with
acute cough, the diagnosis of acute bronchitis, the
evidence supporting treatment options for cough25 and
acute bronchitis, and the rationale for the planned study.
The physicians were reminded that the diagnosis of acute
bronchitis is largely one of exclusion, and therefore other
diagnoses should be carefully considered—such as
pneumonia, viral upper-respiratory-tract illness, influenza,
gastro-oesophageal reflux, sinusitis, postnasal drip, heart
failure, and asthma—before a final diagnosis of acute
bronchitis is made. All laboratory and radiographic studies
were left to the discretion of the treating physicians, but if a
chest radiograph was done before enrolment, any
pulmonary abnormality was grounds for exclusion.
Design and procedures
Patients were randomly assigned one of two study drugs,
azithromycin (total dose 1·5 g) or vitamin C (total dose
1·5 g). All study drugs were prepared at one site by an
independent pharmaceutical consultant (MediDerm,
Chicago, IL, USA) in opaque sealed capsules that were
identical in appearance, taste, and smell. Six capsules
were packaged in bottles that were identical except for
labels that differed only by a unique identification
number. Each azithromycin capsule contained the
equivalent of a 250 mg caplet. Each vitamin C capsule
contained 250 mg vitamin C and enough dextrose to fill
the capsule to a volume equivalent to the azithromycin
capsule.
A research associate, not a member of the research
team, prepared the randomisation code using a computergenerated (Arcus QuickStat Biomedical, Cambridge, UK)
random allocation schedule in three unequal blocks. The
external pharmaceutical company then sealed the study
drugs in sequentially numbered identical containers
according to the allocation sequence. All members of the
research team—investigators, project coordinator,
physicians, patient educators, research assistants, data
collectors, data-entry staff, and the research pharmacist
who dispensed all study drugs in sequence—were unaware
of the allocation schedule. Masking was maintained until
data analysis except on two occasions, when physicians
specifically requested knowledge of the study drug
because of patients’ lack of improvement.
Before leaving the clinic, each patient was directly
observed taking two study drug capsules. Participants
were then instructed to take one study drug capsule in the
morning on an empty stomach 1 h before eating breakfast,
for the next 4 days (ie, a total of six capsules).
We chose vitamin C instead of a traditional placebo
compound, such as dextrose, because the results of several
focus groups we undertook a year earlier with members of
the target population showed that they would probably
refuse to take part in any randomised trial of acute
bronchitis if the placebo group received a “sugar pill”.
However, they suggested that a randomised trial of
antibiotic and a multivitamin or some other vitamin pill
would be acceptable. We followed this recommendation
and used vitamin C as the comparison drug, since it can
be administered in a capsule without any identifying taste
or smell and because there is no evidence of efficacy in
acute bronchitis or any other respiratory illness at the
doses given.26
Patients in both treatment groups all received aggressive
standard symptomatic therapy of proven benefit. All
participants were given 240 mL (8 ounces) of
dextromethorphan syrup and were instructed to take
10 mL by mouth every 6 h as necessary for cough during
the day and 15 mL at bedtime.25 All participants also
received one albuterol inhaler with a spacer and were
instructed to inhale two puffs with the spacer every 6 h as
necessary for cough.27,28 A research nurse or trained
research assistant gave instructions to all participants on
taking all medications and provided supervised practice in
use of the inhaler and spacer. Patients were instructed not
to take any other medications for their illness during the
study period.
The primary endpoint was health-related quality of life
on day 7 of follow-up. Secondary endpoints were return
to usual daily activities at follow-up, domain scores that
comprise health-related quality of life, and adverse effects.
On enrolment, trained research assistants interviewed
study participants to establish baseline measurements of
health-related quality of life and to describe the activity
limitations attributed to the symptoms of acute bronchitis.
In addition, the examining physicians completed a
standard data-collection instrument for recording clinical
data from their history, physical examination, clinical
assessment, and any tests done.
On day 3 (about 48 h after enrolment), a research
assistant telephoned all participants for a follow-up
interview to inquire whether the patient had returned to
his or her usual activities at work, home, or school and to
reassess the patient’s health-related quality of life. In
addition, patients were interviewed about use of all
medications and any possible adverse effects. On day 7,
the interview was repeated, with additional questions
included at the end to assess the adequacy of masking and
patients’ subjective impressions about the effectiveness of
all medications. If a patient was not available for interview
on day 7 at the scheduled time, the interviewers attempted
to contact him or her up to six times daily for
3 consecutive days before declaring the patient lost to
follow-up.
The acute bronchitis health-related quality-of-life
interview was adapted from similar instruments developed
at McMaster University to measure changes in healthrelated quality of life for patients treated for asthma,29
rhinitis,30 chronic lung disease,31 or congestive heart
failure.32 A score is obtained by taking the mean of 22
equally weighted items representing four domains: effects
on daily activities (three activities specified by the
individual and three general activities—sleep, recreational
activities, and regular activities at home and at work);
effects of coughing, including chest pain and dyspnoea
(eight items); general symptoms (four items); and
emotional functioning (four items; panel). For each item,
patients are asked to indicate on a 7-point scale how
troubled they have been during the previous few days as a
result of their bronchitis symptoms, from not troubled at
all (0) to extremely troubled (6).
We assessed the adequacy of masking by asking all
participants at the day 7 interview to guess whether they
received azithromycin or vitamin C.
Statistical analysis
We used multivariate ANCOVA with repeated measures
to assess the effect of treatment group on health-related

quality-of-life scores during the follow-up period, while
controlling for any differences at baseline. In addition, we
used the simpler ANCOVA to assess differences between
groups on day 3 and day 7, separately.
A difference between groups of 0·5 points on the
quality-of-life scale was selected as the smallest important
difference based on published research of similar healthrelated quality-of-life scales.33–36 However, the previous
research that identified 0·5 as a reasonable “smallest
clinically important difference” involved chronic
illnesses—allergic rhinitis, asthma, congestive heart
failure, chronic obstructive lung disease—in which a small
difference over a long period might be judged important.
For self-limited illnesses of shorter duration, such as acute
bronchitis, the smallest important difference might
therefore be greater than 0·5. A difference of 0·5 points
represents a change, for example, from 2 (somewhat
troubled) to 1 (hardly troubled at all) for half of the
symptoms or activities addressed in the questionnaire (on
the assumption the remaining items are unchanged).
In analysing secondary endpoints, we compared the
proportion of participants who had returned to their usual
daily activities on day 3 and day 7 in the azithromycin and
vitamin C groups. We used χ2 or Fisher’s exact tests and
constructed near-exact 95% CI for the difference in
proportions by the method of Miettinen.37
We had originally planned for a sample size of 400
patients so that we would have sufficient power to test
treatment effects within several clinical subgroups that
previous research had suggested as potentially important
(based on age, duration of cough, magnitude of fever, and
severity of symptoms). However, an interim analysis was
done at the end of the fourth month to help decide
whether to continue recruiting. The data-monitoring and
safety committee, independent of the investigators, was
presented with interim analyses addressing primary and
secondary endpoints, as well as adverse effects, after the
first 220 patients had been enrolled. Unaware of
treatment-group identity, the committee concluded that
the study should stop enrolment because the outcomes
were equivalent and there was sufficient precision to be
confident that the likelihood of detecting a clinically
meaningful difference with a larger sample was so small
that continued enrolment of patients would be
inappropriate.
The sample size of 220 provided power of 95–99% to
detect a difference between the groups of 0·5 points in

health-related quality of life, on the assumption of a
population SD of 0·8–1·0 points and α=0·05. This sample
size also provided 80% power to detect a difference of
10% in the proportion who had returned to their usual
activities by day 7.
Statistical analyses were done with SPSS (version 10),
Stata (version 6), and Arcus Quickstat Biomedical
(version 1). We updated a previously published metaanalysis18 using the DerSimonian-Laird random-effects
model for risk differences (Arcus Quickstat Biomedical).
This meta-analysis model was used instead of other
methods that pool odds ratios18 because the results have a
more transparent clinical interpretation and because the
study by Williamson and colleagues11 can be included in
the analysis, despite an odds ratio that is undefined.
Results
Of the 340 patients who met the inclusion criteria, 91
were ineligible because of one or more exclusion criteria
and 29 declined to participate; we enrolled the remaining
220 patients (figure 1). Table 1 shows the baseline
demographic and clinical characteristics of study
participants. 93 (96%) patients in the azithromycin group
and 87 (95%) in the vitamin C group reported taking at
least five of the six study drug capsules (p=0·7).
On day 7, the proportion of participants who guessed
they were taking azithromycin was similar in the
azithromycin and vitamin C groups (34 of 97 [35%] vs 36
of 92 [39%], p=0·6). We unmasked treatment assignment
before the end of follow-up for two patients (both in the
vitamin C group) at the request of their treating
physicians. In one of these patients, pneumonia was
subsequently diagnosed because infiltrates were seen on
chest radiograph and successfully treated on an outpatient
basis with a quinolone antibiotic. The other patient
improved without any additional treatment. The
azithromycin and vitamin C groups did not differ
significantly in their crude or adjusted mean healthrelated quality-of-life scores on day 3 or day 7
(p>0·2; multivariate ANCOVA with two repeated
measures; table 2 and figure 2). The rate of improvement
was the same for both groups (p=0·3). There was no
interaction between baseline health-related quality-of-life
score and treatment effect (p>0·3).

One patient in the vitamin C group was diagnosed with
pneumonia during follow-up, compared with none in the
azithromycin group. No patient required hospital
admission during the study period.
The measurement of health-related quality of life was
internally consistent, since Cronbach’s α was greater than
0·92 for each of the 3 days on which it was measured
(baseline, day 3, and day 7). The measure was also
responsive to change; the average change in score over
7 days was roughly 2 points, equivalent to more than
1·5 SDs of the baseline score.
The effects of treatment within specific domains of
health-related quality of life approached clinical and
statistical significance on day 3 but not on day 7. On day
3, the azithromycin group was less troubled doing daily
activities and less troubled with cough and cough-related
problems than the vitamin C group (table 2), but the
between-group differences were less than 0·5, the smallest
clinically important difference. By day 7, however,
differences between groups for all domains of healthrelated quality of life were smaller and all CI excluded any
clinically important difference. For both the activity
limitation domain and the cough domain, there was a
greater treatment effect among the most troubled
patients, although the statistical test for interaction was
not significant (p>0·2).
The azithromycin and vitamin C groups did not differ
significantly in the proportion who had returned to their
usual activities at work, home, or school by day 3 or by
day 7 (table 2, figure 3). By day 7, five patients in the
azithromycin group and four in the vitamin C group had
made a second visit to a physician because they were not
feeling better.
Among the participants contacted on day 3, 18 of 96
(19%) in the azithromycin group reported adverse effects
from study medications, compared with 19 of 92 (21%) in
the vitamin C group. The most common complaints were
diarrhoea (nine vs seven) and nausea (seven vs three).
Four participants had stopped taking the albuterol inhaler
by the time of the interview on day 3 because of perceived
adverse effects, and an additional 14 had stopped because
they felt sufficiently better.
On day 7, perceived adverse effects were reported by 24
of 97 (25%) in the azithromycin group and 19 of 92
(21%) in the vitamin C group (p>0·2). The most
commonly reported adverse effects on day 7 were
diarrhoea (11 vs six) and nausea (six vs four). Only three
participants reported that they stopped the study drug
because of perceived adverse effects; all three were in the
vitamin C group.
The albuterol inhaler was considered effective by 81%,
ineffective by 10%, and of uncertain value by 9%. There
were no differences between study groups. By day 7, 84
(44%) of the 189 patients reported still using the inhaler;
11 (6%) had stopped using it because of adverse effects,
three (2%) because of perceived ineffectiveness, 64 (34%)
because they were sufficiently better, and 27 (14%) for
other reasons.
Although we did an intention-to-treat analysis of all
available participants, 15 patients in the azithromycin
group and 16 in the vitamin C group were not available at
follow-up. We therefore undertook further analyses to
assess the sensitivity of our results to various assumptions
about the missing data. The 31 patients lost to follow-up
were more likely than those interviewed at day 7 to have a
baseline respiratory rate of 20 per min or greater (odds
ratio 2·9), a baseline self-report of cocaine or heroin use
(2·7), and a lower (less troubled) baseline quality-of-life
score (0·7; each p<0·05 in a multivariate model). There
were no differences by study group. We repeated the
analysis of our primary endpoint with all 220 study
participants with three different methods to impute
missing values: the last value carried forward method; a
best-case scenario for azithromycin; and a worst-case
scenario for azithromycin. The point estimates for the
main outcome were 0·1, 0·4, and –0·2 for the three
methods. Since the three point estimates were within
0·5 points, the smallest clinically important difference, the
study’s conclusions were not considered sensitive to the
method for dealing with loss to follow-up.

These results show that azithromycin is no more effective
than low-dose vitamin C for treatment of acute bronchitis.
Given the lack of evidence that low-dose vitamin C is
beneficial, we conclude that azithromycin is ineffective
and should not be prescribed for patients with acute
bronchitis.
Our study improves on the previous evidence in several
ways. It measured the clinical outcomes most relevant to
patients: health-related quality of life and return to usual
daily activities. Our measure of disease-specific healthrelated quality of life was adapted from validated
instruments used for other respiratory illnesses29–31,34 and
was assessed reliably with a-priori definitions of clinical
significance. Our eligibility criteria kept to a minimum
diagnosis misclassification bias;5 only one of 108 patients
in the control group required antibiotics for pneumonia
(apparently misdiagnosed as acute bronchitis on study
entry). Patients in both groups received intensive
symptomatic treatment, including inhaled bronchodilators.5,28 Finally, we studied a widely prescribed, newer
agent, the infrequent side-effects of which mean not only
that it allows a “best case” for antibiotic therapy to be
investigated but also that it protects concealment of study
drug allocation.5 Indeed, our exit interviews confirmed
that patients did not know whether or not they had
received the antibiotic. These features of our study
strengthen its internal and external validity.
The rate of improvement was more rapid among our
patients than in other studies,38–40 perhaps because the
range of illness was milder (shorter mean duration of
cough at presentation and fewer patients with abnormal
chest signs) or because all patients received aggressive
symptomatic therapy with inhaled bronchodilators.5,28,
The most comprehensive meta-analysis of antibiotics
for acute bronchitis18 concluded that antibiotics decrease
cough but at the expense of drug side-effects. Although no
previous trial has tested azithromycin or measured healthrelated quality of life, four other studies measured the
related endpoint of return to usual activities.18 Our results
for this outcome can be evaluated in the context of the
other published evidence by updating the meta-analysis
(figure 4). The pooled difference of 2% favours
antibiotics, but the aggregate data are compatible with a
range of values that include both benefit (up to 6%) and
harm (up to 3%) from antibiotics.
Our findings do not prove that azithromycin provides
absolutely no benefit to patients with acute bronchitis.
The 95% CI for differences between azithromycin and
vitamin C on study day 3 included 0·5 for the summary
quality-of-life score and for each of its component
domains. Although none of these effects persisted on day
7, our results do not exclude the possibility that
azithromycin may provide transient benefit of little clinical
significance to patients with acute bronchitis. In addition,
our sample size did not permit precise subgroup
comparisons to analyse whether azithromycin is effective
for selected subgroups (for example, elderly patients with
severe symptoms). We discontinued enrolment when our
independent data-monitoring and safety committee,
unaware of study group identity, concluded that the
likelihood of showing a clinically meaningful treatment
effect with a larger sample was too small to warrant
continuation of the study. Notwithstanding these
reservations, our findings shift the burden of proof to
proponents of antibiotic therapy for patients with acute
bronchitis.
Our study is limited in two important ways. First,
although our follow-up rate was similar in both study
groups, 17% (31 of 220) of enrolled patients did not
complete the full evaluation of all study outcomes. None
of these patients was admitted to our hospital, none was
seen in the emergency department or in one of the clinics,
and none died within the month after the study period,
but we cannot be certain that none had an adverse event
and either did not seek medical attention or sought
attention elsewhere. Second, our study shows that
azithromycin is ineffective, but it does not identify the best
treatment for acute bronchitis. Further studies are needed
to identify more effective management strategies,41,42
because many patients with acute bronchitis require their
physicians to “do something”.2,3,43 Those very reasonable
demands should be met with rigorous clinical trials, not
defensive use of ineffective antibiotics.

Figure 4: Meta-analysis of randomised trials that assess the
difference in the proportion of patients who have returned to
their usual daily activities in antibiotic and control groups
For each study, the difference in the proportion of patients who have
returned to their usual activities at follow-up (control group minus the
antibiotic group) is represented by a thin vertical line, which transects a
horizontal open rectangle depicting the 95% CI. Results less than zero
favour the antibiotic group. The solid diamonds are proportional to the
studies’ sample sizes. The pooled results and 95% CI are described by
the final (open) diamond. The DerSimonian-Laird (DL) random-effects
model of risk differences was used to calculate the summary point
estimate for the difference in proportions between treatment.
