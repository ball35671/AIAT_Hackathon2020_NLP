ACUTE LOWER RESPIRATORY
tract illness is the most common condition treated in primary care.1,2 Assuming 75%
of patients are prescribed antibiotics1
and using conservative national morbidity survey estimates,2 acute cough
costs the UK National Health Service
at least US $270 million in consultation costs and US $35 million to 70 million antibiotic prescription costs annually. In the United States, excess
antibiotic prescribing is mainly for pharyngitis and acute bronchitis, amounting to 55% of prescriptions and costing $726 million per year.3
A consensus has been made for limiting antibiotic use in acute lower respiratory tract infection.4-6 However, recent systematic reviews7,8 have come to
diverse conclusions about the likely effectiveness of antibiotics, and the most
recent Cochrane review7 confirms a
moderate effect of antibiotics on illness course; the debate continues unabated about the role of antibiotics beFor editorial comment see p 3062.

Context Acute lower respiratory tract infection is the most common condition treated
in primary care. Many physicians still prescribe antibiotics; however, systematic reviews of the use of antibiotics are small and have diverse conclusions.
Objective To estimate the effectiveness of 3 prescribing strategies and an information leaflet for acute lower respiratory tract infection.
Design, Setting, and Patients A randomized controlled trial conducted from August 18, 1998, to July 30, 2003, of 807 patients presenting in a primary care setting
with acute uncomplicated lower respiratory tract infection. Patients were assigned to
1 of 6 groups by a factorial design: leaflet or no leaflet and 1 of 3 antibiotic groups
(immediate antibiotics, no offer of antibiotics, and delayed antibiotics).
Intervention Three strategies, immediate antibiotics (n = 262), a delayed antibiotic
prescription (n = 272), and no offer of antibiotics (n = 273), were prescribed. Approximately half of each group received an information leaflet (129 for immediate antibiotics, 136 for delayed antibiotic prescription, and 140 for no antibiotics).
Main Outcome Measures Symptom duration and severity.
Results A total of 562 patients (70%) returned complete diaries and 78 (10%) provided information about both symptom duration and severity. Cough rated at least
“a slight problem” lasted a mean of 11.7 days (25% of patients had a cough lasting
17 days). An information leaflet had no effect on the main outcomes. Compared
with no offer of antibiotics, other strategies did not alter cough duration (delayed, 0.75
days; 95% confidence intervals [CI], −0.37 to 1.88; immediate, 0.11 days; 95% CI,
−1.01 to 1.24) or other primary outcomes. Compared with the immediate antibiotic
group, slightly fewer patients in the delayed and control groups used antibiotics (96%,
20%, and 16%, respectively; P.001), fewer patients were “very satisfied” (86%,
77%, and 72%, respectively; P=.005), and fewer patients believed in the effectiveness of antibiotics (75%, 40%, and 47%, respectively; P.001). There were lower
reattendances within a month with antibiotics (mean attendances for no antibiotics,
0.19; delayed, 0.12; and immediate, 0.11; P=.04) and higher attendance with a leaflet (mean attendances for no leaflet, 0.11; and leaflet, 0.17; P=.02).
Conclusion No offer or a delayed offer of antibiotics for acute uncomplicated lower
respiratory tract infection is acceptable, associated with little difference in symptom
resolution, and is likely to considerably reduce antibiotic use and beliefs in the effectiveness of antibiotics.

cause these reviews are relatively small
(9 trials of 750 patients7
). There are also
concerns about complications if antibiotics are not prescribed9,10 and debate about which clinical characteristics identify those patients at higher
risk.11-14
Although double-blind placebocontrolled trials are important to assess efficacy, open trials help assess effectiveness and are vital when outcomes
include patient perceptions, beliefs, satisfaction, and return rate to the physician’s office15; only if patients know that
they are not getting antibiotics initially
can the impact on beliefs, antibiotic use,
and behavior of either not prescribing
or delayed prescribing be realistically assessed. By using simple-structured support and advice for each group, in effect
generating a placebo effect in each group,
any placebo effect related to prescribing antibiotics can be minimized.15
Prescribing strategies to treat upper
respiratory tract illness, which do not involve initial antibiotics (either no antibiotics or offering delayed antibiotics),
are effective in 70% to 90% of cases, result in acceptable symptom control, are
satisfactory to the patient,15 and can reduce reconsultation by up to 40%, with
the delayed approach having the lowest
reattendance rates.16 It is unclear whether
these findings can generalize to lower respiratory tract infection; 1 trial17 (n=191)
compared the delayed prescribing strategy with immediate prescribing, leaving it uncertain whether either approach was preferable to no offer of
antibiotic treatment, which has been advocated strongly.18A recent Cochrane review19 of delayed prescribing argued for
more evidence and, in particular, better
reporting of symptomatic outcomes.
The relative importance of prescribing strategies and information about
natural history is also unclear. Preliminary evidence suggests that provision
of an information leaflet can affect return rate and antibiotic use in lower respiratory tract infection,20,21 although the
effect on symptomatic management of
such a simple leaflet and whether a leaflet provides additional benefit to simple
verbal information remains unclear.
Our goals were to assess the effectiveness on symptoms, beliefs, and behavior of 3 different antibiotic prescribing
strategies and assess the effectiveness of
an information leaflet compared with
brief verbal information alone.
METHODS
Inclusion Criteria
We recruited patients aged 3 years or
older with uncomplicated acute illness
(21 days) who presented in primary
care with cough as the main symptom
and with at least 1 symptom or sign localizing to the lower tract (sputum, chest
pain, dyspnea, wheeze). Our criteria used
the same criteria as previous large cohorts in England of patients with lower
respiratory tract infection.22,23
Exclusion Criteria
We excluded patients with a history and
physical examination suggestive of
pneumonia based on the British Thoracic Society guidelines,24 which included new focal chest signs (focal
crepitations or bronchial breathing) and
systemic features (high fever, vomiting, severe diarrhea). Because there is
no clear agreement among the clinical
prediction rules that have been used to
exclude pneumonia11,12,14,25 and, although C reactive protein (CRP) may
help predict pneumonia, most physicians in England rarely use CRP in the
assessment of acute infections.11,12,26 We
also excluded patients clinically diagnosed with asthma; other chronic or
acute lung diseases, including cystic fibrosis, cardiovascular disease, major
current psychiatric diagnosis, mental
subnormality, and dementia; or with
complications from previous episodes
of lower respiratory tract infection (eg,
hospital admission for pneumonia).
Sample Size
Using our pilot data,27 for the immediate antibiotic prescribing strategy to
make an SD difference of approximately 0.3 in the severity of symptoms
or duration of cough (SD of 0.3 equals
1-2 days), we required at least 162 patients per antibiotic prescribing group,
or 486 diary returns (for=.05,=.20).
A total of 800 patients allowed us to detect an 11% difference in reconsultation rates.16Our study was approved first
by the South West Multi Centre Research Ethics Committee (whole region of South West England), and by
each local research ethics committee
(Southampton, Salisbury, Winchester,
Portsmouth, and Bristol).
Randomization
After written informed consent, 807 patients were randomized. Randomization was required within the consultation to make the prescribing strategies
feel the most natural to patients. Sealed
opaque numbered envelopes containing structured advice for 1 of the 6
groups were prepared several weeks in
advance at the study center by the research team by using computer generated random number tables, and block
randomization (block size 6) was used
to minimize significant group size discrepancies. Recruiters were not told that
block randomization was being used,
and different recruiters in each practice took individual envelopes from the
same source.
Patients were assigned to 1 of 6
groups by a factorial design. The first
factor randomized patients to leaflet or
no leaflet, and the second factor randomized patients to 1 of 3 antibiotic
groups (immediate antibiotics, no offer of antibiotics, and delayed antibiotics). Delayed antibiotics was defined as advice to use a course of
antibiotics available on request if symptoms were not resolved after 14 days.
The antibiotics prescribed to the patients were 250 mg of amoxicillin 3
times per day for 10 days (125 mg if
aged 10 years) or 250 mg of erythromycin 4 times per day if allergic to
penicillin. These doses were chosen
based on the British National Formulary recommendations for uncomplicated infection and from the evidence
of community studies in England before and during the study that indicated no resistance among streptococcal isolates.22,23
In the delayed antibiotic group, the
prescription was written at the time of

the initial consultation and left in a
box at reception. The decision to collect the script was left to the discretion of the patient or parents (if the
patient was age 16 years) without
requiring a further appointment,
which we have shown to be feasible
with high compliance.15 Although
patients were advised to wait 14 days,
they could request antibiotics earlier.
For each group, a small number of
statements were read by the physician, which included advice to take analgesics, the likely natural history of the
illness, and supporting the proposed
prescribing strategy. This generated a
placebo effect in each group.15 The physician checked a box when each statement was read, documented clinical
signs, and mailed the documentation
back to the study center.
All patients, irrespective of whether
they had the leaflet, were given brief
verbal information about the likely
range of natural history.20 The leaflet
was simple, only 1 page, and included
information about the natural history.21,28 It also addressed patients’ major worries28 and provided advice about
when to seek further help (eg, persistent fever, worsening shortness of
breath).
Outcome and Data Collection
Daily Diary and Satisfaction Questionnaire. Patients, or with parents’
help if younger than 16 years, completed a validated daily symptom diary (available on request). They also
recorded their temperature with singleuse disposable thermometers (3M
Tempa-DOT, 3M Corporate, St Paul,
Minn), where the dots change color and
can be read to within 0.1°C.27 The recorded diary items included antipyretic use and 6 symptoms (cough, dyspnea, sputum production, well-being,
sleep disturbance, and activity disturbance). Each of the 6 symptoms were
scored (0=no problem, 1=very little
problem, 2=slight problem, 3=moderate problem, 4=bad problem, 5=very
bad problem, and 6=as bad as it could
be). Patients also completed Likert
scales of how satisfied or concerned
they were with different aspects of treatment (6-point scale: extremely satisfied, very satisfied, moderately satisfied, slightly satisfied, not very satisfied,
and not at all satisfied). These Likert
scales have previously been shown to
be reliable, have good construct validity, and predict illness duration.15,29 Patients also rated their belief in antibiotics using a 6-point scale (extremely
effective, very effective, moderately effective, slightly effective, not very effective, and not at all effective).
Clinical Symptoms and Signs. The
clinical history, symptoms (prior duration, sputum production, sputum
color), signs (breath sounds: normal or
bronchovesicular), or added sounds
(crepitations, wheeze) were documented initially by the physician. Physicians were not provided with any special training, given that the examination
of the chest is part of daily routine clinical practice.
Reported Antibiotic Use. Because
prescription redemption is not necessarily a guide to prescription use, we
asked patients to document whether
they used antibiotics and for how many
days (giving patients the permission not
to comply but not encouraging noncompliance). We have previously
shown that reported antibiotic use,
documented by a self-completed questionnaire after the diary was completed, is very reliable when validated
against prescription collection.15
Notes Review. The patients’ notes
were reviewed by an author (J.K.)
who was blind to study group for
reconsultation with cough and for
complications within 1 month after
randomization. The advantage of
England’s primary care system is that
all patients are registered with their
primary care physician (private practice is rare), which means that contacts for review of illness will be documented in the note of the registered
practice.
Statistical Analysis
We used analysis of variance and logistic regression for a factorial study for
continuous and dichotomous outcomes, respectively. All patient data,
where outcomes were available and
with no imputation of missing values,
were analyzed according to the randomized group in an intention-totreat analysis. We first tested for interactions between factors. Because no
interactions were found, main effects
for each factor are presented that mutually control for the effect of each factor. For the number of reattendances
with cough in the month after the physician visit, which follows a Poisson distribution, we used Poisson regression
for a factorial study. Stata software version 7 (StataCorp LP, College Station,
Tex) was used for all statistical analyses. P.05 was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS
Recruitment
Thirty-seven physicians in England
(mainly around Southampton and Bristol) were recruited during a 5-year period (August 18, 1998, to July 30, 2003)
and 807 patients were recruited from
the same area (FIGURE 1). Although
most physicians only approached a few
patients (lack of time being the most
common reason), the 4 highest recruiting physicians recruited the majority of
the patients (540 patients [67%], most
of the patients presented to the physician). Recruitment status of patients
(from high vs low recruiting physicians) did not predict any outcome.
There was no evidence of any significant interaction between recruitment
status and the effectiveness of prescribing antibiotics immediately; the estimates of the interaction were small (for
the mean diary score, 0.25; 95% confidence interval [CI], −0.20 to 0.71; for
mean duration of moderately bad
cough, 1 day; 95% CI, –0.76 to 2.76
days; and for mean duration of any
moderately bad symptom, 0.55 days;
95% CI, –1.60 to 2.70 days).
Baseline Characteristics
We recruited 136 patients (17%) who
were children (16 years) and 133
older patients (17%) (60 years). As
expected, children presented with

higher temperatures (mean temperature, 36.9°C [SD, 0.7°C]), with 51%
having an axillary temperature of at
least 37.0°C; for adults, the mean temperature was 36.6°C (SD, 0.7°C).
Baseline clinical characteristics were
similar in the intervention groups
(TABLE 1). The severity of symptoms
was the primary outcome, which was
close to being significantly different by
group; however, the adjusted estimates for severity of symptoms including all baseline variables in the model
were –0.05 for leaflet vs no leaflet
(P=.58), –0.02 for delayed vs no antibiotics (P=.86), and –0.07 for immediate vs no antibiotics (P=.49). This
suggests adequate control of confounding by randomization.
Loss to Follow-up
for Symptom Resolution
A total of 562 patients (70%) returned
complete diaries after 3 weeks and an
additional 78 (10%) provided information about both symptom duration
and severity. There were no differences in baseline characteristics (eg,
fever, sputum, chest signs) comparing
those patients followed up to those
not followed up. Those patients not
followed up had low return rates in
the next month (6% vs 15% for those
followed up), which suggests they
were not likely to have had severe
illness.
Symptom Duration and Severity
Main results are shown in TABLE 2 and
TABLE 3; descriptive information for cumulative duration of symptoms is
shown in FIGURE 2. There was no effect
of the leaflet on any primary outcome.
Cough that was rated at least “a slight
problem” lasted a mean of 11.7 days
(25% of patients had a cough lasting
17 days), and a moderately bad cough
lasted a mean of 6.0 days (25% of patients had a cough lasting 8 days).
Compared with no offer of antibiotics,
other prescribing strategies did not
alter the primary outcomes (Table 2).
Antibiotics reduced duration of moderately bad symptoms (scoring 4 of
6 on any symptom each day) by 1 day
overall and reduced moderately bad
symptoms for 4 individual diary
items, but in all cases making less
than 1 day difference for phlegm
(mean, −0.96 days; 95% CI, −1.84 to
−0.08), sleep disturbance (mean,
−0.73 days; 95% CI, −1.46 to 0.00),
activity disturbance (mean, −0.93
days; 95% CI, −1.72 to −0.13), and
feeling unwell (mean, −0.91 days;
95% CI, −1.71 to −0.11).

Satisfaction, Beliefs,
and Antibiotic Use
Slightly fewer patients were very satisfied, fewer used antibiotics, and fewer
believed in the effectiveness of antibiotics in the delayed and control groups
vs the immediate antibiotic group
(Table 3).
Reattendance Within 1 Month
Overall, there were fewer reattendances with cough with delayed prescribing and immediate antibiotics in
the month after the physician visit
(mean attendances for no antibiotics,
0.19; delayed, 0.12; and immediate,
0.11; likelihood ratio [LR] test from
Poisson regression, P=.04). There was
increased attendance with a leaflet
(mean attendances for no leaflet, 0.11;
and leaflet, 0.17; LR test, P=.02). The
incidence rate ratio estimates for individual groups were 0.55 (95% CI, 0.33-
0.91; P=.02) for immediate antibiotics vs no antibiotics (a 45% decrease);
0.65 (95% CI, 0.40-1.04; P=.08) for delayed antibiotics vs no antibiotics (a
35% decrease); and 1.63 (95% CI, 1.07-
2.49, P=.02) for leaflet vs no leaflet (a
63% increase).
Adverse Events
One patient in the no antibiotic group
developed pneumonia, was admitted to
the hospital, administered antibiotics,
and recovered fully. Diarrhea was
slightly more common but not significantly in the delayed groups (odds ratio [OR], 1.17; 95% CI, 0.67-2.03;
P=.58) and the immediate group (OR,
1.22; 95% CI, 0.70-2.12; P=.48).
Subgroups
A priori, we defined patients with colored sputum and elderly persons aged
at least 60 years as possible subgroups

who might preferentially benefit from
the offer of immediate antibiotics.7,30
There was no evidence of a significantly different effect for those patients with colored sputum for duration of cough (interaction terms for
delayed group, −0.09 days; 95% CI,
−3.67 to 3.47; P=.96; interaction term
for immediate antibiotic group, −1.85
days; 95% CI, –5.51 to 1.81; P=.32).
Elderly patients had shorter symptom duration (−2.65 days; 95% CI,
−4.78 to −0.62; P=.01) and also benefited less from either delayed antibiotics (interaction term, 3.59 days; 95%
CI, 0.64-6.53; P=.02) or immediate antibiotics (interaction term, 2.84 days;
95% CI, 0.005-5.67; P=.05). These results were not affected by controlling
for baseline clinical characteristics.
There was no evidence for a differential effect in children, either in terms
of symptom duration or effect of prescribing strategies on outcome.
Patients with asthma at presentation were excluded, but some patients
were given a clinical diagnosis of asthma
during follow-up. Excluding 33 (5%)
of 691 patients who had a diagnosis of
asthma made in the subsequent 12
months did not alter the estimates of
effect size on duration of cough for immediate antibiotics (interaction term,
0.14 days; 95% CI, –1.01 to 1.29).
COMMENT
To our knowledge, our trial is the largest randomized trial of antibiotic use for
lower respiratory tract infection presenting in primary care and provides
important information for management, being a similar size to the data
set for the existing Cochrane systematic review,7 but also suggests a smaller
effect of antibiotics.
Our study had several limitations.
There is no widely agreed definition of
lower respiratory tract infection7
; therefore, we used the criteria from previous
large cohorts22,23 to define our study
population and, in practice, most patients in this cohort had acute cough with
sputum.
An open design was essential in our
study to allow the observance in practice of the pragmatic uptake and effect
of prescribing strategies on such outcomes as beliefs and antibiotic use. The
limitation of our design is the possibility of a placebo effect favoring antibiotics. However, any differential placebo
effect was minimized by the physician
using a structured approach to support
each strategy. There was no evidence of
a differential placebo effect using the
same approach in the previous trial in
upperrespiratorytractinfection.15 Inour
study, little evidence of a placebo effect
was observed favoring immediate antibiotics for the main outcome measures.
Our study confirms the long natural history of lower respiratory tract infection, in that patients need to be
warned that they will on average have
an illness lasting 3 weeks in total with
10 days of symptoms before the physician visit and 12 days after the physician visit.
Compared with immediate antibiotics, a strategy of either no offer of antibiotics or delayed prescribing is associated with little difference in
duration or severity of symptoms. This
is consistent with recent existing systematic reviews and suggests that for
most patients, antibiotics probably provide modest symptomatic relief.7,8 The
estimates from our study suggest that
the likely effect sizes of prescribing immediate antibiotics in routine practice
are likely to be rather more modest than
documented in the Cochrane review.7
A secondary finding from our study
was that immediate antibiotics may possibly reduce the duration of moderately
bad symptoms. This must be interpreted with caution as it is a secondary
finding. Even if this finding is not due
to type I error, it represents benefit of
only 1 day in an illness with a relatively
long natural history. It is difficult to justify widespread antibiotic prescribing for
uncomplicated lower respiratory tract infection on this basis given the dangers
of antibiotic resistance.31,32
Other important findings of our
study were that although 10% fewer of
our patients were very satisfied, not offering antibiotics or using delayed prescribing are both very acceptable to
most patients, which supports previous evidence about the modest differences in satisfaction when antibiotics
are prescribed33; and there are likely to
be reductions in both belief in antibiotics and antibiotic use, with delayed
prescribing performing almost as well
as no initial offer of antibiotic use. The
low prescription use for the collection
approach to delayed prescribing used
in our study is similar to the finding in
upper respiratory tract infection,15 but
may well be lower than rates of delayed prescription use in which the patient is given the prescription to take
away.34 Our study suggests that one advantage of immediate or delayed antibiotics is fewer reattendances with
cough in the month after the physician visit.
The lack of effect of an information
leaflet does not mean that leaflets are unhelpful because previous evidence suggests that they are helpful,20,21 but that
there is no reinforcing effect of a leaflet
beyond providing verbal information,
which all patients in our study were
given. The 14% decrease in antibiotic use
with a leaflet among those patients who
received a delayed antibiotic prescription reported previously20 occurred when
the delayed prescription was given to the

Feeling better was defined as a cough that was rated

patient and antibiotic use was high (49%-
63%). In contrast with our study in
which patients were asked to collect their
prescription if they wished to use it, antibiotic use was much lower, which may
have limited the power of our study to
detect an information-leaflet effect. The
finding of increased attendance during
the following month probably reflects patients responding to advice in the leaflet to reattend for particular circumstances, such as ongoing fever or
shortness of breath.
Inconclusion,inourpatientsfromprimary care who presented with acute uncomplicated lower respiratory tract infection, the use of delayed antibiotics or
no antibiotics was acceptable, resulted in
little difference in duration or severity of
symptoms compared with immediate
treatment with antibiotics, and considerably reduced both antibiotic use and
belief in antibiotics. These findings suggest that adopting these strategies would
help limit the vicious circle of the medicalization of self-limiting illness when antibiotics are prescribed. Immediate antibiotic prescribing is likely to limit the
number of patients who return for cough
within the next month but only by a little
more than delayed antibiotic prescription. The challenge now is for clinicians and researchers to determine which
groups are at risk of adverse outcomes
and identify those patients who might selectively benefit from immediate antibiotic prescription.
