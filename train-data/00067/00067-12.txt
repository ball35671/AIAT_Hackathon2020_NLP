Summary
Myrtol standardized (Gelomyrtol forte) is a phytotherapeutic extract (distillate) consisting
mainly of three monoterpenes: (+)α-pinene, d-limonene and 1,8-cineole.
Objective: This study describes and compares the efficacy, safety and tolerability of a 2-week
treatment with myrtol stand. (4 × 300 mg, day 1−14), cefuroxime (CAS 55268-75-2) (2 × 250
mg daily for day 1−6), ambroxol (CAS 18683-91-5) (3 × 30 mg for day 1−3, 2 × 30 mg for
days 4−14) and matched placebo in acute bronchitis.
Patients: 676 male and female outpatients, aged  18 years, with acute bronchitis of recent
onset (within last 5 days), with an FEV1 > 75 % of the normal EGKS-value and without
evidence or suspicion of chronic pulmonary disease or any further confounding illness were
included in the study.
Intervention: Patients were randomly assigned to a 2-week treatment course with either myrtol
stand. (N = 170), cefuroxime (N = 171), ambroxol (N = 163) or placebo (N = 172) in a
double-blind, placebo-matched, parallel-group fashion. Evaluations were at baseline (visit 1),
after 1 and 2 weeks of treatment (visits 2 and 3) and at 2 weeks after conclusion of the
treatments (visit 4).
Criteria: Responder- and non-responder rates (primary), signs (abnormal auscultation), symptoms (daily diary data on nightly cough, coughing fits during the day, sputum consistence and
general well-being; visit data on bronchial hyperreactivity and absence/presence of associated
symptoms), FEV1, overall efficacy, absence of relapse, safety and tolerability (adverse events,
laboratory screens, vital signs and physical examination). Criteria were evaluated for the intention-to-treat data-set (ITT) and the ’efficacy evaluable’ sample (EAP), i.e. excluding patients
with missing values (incl. discontinued non-responders and drop-outs for other reasons) at
the time of assessment.
Results: The signs and symptoms of acute bronchitis regressed readily in all treatment groups,
but regression was slower and less complete in the patients treated with placebo. In patients
treated with placebo, the acute bronchitis was considered to have deteriorated to such an
extent that discontinuation was indicated (’non-responder’) in 36 patients (ITT: 20.9 %, 95 %
CI: 15.1 to 27.8 % and EAP: 21.3 %, CI: 15.4 to 28.3 %) after 1 week (visit 2) and in 19
further patients (ITT: 11.0 %, CI: 6.8 to 16.7 %; EAP: 14.8 %, CI: 9.2 to 22.2 %) after 1 further
week (visit 3). In contrast, in the group of patients treated with myrtol stand. the non-reArzneim.-Forsch./Drug Res. 50 (II), Nr. 8 (2000) 700 Matthys et al. − Myrtol standardized

sponder rates at visits 2 and 3 were only 5.3 % (ITT, CI: 2.4 to 9.8 %; EAP: 5.4 %, CI: 2.5 to
10.0 %) and 1.2 % (ITT, CI: 0.1 to 4.2 %; EAP: 1.3 %, CI: 0.2 to 4.7 %); the responder rates
at visit 2 were statistically significantly higher (p < 0.001) for myrtol stand. (ITT: 92.9 %, CI:
88.0 to 96.3) compared to placebo (ITT: 77.3 %, CI: 70.3 to 83.4), and similar to those for
cefuroxime (ITT: 92.4 %, CI: 87.4 to 95.9) and ambroxol (ITT: 89.6 %, CI: 83.8 to 93.8 %).
The superiority of the active treatments vs. placebo with little difference among the treatments
was confirmed for all further criteria of evaluation. There was no evidence of bronchoconstriction or relapse in any treatment group for the patients continuing treatment (i.e. for those who
were not discontinued because of non-response). The treatments were safe and comparably
well tolerated.
Conclusion: Compared to placebo, treatment with myrtol stand. was well tolerated but evidently superior in terms of efficacy, resulting in a more rapid and more complete recovery;
although well comparable with the other active treatments, myrtol stand. tended to be superior
to cefuroxime and ambroxol for several ancillary criteria. Myrtol stand. is a well-evidenced
alternative to antibiotics for acute bronchitis without specified infective agent, without the
risk to promote the development of bacterial resistance.
Zusammenfassung
Wirksamkeit und Verträglichkeit von Myrtol standardisiert bei akuter Bronchitis / Eine
randomisierte, Plazebo-kontrollierte, doppelblind geführte Multizenter-Studie im Parallelgruppen-Design versus Cefuroxim und Ambroxol
Myrtol standardisiert (Gelomyrtol forte) ist ein pflanzliches Destillationspräparat mit den
hauptsächlichen Markern 1,8-Cineol, d-Limonen und α-Pinen.
Ziel: Diese Untersuchung beschreibt und vergleicht die Wirksamkeit und Verträglichkeit einer
2-wöchigen Behandlung mit Myrtol standardisiert (4 × 300 mg von Tag 1 bis 14), Cefuroxim
(CAS 55268-75-2) (2 × 250 mg täglich für die Tage 1−6), Ambroxol (CAS 18683-91-5) (3 × 30
mg für die Tage 1−3 und 2 × 30 mg für die Tage 4−14) und Plazebo bei akuter Bronchitis.
Patienten: 676 männliche und weibliche ambulante Patienten mit akuter Bronchitis seit weniger als 5 Tagen, mit einer FEV1 > 75 % und ohne klinischen Hinweis auf eine chronische
Atemwegserkrankung oder weitere gravierende Erkrankungen nahmen an der Studie teil.
Behandlungsschema: Die Patienten wurden zufallsbedingt, doppel-blind und Plazebo-kontrolliert einer zweiwöchigen Behandlung mit entweder Myrtol standardisiert (N = 170), Cefuroxim (N = 171), Ambroxol (N = 163) oder Plazebo (N = 172) gemäß einem Parallelgruppendesign zugeordnet. Kontrolluntersuchungen erfolgten zu Beginn der Behandlungsdauer (Visite
1), nach einer bzw. zwei Wochen der Behandlung (Visiten 2 + 3) und zwei Wochen nach
Behandlungsabschluß (Visite 4).
Endpunkte: Evaluiert wurden Responder und Non-Responder-Raten, klinische Untersuchungsbefunde (pathologische Auskultationsbefunde), Symptome (Tagebuchdaten über das
nächtliche Husten, Hustenattacken tagsüber, Sputumkonsistenz und allgemeines Wohlbefinden; klinische Befunde zu den jeweiligen Visiten bezüglich der bronchialen Hyperreaktivität
und relevanten Begleitsymptomen), FEV1, Globalbewertung der Wirksamkeit, Fehlen eines
Rezidivs, Verträglichkeit (unerwünschte Arzneimittelwirkungen, Screening von Laborparametern und körperliche Untersuchungsbefunde). Die Parameter wurden sowohl für die intentionto-treat Population (ITT) als auch für die efficacy analysable Population (EAP) bestimmt,
d. h. es wurden bei letzterer diejenigen Patienten ausgeschlossen, bei denen keine Daten erhoben werden konnten (einschließlich Non-Responder, die die Studie vorzeitig abbrachen, und
Studienabbrecher aus anderen Gründen).
Ergebnisse: Obwohl sich die Beschwerdesymptomatik in allen Behandlungsgruppen rasch besserte, war die Rückbildung bei den mit Plazebo behandelten Patienten langsamer und weniger
vollständig: unter Behandlung mit Plazebo, zeigten 36 Patienten (ITT: 20,9 %, 95 % CI: 15,1
bis 27,8 % und EAP: 21,3 %, CI: 15,4 bis 28,3 %) eine Verschlechterung der akuten Bronchitis
in einem solchen Ausmaß, daß sie die Studie nach 1 Woche abbrechen mußten (Non-Responder); nach einer weiteren Woche (Visite 3) wurden 19 zusätzliche Patienten als Non-Responder
betrachtet (ITT: 11,0 %, CI: 6,8 bis 16,7 %; EAP: 14,8 %, CI: 9,2 bis 22,2 %). In der Patientengruppe, die mit Myrtol standardisiert behandelt wurde, lag die Non-Responder-Rate bei
Visite 2 lediglich bei 5,3 % (ITT, CI: 2,4 bis 9,8 %; EAP: 5,4 %, CI: 2,5 bis 10,0 %) bzw. bei
Visite 3 lediglich bei 1,2 % % (ITT, CI: 0,1 bis 4,2 %; EAP: 1,3 %, CI: 0,2 bis 4,7 %); Die
Responderraten waren bei Visite 2 statistisch signifikant höher (p < 0,001) für Myrtol standar- disiert (ITT: 92,9 %, CI: 88,0 bis 96,3) im Vergleich zu Plazebo (ITT: 77,3 %, CI: 70,3 bis 83,4)
und ähnlich zu denen von Cefuroxim (ITT: 92,4 %, CI: 87,4 bis 95,9) und Ambroxol (ITT:
89,6 %, CI: 83,8 bis 93,8 %). Die Überlegenheit der aktiven Behandlungen gegenüber Plazebo
mit geringen Unterschieden unter den einzelnen Behandlungsgruppen konnte für alle weiteren
dargestellten Parameter bestätigt werden. Es gab keine Hinweise auf Bronchokonstriktion
oder Rezidive bei den Responder-Patienten. Die Behandlungen wurden vergleichsweise gut
vertragen.
Fazit: Myrtol standardisiert ist hinsichtlich der Verträglichkeit mit Plazebo vergleichbar, jedoch in bezug auf die Wirksamkeit bei der Behandlung der akuten Bronchitis Plazebo klar
überlegen; die Besserung des Beschwerdebildes ist unter Myrtol standardisiert schneller und

1. Introduction
Although mostly of viral origin, acute bronchitis is
still often treated with antibiotics [1, 2, 3]. The benefit of antibiotics in this indication is small [4,
5] in relation to the inherent risk to promote the
development of bacterial resistance [6, 7], a major
threat to public health [8]. In spite of many efforts
by expert advisory panels and intensified education, and the discomfort and dissatisfaction of the
prescribing physicians themselves, little change in
the prescribing habits in this indication has yet
been reached. This often is explained by the
patients’ pressure and expectations [9, 10, 11].
Overall, this demands for better alternatives.
Myrtol standardized1) is a phytotherapeutic extract
(distillate) consisting mainly of three monoterpenes: (+)α-pinene, d-limonene and 1,8-cineole. Its
efficacy in respiratory tract infections is primarily
related to its secretolytic and secretomotoric properties and the resulting improvement of bronchoalveolar and/or sinu-bronchial aeration. Further ancillary pharmacological properties might contribute to this, anti-inflammatory [12, 13] and anti-oxidant actions [14], in particular. Both ambroxol
[15−19], a further well-established mucolytic agent
[20], and myrtol stand. [21] were shown to be efficacious in preventing and alleviating acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, but there is little
documentation of their efficacy and tolerability in
acute bronchitis.
For these reasons the present study was carried out
to investigate the course of acute bronchitis under
treatment with myrtol stand. and ambroxol, compared to cefuroxime (a 2nd generation cephalosporin often used in lower respiratory tract infections,
incl. acute bronchitis) and placebo in an appropriately designed randomised, double-blind, controlled, parallel-group clinical trial.

ausgeprägter. Obwohl mit den anderen Behandlungsformen gut vergleichbar, zeigte Myrtol
standardisiert eine geringfügige Überlegenheit gegenüber Cefuroxim und Ambroxol bei mehreren der untersuchten Parameter. Myrtol standardisiert kann als gut belegte Alternative zu
Antibiotika bei der Behandlung der unspezifischen akuten Bronchitis betrachtet werden, da
es eine nachgewiesene Wirksamkeit besitzt ohne das Antibiotika-typische Risiko einer bakteriellen Resistenzentwicklung.

2. Methods
2.1. Ethical Considerations
The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (Somerset West, 1996) and the
Notes for Guidance on Good Clinical Practice. The
study protocol was reviewed and approved by pertinent
Ethics Committees. Participation in the study was voluntary. Only subjects who were willing and able to provide
informed consent were eligible.
2.2. Design
The study was conducted in a multi-centre, randomised,
placebo- and actively controlled, double-blind, parallelgroup fashion. Eligible patients with acute bronchitis
were randomly allocated to following investigational
treatments: 1) myrtol stand. (4 x 300 mg daily for 14
days), 2) cefuroxime (2 × 250 mg daily for day 1−6), 3)
ambroxol (3 × 30 mg for day 1−3, 2 × 30 mg for days 4−
14) and 4) matched placebo (4 times daily for days 1− 14); all patients received investigational medication 4
times daily for days 1−14; treatments were matched by
the use of placebo capsules.
2.3. Patients
Six-hundred-forty (640) patients with acute bronchitis
were intended to be recruited in approximately 54
centres to obtain at least 592 evaluable cases. Eventually,
681 patients were recruited by 40 active centres, 5 of
whom were not randomised. Male and female patients
were eligible if they met all of the following criteria: at
least 18 years of age, acute bronchitis of recent onset
(onset of symptoms within the last 5 days), with nightly
cough (at least 4 awakenings due to cough during the
night) as main symptom, without reduced FEV1 (i.e. >
75 % of the normal) and otherwise good physical and
mental condition. Furthermore, they had to be willing
and able to provide informed consent. Patients with any
of the following were to be excluded: chronic bronchitis
and/or acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, recurrent acute bronchitis (within 4 weeks prior to study admission), bronchial asthma, suspected or evidenced
pneumonia, concomitant bacterial infection, fever
>39.5 °C (rectally) or  39 °C (axillary, orally), pregnancy, lactation, relevant allergy or hypersensitivities,
lithiasis, gastritis or peptic ulcer disease, evidence or suspicion of drug, medication or alcohol abuse, any relevant
associated disease or abnormal finding on extensive prestudy evaluation (including lab. screen), suspicion of
likely lack of compliance, recent participation in another
clinical trial. Treatment with antibiotics was prohibited
Arzneim.-Forsch./Drug Res. 50 (II), Nr. 8 (2000) 702 Matthys et al. − Myrtol standardized

from two weeks prior to the study and during the study.
Secretolytics, mucolytics, tussisedatives were prohibited
from 5 days before enrolment and during the study. Recent therapy with acetylsalicylic acid (within 12 h prior
to inclusion) was not allowed. From the start of the
study onwards, therapy with analgesics, except paracetamol, was prohibited. Additionally, inhalation and physical therapy of bronchitis was not allowed from the start
of the study onwards. Any other concomitant medication was only allowed if it did not interfere with the eligibility criteria and the evaluation of the study endpoints.
Patients had the right to withdraw from the study at any
time and for any reason. Each investigator was entitled
to withdraw any patient prematurely if this was deemed
to be in the patient’s best interest (e.g. in the case of
adverse events, need for prohibited medication, intercurrent disease etc.). Additionally, patients were to be discontinued prematurely if they failed to adhere to the
treatment schedule, if they were found not to have met
the eligibility criteria and/or if they were found not to
comply with the protocol directives. In order not to deny
patients specific (unblinded) treatment, patients were
also to be discontinued in the event of any of the following: 1) deterioration of acute bronchitis (visit 2) and deterioration of acute bronchitis or lack of improvement
(visit 3), 2) suspected pneumonia, 3) FEV1 < 75 % of
normal, 4) fever above the level of eligibility and relevant
changes of safety lab. tests (serum creatinine > 1.8 mg %
or SGPT > 3 times upper normal value).
2.4. Schedule
The study was to last up to 28 days in each given individual, with investigational treatment regimens lasting
14 days. The study comprised 4 visits: Visit 1 (study day
1): baseline, assessment of eligibility, enrolment, randomisation, start of treatment; Visit 2 (study day 7 ± 2):
evaluation after 1 week of treatment, assessment of
study criteria; Visit 3 (study day 14 ± 2): evaluation after
2 weeks of treatment; Visit 4 (study day 15−28) final examination and (in those still on study) evaluation at 2
weeks after the regular end of the investigational treatment phase.
2.5. Study medication
Gelomyrtol forte capsules (300 mg) and placebo capsules were provided by the Sponsor; commercially available formulations were used for the treatments with ambroxol and cefuroxime. All medications were encapsulated to allow appropriate matching.
2.6. Treatments
The patients took the medications themselves in ambulatory fashion. Compliance was surveyed by pill-count
at visits 2 and 3. The patients were instructed to take 4
capsules per day for 14 days, in the morning, at noon
and in the evening − 30 min before meals − and at bedtime. The capsules were to be taken with sufficient cold
water. If the patient forgot to take a capsule at the given
time, he/she was not to take it at a later time that day,
but to leave it in the blister.
2.7. Treatment assignment
For each treatment group, the study medication was assembled in individual subject boxes. These were allocated to the individual participants in accordance with
the randomisation list provided by the sponsor. In each
centre, the investigator allocated the study medication in
ascending order.
2.8. Study criteria and methods
The study evaluated the course of acute bronchitis on
the basis of the following criteria:
 Responder- and non-responder rate: at visits 2 and 3,
the investigator was to assess whether the condition
of the patient had worsened (i.e. making it appropriate to discontinue investigational treatment). Patients
considered to suffer a relevant deterioration (visit 2
and 3) or also a relevant lack of improvement (visit 3)
were considered ’non-responders’ (at that visit).
Patients without such relevant deterioration and who
were not discontinued prematurely from the study because of other reasons unrelated to the clinical course
of the disease were considered ’responders’.
 Diary data on coughing fits during the day, disturbance of sleep by cough, type of cough (sputum consistence) and general well-being as recorded daily by
the patient on categorised verbal rating scales (VRS)
 Clinical signs: temperature and lung auscultation
(classified as “normal” or “abnormal”; in case of abnormal findings, these were to be specified acc. to predefined categories)
 Clinical symptoms: absence/presence of acute rhinitis,
sore throat, difficulty swallowing, hoarseness, headache, pain in limbs and joints, fatigue, others (with
specification)
 Overall efficacy: the patient and the physician were to
score their overall evaluation of the efficacy on visits
2, 3 and 4 as “very good”, “good”, “moderate”,
“bad” and “very bad” (5-point VRS).
 Bronchial hyperreactivity as characterised by
coughing when exposed to cold/change of temperatures, during exercise and/or when exposed to noxious substances (e.g. cigarette smoke).
 The change of lung function was assessed by measuring the forced expiratory volume in one second
(FEV1) in relation to the normal reference value
(EGK) [22]
 The number of patients with a relapse of the acute
bronchitis within 4 weeks after first application of the
study drugs
Safety and tolerability were evaluated with regard to the
following: adverse events, vital functions (blood pressure
and pulse rate), physical examinations and safety laboratory screens (haematology, clinical chemistry and urinalysis).
2.9. Statistical analysis
Two data-sets were assessed:
 ITT (intention-to-treat − ’full sample analysis’): all
patients who were treated at least once
 EAP (efficacy analysable population): patients as evaluable for a given criterion at the given timepoint; this
excludes ITT-patients discontinued before the given
visit because of non-response and those discontinued
because of any other reason plus patients who had
not been discontinued but for whom data for the given
criterion were missing at that time
The EAP accounts for ’informative’ drop-outs [23], due
to treatment related differences in the discontinuation
rates (and resulting exposure) in the absence of procedures to replace missing values [24]. Both data-sets are
to be looked at in parallel and are not mutually exclusive. The EAP at a given visit hence represents the sample
of the ITT that was not discontinued previously for any
reason, lack of response inclusively.
A stepwise testing procedure of a priori ordered hypotheses was established in the study protocol. First myrtol
stand. was compared to placebo. In case of a significant
Arzneim.-Forsch./Drug Res. 50 (II), Nr. 8 (2000)

result of this 1st step, myrtol stand. was compared to
cefuroxime. For both steps a chi-squared test was used
with a two-sided significance level α = 0.05. This analysis was based on the ITT responder rates at visit 2. All
further analyses were carried out descriptively reporting
frequencies, means and the corresponding 2-sided 95 %
confidence intervals (CI).
3. Results
3.1. Patient disposition
The study was carried out between March 1998
and January 1999. The time course of enrolment
between August and December 1998 is shown in
Fig. 1. A total of 681 patients were enrolled, 676
patients were randomised and treated with study
medication (= ITT and safety evaluable data-set).
Seven patients were discontinued prematurely or
withdrew from the study between visit 1 and visit
2 (2 because of re-confirmed non-eligibility, 2 because of adverse events (AE) and 3 because of administrative reasons). A total of 94 patients were
discontinued at visit 2, including 69 patients discontinued also because of non-response (s. below);
a total of 47 further patients were discontinued at
visit 3, including 37 patients discontinued because
of non-response (s. below). 17/676 (2.5 %) patients
were discontinued because of AE (multiple reasons
possible, s. below).
3.2. Protocol deviations
At the blinded report planning meeting, 107 minor
and 51 major protocol deviations were identified;
the main deviations related to low compliance (23
minor and 18 major) and/or deviations from the
time window for visit 2 (24 minor and 16 major).
Additionally, patients with relevant deterioration
and/or lack of improvement (non-responders) were
intended to be discontinued at visit 2 and 3; six
patients who were labelled as non-responder either
at visit 2 (5 pts.) or visit 3 (1 pt.) were erroneously
not discontinued; these patients were not excluded
from the efficacy analysis and were categorised as
’non-responder’ in spite of the lack of discontinuation.
3.3. Demography
The study patients (N: 676, 58.1 % females), had a
mean age of 39 years (range of 18−79 years) and
were caucasian. The main demographic data are
shown in Table 1. There were no relevant differences in demographic details between the treatment groups. 57.5 % of the patients were nonsmokers; a total of 235 previous and/or concomitant diseases were documented in 155 (23 %)
patients of the ITT sample; hypertension was the
most common diagnosis, i.e. occurring in 71
patients. 296 patients (43.8 %) received at least one
concomitant medication; vitamins and minerals
were the most often cited. These features were
equally distributed across the treatment groups
and none meant a relevant confounding factor to
the efficacy analysis.

94 % reporting at least 4 coughing fits during the
day (94−96 % reporting either a dry cough or viscous sputum) and 72−78 % reporting feeling ’bad’
or ’very bad’ upon entrance in the study. About
36 % had temperature > 37.5 °C; in 72−76 %
patients abnormal findings were reported upon
auscultation (mainly as sibilant ronchi/buzzing),
49−59 % had associated acute rhinitis, 47−57 % reported associated sore throat, 19−23 % difficulty
swallowing and 49−55 % hoarseness; 58−61 % also
reported headache, 37−43 % had pain in the limbs
and joints and 65−72 % fatigue; in 51−57 % of the
patients bronchial hyperreactivity was reported;
bronchial obstruction was no common finding
(patients with FEV1 < 75 % of normal were not
considered eligible) for the present trial.

3.4.2. Natural course of disease under study −
placebo treatment
Under treatment with placebo, a clear improvement was seen within one week: there was a clear
reduction in cough during the day and during the
night (Fig. 3), the sputum was easier to expectorate
(37 % reporting filmy or liquid sputum on visit 2
vs. only 5 % on visit 1 [EAP]) and the patients felt
generally better (33 % reporting feeling ’good’ or
very good’ at visit 2 vs. none at visit 1 [EAP]).

Findings on lung auscultation had improved as
well (50 % now having abnormal findings vs. 76 %
at visit 1 [EAP], see Fig. 4) and associated symptoms were less frequent (Fig. 5). Nevertheless, after
1 week of treatment (at visit 2) the condition in 36/

EAP: 21.3 %, CI: 15.4 to 28.3 %) was considered
to have deteriorated to such and extent that discontinuation was indicated (’non-responder’, Table

After one further week of treatment in the remaining patients [EAP at visit 3], the overall condition
in general had improved even further: 49 % had no
coughing fits during the day (vs. 13 % and 0 % at
visits 2 and 1, respectively), 78 % had no awakening during the night (vs. 49 and 1 % at visits 2 and
1) and 71 % reporting feeling ’good’ or ’very good’
(vs. 33 % and 0 % at visits 2 and 1); an abnormal
auscultation was reported in 20 % [EAP]; associated symptoms had become relatively uncommon
(Fig. 5). However, in 19/172 patients originally initiated (ITT: 11 %, CI: 7 to 17 %) i.e. 19/128
patients still under treatment at visit 3 (EAP: 15 %,
CI: 9 to 22 %), the treatment had to be discontinued at this time (’non-responders’ at visit 3) because of a deterioration or lack of improvement of
the acute bronchitis (Table 2, Fig. 2). Of the 172
patients enrolled in the placebo group, 107 completed the study up to visit 4. At that time, the
associated symptoms had cleared in most but not
all patients and the abnormal auscultation was still
present in 4.7 % [EAP]; bronchial hyperreactivity
was still present in 21.5 % (CI: 14.1 to 30.5). There
was no evidence of bronchoconstriction and/or relapse in the subjects still under study at that time.
3.4.3. Treatment with myrtol stand.
Under treatment with Myrtol stand., there was a
qualitatively similar change over time, but the improvement was more extensive and relatively faster: the percentage of patients with  4 awakenings
during the night due to cough decreased from
100 % (visit 1) to 6 % (visit 2 [EAP]) and patients
with  4 coughing fits during the day from 93 %
to 28 % [EAP]; the sputum was easier to expectorate (63 % reporting filmy or liquid sputum on visit
2 vs. only 5 % on visit 1 [EAP]); the patients felt
generally better (47 % reporting ’good’ or very
good’ at visit 2 vs. 1 % at visit 1 [EAP], Fig. 3). Findings on lung auscultation had improved as
well (28 % now having abnormal findings vs. 73 %
at visit 1 [EAP], Fig. 4); associated rhinitis (visit 2:

(visit 2: 4 %, visit 1: 22 % [EAP]), hoarseness (visit
2: 24 %, visit 1: 53 % [EAP]), headache (visit 2:
24 %, visit 1: 58 % [EAP]), pain in joints and limbs
(visit 2: 10 %, visit 1: 43 % [EAP]) and fatigue (visit
2: 36 %, visit 1: 72 % [EAP]) all improved (Fig. 5).
Bronchial hyperreactivity improved similarly. Only
in 9/170 patients (ITT: 5.3 %, CI: 2.4 to 9.8 %,
EAP: 5.4 %, CI: 2.5 to 10.0) the condition was considered to have deteriorated to the extent of requiring discontinuation (’non-responder’, Table 2, Fig.
2). The responder rate for myrtol stand. (ITT:
92.9 %, CI: 88.0 to 96.3) was significantly (p <
0.001) larger than for placebo (ITT: 77.3 %, CI:
70.3 to 83.4), but not statistically significantly different (p: 0.85) from that for cefuroxime (ITT:
92.4 %, CI: 87.4 to 95.9, Table 2, Fig. 2). After one
further week of treatment with myrtol stand. in the
remaining patients [EAP at visit 3], the overall condition in general had improved even further: 63 %
had no coughing fits during the day (vs. 9 % and
0 % at visits 2 and 1, respectively), 91 % had no
awakening during the night (vs. 58 and 0 % at visits
2 and 1) and 86 % reporting feeling ’good’ or ’very
good’ (vs. 47 % and 1 % at visits 2 and 1; Fig. 3);
an abnormal auscultation was reported for only
3 % [EAP] (Fig. 4); associated rhinitis (5 % [EAP]),
sore throat (3 % [EAP]), difficulty swallowing
(1 % [EAP]), hoarseness (5 % [EAP]), headache
(7 % [EAP]), pain in joints and limbs (5 %
[EAP]) and fatigue (11 % [EAP]) all had become
relatively uncommon (Fig. 5). In only 2/170
patients originally initiated (ITT: 1.2 %, CI: 0.1
to 4.2 %) i.e. 2/152 patients still under treatment
at visit 3 (EAP: 1.3 %, CI: 0.2 to 4.7 %), the
treatment had to be discontinued at this time
(’non-responders’ at visit 3) because of a deterioration or lack of improvement of the acute
bronchitis (Table 2, Fig. 2).

group, 149 completed the study up to visit 4. At
that time, the associated symptoms had cleared in
most but not all patients and no abnormal findings
on auscultation were present in any of the subjects
[EAP] who completed the study. Bronchial hyperreactivity was present in only 13.4 % (CI: 8 to
20 %). There was no evidence of bronchoconstriction and/or relapse in the subjects still under study

3.4.4. Treatments with ambroxol and cefuroxime
In general, cefuroxime and ambroxol had a similarly beneficial effect, clearly superior to that of
placebo, with little difference vs. myrtol stand., although the latter tended in general to score
slightly better.

(Fig. 6): for 42 %, 79 %, 74 % and 67 % (ITT) the
efficacy was scored as ’good’ or ’very good’ by the
physicians (41 %, 78 %, 74 % and 66 % for the
scores by the patients) at visit 2 for the treatment
groups with myrtol stand., placebo, cefuroxime
and ambroxol, respectively. For 92 %, 66 %, 89 %
and 86 % of the patients who remained under
study, i.e. for those who had not to be discontinued (incl. drop-outs for non-response − EAP),
the physicians scored similarly high at visit 4
(91 %, 65 %, 89 % and 87 % for the patient
scores).
3.4.6. Safety and tolerability
There was a total of 131 AEs in 104/676 subjects:
15.9, 16.3, 14.0 and 15.3 % of the subjects treated
with myrtol stand., placebo, cefuroxime and ambroxol (respectively) experienced at least one AE.
There was one serious AE (mild increase in serum
hepatic enzymes requiring hospitalisation for clarification) in a patient treated with placebo; no AE

was labelled as severe, 48 AE as of moderate intensity (myrtol stand.: 12, placebo: 10, cefuroxime: 12,
ambroxol: 14 AE) and 83 as of mild intensity.
Fifty-six AE (41 of mild and 15 of moderate intensity) were considered at least possibly treatment related: 18, 4, 15 and 19 AE under treatment with
myrtol stand., placebo, cefuroxime and ambroxol
respectively. 17/676 (2.5 %) patients were discontinued (also − multiple reasons possible) because
of AE (24): 5, 2, 8 and 2 pts. treated with myrtol
stand., placebo, cefuroxime and ambroxol, respectively.
There was no evidence or indication of relevant
changes with regard to the findings upon physical
examination, vital functions (blood pressure and
pulse rate) and safety laboratory screens (haematology, clinical chemistry and urinalysis).
The treatments scored comparably well upon
evaluation of tolerability by patients and physicians: for 88 %, 86 %, 90 % and 90 % (ITT) the
tolerability was scored as ’good’ or ’very good’ by
the physicians (85 %, 86 %, 84 % and 87 % for the
scores by the patients) at visit 2 for the treatment
groups with myrtol stand., placebo, cefuroxime
and ambroxol, respectively. For 97 %, 94 %, 98 %
and 96 % of the patients who remained under
study, i.e. for those who had not to be discontinued
(incl. drop-outs for non-response − EAP), the
physicians scored similarly high at visit 4 (93 %,
95 %, 96 % and 95 % for the patient scores).
4. Discussion
Although mostly of viral origin, and in spite of
well-evidenced expert advice against it, acute bronchitis still is often treated with antibiotics. This
usually is explained by the patients’ pressure and
expectations. This latter factor might be challenged
if appropriate alternatives were available. In
patients with acute bronchitis and wheezing (or
other evidence of bronchoconstriction), bronchodilators might be an alternative [25, 26, 27]; but
their safety margin is low, especially because of
tremor and − although less frequently − because of
untoward cardiovascular extension effects [28, 29].
Additionally, this approach might be less appropriate for patients with acute bronchitis without evident bronchoconstriction [30]. Muco-secretolytic
drugs are a further alternative. Their efficacy in
preventing and alleviating acute exacerbations of
chronic bronchitis has been extensively investigated and confirmed, but little is known about
their efficacy and tolerability in acute bronchitis in
patients without chronic respiratory disease. The
present study was carried out to address this question.
The present study confirmed that acute bronchitis
is a bothersome disease with a broad variety of
symptoms at onset and a clear impairment of wellbeing. The observations in the group treated with
placebo clearly showed that the condition is selflimiting as it regresses readily − albeit not completely − in many patients. But it also showed that
there is room for improvement by appropriate
therapeutic intervention.
Indeed, in the actively treated patient groups, the
non-responder rates (i.e. the frequency of patients
with a deterioration and/or lack of improvement
to such an extent that discontinuation from the
study was to be considered) at visit 2 (after 1 week
of treatment) and 3 (after 2 weeks of treatment)
were clearly lower than for placebo. The superiority of the active treatments vs. placebo, with little
difference among the active treatments, was evident also for the cough data, and the associated
signs and symptoms: there was a rapid, treatment
dependent regression of the frequency of abnormal
auscultation, and associated hoarseness, headache,
pain in joints and limbs and fatigue, but not for
associated rhinitis and sore throat (which cleared
similarly fast for all treatments). This was confirmed by the patient’s and investigator’s valuation
of efficacy: at visit 3, the investigators considered
the efficacy at least good for 80.0 % (ITT − 89.5 %
for EAP) and 41.9 % (ITT − 56.3 % for EAP) of
the patients treated with myrtol stand. and placebo, respectively; this was similar on the basis of
the patient’s valuation.
The extent of discomfort due to coughing fits during the day and the night reflected the treatment
effects differently, whereby the latter are less confounded and more suitable to evaluate treatment
effects [31, 32].
Additionally, the active treatments were in general
very well tolerated; AE were relatively few and
mostly of mild-to-moderate intensity. There were
no treatment related changes upon physical examination, for vital functions and for the safety lab.
data.
It is concluded therefore, that treatment with myrtol stand. is as well tolerated as placebo but evidently superior in terms of efficacy when treating
acute bronchitis, resulting in a more rapid and
more complete recovery; in general, although well
comparable with the other active treatments, myrtol stand. tended to be superior to alternative active treatments for several criteria. In view of this,
myrtol stand. ought to be considered as a well-evidenced alternative to antibiotics for acute bronchitis, as it is evidently efficacious but carries no
risk to cause bacterial resistance.
