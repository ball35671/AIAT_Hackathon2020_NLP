Objective. To investigate the effectiveness of acupuncture in addition to routine care, compared with
routine care alone, in the treatment of patients with
chronic pain due to osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee or
hip.
Methods. In a randomized, controlled trial, patients with chronic pain due to OA of the knee or hip
were randomly allocated to undergo up to 15 sessions of
acupuncture in a 3-month period or to a control group
receiving no acupuncture. Another group of patients
who did not consent to randomization underwent acupuncture treatment. All patients were allowed to receive
usual medical care in addition to the study treatment.
Clinical OA severity (Western Ontario and McMaster
Universities Osteoarthritis Index [WOMAC]) and
health-related quality of life (Short Form 36) were
assessed at baseline and after 3 months and 6 months.
Results. Of 3,633 patients (mean  SD age 61.8 
10.8 years; 61% female), 357 were randomized to the
acupuncture group and 355 to the control group, and
2,921 were included in the nonrandomized acupuncture
group. At 3 months, the WOMAC had improved by a
mean  SEM of 17.6  1.0 in the acupuncture group
and 0.9  1.0 in the control group (3-month scores
30.5  1.0 and 47.3  1.0, respectively [difference in
improvement 16.7  1.4; P < 0.001]). Similarly, quality
of life improvements were more pronounced in the
acupuncture group versus the control group (P <
0.001). Treatment success was maintained through 6
months. The changes in outcome in nonrandomized
patients were comparable with those in randomized
patients who received acupuncture.
Conclusion. These results indicate that acupuncture plus routine care is associated with marked clinical
improvement in patients with chronic OA–associated
pain of the knee or hip.
Osteoarthritis (OA) has a major impact on patients’ physical functioning and independent mobility
(1). Common sites of OA are the knee and the hip (2).
The antiinflammatory medications frequently used to
treat symptoms of this condition are associated with a
number of side effects (3). Furthermore, if these drugs
do not lead to adequate response, replacement surgery
is often recommended (4).
In recent years, patients with chronic pain have
increasingly used acupuncture for relief (5). In a systematic review including 7 randomized controlled trials with
a total of 393 patients, acupuncture was shown to be
more effective than sham acupuncture in reducing pain,
whereas the results regarding joint function were inconclusive (6). Two recent studies, one by Berman et al (7)
and one by our group (8), showed some evidence that
acupuncture is superior to sham acupuncture in improvSupported by the following statutory health insurance funds

ing function and reducing pain in patients with OA of
the knee. The main aim of all of the above-mentioned
studies was to determine the efficacy of acupuncture
compared with sham acupuncture. To maximize internal
validity, these trials used standardized or at least semistandardized acupuncture interventions. In contrast, in
routine care a broad variety of acupuncture styles is
used, and acupuncture is often administered in conjunction with other treatments. To date there has been
little information about the effectiveness of acupuncture
treatment provided as an adjunct to routine medical care.
In 2000 the German Federal Committee of Physicians and Health Insurers proposed that large research
initiatives on the use of acupuncture for several pain
syndromes could be conducted by health insurance
companies (9). As one of these research initiatives, we
designed the present study as a pragmatic trial to
investigate the efficacy of acupuncture in addition to
routine care compared with routine care alone in patients with pain due to OA of the knee or the hip. In
addition, we examined whether the effects of acupuncture differ in randomized and nonrandomized patients,
whether treatment effects last for a period of time after
treatment is discontinued, and whether specific patient
and physician characteristics are associated with particular treatment outcomes.
Based in part on the results of the present study,
the German Federal Committee of Physicians and
Health Insurers proposed in April 2006 that acupuncture will be reimbursed by statutory health insurance
funds. Pending final decision by the German Ministry of
Health, acupuncture will likely be provided as a routine
medical option in the treatment of pain due to OA of the
knee.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Study design. The Acupuncture in Routine Care
(ARC) study included a multicenter, randomized, controlled
trial and a nonrandomized cohort. Patients who agreed to
randomization were allocated to an acupuncture group (patients who received immediate acupuncture treatment) or a
control group (patients who received delayed acupuncture
treatment [starting 3 months after baseline]). Patients who
declined to be randomized were included in a third arm and
also received immediate acupuncture treatment (nonrandomized acupuncture group). The study period for each patient
was 6 months: a 3-month treatment phase followed by 3
months of followup.
The ARC study is part of a large acupuncture research
initiative funded by a group of statutory health insurance funds
that provide coverage to 10% of the German population.
The study protocol was approved by the local ethics review
boards, and the study itself was conducted according to
standard guidelines (i.e., Declaration of Helsinki and Good
Epidemiological Practice [10]). All study participants provided
written informed consent.
Patients. All patients in this study were insured by one
of the participating statutory health insurance funds and had
contacted a participating physician due to OA pain in the knee
or hip. If the patient requested acupuncture or if the physician
considered acupuncture to be a suitable treatment option, the
patient was informed about the study. Patients were provided
with information on the study design, study procedure, and
acupuncture treatment. Those who met the inclusion criteria
(see below), provided informed consent, and signed an agreement for randomization were randomized using a central
telephone randomization procedure. For randomization we
used blocks of 10, and the random list was generated with SAS
software. Patients who declined randomization were included
in the nonrandomized acupuncture group. Patients were included in the study only if we received the patient consent form
following randomization. Upon successful enrollment in the
study, patients were sent, by standard mail, a questionnaire in
which to record their baseline characteristics. Criteria for
inclusion in the study were as follows: age 40 years, clinical
diagnosis of OA-associated pain in the knee or hip with disease
duration of 6 months, radiologic evidence of OA (osteophyte
formation), and at least 15 days with pain in the preceding 30
days. Knee or hip pain due to inflammation or malignancy was
a criterion for exclusion.
Interventions. Physicians interested in participating in
the study were required to have at least an A-diploma, which
represents 140 hours of certified acupuncture education. Certified acupuncture education and training programs in Germany vary widely in terms of the acupuncture style and
technique that are taught.
Each patient in the randomized and nonrandomized
acupuncture groups received up to 15 acupuncture sessions
during the first 3 months of the study, and no acupuncture
during the fourth through sixth months. Because the aim of
this study was to assess the effectiveness of acupuncture in
general medical practice, each patient could be treated individually (as opposed to use of a standardized protocol), and
the number of needles and acupuncture points used were
chosen at the physician’s discretion. Only needle acupuncture
(with disposable 1-time-use needles) was allowed; other forms
of acupuncture treatment (e.g., laser acupuncture, electroacupuncture, moxibustion) were not permitted. In addition,
only manual needle stimulation was allowed. The control
group was not allowed to receive any kind of acupuncture
during the first 3 months. In all 3 treatment groups, the
patients were permitted to receive any additional conventional
treatments as needed. In accordance with German federal
regulations, the participating health insurance companies covered 100% of the acupuncture costs for patients who agreed to
randomization and 90% percent of the costs for patients who
participated in the study but did not agree to randomization.
Outcome measures. The patients completed standardized questionnaires, including information on sociodemographic characteristics, at baseline and after 3 months and 6
months. The primary outcome measure was the Western
Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index
(WOMAC) (11,12). The patients documented, at baseline,
3486 WITT ET AL
which was the most painful joint and assessed this during the
whole study period. As a secondary outcome measure, we used
the percent reduction in the WOMAC index. If the WOMAC
index increased in a patient during followup, the percent was
calculated with respect to the maximum possible decrease and
shown as a negative value. We decided to use the percent
reduction rather than the absolute reduction in the WOMAC
index since the latter correlated with the baseline score (r
0.415) while the former showed almost no correlation (r
0.047). Patients who showed an improvement of at least 50% in
the WOMAC were considered to be treatment responders. All
patients with missing data were counted as nonresponders.
As further secondary outcome parameters we used the
Short Form 36 (SF-36) component scales (13) to assess
health-related quality of life. Side effects were recorded on
patient and physician questionnaires after 3 months.
Statistical analysis. Confirmatory testing of the primary and secondary outcome measures (using SPSS 11.5) was
based on the intent-to-treat population, using the maximum
available data set. Sensitivity analyses for the primary outcome
measure were performed either by replacing missing data
according to the last observation carried forward principle or
by using various hot deck methods or regression-based multiple imputation. Test procedures to maintain a global significance level () of 5% were performed. Using covariance
analysis, we tested the 2-sided null hypothesis, i.e., mean
WOMAC index after 3 months of acupuncture  mean
WOMAC index after 3 months in controls. Group sizes of 223
patients were required for the study to have 90% power to
detect a difference of 8 points in the WOMAC index, assuming
a mean of 43 score points and an SD of 26.
In order to identify factors affecting improvement in
the WOMAC index and for better understanding of patient
selection due to acceptance of randomization, we fitted linear
mixed models for the WOMAC index to the data on all study
patients. Mixed models were chosen to comply with the
potential cluster structure of the data, because several patients
were enrolled by the same physician. As potential regressors,
we prespecified several characteristics of the physicians (age,
years of professional experience, type of acupuncture diploma,
hours of acupuncture training, years of acupuncture experience, experience in diagnosis in the context of traditional
Chinese medicine, and percent of practice time spent performing acupuncture) and of the patients (sex, age, education level,
baseline physical and mental quality of life scores, WOMAC
index, duration of symptoms prior to the study, and study
group to which each patient was assigned). For the final model,
we selected significant variables in a stepwise backwards
procedure based on likelihood ratio tests. In addition, we
considered the selected regressors as potential modifiers of the
acupuncture effect and added the corresponding interaction
terms to the model, backwards selecting if they were significant. All reported P values are 2-sided.
RESULTS
Patient enrollment, baseline characteristics, and
treatment. From July 2001 to July 2004 a total of 3,633
patients with pain due to arthritis of the knee or the hip
were recruited for the study, by 1,417 study physicians
(Figure 1). A total of 712 patients accepted randomization and were allocated to the acupuncture group or the
control group. Eighty patients (35 randomized to the
acupuncture group, 45 to the control group) could not
be included in the analysis because the study office did
not receive the consent form or the patient did not
receive the study intervention. The remaining 3,553
patients (322 in the randomized acupuncture group, 310
in the control group, 2,921 in the nonrandomized acupuncture group) were included in the analysis. After 3
months, data were available on 93.2% of the patients
(308 in the randomized acupuncture group, 289 in the
control group, 2,716 in the nonrandomized acupuncture
group).
The randomized groups were comparable with
regard to baseline characteristics (Table 1). In addition,
with the exception of the reason for seeking acupuncture
treatment, the randomized and the nonrandomized acupuncture groups showed no significant differences at
baseline.
OA of the knee was present in 57.1% of the
patients, OA of the hip in 14.5%, and OA of both the
knee and the hip in 28.4% (Table 1). Only 11.8% of the
patients had had acupuncture during the 12 months
immediately prior to study entry (13.9% of those in the
randomized acupuncture group, 10.0% of those in the
control group, and 11.7% of those in the nonrandomized
acupuncture group; P  0.328). For subgroup analyses,
patients were grouped according to the most painful
joint (as reported at baseline and assessed throughout
the study period); the evaluated joint was the knee in
2,627 patients and the hip in 926.

Because there were no significant baseline differences between patients with OA of the knee and patients
with OA of the hip, the baseline data on these subgroups
are not presented separately. Patients in the acupuncture groups received a mean  SD of 10.7  3.9
acupuncture sessions (randomized acupuncture group
10.8  2.1, nonrandomized acupuncture group 10.7 
4.0; P  0.647). Most patients (76.6%) underwent 5–10
sessions, whereas 21.1% had 10 sessions and 2.2% had
5 sessions.
Comparisons between randomized groups.
Changes in the WOMAC scores in both randomized
groups and the nonrandomized group are depicted in
Figure 2. In the primary analysis at 3 months, the
WOMAC index had improved to a more pronounced
degree in the acupuncture group than in the control
group (mean  SEM score at 3 months 30.5  1.0
[change of 17.6  1.0] in the acupuncture group,
mean  SEM score at 3 months 47.3  1.0 [change of
0.9  1.0] in the control group [difference in degree of
change 16.7  1.4]; P  0.001 after adjustment for
baseline values) (Table 2). This improvement was robust
in the sensitivity analyses for missing data (smallest
difference between acupuncture and control groups
15.6; P  0.001). The proportion of responders (50%
reduction in WOMAC index) was 34.5% in the acupuncture group, compared with 6.5% in the control group

(P  0.001). Subgroup analyses showed very similar
results in patients with OA pain in the knee and patients
with OA pain in the hip (Table 2).
The 3-month improvement (percent reduction)
in the WOMAC index and its 3 subscales was significantly more pronounced in the acupuncture group than
in the control group, in the total study population as well
as in the hip OA patients and the knee OA patients
analyzed separately (Table 3). Similar results were found
for quality of life as assessed by both SF-36 component
scores, with the mental component score in hip OA
patients being the only exception (Table 3). There were
no differences between the acupuncture and control
groups with regard to the proportion of patients prescribed medication due to OA during the 3 months
following randomization (36.2% of patients in the acupuncture group, 35.8% of controls).
Comparisons between the randomized and nonrandomized acupuncture groups. At 3 months, improvement was similar in the nonrandomized acupuncture
group and the randomized acupuncture group (mean 

in the nonrandomized group, compared with a score of

group [difference in degree of change 0.2]; 95%

acupuncture group, compared with 34.5% in the randomized acupuncture group (P  0.660). There were no
significant differences between patients in the randomized and the nonrandomized acupuncture groups in the
3-month improvement from baseline, in any of the
parameters assessed (Table 3).
Factors affecting the WOMAC score at 3 months.
There were several confounding factors affecting the
3-month WOMAC index. By multivariate analysis, the
improvement in the WOMAC index was significantly
(P  0.001) more pronounced in patients of younger
age, with higher baseline physical or mental quality of
life, and with higher baseline WOMAC indexes, consistently over all treatment groups and independent of
treatment. Patients in all treatment groups (including

those who did not receive acupuncture) had better
scores on the WOMAC when the percent of the physician’s routine practice time spent performing acupuncture was higher (P  0.025). Even after controlling for
physician acupuncture experience in the model, the
patients’ WOMAC indexes differed significantly between physicians (P  0.029).
As noted above, treatment responses were not
significantly different between the randomized and the
nonrandomized patients who underwent acupuncture.
After adjustment, the additional percent reduction in
the WOMAC index due to acupuncture was estimated to
be 35.8% (difference in the randomized acupuncture
group versus the control group) (95% confidence interval 31.2%, 40.5%), which was slightly higher than the
unadjusted estimate.
No acupuncture effect modifiers could be identified. The physician’s acupuncture qualification (hours of
training, years of experience) had no significant influence on the effect of the treatment.
Durability of acupuncture effects over 6 months.
The 6-month followup results in the 3 treatment groups
are shown in Table 4. At 6 months (3 months after
completion of acupuncture treatment), the differences
from baseline in the WOMAC and SF-36 scores of
patients in the randomized and nonrandomized acupuncture groups were only slightly lower than they had
been at 3 months. The proportion of patients showing a
response at 6 months was 31.7% in the randomized
acupuncture group and 32.8% in the nonrandomized
group (P  0.674).
Delayed acupuncture. No significant differences
were found in treatment results when patients who
received immediate acupuncture and those who received
delayed acupuncture (i.e., patients randomized to the
control group, who began 3-month acupuncture treatTable 3. Changes from baseline to 3 months in assessments of osteoarthritis symptoms and quality of life in the 3 treatment groups*

ment after not receiving acupuncture for the first 3
months of the study) were compared. Following delayed
acupuncture, the improvement in WOMAC and SF-36
scores seen in control patients at 6 months was comparable with the improvement observed after 3 months in
patients who had been randomized to receive immediate
acupuncture therapy (Tables 3 and 4).
Side effects. In 5.2% of the patients (n  184), a
total of 219 side effects were reported after the patients
had acupuncture (66% minor local bleeding or hematoma, 5% pain at the site of needle insertion, 4%
vegetative symptoms, and 25% other). No lifethreatening side effects were reported.
DISCUSSION
Patients with chronic pain due to OA of the knee
or the hip who were treated with acupuncture in addition to routine care showed significant improvements in
symptoms and quality of life compared with patients
who received routine care alone. In patients who consented to randomization, treatment outcomes after acupuncture were similar to those in patients who declined
randomization. Physician characteristics, such as the
level of formal acupuncture training or certification, did
not influence treatment outcomes.
The present study is by far one of the largest
randomized trials of acupuncture to date, including 5%
of physicians specializing in acupuncture and a full 1%
of all primary care physicians in Germany. The aim of
the study was to evaluate acupuncture in a manner that
would reflect as closely as possible the conditions of
daily medical practice (needle acupuncture and manual
stimulation) and maximize external validity. We used
recommended outcome parameters to evaluate patients with OA of the knee or the hip (14,15). Although
the study had high followup rates, we used conservative

methods to deal with missing data. The additional
inclusion of patients who declined randomization allowed us to investigate any potential selection effects.
Obviously, such an approach has methodologic
limitations. In this study, neither providers nor patients
were blinded with regard to treatment. Although the
main outcome was determined based on patient assessment, bias due to lack of blinding cannot be ruled out.
To minimize social acceptability bias, all questionnaires
were sent directly from and to the coordinating research
institute. Because the specifics of both acupuncture
treatment and any concomitant interventions were left
to the discretion of the physician, treatment regimens
varied greatly among patients in our study. Inclusion
criteria were broad, which resulted in a heterogeneous
patient sample and, possibly, some diagnostic misclassification. While these issues might be considered limitations from an experimental perspective, the study design
was chosen to reflect general medical practice. Subgroup
analyses in this study showed that the benefit obtained
with acupuncture treatment was comparable in patients
with OA at different sites, whereas a recent study with
naproxen showed a greater reduction of pain in patients
with knee OA than in those with hip OA (16).
Patient self-selection in randomized trials of knee
OA could be a relevant problem (17). In our study,
approximately four-fifths of the eligible patients refused
randomization in spite of a (minor) financial incentive,
even though the 50% chance of a 3-month delay before
starting acupuncture treatment (following an average
disease duration of 5 years) presented only a slight
disadvantage. These patients were included in the nonrandomized acupuncture group. However, there were no
significant differences with respect to either baseline
characteristics or treatment outcomes between randomized and nonrandomized patients. Further support for
the observation that randomized trials and nonrandomized observational studies could yield similar results is
derived from other publications (18). In other study
settings in which randomization creates a greater disadvantage (e.g., studies in which control patients receive
sham acupuncture), this could be different. Therefore,
to control for selection bias, the use of study designs that
also include nonrandomized patients appears to be
desirable. Both in randomized and in nonrandomized
patients in the present study, the improvements in the
WOMAC index were clinically relevant (19). A further
important finding is that improvements seen immediately after completion of 3 months of acupuncture
treatment were sustained for at least another 3 months.
Our results confirm the findings of 3 previous
smaller trials (2 randomized [20,21] and 1 nonrandomized [22]) that compared results in patients receiving
acupuncture with results in patients in a waiting-list
control group receiving no treatment. Compared with
the findings of our recent sham-controlled study (8),
improvements in the WOMAC index and the responder
rates in the present study were slightly smaller.
Our finding that the physician’s formal qualifications and years of acupuncture experience had no significant influence on treatment outcome could be interpreted as a further indication that formal acupuncture
training of the clinician has only a limited role in
treatment effect. However, these results should be interpreted with caution, because the indicators used in the
present study might not adequately reflect the quality of
treatment delivered by the physician.
Results of this study provide further evidence
that acupuncture is a safe intervention. This is consistent
with the findings of previous large surveys (23–25).
When interpreting these findings, however, it must be
kept in mind that all acupuncture procedures in the
present study were administered by physicians.
In conclusion, the present results show that, in
patients with chronic pain due to OA of the knee or hip
who were receiving routine primary care, addition of
acupuncture to the treatment regimen resulted in a
clinically relevant and persistent benefit. Acupuncture
should be considered as a treatment option for patients
with knee or hip OA–associated chronic pain.
