Objectives: The aim of the study was to evaluate the therapeutic
effect of electro-acupuncture (EA) and hydrotherapy, both in combination with patient education or with patient education alone, in the
treatment of osteoarthritis in the hip.
Methods: Forty-five patients, aged 42–86 years, with radiographic
changes consistent with osteoarthritis in the hip, pain related to motion, pain on load, and ache were chosen. They were randomly allocated to EA, hydrotherapy, both in combination with patient education, or patient education alone. Outcome measures were the disability rating index (DRI), global self-rating index (GSI), and visual
analogue scale (VAS). Assessments were done before the intervention and immediately after the last treatment and 1, 3, and 6 months
after the last treatment.
Results: Pain related to motion and pain on load was reduced up to
3 months after last the treatment in the hydrotherapy group and up to
6 months in the EA group. Ache during the day was significantly
improved in both the EA and hydrotherapy group up to 3 months after
the last treatment. Ache during the night was reduced in the hydrotherapy group up to 3 months after the last treatment and in the EA
group up to 6 months after. Disability in functional activities was improved in EA and hydrotherapy groups up to 6 months after the last
treatment. Quality of life was also improved in EA and hydrotherapy
groups up to 3 months after the last treatment. There were no changes
in the education group alone.
Discussion: In conclusion, EA and hydrotherapy, both in combination with patient education, induce long-lasting effects, shown by reduced pain and ache and by increased functional activity and quality
of life, as demonstrated by differences in the pre- and post-treatment
assessments.

One of the most common causatives of hip pain in elder
persons is osteoarthritis.1 The prevalence of radiographic
verified osteoarthritis in the hip is 3% in the ages 55–64 year
and 5–6% in the ages over 65 years.2 Osteoarthritis in the hip is
associated with pain, which is generally described as aching,
use-related, at the end range of movement related to motion,
and limited hip mobility with decreased functional ability.3 It
is characterized by local destruction of articular cartilage, leading to proliferation and remodeling of subchondral bone.4
When joint damage is extensive, this pathology results in radiographic changes used to define it in clinical practice. Pain is
the major symptom and the most common reason why people
with osteoarthritis seek medical help. Accurate treatment is
important and is aimed at pain relief to avoid development of
chronic pain syndrome. Common treatment consists of pharmacological, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug
(NSAID) or COX-2–specific inhibitor, opiate analgesic and
local cortisone injection, physiotherapy and exercise, hydrotherapy, acupuncture, and patient education.
Few studies exist concerning the efficacy of acupuncture
in the treatment of hip osteoarthritis.5,6 However, there are several clinical acupuncture studies on osteoarthritis in the knees
and neck.7–10 The research to date is inconclusive but promising. Basic scientific research suggests that acupuncture results
in an activation of muscle afferents (mainly A- and possibly
C-fibers) and relieves pain through modulation of spinal reflexes11 and through modulation of the release of endogenous
opioids in the central nervous system.12–14 Low-frequency
electro-acupuncture (EA) (1–4 Hz) stimulation with needles
probably excites a group of receptors found in muscles, denoted ergoreceptors,15,16 which are physiologically activated
during muscular contractions. There is a proposed link beReceived for publication February 8, 2002; revised February 13, 2003; accepted February 13, 2003.

tween low-frequency EA and muscle exercise supported by
studies showing that both events may result in the release of
endogenous opioids, and there is evidence that the hypothalamic ß-endorphinergic system has a central role in mediating
the pain-relieving effect of EA.12–14,17 Sandküler has demonstrated a long-term depression in the dorsal horn by lowfrequency stimulation of A-fibers,18–20 which may underlie
segmental pain inhibition.
Exercise therapy aims to reduce pain and disability,
probably by activation of physiological processes similar to
those resulting from low-frequency EA. This is achieved
through improvement of muscle strength, joint stability, range
of motion, and aerobic capacity. The use of exercise in warm
water is promoted because of its physical properties, such as
buoyancy and temperature. The weight-relieving property of
water immersion allows easier movement with less pain,
which may also be attributed to the warmth of the water. Few
studies exist about the efficacy of hydrotherapy in the treatment of hip osteoarthrosis, but there is some indication that
hydrotherapy reduces pain and disability.21,22 In our knowledge, there are no other previous controlled trials that have
compared the therapeutic effect of hydrotherapy and EA, both
in combination with patient education.
Patient education is a cornerstone of the treatment of osteoarthritis. Data suggest that group patient education for
people with osteoarthritis improves health status and is cost
effective.23,24 It may also help to extend the time before a total
hip replacement is necessary.25
Despite inconsistencies in the efficacy of these interventions, the current treatment has increased in popularity. Since
there is a lack of evidence to support the effect of low frequency EA and hydrotherapy, there is a need for evaluation on
the effect of these methods in the treatment of hip pain caused
by osteoarthritis.
The main objective of the present study was to evaluate
the therapeutic effect of EA and hydrotherapy, both in combination with patient education, or patient education alone. This
was done by measuring changes in pain related to motion and
pain on load, ache during day and night, functional ability, and
quality of life in patients with radiographically verified osteoarthritis in the hip joint.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study was a prospective, randomized, controlled
clinical trial performed at the physiotherapy clinic at
Krokslätts Vårdcentral in Mölndal, Sweden, from 1997 to 1999.
The local ethics committee in Göteborg, Sweden, approved the study, and before commencement, written informed consent was obtained from all participants.
Participants
Forty-five patients were consequently preselected by orthopedics at Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Mölndal, and by
general practitioners at the outpatient department in Mölndal,
Sweden. All patients were on a waiting list for total hip arthroplasty. The main inclusion criteria were radiographic changes
consistent with osteoarthritis in the hip and pain related to motion and/or pain on load and/or ache during rest. Patients with
a pacemaker, hepatitis B, epilepsy, or rheumatoid diseases
were excluded. Patients who were eligible and willing to participate in the study were given written information about
study design, randomization, assessments, and the different interventions
Randomization
Participants were randomly allocated to EA in combination with patient education (n = 15) or hydrotherapy in combination with patient education (n = 15) or patient education
alone (n = 15) as a control by using sealed, unlabeled envelopes. The term “EA group” is used hereafter and refers to EA
in combination with patient education, and the term “hydrotherapy group” refers to hydrotherapy in combination with patient education. Participants were informed that they could discontinue the study at any time.
Treatment
Patients were treated 10 times during 5 weeks, 2 times
per week. Each treatment lasted for 30 minutes. All treatments
were performed by 2 experienced physiotherapists, CK-S
and KJ.
Electro-Acupuncture (EA)
The patient was positioned on the side, lying with their
affected hip uppermost. The acupuncture needles were placed
locally in the most painful area of the hip and distally in points
according to the segmental innervation of the hip joint (lumbar
3–5) (Table 1). Locally in the pain area, four of the following
points were selected: BL 54, 36, GB 29, 30, 31, and ST 31. The
distal points were always the same, GB 34 and BL 60 ipsilateral, both in the same segmental innervation as the hip joint.
The needles (Hegu; Hegu AB, Landsbro, Sweden) were made
of stainless steel for single use and were inserted intramuscularly to a depth of 15–35 mm. Needle sizes were 0.32 × 30 mm
and 0.40 × 50 mm. They were then rotated manually to evoke
needle sensation, reflecting activation of muscle–nerve afferents (A- and possibly C-fibers), in total 4 times during each
treatment.26,27 All needles were attached to an electrical stimulator (ACUS I; Cefar, Lund, Sweden) and stimulated with continuous square wave pulses with alternating polarity. The frequency used was low burst frequency of 2 Hz (each pulse has
a duration of 180 microseconds, a burst length of 0.1 seconds,
and a burst frequency of 80 Hz). The intensity was sufficient to
cause non-painful local muscular contractions and was optimized for each patient in an attempt to activate both the segmental pain control systems and the central descending pain

inhibitory systems, including central ß-endorphinergic systems.
Hydrotherapy
Hydrotherapy was performed in small groups, 1–3 in
each, in an Arjo pool with 34°C warm water. The program
consisted of warming up, mobility, and strengthening exercises for the muscles around the pelvis and stretching exercises.
Patient Education
All participants went through the patient education. The
patient education consisted of 2 group meetings of 2 hours
each. They were taught about hip anatomy and the disease
process. Instructions and advice about load–unload, activity–
inactivity, and pain relief, as well as information about total
hip arthroplasty surgery. They were also given information
about aid facilities and instructions for a program of home exercise, which included 10 exercises, aiming to improve the
muscle strength, joint stability, and range of motion in the hip.
They were taught to train once per day with intensity below
pain.
Assessments
The EA and hydrotherapy groups were assessed before
the intervention and immediately after the last treatment. Follow-up included 1 assessment at 1, 3, and 6 months after the
last treatment. The control group was assessed at the same
point of time except from the time immediately after the last
treatment. The same physiotherapists who gave the treatment
(CK-S and KJ) made all assessments.
Outcome Measures
Outcome measures were determined by a functional index, called the disability rating index (DRI),28 a quality-of-life
status called the global self-rating index (GSI),29 and, for pain,
the visual analogue scale (VAS).30
DRI includes 12 functions for rating the degree of disability in functional activities in daily life, eg, walking
upstairs/downstairs. Each function consists of a 100 mm line
oriented vertically on a paper. The sum of the 12 ratings divided by 12 gives the index value.
GSI consists of 10 yes or no questions concerning quality of life. Each answer gives a value that is summarized. The
maximum value is 10.
VAS was used for pain rating. Each VAS consisted of a
100-mm line oriented vertically on a paper with 3 different
questions with 2 endpoints: no pain and unbearable pain. The
questions asked were: “Do you have any pain related to motion
and/or pain on load now?” “Do you have any ache during the
day?” “Do you have any ache during the night?”
Statistics
All statistical analyses were carried out using Statistica
4.1 for Macintosh. Assessment of the rating scales VAS, DRI,
and GSI was ordered into categorical levels. For that reason,
data were statistically evaluated by non-parametric methods.
The primary aim was to evaluate the therapeutic effect of each

specific treatment. The time point before intervention was
compared with immediately after the last treatment and 1
month, 3 months, and 6 months after the last treatment. Statistically significant changes over time, within each group, were
analyzed with the Wilcoxon matched pairs test. The secondary
aim was to compare differences between the three interventions. Significance analyses for comparisons between different
interventions were made with Kruskal–Wallis calculations. If
statistically significant results were shown by Kruskal–Wallis,
then the 2-sample Mann–Whitney U test was used to identify
where the differences lie. P values less than 0.05 were considered significant.
RESULTS
Of the 45 included patients were 27 women and 18 men,
aged 42–86 years. The “EA group” consisted of 10 women and
5 men, aged between 49 and 86 years (mean 65.7 years), the
“hydrotherapy group” consisted of 8 women and 7 men, aged
between 49 and 83 years (mean 70.3 years), and the “control
group” that received only patient education consisted of 9
women and 6 men, aged between 42 and 86 years (mean 65.5
years). The duration of their symptoms was between 4 months
to 15 years. Figure 1 shows the progress and withdrawal of
patients throughout the study.
Table 2 shows the median and interquartile range (25th
and 75th percentiles) for each measurement on the VAS.
Pain Related to Motion and Pain on
Load (VAS)
Pain related to motion and pain on load improved significantly in patients who received EA compared before the
treatment period (baseline) with directly after the last treatment (P < 0.05), 3 months after (P < 0.05), and 6 months after
(P < 0.05) the last treatment. The hydrotherapy group improved significantly compared with baseline at 3 months after
the last treatment (P < 0.05). There were no improvements in
the group who received education alone, and there were no
differences between all 3 intervention groups at any time.

Ache During the Day (VAS)
Ache during the day was significantly reduced in patients who received EA and hydrotherapy compared with baseline directly after the last treatment (both P < 0.05), 1 month
after (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01 respectively), and 3 months after
(both P < 0.05) the last treatment. There were no improvements in the group who received education alone. One month
after the last treatment, the reduction of ache during the day
was significantly greater in the hydrotherapy group (P < 0.01)
compared with only education.
Ache During the Night (VAS)
Ache during the night was significantly reduced in patients who received EA and hydrotherapy compared with baseline directly after the last treatment (both P < 0.01). One month
after, the hydrotherapy group (P < 0.01), but not the EA group,
significantly improved. Six months after the last treatment, the
EA group (P < 0.05), but not the hydrotherapy group, significantly improved. There were no improvements in the group
that received education alone. One month after the last treatment, the reduction of ache during the night was significantly
greater in the hydrotherapy group (P < 0.01) compared with
only education.

treatment (P < 0.05), 1 month after (P < 0.05), and 3 months
after (P < 0.05). Six months after the last treatment, the EA
group (P < 0.05), but not the hydrotherapy group, significantly
improved. DRI was significantly increased in patients who received only education compared with baseline 6 months after
the last treatment (P < 0.05).
One month after the last treatment, the DRI significantly
decreased in the hydrotherapy group (P < 0.01) compared with
only education. Three months after the last treatment, the DRI
decreased significantly more in both the EA group and the hydrotherapy group (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05, respectively) compared with education alone.
GSI—Quality of Life
GSI was significantly reduced in patients who received
EA and hydrotherapy compared with baseline directly after
(P < 0.01 and P < 0.05, respectively), 1 month after (both
P < 0.05), and 3 months after (both P < 0.05). There was no
improvement in GSI in patients who received only education at
all time points.
One month after the last treatment, the reduction in GSI
was significantly greater in both the EA group and the hydrotherapy group (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05, respectively) compared
with education alone. Three months after, the reduction was
significantly greater only in the EA group (P < 0.05) compared
with education alone.
DISCUSSION
The main outcome of the present study was that EA and
hydrotherapy, both in combination with patient education, offer clear advantages for patients with hip pain caused by osteoarthritis over patient education alone, as shown by reduced
pain, increased function, and increased quality of life.
Pain related to motion and pain on load was reduced up
to 3 months after the last treatments in the hydrotherapy group
and up to 6 months in the EA group. Ache during the day was
significantly improved in both the EA and hydrotherapy group
up to 3 months after the last treatment. Ache during the night
was reduced in the hydrotherapy group up to 3 months after the
last treatment and in the EA group up to 6 months after. The
results clearly indicate that both EA and hydrotherapy induce
good pain relief for patients with hip pain caused by osteoarthritis. It also indicates that both EA and hydrotherapy induce
long-term effects. These results are in line with previous reports.5,6,31
Disability in functional activities in daily life was improved in EA and hydrotherapy groups up to 6 months after the
last treatment. In the control group, disability in functional activities deteriorated 6 months after the last treatment. Quality
of life was also improved in EA and hydrotherapy groups up to
3 months after the last treatment.
The advantage of hydrotherapy is that it can be given as
a group therapy, with psychosocial and sociobehavioral benefits. However, many patients do not tolerate warm water for
different reasons, eg, infections. Another disadvantage of hydrotherapy is that it is an extremely expensive method. Acupuncture is well accepted by most patients, but it does not have
the beneficial group effect.
The mechanisms behind the beneficial effect of EA and
hydrotherapy is most likely explained by activation of endogenous pain inhibitory mechanisms at both central and segmental levels previously described in the introduction.32 Reduced
pain will automatically improve functional activities. Many
patients experienced changes in mood, such as relaxation and
improved well being, which possibly explains the increased
quality of life after EA or hydrotherapy treatment. This is probably the result of effects on the central hormonal system, including the release of oxytocin.33,34
Patient education has previously been reported to improve health status, to be cost effective, and to give pain relief.23,24 We were not able to confirm this in the way that patient education was given in the present study. The patient education used in the present study was a modification of an
original education program that consisted of 4 group meetings.
The reduction in the number of meetings may be one reason for
the lack of effect by patient education. Another reason might
be that patients in the education group received less social support compared with patients in both the EA and hydrotherapy
groups. It has previously been shown that patients with osteoarthritis who received bi-weekly telephone calls improved significantly both regarding physical disability and pain relief.35
In the present study, patients in both the EA group but especially in the hydrotherapy group received much more social
support during their treatment period.
There are limitations in the present study, such as sample
size and control situations. For this reason, we are not able to
determine any specific treatment effects. Power calculations
showed that a number of 86 patients would be needed in each
group to detect statistically significant differences (P < 0.05) in
pain ratings. Furthermore, the physiotherapists who assessed
the patients were the same as those providing treatment. Of
course, blinding of the assessors would strengthen the study by
reducing examiner bias. Despite methodological limitations,
there are many indications that both EA and hydrotherapy in
combination with patient education is superior to patient education alone. However, further randomized, controlled trials
need to be undertaken.
In conclusion, EA and hydrotherapy, both in combination with patient education, induce long-lasting effects, demonstrated by reduced pain and ache and by increased functional
activity and quality of life, as shown by differences in the preand post-intervention assessments. The pain relief was more
long lasting, up to 6 months, in the EA group. Patient education
alone does not improve any variable in the present study.
