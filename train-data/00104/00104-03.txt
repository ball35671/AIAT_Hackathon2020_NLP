Abstract
OBJECTIVE: To observe the differences of effect of electroacupuncture and medication on hip osteoarthritis. METHODS: Sixty cases were randomly divided into an electroacupuncture group and a medication group, 30 cases in each one. In electroacupuncture group, electroacupuncture was applied at Biguan (ST 31), Juliao (GB 29), Zuwuli (LR 10) and Yinlian (LR 11). In medication group, Diclofenac Sodium was prescribed for oral administration. One month after treatment, Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and Harris score were compared between two groups. RESULTS: VAS scores were 67.83 +/- 8.48 and 55.83 +/- 9.66 before and after treatment in electroacupuncture group, and were 68.67 +/- 8.09 and 61.50 +/- 7.78 in medication group separately. VAS pain scores after treatment were reduced remarkably in two groups (both P < 0.001), but the score was reduced much more remarkably in electroacupuncture group as compared with medication group. In electroacupuncture group, after treatment, Harris total score, the single scores of joint pain, function and motion range increased apparently as compared with those before treatment (all P < 0.001). In medication group, after treatment, Harris total score and pain score increased remarkably as compared with those before treatment (both P < 0.001). Harris total score, pain score and function score after treatment in electroacupuncture group increased much more remarkably as compared with those in medication group (all P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Electroacupuncture can treat effectively hip osteoarthritis, relieve joint pain and improve joint function. The efficacy of it is superior to that of oral administration of Diclofenac Sodium.
