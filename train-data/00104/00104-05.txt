abstract
The nonspecific effects of acupuncture are well documented; we wished to quantify these factors in
osteoarthritic (OA) pain, examining needling, the consultation, and the practitioner. In a prospective randomised, single-blind, placebo-controlled, multifactorial, mixed-methods trial, 221 patients with OA
awaiting joint replacement surgery were recruited. Interventions were acupuncture, Streitberger placebo
acupuncture, and mock electrical stimulation, each with empathic or nonempathic consultations. Interventions involved eight 30-minute treatments over 4 weeks. The primary outcome was pain (VAS) at
1 week posttreatment. Face-to-face qualitative interviews were conducted (purposive sample, 27 participants). Improvements occurred from baseline for all interventions with no significant differences
between real and placebo acupuncture (mean difference 2.7 mm, 95% confidence intervals 9.0 to
3.6; P = .40) or mock stimulation (3.9, 10.4 to 2.7; P = .25). Empathic consultations did not affect pain
(3.0 mm, 2.2 to 8.2; P = .26) but practitioner 3 achieved greater analgesia than practitioner 2 (10.9, 3.9
to 18.0; P = .002). Qualitative analysis indicated that patients’ beliefs about treatment veracity and confidence in outcomes were reciprocally linked. The supportive nature of the trial attenuated differences
between the different consultation styles. Improvements occurred from baseline, but acupuncture has
no specific efficacy over either placebo. The individual practitioner and the patient’s belief had a significant effect on outcome. The 2 placebos were equally as effective and credible as acupuncture. Needle and
nonneedle placebos are equivalent. An unknown characteristic of the treating practitioner predicts outcome, as does the patient’s belief (independently). Beliefs about treatment veracity shape how patients
self-report outcome, complicating and confounding study interpretation.

1. Introduction
All complex therapeutic interventions achieve their outcomes
through a combination of specific and nonspecific mechanisms,
including the patient–therapist relationship, treatment process
and rituals, expectation, suggestibility, conditioning, and practitioner bias [1,11]. Acupuncture studies show very large improvements from pretreatment to posttreatment [2,28], with mean
improvements of 80% for symptom severity (across painful pathologies) and 62% for pain [6]. There is a significantly greater benefit
from acupuncture than from standard conventional care [5], with
acupuncture ‘‘placebos’’ routinely outperforming conventional
care [3,12,25]. This suggests that the effectiveness of acupuncture
is not point- or therapy-specific.
There is considerable interest in maximising treatment effects
through understanding the placebo more generically [10,16]. Acupuncture’s effectiveness coupled with marginal proven efficacy implies that contextual factors may have a profound influence on
outcome. Kaptchuk et al. suggest that acupuncture needles create
enhanced placebo effects [15], implying that different placebo rituals may demonstrate different relative benefits.
The aims of this study were to investigate whether there is an
enhanced nonspecific effect associated with needling, to ascertain
the effects of the consultation process and the practitioner, to evaluate the efficacy of acupuncture on severe osteoarthritic (OA) pain,
and to enhance interpretation of the quantitative study through
nested qualitative work.

2. Materials and methods
A randomised, single-blind (patient), multifactorial trial was
conducted involving 3 interventions, 2 consultation types, and 3
practitioners with a nested qualitative study to elucidate the quantitative findings. Recruitment was via joint replacement waiting
lists at Southampton General and Salisbury District Hospitals
(Table 1).
2.1. Randomisation
After informed consent and 1-week baseline pain recording, a
2-stage randomisation occurred via an independent third party
using a computer-generated list. Patients were first randomised
to treatment type and consultation type, and then to specific
practitioners.
2.2. Interventions
2.2.1. Real acupuncture
A Western acupuncture approach was used involving a flexible
but prescribed range of points. Practitioners were free to pick
appropriately from the list as clinically indicated. A mean of 6
points was used at each treatment, with deep needling, which
lasted for 20 minutes during the 30-minute appointment twice
per week for 4 weeks. Deqi (needle sensation) was elicited for each
needle through needle rotation. The acupuncture treatment was
designed to provide high-quality Western acupuncture of the type
commonly used in UK clinics.
2.2.2. Placebo acupuncture
The format was exactly the same as those for real acupuncture
(RA), but using streitberger needle (SN) nonpenetrating needles instead of RA needles. These work rather like a stage dagger, have
been validated, and patients cannot distinguish them from RA needles [27].
2.2.3. Mock electrical stimulation
An electroacupuncture stimulator was used (NOMA Ltd., Southampton, UK) to provide mock transcutaneous electrical stimulation
to acupoints via electrodes fixed to the surface of the patient’s skin.
The cables were disconnected inside the output plug. All aspects of
the intervention were exactly the same as with RA and SN, including time of treatment and checking on patients at regular intervals.
This control has previously been well validated [22].
2.3. Consultation types
2.3.1. Empathic
Empathic (EMP) consultations were deemed to be normal pragmatic treatment sessions. Patients were greeted in a friendly,
warm manner and were free to enter into conversation with their
practitioner, who in turn would willingly do so. Practitioners did
their utmost to comply with participants’ wishes, providing detailed answers to questions and emphasising patient comfort and
well-being.
2.3.2. Non-EMP
This encounter was more ‘‘clinical’’ in nature. Patients were
greeted in an efficient manner and quietly shown to the treatment
cubicle. Practitioners would only discuss matters directly relating
to the treatment to enable them to effectively carry out that treatment, e.g., pattern of pain and side effects. Necessary explanations
were kept as short as possible, and if patients attempted to enter
into any discussion, the practitioner would respond using the
words ‘‘I’m sorry but because this is a trial I am not allowed to discuss this with you.’’ Between needle stimulations, patients were
left on their own in a curtained cubicle.
2.3.3. Acupuncturists
Three qualified, experienced (range 3 to 10 years) practitioners
were available and funded to provide treatments (physiotherapist,
nurse, and licensed acupuncturist). They met frequently throughout the trial to ensure that treatments, including the acupoints
used, and consultation types were as comparable and equivalent
as possible.
2.4. Protocol/procedure
Patients were assessed and gave consent (including consent to
differing consultation types). Ethics approval was gained from
the Southampton and South West Hampshire and the Salisbury
and South Wiltshire Research ethics committees (approval number
170/03/t).
The information sheet explained that ‘‘a proportion of patients
will receive placebo (dummy) treatment and so the acupuncture
points will not be stimulated; i.e., the needle will not penetrate
your skin or the machine will not deliver any current.’’
Patients were given a daily pain diary (100 mm visual analogue
scale VAS) to complete for 7 (pretreatment) days, which included
recording their analgesia. A minimum mean weekly score of 30
of 100 was an inclusion requirement. Patients were then randomised and treated. Throughout treatment, patients recorded their
weekly pain and analgesia with a final extra weeks’ diary after
treatment completion.
Face-to-face open-ended narrative qualitative interviews were
conducted with 27 randomized controlled trial (RCT) participants
purposively sampled to obtain representation from all treatment
groups (EMP and non-EMP, all 3 interventions and the 2 practitioners not conducting the qualitative study), and both responders
and nonresponders. Interviews took place 4 to 8 weeks after treatment completion. There was no topic guide, apart from the opening question in which participants were asked to talk about their
experiences of taking part in the trial. Interviews lasted between
30 and 120 minutes (typically 60 minutes), and were audio-taped,
transcribed, and annotated with the interviewer’s field notes. Summaries were sent to interviewees to provide a member check on
the analysis. Patients were not interviewed by their treating acupuncturist (Table 2).
2.5. Outcomes
Pain measured on a 100-mm VAS in the 7 days immediately
after treatment completion. The primary outcome was the differences between groups in percentage change in pain. Differences
of >30% improvement from baseline were defined as clinically
important [8,9]. Secondary outcomes were Nottingham Health Profile (part 1) and Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index and pain over time (weekly VAS).

2.6. Potential confounders
To assess potential confounding, we recorded treatment credibility [7], attitudes to complementary medicine holistic complementary and alternative medicine questionnaire (HCAMQ) [13],
empathy consultation and relational empathy (CARE) questionnaire [19], analgesic intake (tablet count), and needling sensation
[20]. Patients were asked at treatment completion, ‘‘Do you think
the treatment you had was real’’ and required to give a yes or no
answer.
2.7. Sample size and analyses
Assuming a 13% dropout, 96 subjects were required per arm for
80% power to detect a 20% difference between each group on VAS
(assuming SD = 38 mm) for our primary outcome. To avoid an
accumulated type I error from multiple testing, we required a P value of .01 or less, creating a sample size of 288.
An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) for pain (VAS) estimated
main effects and interactions between factors and controlled for
baseline pain, stratifiers, and confounders. If interactions were
not found, the main effects with confidence intervals were reported. Missing data were dealt with by either taking a mean of
the values on either side of the missing value or by carrying forward the last entry as appropriate. Our per-protocol analysis
examined needling sensation, belief in treatment, and attitudes
to complementary medicine, as well as treatment type, the empathetic nature of the consultation, and practitioner.
Framework analysis [24] incorporating deductive and inductive
elements was used to relate the qualitative data to the quantitative
trial. An index was used by 2 authors (F.B., G.L.) to identify talk that
related to the 4 main predetermined elements of the framework:
outcomes, intervention characteristics, practitioners, and empathy.
Talk that related to each of these themes was explored inductively
to identify subthemes. Predetermined comparisons were then
made across intervention groups by examining how each subtheme manifested in the different participants’ accounts. These
comparisons suggested consistent explanations for the main RCT
findings. Table 3 shows how the RCT findings were used to determine the 4 key themes and how data mapped to themes, and were
explored inductively to identify subthemes. The findings are presented with illustrative quotes (using pseudonyms) selected as
typical and/or particularly clear examples.
3. Results
Patients (279) were assessed and completed baseline pain
recordings (01/2004 to 08/2007) with 221 patients recruited
(Fig. 1). Eleven patients (4.9%) dropped out (Table 4); 3 completed
some pain scores, and their data were carried forward per intention-to-treat analysis and included in the final analysis. Eight did
not complete any outcomes and were excluded from analysis.
3.1. Demographics and baseline measurements
Age (mean = 66.75 years, SD = 8.29) and sex were balanced
across all treatments, consultation types, and practitioners; 57.5%
were female; 59.7% knee joints were treated. Table 5 shows baseline data and mean posttreatment scores.
The ANCOVA showed that treatment credibility and HCAMQ
scores had no effect on outcome, implying that equipoise between
groups was achieved. The final empathy questionnaire demonstrated statistically significant differences between consultation
types, with mean scores of 45.73 (95% confidence interval [CI]
44.73 to 46.73) (empathic) and 36.38 (95% CI 34.34 to 38.42,
Mann–Whitney U, P < .001) (nonempathic) demonstrating that this
factor was delivered effectively. This difference in empathy for the
CARE score, based on available data, also demonstrates a clinically
significant effect for the EMP and non-EMP consultation types [18].
Strength of needle sensation was not correlated with pain relief
(Spearman correlation coefficient .121, P = .083).
3.2. Primary outcome—pain
Pain diminished for all groups, with only RA achieving clinically
relevant improvements at 29.5% (Table 5). SN reduced pain by
23.0% and mock electrical stimulation by 16.6%. Those allocated
to nonempathic consultations achieved slightly (nonsignificant)
greater analgesia than empathic consultations (25.2% vs 21.1%;
mean VAS difference 3.00 mm, 95% CI 2.2 to 8.2, P = .26).
ANCOVA at week 5 showed no significant effect on immediate
posttreatment pain of the factors practitioner, treatment, and consultation type, and their first-order interactions with all of the possible baseline confounders as covariates (age, sex, joint, previous
knowledge of acupuncture, credibility, CARE score, and HCAMQ
scores). The ANCOVA was repeated with the insignificant covariates removed. Group differences are shown in Table 6. Patients
who thought that their treatment was real recorded pain scores
11.5 mm (95% CI 3.4 to 19.5, P = .005) lower than those who did
not. Treatment type and consultation type had no significant effect
on posttreatment pain (Table 6). There was a significant practitioner effect. Practitioner 3 achieved greater analgesia than practitioner 2 (mean difference 10.9 mm, 95% CI 3.9 to 18.0, P = .002)
across all treatments and consultation types. This also neared significance against practitioner 1 (mean difference 5.8 mm, 95%
CI .1 to 11.7, P = .05).
3.3. Secondary outcomes
Pain over time decreased for all treatments (Fig. 2). This was assessed using a repeated-measures ANCOVA and showed that there
was a highly significant downward trend in pain scores over time,
with an average reduction of 3.4 mm in pain scores per week on
the VAS scales (P < .001), but there was not a significant difference
between the downward trends for the different treatments. All
scores for Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis
Index and Nottingham Health Profile improved in all groups, with
no significant differences between treatment or consultation types.
Practitioner 3 achieved the largest improvements.
3.4. Blinding
A high percentage of patients believed that their treatment had
been real; 96% (RA), 93% (SN), and 75% (mock electrical stimulaTable 2

tion), which suggests that blinding was successful. These differences between treatments were significant (v2 = 15.486,
P = .001). Three adverse events were recorded, none of which were
related to treatment. There were 28 cases of minor side effects
(Table 7).
3.5. Qualitative findings
The qualitative analysis provides insight into how perceptions
of treatment veracity influenced outcomes, why practitioner 3
was more effective, and why consultation type had no effect on
posttreatment pain.
3.5.1. Treatment veracity
Interviewees expressed uncertainty regarding the veracity of
their treatment, which was accompanied by uncertainty regarding
subjective outcomes. Beliefs about treatment veracity and confidence in outcomes were reciprocally linked. As people became
more confident that they were experiencing benefits, such as decreased pain, they also became more confident that they were
receiving real acupuncture. As they became more confident that
they were receiving real acupuncture, they also became more confident that they were experiencing positive health changes. Confidence in health changes in turn impacted how participants
completed the quantitative self-report outcome measures.
The only thing that you do think about is—you’re having your
treatment and you’re not sure if you are having something that is
supposed to do something or whether you’re just having something
that’s just sticking needles in you... And you’re always a bit hesitant to say ‘well I think it’s doing me good’ because you’ve got that
feeling that perhaps what you’re having done isn’t...you know.’’
(Martin, receiving RA)
3.5.2. The practitioner effect
Interviewees described practitioners in predominantly positive
ways, related to personality (friendly, nice, understanding) and
technical skills (being very good at giving treatments, and as offering clear explanations). One difference was identified: terminology. Interviewees referred to Practitioner 1 by her first name and
as a ‘‘girl’’ and a ‘‘young lady,’’ and some described her using affectionate terms such as ‘‘sweet.’’ Practitioner 3 was referred to as
‘‘Doctor,’’ was never referred to by his first name, and was typically
described in more respectful than affectionate terms, including
‘‘courteous’’ and ‘‘formal but friendly.’’ Participants seem to have
seen practitioner 3 as more authoritative than practitioner 1.
3.5.3. Consultation type
Participants in empathic consultations described practitioners
as caring, friendly, and communicative. Those in nonempathic consultations undertook a little more work to explain their similarly
positive views of their practitioners. Thus interviewees who had
received nonempathic consultations talked about how they colluded with the practitioner to obey the study rules and have limited personal interactions. They suggested that the practitioners
were not really nonempathic, they were just acting that way for
the sake of the trial. For example, ‘‘I had the feeling that she sort
of felt that you know, not being able to converse properly, that
she felt a bit awkward about it’’ (Betty, nonempathic). Other aspects of the trial beyond the consultation (friendly and polite
reception staff, convenient appointments) were also described positively as evidence that the researchers and practitioners did actually care about the interviewees and so the interviewees described
feeling ‘‘cared for’’ by all those involved in the study.
Dorothy was the only interviewee to describe her experiences
of being in the trial in general and her experiences of her (nonempathic) practitioner in negative terms: ‘‘in the end I decided that
she couldn’t be a practitioner, she was just being told where to
put these things and was bored stiff with the job but needed the
job.’’ Dorothy described not knowing that her practitioner’s behaviour was part of the trial (despite being fully informed at the
recruitment interview) and was also the interviewee for whom
the nonempathic consultation could be described as most successful. If she had recalled her recruitment interview, the nonempathic
consultation may have lost its potency: ‘‘if I had this young lady
and I’d known that some of you were going to be just businesslike
and some are going to be friendly, I would have thought I had got
one of the businesslike ones and brushed it off. But not to know
was I think, wrong.’’
4. Discussion
All groups improved from baseline, with many achieving clinically significant improvements. There were no differences between
verum and placebo treatments. The empathic nature of the consultation process had no effect on outcome, but believing in the treatment and a powerful practitioner effect significantly affected pain
at 5 weeks. All primary and secondary outcomes showed similar
trends. The qualitative study helps to explain these findings, suggesting that beliefs about treatment veracity and confidence in
outcomes were reciprocally linked and the supportive nature of
the study and consent process may have attenuated differences
in outcomes between the different consultation styles. In this

population, an authoritative practitioner seemed to be more effective across all outcomes.
The methodology is rigorous, with particular focus on the analysis of potential confounders. All groups were comparable at entry,
and treatment credibility ratings confirm that each treatment was
considered equally likely to be effective (i.e., there was no a priori
bias). Outcome was not confounded by pre-existing beliefs or previous acupuncture treatment. Most patients in all groups believed
their treatment had been real. The nested qualitative study offers
important and unique insights into the mechanisms involved in
delivering and interpreting an RCT as well as novel explanatory
hypotheses for our main quantitative findings.
A type II error is unlikely; there was underrecruitment but
dropouts were approximately half that anticipated, so the main-effect comparisons were adequately powered. Using the smallest
groups, the absolute difference between the mean pain improvement for practitioners 2 and 3 was 13 mm, which is less than our
predefined clinically important difference of 20 mm, and corresponds to 80% power at 1% significance. Other main comparisons
were based on much larger group sizes. Type I error is possible
for the practitioner effect, but the level of significance and the supportive findings from the qualitative study make this unlikely.
This study did not employ a no-treatment arm, and therefore it
is possible that improvements recorded might simply be due to the

natural history of the condition, i.e., leading to spontaneous remission (a regression to the mean). The effect of this cannot be measured from this study, and we cannot discount this possibility.
However, this possibility might be attenuated by the population
chosen for this study, i.e., all were chronic end-stage OA sufferers
such that all were awaiting joint replacement. Conservative treatment options for this group had been exhausted and pain was still
persistent and consistently high enough to warrant surgical
intervention.
4.1. The effect of the consultation process and treatment context
Manipulating the consultation process was effective quantitatively and resulted in significantly different CARE scores across
the groups. Mercer [18] suggest that small differences in CARE represent large differences in real terms because patients are reluctant
to give very low scores to their doctors. The 10-point difference
found in this trial is therefore substantial, reflecting clinically
important differences that may be much larger differences in observer rated scores [18]. This did not result in a different therapeutic outcome in spite of the acknowledged importance of a
patient-centred approach [17]. It is possible that CARE is failing
to adequately capture patient centeredness [17], but the qualitative study suggests that this is not the case. It seems that patients
appear to have made allowances and colluded when receiving nonempathic consultations, which might have subverted the trial process. They drew empathy from other sources (reception staff, the
initial prerandomisation consent/screening session), thus implying
it may be very difficult to deliver a nonempathic process to patients in a trial in which patients have received prior informed consent. Researchers and ethics committees should consider this
carefully in relation to consent and subsequent trial debriefing.
The other more fundamental issue is that we do not yet fully
understand the relationship between verbal and nonverbal communication in the consultation with respect to patient centeredness and therapeutic outcome [17]. Interpretations of outcome
related to empathy should therefore be approached with great
caution.

Kaptchuk et al. suggest that enhanced consultations produced
better outcomes [14]. The differences between our studies could
relate to the diagnoses (OA pain vs irritable bowel syndrome) or
to the differences in the initial consent process (Kaptchuk et al.
did not require consent to different consultation types, whereas
we did). We only manipulated empathy, and Kaptchuk et al.
manipulated the acupuncture treatment (palpation), consultation
time, and therapists’ confidence in treatment. There may also be
an interaction between different components within acupuncture
treatment (talking, listening, and diagnosis) that produce a clinical
effect that is greater than the sum of its individual elements. Paterson and Dieppe [21] suggest that these factors, in contrast to drug
trials, are integral to complex nonpharmaceutical interventions.
Belief in treatment veracity was significantly correlated to outcome, suggesting that improving the management of expectation
could enhance outcome. This is supported by the qualitative analysis, which suggests that patients link positive outcomes and recorded improved symptoms when they believed that the
treatment had been real and vice versa. Where patients were unsure as to the ‘‘reality’’ of their treatment, this was manifest in a
reluctance to score symptom improvement, and therefore they
were less willing to commit themselves when completing the outcome questionnaires. This has implications for all placebo-controlled trials insomuch as the real effects of an unconvincing
verum treatment might be underreported (a type II error). One
solution might be to encourage participants to understand and believe (correctly) that placebos are powerful interventions that act
through a variety of complex sociocultural, psychological, and neurological mechanisms [23]. They have a proven range of beneficial
effects, including pain relief. This might encourage participants to
report perceived improvements confidently despite being uncertain as to their treatment allocation. It might also minimise the distress that some participants experience on unblinding when
discovering they have responded to a placebo [4] and perceive this
as something deceitful.
4.2. Practitioner effect
Practitioner 3 produced better outcomes across all treatment
and consultation types. This occurred in spite of the meticulous
care and planning taken to ensure consistency of treatment delivery among the 3 practitioners. The qualitative data suggested that
the interviewees perceived practitioner 3 as a paternalistic male
authority figure. Practitioner 3, as the primary investigator, might
have been seen by patients as the expert, consequently establishing higher expectations of success, which in turn influenced outcome. Although this is consistent with previous research [10,29]
a larger explanatory study involving many practitioners is needed.
4.3. Control type
It has been suggested that that needling carries an enhanced
placebo effect [14,15]. We are the first to compare 2 acupuncture
placebo controls demonstrating no difference between needle
and nonneedle placebos. The magnitude of the improvements
shown in the placebo arms in this and other trials indicates that
placebo acupuncture has powerful effects outperforming standard
care [12,25]. This supports the hypothesis that ‘‘exotic’’ processes
or rituals may have powerful therapeutic effects.
4.4. Efficacy of acupuncture
Efficacy studies of acupuncture for OA pain have not reported
consistent results. Although our results concur those of with Scharf
et al. [25], other large studies demonstrate a statistically significant
effect for verum acupuncture in knee pain [2,26,28]. The reasons
for these differences are unclear. We included patients with hip
pain, and this might not respond as well to acupuncture; it is also
possible that acupuncture is much less effective in this group of severely affected OA patients.
4.5. Conclusions
This trial uniquely reports a mixed-methods approach in a single report to enable a contextual interpretation of the quantitative
data. Patients receiving acupuncture demonstrated clinically
important improvements from baseline (i.e., a 29.5% reduction in
pain), but despite this, acupuncture has no specific efficacy over
placebo for this group of patients. The clinical effect of acupuncture
treatment and associated controls is not related to the use of an
acupuncture needle, nor mediated by empathy, but is practitioner
related and may be linked to the perceived authority of the practitioner. Qualitative analysis indicated that beliefs about treatment
veracity and confidence in outcomes were reciprocally linked,
and this appears to affect how patients self-report treatment outcomes, leading to a greater risk of demonstrating type II errors.
This suggests that the process of interpreting RCT data is complex
and contextual.
