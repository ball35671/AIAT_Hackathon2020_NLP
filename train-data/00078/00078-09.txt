Abstract
Objective:
Painful physical symptoms are common in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and may predict
poorer treatment outcomes. Duloxetine has demonstrated efficacy in treating both MDD and certain other
painful conditions. This randomized, double-blind clinical trial assessed the effects of duloxetine in patients
with both MDD and MDD-associated physical pain.
Methods:
Participants were outpatient adults with current MDD (DSM-IV-TR criteria; Montgomery–A˚sberg Depression
Rating Scale [MADRS] total score
20) and at least moderate pain (Brief Pain Inventory Short Form [BPI]
average pain rating
3) and with at least one prior episode of MDD. Patients received placebo (
N
¼ 266) or
duloxetine (
N
¼ 262) 60 mg once daily. This trial is registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01000805).
Main outcome measures:
Coprimary outcomes were MADRS total score (change from baseline at 8 weeks) and BPI average pain
rating (overall main effect over 8 weeks). The Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) global functional impairment
score (change from baseline at 8 weeks) was used to assess functioning. Remission was defined as MADRS
total score
12 at the 8-week endpoint. Changes were analyzed using mixed-effects model repeated
measures (MMRM).
Results:
Compared with placebo, duloxetine significantly improved the mean MADRS total score, BPI average pain
rating, and SDS global functional impairment score (all
p
 0.05 for analyses described above). The
remission rate was significantly greater with duloxetine compared with placebo (
p
¼ 0.001) and was
greater for duloxetine-treated patients with
50% versus
550% improvement in BPI average pain score
(
p
 0.001). Treatment emergent adverse events that occurred in at least 5% of duloxetine-treated patients
and at twice the rate of placebo included nausea, somnolence, constipation, decreased appetite, and
hyperhidrosis. Rates of discontinuation due to adverse events were greater for duloxetine than placebo
(8.0% vs 3.4%, respectively;
p
¼ 0.024). This study did not address the effects of duloxetine on MDD and
comorbid pain of a known origin.
Conclusions:
These results support the efficacy and tolerability of duloxetine in the treatment of depression and associated
painful physical symptoms in patients with MDD and at least moderate MDD-associated pain.
Introduction
Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) may present with signs and
symptoms across both emotional and physical domains. Increasingly, painful

physical symptoms are recognized as being associated with
MDD. For example, Vaccarino and colleagues1 evaluated
pooled data from 2191 patients enrolled in randomized,
multicenter, double-blind placebo-controlled studies of
the treatment of MDD for the purpose of scale development. Based on inquiry prior to study entry, 75% of the
patients reported at least one pain-related complaint that
was rated as moderately bothersome or worse (based on a
score of 3 or more out of 5 on the Somatic Symptoms
Inventory), with headache; pain in lower back, in neck,
or in joints; and soreness in muscles being the most
common. These data are consistent with prior reports in
clinical populations with MDD2,3. The presence of associated pain in MDD has been linked with poorer clinical
outcomes, including decreased remission rates4
, and substantially increased overall treatment costs compared to
patients with MDD and little or no interference from
pain5
. Further, MDD-associated pain impairs productivity6
and quality of life6–9. In total, the data suggest that associated painful symptoms may contribute substantially to
the overall burden of disease in many patients with MDD.
Duloxetine is a serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake
inhibitor (SNRI) approved in the United States for the
treatment of MDD and generalized anxiety disorder
(GAD) and also approved for the management of diabetic
peripheral neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia, and chronic
musculoskeletal pain in patients with chronic low back
pain and chronic pain due to osteoarthritis10. Given the
increasing understanding of the links between pain and
depression, the impact of duloxetine on painful physical
symptoms associated with MDD is of significant interest.
While many previous studies of duloxetine in the treatment of MDD have measured pain improvement as an
outcome, two randomized, placebo-controlled trials have
examined the efficacy of duloxetine in the treatment of
MDD in patients with a prespecified severity of pain at
baseline11,12; these two studies had dissimilar results in
that one study had a positive depression outcome and the
other did not, likely as a result of differences in their methodologies (see details in Discussion). The present study was
therefore designed to replicate most design elements of the
positive study12 to provide clear information on the role of
duloxetine for the treatment of painful physical symptoms
in patients with MDD and associated painful symptoms.
Patients and methods
Study design
This multicenter, phase 4, 8-week, randomized, doubleblind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study was conducted at 47 study sites in the United States, Germany,
France, Sweden, and Romania between November 2009
and October 2010. The study consisted of a 5- to 30-day
screening period; the 8-week randomized, double-blind
treatment phase; and an optional 2-week taper period.
After the screening period, patients who met inclusion/
exclusion criteria were randomized (at a 1:1 ratio) to an
oral dose of duloxetine 60 mg once daily or placebo once
daily. Patients randomly assigned to duloxetine 60 mg
once daily started on duloxetine 30 mg once daily for 1
week and then titrated up to duloxetine 60 mg once
daily for 7 weeks.
The protocol was approved by study center Ethical
Review Boards. Patients provided written informed consent before participating and after being fully informed
regarding the nature of the procedures involved. The
study was conducted in accordance with regulatory standards of Good Clinical Practice and the Declaration of
Helsinki (1996) and all applicable local regulations. The
study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01000805).
Patients
Adult (18 years of age) male or female outpatients were
eligible to be included in the study if they met all of the
following criteria: a current episode of MDD according to
the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,
Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) and confirmed
by the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview
with a history of at least one separate, previous episode
of depression, and at both the screening and randomization
visits a Montgomery–A˚ sburg Depression Rating Scale
(MADRS) total score of 20, and at least moderate pain
with a score of 3 on the Brief Pain Inventory Short Form
(BPI) average pain item, and a Clinical Global Impression
of Severity (CGI-S) score 4.
Patients were excluded from the study if they met any of
the following criteria: any current (within the past 6
months) DSM-IV-TR primary axis I diagnosis other than
MDD; a history of alcohol or substance abuse or dependence within 1 year immediately prior to visit 1; any prior
history of bipolar disorder, psychosis, or schizophrenia; any
current axis II disorder that, in the judgment of the investigator, would have interfered with study compliance; a
history of a serious suicide attempt or subject judged by
the investigator to be at serious suicidal risk; lack of
response of any episode of major depression to two or
more adequate courses of antidepressant therapy or investigator defined treatment-resistant depression; previous
nonresponse to treatment of MDD or GAD with an adequate course of duloxetine; required continuous use of
analgesics (4step 2 World Health Organization definition13) because of chronic pain (46 months); presence of
pain of a known origin; meeting criteria for fibromyalgia as
defined by the American College of Rheumatology; treatment with any excluded medications within 7 days prior to
visit 2 with the exception of fluoxetine which could not

have been taken within 30 days prior to visit 2; and treatment with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) within
14 days prior to visit 2 or potential need for treatment with
an MAOI during the study or within 5 days of discontinuation of study drug.
Key restrictions regarding concomitant medication
usage were as follows: chronic use of narcotics/opioids
was not allowed; episodic use was allowed only after sponsor approval for individual cases of acute injury or surgical
procedure. As a rescue medication, acetaminophen (paracetamol) was allowed at a maximum dose up to 3 g per day
for up to 3 days per week if needed for a concomitant disease. Paracetamol was not allowed for treatment of painful
physical symptoms of MDD during the study. Aspirin
was permitted for cardiac prophylaxsis at a dose up to
100 mg/day, provided the subject was on a stable dose for
at least 3 months prior to enrollment. Chronic use of benzodiazepines was not allowed; episodic use was limited to
lorazepam at a maximum dose of 2 mg/day for up to 3 days
per week. Zolpidem was allowed as a sedative/hypnotic/
sleep agent at up to 10 mg/day, for no more than six total
days during the double-blind treatment period. Dietary
supplements with known or suspected CNS activity were
not allowed for chronic or episodic use; herbal preparations
were not allowed for chronic or episodic use.
Initiating, changing, or stopping psychotherapy within
6 weeks prior to Visit 1 or at any time during the study; or
initiating, changing, or stopping non-pharmacologic or
alternative therapies (for example, acupuncture, biofeedback, or massage) for painful physical symptoms at any
time during the study were not allowed.
Efficacy assessments
The coprimary efficacy outcomes of this study were the
overall mean change from baseline in the BPI average
pain rating through 8 weeks (overall main effect of treatment) and the mean change in the MADRS total score
from baseline at the 8-week endpoint. The BPI14 is a
patient-rated, Likert-type scale that measures the severity
of pain (4 items) and the interference of pain on function
(7 items). Items are scored from 0 (no pain/does not interfere) to 10 (pain as severe as you can imagine/completely
interferes). The MADRS15 is a depression rating scale
which is designed to be particularly sensitive to change
in patients treated with antidepressant medication and
was administered by appropriately trained site personnel.
The scale includes 10 items focusing on core symptoms of
depressive illness, scored from 0 to 6, with a maximum
total score of 60. The primary efficacy measure was calculated as the sum of 10 MADRS items. Reductions in score
over time are interpreted as improvement in the patient’s
status.
A gatekeeper strategy16 was employed for sequentially
testing five gated secondary measures related to global
functioning and the remission of depressive symptoms.
Functioning was assessed using the mean change from
baseline at the 8-week endpoint in the Sheehan
Disability Scale (SDS) global functional impairment
score. The SDS17 is a widely used and well validated
patient-rated scale that measures the extent to which
emotional symptoms disrupt patient functioning in
three life domains (work/school work, social life/leisure
activities, and family life/home responsibilities) on a
scale of 0 (not at all) to 10 (extremely). Scores of 5
and above in any functional domain indicate significant
functional impairment18. The global functional impairment score is the sum of scores from three life domains17.
When calculating the global functional impairment
score, if the work/school item score was missing, the
value was imputed as the average of the family and
social item scores. If the family and/or social item score
was missing, the global functional impairment score was
missing. Remission of MDD was measured two ways: as
the percentage of patients with MADRS total score 12
at the 8-week endpoint and as the percentage of patients
with MADRS total score 12 at the last two nonmissing
acute study visits to assess improvements in depressive
symptoms over an extended period of time. Other gatekeeper objectives included the MADRS total score mean
change from baseline to week 4 and to week 2.
Nongated, but a priori defined, secondary measures
included the Patient Global Impression of
Improvement (PGI-I) scale and the relationship
between improvement in pain and improvement in
mood. The PGI-I scale15 is a patient-rated instrument
that measures the improvement of the patient’s symptoms on a scale of 1 (‘very much improved,’) to 7 (‘very
much worse’). A related physician-administered scale,
the CGI-S19 was used to assess depression symptoms at
the screening and baseline visits. The scores range from
1 (normal, not at all ill) to 7 (among the most extremely ill patients). The relationship between improvement in pain and improvement in MDD was evaluated
by assessing remission of depressive symptoms (defined
as a MADRS total score of 12 at the 8-week endpoint)
for patients reporting reduction in pain (as measured by
change in BPI average pain rating score from baseline to
the 8-week endpoint) of at least 30% and at least 50%.
The 30% cutoff was based on a report assessing studies
of several painful conditions by Farrar et al.20, which
found that improvements in pain of at least 30% were
associated with PGI-I ratings of ‘much improved’ or
‘very much improved’. The 50% cutoff, which is an
even more stringent definition of improvement, was
also considered by the authors to reflect a highly meaningful improvement.

Safety assessments
Safety measures included the occurrence of treatmentemergent adverse events and serious adverse events; rates
and reasons for early discontinuation; vital signs; laboratory assessments; and suicide-related events (behavior and/
or ideation) as assessed by the Columbia–Suicide Severity
Rating Scale (C-SSRS)21.
Statistical analyses
Assuming an effect size of 0.29, this study was estimated to
have 90% power to detect a treatment difference between
duloxetine 60 mg once daily and placebo in mean change
from baseline in BPI average pain rating over 8 weeks of
treatment with 251 subjects in each treatment arm using a
two-sided t-test at an alpha level of 0.05. Based on this
sample size, this study was estimated to have 99% power
to detect a treatment difference between duloxetine 60 mg
once daily and placebo in mean change from baseline to 8
weeks in MADRS total score using a two-sided t-test at an
alpha level of 0.05, assuming an effect size of 0.63.
Approximately 4% of subjects were predicted not to
have a postbaseline measure of BPI average pain; therefore
a total sample size of 520 was estimated. All randomized
patients were included in safety analyses and all randomized patients with baseline and at least one postbaseline
assessment were included in efficacy analyses.
The primary method of analysis for both coprimary
efficacy measures was a mixed-effects model repeated measures (MMRM) approach. The models included the fixed,
categorical effects of treatment, investigator, visit, and
treatment-by-visit interaction, as well as the continuous, fixed covariates of baseline score and baseline scoreby-visit interaction. An unstructured (co)variance
structure was used to model the within-patient errors.
For statistical analysis purposes, the investigators with
the fewest subjects were pooled within country until
each site (or pooled site) had at least eight subjects with
postbaseline data.
The overall main effect of treatment for the BPI average
pain rating and the contrast between treatments at 8-week
endpoint for the MADRS total score were prespecified as
the primary evidence of efficacy for the comparison
between duloxetine 60 mg once daily and placebo. As sensitivity analysis, mean change from baseline at 8-week
endpoint for MADRS total score was also analyzed using
a last observation carried forward (LOCF) approach and a
fixed-effects analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model
that included treatment, investigator, and baseline score.
To control for type I experiment-wise error during multiple comparisons, a gatekeeping procedure was employed
for sequential testing of five gated secondary hypotheses
that duloxetine 60 mg once daily (p  0.05) was superior to
placebo once daily. Testing for statistical significance was
to stop when a hypothesis failed to show statistical significance favoring duloxetine (p40.05)16. The five gated
secondary measures assessed using the gatekeeping strategy
were the following (in order of testing): (1) the SDS global
functional impairment score, assessed as mean change
from baseline at 8-week endpoint; (2) remission defined
as the percentage of patients with MADRS total score 12
at the 8-week endpoint; (3) remission defined as the percentage of patients with MADRS total score 12 at the
last two nonmissing acute study visits; (4) MADRS total
score mean change from baseline to week 4; and (5)
MADRS total score mean change from baseline to week
2. The SDS global functional impairment score was analyzed using the same approach (MMRM) as that employed
for the coprimary measures. Remission rates and BPI
response rates (proportion of patients with at least 30%
or 50% reductions in average pain score) were analyzed
using a LOCF approach and the Cochran–Mantel–
Haenszel test with stratification by investigator. The differences between treatments at week 4 and week 2 from
the MMRM model, as employed for the primary measure
(MADRS total score), served as the evidence of efficacy
for the comparison between treatments for the gated secondary objectives 4 and 5. As detailed in later sections, the
results for all gated secondary outcomes demonstrated significant improvement with duloxetine compared with placebo according to the prespecified testing plan; for the sake
of clarity, results for gated and nongated findings were
integrated within outcome measure in the results section.
Type I experiment-wise error rate was not controlled for
the additional nongated a priori analyses reported. These
included remaining BPI pain severity items (e.g. ‘worst
pain’, ‘least pain’, ‘pain right now’) and BPI interference
items (all), and SDS item scores (analyzed using the same
MMRM approach as that described for the BPI average
pain rating); and remission rates (defined as a MADRS
total score of 12 at the 8-week endpoint), which were
compared between subgroups of patients taking duloxetine
who either had, or did not have, at least a 30% or a 50%
improvement in BPI average pain at the 8-week endpoint
using the Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel test with stratification by pooled investigator. The BPI pain severity and
interference items were analyzed using the same approach
(MMRM) as that employed for the coprimary measures.
The percentage of patients with each treatment emergent
adverse event who discontinued due to adverse events and
the percentage of patients with C-SSRS outcomes were
analyzed using Fisher’s exact test. The mean changes
from baseline to 8-week endpoint for vital signs were analyzed using a LOCF approach and an ANCOVA model
which included treatment, investigator, and baseline. The
mean changes from baseline to 8-week endpoint in laboratory measurements were analyzed using a LOCF
approach and the significance of differences between treatment groups were assessed based on rank-transformed data.

Results
Patient disposition
A total of 528 patients were randomly assigned to duloxetine (N ¼ 262) or placebo (N ¼ 266) treatment.
Completing the 8-week double-blind treatment period
were 192 patients who received duloxetine treatment
(73.3%) and 204 patients who received placebo (76.7%)
(Figure 1). Compared with placebo, more subjects discontinued duloxetine treatment due to adverse events and
subject decision; whereas more subjects discontinued placebo treatment than duloxetine due to lack of efficacy
(Figure 1).
Baseline characteristics
The mean age of randomized patients was 45.9 years,
and approximately 69% of patients in both treatment
groups were female (Table 1). There were no significant differences between treatment groups in the
patient demographic variables, the severity of pain or
interference from pain, severity of depressive symptoms,
or global functional impairment (Table 1). The treatment groups did not differ in their psychiatric history as it related to number of previous episodes of
depression or to duration of the current episode of
depression.
Efficacy
Depression and related measures
Treatment with duloxetine resulted in significantly greater
improvement based on the coprimary outcome of change
in MADRS total score from baseline at 8 weeks (MMRM
method) in comparison to placebo (16.77 [SE 0.67] vs
12.73 [SE 0.64] or a 57.9% vs 44.3% improvement from
baseline, respectively; p50.001) (Figure 2). In the time
course analysis, the treatment-by-visit interaction was significant (p  0.001) and duloxetine was more efficacious
than placebo beginning at week 2 and at all remaining
visits (p  0.001; weeks 2 and 4 were significant positive
gated secondary outcomes) (Figure 2). The LS mean
change in MADRS total score from baseline to 8-week
endpoint was also greater versus placebo by LOCF sensitivity analysis (duloxetine, 15.0 [SE 0.66]; placebo,
11.6 [SE 0.64]) (p  0.001).
A significantly greater proportion of patients receiving
duloxetine versus placebo met the criteria for remission
(MADRS total score 12) whether assessed at 8-week
LOCF endpoint (47.0% and 32.8%, respectively) or the
last two nonmissing study visits (29.5% and 18.7%, respectively) (both gated secondary measures; p  0.01).
Pain measures
The coprimary efficacy outcome of mean change from
baseline over 8 weeks (overall main effect of treatment)
for the BPI average pain rating (MMRM method) demonstrated a significantly greater improvement (reduction) in
average pain rating with duloxetine (1.93 [SE 0.11])
compared with placebo (1.31 [SE 0.10]) (p  0.001), corresponding to 35.1% and 22.9% reductions in average pain
score, respectively. Patients treated with duloxetine also
had greater improvement in their average pain rating at
weeks 1, 2, 4, and 8 compared with patients treated with
placebo (all p  0.005) (Figure 3). Overall scores (MMRM
method) for ‘worst pain’ and ‘least pain’ in the last 24 hours
and for ‘pain right now’ were also reduced with duloxetine
versus placebo (all p  0.001; Table 2).
Greater improvements were observed over the 8-week
treatment period with duloxetine versus placebo for all BPI
pain severity and interference items (Table 2; experimentwise type I error rate not controlled for). The proportion of
patients reporting at least 50% improvement in average
pain at 8-week LOCF endpoint was 52.6% with duloxetine
and 37.2% with placebo (p  0.001), while 61.8% of
duloxetine-treated patients and 49.0% of placebo patients
experienced at least 30% reductions in average pain
(p ¼ 0.003).

endpoint) that were higher (both p  0.001) compared
with the duloxetine-treated patients who did not meet
the BPI response criterion (Figure 4).
Other measures of symptoms and global functioning
Overall symptom improvement was further assessed using
the PGI-I score recorded by patients at each study visit.
Compared with placebo-treated patients, the least-squares
mean PGI-I score indicated significantly greater improvements for duloxetine-treated patients at each individual
study visit as well as overall (p  0.021, MMRM
approach). Scores of 1 (‘very much better’) or 2 (‘much
better’) were reported by a significantly greater percentage
of patients in the duloxetine group (50.8%) compared with
the placebo group (35.2%; p  0.001).
For the SDS global functional impairment score, the
duloxetine treatment group demonstrated significantly
greater improvement from baseline at the 8-week endpoint
compared with placebo (secondary gatekeeper measure)
(48.2% vs 37.7% improvement from baseline, respectively;
p ¼ 0.019, Table 3). Improvements from baseline at

social life/leisure activities and family life/home responsibilities were both greater with duloxetine versus placebo at
the 8-week endpoint (p  0.05); however, improvement in
the item addressing school/work life was not significantly
different between duloxetine and placebo (p ¼ 0.112).
Safety
The majority of patients in both groups completed the
study (duloxetine ¼ 73.3%, placebo ¼ 76.7%) (Figure 1).
Drug compliance (defined as 80 to 120% of capsules taken
for each visit) was greater than 80% for 211/251 patients
(84.1%) receiving duloxetine and 221/262 patients
(84.4%) receiving placebo, and did not differ between
treatments. Significantly more of the patients treated
with duloxetine, compared with placebo, discontinued
due to adverse events (8.0% vs 3.4%; p ¼ 0.024) and
patient decision (6.1% vs 2.3%, p ¼ 0.030). Significantly
more of the placebo-treated patients discontinued due to
lack of efficacy (6.0%) compared with patients in the
duloxetine group (1.9%, p ¼ 0.024). There were no specific AEs that led to significantly different discontinuation
rates between treatment groups. Nausea was the most frequently reported AE that led to study discontinuation
(three in the duloxetine treatment group and none in
the placebo treatment group). Treatment-emergent
adverse events that occurred in at least 5% of duloxetine-treated patients and at least twice the rate of placebo
in this study are shown in Table 4. With duloxetine and
placebo therapy, for other adverse events noted as being
more common with duloxetine than placebo in the duloxetine prescribing information10, dry mouth occurred in 22
(8.4%) and 14 patients (5.3%; p ¼ 0.170), respectively;
dizziness in 13 (5.0%) and 10 patients (3.8%; p ¼ 0.529),
respectively; and fatigue in 11 (4.2%) and 7 patients
(2.6%; p ¼ 0.348), respectively.
With regard to serious adverse events, five duloxetine
patients and one placebo patient had 1 serious adverse
events during the treatment phase (p ¼ 0.12). Duloxetinetreated patients reported clostridial infection,
diverticulitis, inguinal hernia, respiratory tract infection,
suicide attempt, and syncope. One placebo patient
reported therapeutic agent toxicity. No serious adverse
events were considered by the investigators to be related
to study drug. However, two of these serious adverse events
(suicide attempt and respiratory tract infection) were
reported as the reason for study discontinuation.
No significant between-group differences occurred in
mean changes in systolic or diastolic blood pressure from
baseline to 8-week LOCF endpoint; pulse rate decreased
for placebo (0.70 [SE 0.53] bpm) and increased for duloxetine (1.71 [SE 0.54] bpm) (p50.001). Mean changes in
weight reflected an increase for placebo-treated patients
(0.14 [SE 0.13] kg) and a decrease for duloxetine-treated
patients (0.74 [SE 0.14] kg) (p50.001). With regard to
laboratory values, duloxetine-treated patients experienced
a statistically significant least squares mean decrease in
chloride (0.63 mmol/L [SE 0.17], p  0.001) and in uric
acid (12.47 mmol/L [SE 3.21], p  0.001) as compared
with placebo-treated patients who experienced a nonsignificant increase in chloride (0.24 mmol/L [SE 0.17],
p ¼ 0.71) and in uric acid (2.38 [SE 3.14], p ¼ 0.63)
(between group comparisons, p ¼ 0.001 for chloride and
p ¼ 0.002 uric acid). A statistically significant difference
was seen for duloxetine-treated patients compared with
placebo-treated patients for change in mean cell volume
(0.54 [SE 0.23] and 0.13 [SE 0.22], respectively; p ¼ 0.026)
and change in neutrophil count (0.14 [SE 0.09] and
0.18 [SE 0.09], respectively; p ¼ 0.012). The percentages
of patients with treatment-emergent abnormally high (
the Covance Upper Limit of Normal [ULN] reference
range) laboratory results for the above listed results (i.e.
chloride, mean cell volume, neutrophils, and uric acid)
were not different between duloxetine and placebo; however, a statistically significantly greater percentage of
duloxetine-treated vs placebo-treated patients experienced treatment-emergent abnormally high (the
Covance ULN) ALT values during the double-blind treatment phase (7.7% vs 2.6%, respectively, p ¼ 0.033). There
were no statistically significant differences between treatment groups for the number and percentage of patients
with suicide-related outcomes during treatment as measured by the C-SSRS (duloxetine, 8.0%; placebo, 11.1%,
p ¼ 0.293).
Discussion
The present study assessed the impact of duloxetine 60 mg
once daily in the treatment of depression and associated
painful symptoms in patients with MDD and at least moderate levels of pain at study entry. Patients treated with
duloxetine had significantly greater improvement compared with placebo in the coprimary measures of change
in the overall BPI average pain rating over the 8-week

double-blind treatment period and of mean change in
MADRS total score from baseline at the 8-week endpoint
(both p  0.001). In addition, patients receiving duloxetine experienced significantly greater improvements in
global functioning, as measured by the change in the
SDS global functional impairment score from baseline at
8 weeks (p ¼ 0.019). A significantly greater proportion of
subjects met criteria for remission as measured at 8 weeks
and as measured over the period of time represented by the
last two non-missing study visits (both p  0.01; significantly greater reductions in depressive symptoms based
on MADRS total score at weeks 2 and 4 were also observed
for duloxetine vs placebo (both p  0.001). In addition,
greater improvements over the 8-week study were
observed for each of the individual BPI items for pain
and interference from pain (all p  0.05). Overall, the
safety data were consistent with the known safety characteristics of duloxetine10.
The finding of improvements in both pain and depressive symptoms in this study is consistent with the report by
Brecht et al.12, but differed from the findings reported by
Brannan et al.11. The Brannan study required patients to
have a score of 2 on the BPI average pain item, and the
mean BPI average pain score at baseline was approximately
4.7, while the study reported by Brecht et al. required a
baseline score of at least 3, and a mean of 5.7 was observed.
In addition, the study reported by Brannan et al. did not
require a documented history of a prior depressive episode.
In that study, duloxetine did not separate from placebo on
the primary depression measure; however, greater differences between duloxetine and placebo were observed for
most pain outcome measures. In contrast, the current study
and the Brecht et al. study12 required potential study
patients to have at least one prior episode of MDD to
increase the likelihood of a true MDD episode as opposed
to situational depression in response to a psychosocial
stressor. In addition, both the current study and the
study by Brecht et al.12 required patients to have moderate
or greater pain at baseline defined by a score of 3 on the
BPI average pain question. The intent of these criteria was
to help identify a more homogenous study population in
which the coprimary objectives could be more efficiently
evaluated.
One final note that is clinically germane: in patients
receiving duloxetine, remission of depressive symptoms
was at least 2.5-fold more likely in patients who experienced improvement in pain symptoms than in those without such a reduction using several a priori definitions.
These findings are consistent with those reported by
Fava et al.4
, who found in a post-hoc analysis that improvements in painful physical symptoms were associated with
higher rates of remission of depressive symptoms, even
after accounting for improvements in core emotional
symptoms.
Several study limitations should be noted. While
duloxetine is approved for several chronic painful conditions (e.g. diabetic nerve pain, chronic low back pain,
and chronic osteoarthritis pain) in patients without
comorbid MDD, patients with MDD and pain of a
known origin were specifically excluded from the current
study to focus on the nonspecific pain commonly associated with MDD. As such, these results do not address the
effects of duloxetine on pain in patients with MDD and
comorbid pain of a known origin. This was a short-term
study, and does not address the efficacy of duloxetine for
depression or associated pain during longer-term treatment; further, because this was a fixed-dose study, its
results do not speak to other dosages that might be
used in clinical practice. Because duloxetine was the
only active drug evaluated in this study, the results
cannot be generalized to other antidepressants,
and even general comparison to other medications is
made difficult by the paucity of studies assessing treatment of both MDD and associated painful physical
symptoms.
Finally, pain associated with depression is not clearly
defined in psychiatric nomenclature, and for this study
was determined via investigator assessment by ruling out
pain of a known origin in potential patients. Thus, some
of the observed pre-existing pain conditions could potentially have been associated with either pain associated
with depression (allowed) or with pain of a known
origin (not allowed) or both. The subjective nature of
both depression and pain is an ongoing issue in these
types of studies, and our attempts to control for it
included randomization as well as asking investigators
to be thorough when ruling out pain of other known
origins.
Conclusion
This study demonstrated that duloxetine at 60 mg once
daily was safe and efficacious in the treatment of MDD
and associated painful physical symptoms.
