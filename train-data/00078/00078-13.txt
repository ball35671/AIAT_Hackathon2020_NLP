Randomized clinical trial
abstract
Preclinical and clinical studies suggest that neuronal nicotinic receptor (NNR) agonists may be a novel and
effective therapy for numerous painful conditions. Analgesic efficacy and safety of the highly selective a4b2
NNR agonist ABT-894 was evaluated in 2 separate randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled clinical trials in patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain (DPNP). Study 1 (280 patients
randomized) tested 1, 2, and 4 mg ABT-894 twice daily compared with placebo and 60 mg duloxetine once
per day over 8 weeks of treatment. Study 2 (124 patients randomized) tested 6 mg ABT-894 twice daily vs
placebo for 8 weeks. The primary efficacy outcome measure in both studies was the weekly mean of the 24-
hour average pain score recorded in each patient’s diary. In both trials, none of the ABT-894 dose groups
showed efficacy compared with placebo, whereas duloxetine achieved a statistically significant improvement over placebo in Study 1. All dose levels of ABT-894 were well tolerated, and no significant safety
issues were identified. These results are in contrast to the outcome of a previously reported study of DPNP
using the less selective a4b2 NNR agonist ABT-594, which demonstrated efficacy compared with placebo,
albeit with significant tolerability limitations. The failure of the highly selective a4b2 NNR agonist ABT-894
indicates that it may not be possible to define a therapeutic index for this mechanism or that selectively
targeting a4b2 NNRs may not be a viable approach to treating neuropathic pain.

1. Introduction
Diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain (DPNP) affects approximately 20% of those with a history of diabetes of longer than
10 years [13]. Current first-line oral treatment approaches for
DPNP include the antiepileptic agents gabapentin and pregabalin
and selected antidepressants (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants and
serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors such as duloxetine);
only pregabalin and duloxetine are approved by the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration for the treatment of DPNP [4,6]. These
currently prescribed therapies often prove ineffective or partially
effective, and adverse effects frequently limit their utility [4]. Opioids are also prescribed for DPNP [11], but their use is hindered by
concerns over safety and misuse.
Neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (NNRs) are members
of a ligand-gated ion channel family that are widely distributed
throughout the central and peripheral nervous systems. NNRs are
composed of various combinations of a (a2–10) and b (b2–4) subunits, resulting in receptor subtypes of varying pharmacologies
that mediate a variety of functional effects, including positive effects (analgesia and cognitive enhancement) and negative effects
(physical dependence, nausea, and increased heart rate) [20]. The
a4b2 and a7 NNR subtypes are primarily present in central nervous
system pain pathways, whereas a3- and b4-containing subtypes
are principally expressed in the autonomic nervous system, mediating the negative functional effects of NNR activation [2,20]. The
a4b2 NNR agonist ABT-594 demonstrated efficacy in DPNP in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 study. The relatively high incidence of dose-dependent adverse events indicated
an unfavorable therapeutic profile for ABT-594, but established
proof-of-concept for a4b2 agonists in the treatment of DPNP and
supports exploration of more selective a4b2 NNR agonists to
establish a suitable therapeutic index [15].

ABT-894 (3-(5,6-dichloro-pyridin-3-yl)-1(S),5 (S)-3,6-diazabicyclo[3.2.0]heptane) is a novel, highly selective a4b2 NNR agonist
(compound 42 in [10]) that has demonstrated efficacy in preclinical animal models of neuropathic pain. Early preclinical and
clinical data indicate that ABT-894 could offer an improved therapeutic index compared with the less selective agonist ABT-594.
Whereas ABT-594 is only 2.4 times more selective for a4b2 over
a3b4 NNRs [3], ABT-894 shows an almost exclusive affinity for
the a4b2 subtype. Consistent with this receptor selectivity, ABT894 has shown positive effects comparable to ABT-594 in several
preclinical neuropathic pain models, but with fewer adverse
effects.
In previous healthy-volunteer, repeated-dose studies, ABT894 was generally well tolerated up to 8 mg twice daily. The
most commonly reported adverse events of dizziness, nausea,
headache, and vomiting increased with dose, and the majority
of events occurred at doses exceeding 8 mg twice daily. For
doses exceeding 6 mg twice daily, there was a mild, dosedependent increase in mean heart rate (>3 beats/min). Based
on preclinical predictions and the phase 1 safety and tolerability data, the dose range for the phase 2 DPNP studies was
determined to be 1 mg twice daily to 6 mg twice daily, allowing
for robust clinical hypothesis testing in a key target population.
Reported here are the results of 2 randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled phase 2 studies designed to examine the
analgesic efficacy and safety of ABT-894 in patients with
DPNP.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Patient population
In both studies, subjects were men and women between 18
and 75 years of age with a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (type
1 or type 2) and a glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) 69%. Subjects must have had painful distal symmetric diabetic polyneuropathy for P6 months and a score of P3 on the physical
assessment portion of the Michigan Neuropathic Screening
Instrument at the screening visit. In addition, subjects had to
have an average score P4 during the 7 days before the baseline
visit on the 24-hour average pain scale (11-point Likert scale, 0
[no pain] to 10 [worst pain]). Prospective subjects were required to have a compliance rating of P60% (at least 5 of 7 days
with completed baseline diary entries); an average score P4 on
BPI (Brief Pain Inventory) average pain score at baseline visit. In
study 1, subjects were excluded if they had a history of myocardial infarction within 6 months of the screening visit, undergone
a cardiac revascularization within 30 days of screening or had
systolic blood pressure P160 and/or diastolic blood pressure
P100 at screening and/or baseline; in study 2, subjects were
excluded if they had any history of myocardial infarction, had
undergone a cardiac revascularization, or had systolic blood
pressure P150 and/or diastolic blood pressure P100 at screening and baseline. Based on medical history and investigator
assessment, patients were excluded if they had a major psychiatric disorder including bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, or borderline personality disorder (defined by the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV). A major depressive
episode within 2 years was exclusionary; however, if patients
had been treated for major depressive disorder within 2 years,
they could have been included upon the investigator’s consultation with the study medical director. An independent ethics
committee/institutional review board approved both study protocols, and informed consent was obtained for each patient
before any study-related procedures being performed.
2.2. Study design
Both studies were phase 2, multiple-country, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group studies. Study 1
(NCT00507936) enrolled 280 subjects at 47 sites, from August
2007 to October 2008. Study 2 (NCT00548925) enrolled 124 subjects at 26 sites, from November 2007 to December 2008. A screening/washout period was followed by a baseline visit, an 8-week
treatment period, and a 1-week follow-up visit (Fig. 1). Study visits
occurred at baseline; at Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 (on treatment); and
Week 9 (1 week posttreatment follow-up visit).
2.3. Dosing
Study 1 had 5 treatment groups: 3 doses of ABT-894 (1 mg,
2 mg, 4 mg twice daily), 1 dose of duloxetine (60 mg once daily,
the dose of duloxetine approved for DPNP by the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency), and placebo. To maintain blinding, subjects assigned to duloxetine took
2 pills daily: 1 duloxetine 60 mg and 1 placebo. Study 2 had 2
treatment groups: ABT-894 6 mg twice daily and placebo. Study
1 included doses of ABT-894 up to 4 mg twice daily. Because of
the potential for an increase in heart rate after doses greater than
6 mg twice daily (seen in earlier phase 1 trials), Study 2 evaluated
6 mg twice daily using a more restrictive cardiovascular enrollment criteria (see Patient Population, described earlier). For each
study, patients were randomized 1:1 to each treatment arm via
an interactive voice response system using a randomization schedule that was generated before study start. An adaptive dropping-arm design was used for Study 1, which involved an interim
efficacy evaluation. The details of this design are described in the
online Supplementary text.
2.4. Concomitant medications
Patients must have discontinued all analgesics for DPNP, including anticonvulsants and antidepressants used for pain. Patients
were required to undergo washout of all disallowed analgesics
for at least 5 half-lives of the longest acting, or 2 days, whichever
was longer. Other excluded medications included monoamine oxidase inhibitors, selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors,
varenicline, any inhibitor of CYP2D6, and intramuscular or intravenous corticosteroids (inhaled corticosteroids were allowed). Aspirin (6325 mg/day) was permitted for cardiovascular prophylaxis.
The following medications were also allowed, provided they had
been at a stable dose for at least 30 days: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for conditions other than DPNP, antidepressants
(other than those listed) for depression or anxiety, benzodiazepines for sleep and/or anxiety, and over-the-counter topical analgesics. Acetaminophen (maximum 3000 mg/day) was allowed as
a rescue medication up to 3 days per week during the treatment
period, but not within 24 hours before scheduled study visits.
2.5. Efficacy assessments
The primary efficacy outcome measure in both studies was the
weekly mean of the 24-hour average pain score, recorded using an
11-point Likert scale and calculated from each patient’s daily diary.
All patients in all countries utilized the same electronic diary device to record pain assessments and rescue medication use. Each
evening, patients rated separately their average pain over the past
24 hours and their worst pain during the day on 11-point Likert
scales. At scheduled study visits, patients completed questions
regarding their pain and its effects on daily living using the same
electronic diaries that were used to record daily pain ratings. Secondary efficacy outcomes included the BPI Short Form (BPI-SF) [8],
M.C. Rowbotham et al. / PAIN
153 (2012) 862–868 863
Clinician Global Impression-Severity [14], Patient Global Impression-Change [17], Short Form McGill Pain Questionnaire [5],
SF-36 Health Status Survey [21], the EUROQOL-5D [1], and the
Neuropathic Pain Scale [15].
2.6. Safety assessments
Safety assessments included adverse event monitoring, vital
signs, physical examination, electrocardiography (ECG), and laboratory test assessments. Concomitant medication review was performed throughout the study.
2.7. Statistical design and analyses
For both studies, a sample size of 55 subjects per treatment
group was planned. The sample size was estimated to have at least
80% power to detect a treatment group difference of 1.4 points in
the change from baseline to final observation on the weekly mean
of the 24-hour average pain score between an ABT-894 dose group
and the placebo group at a 1-sided significance level of a = 0.05. In
the sample size calculation, it was assumed that the common standard deviation for the change was 2.76 and that 10% of the subjects
would not have any postbaseline data for the weekly mean 24-
hour average pain score.
The intent-to-treat population comprised all randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug. For efficacy
variables, only subjects with both baseline and at least 1 postbaseline efficacy assessment were included in the corresponding analysis. In the analysis of any given variable, baseline is defined as the
observation collected at or before the randomization visit; final
observation is defined as the last nonmissing observation of that
variable collected during the 8-week treatment period. The weekly
mean 24-hour average pain score was calculated from the subject’s
diary data for the 7 days before a scheduled clinic visit.
The treatment group difference in mean change from baseline
to final observation on the weekly mean 24-hour average pain
score was primarily assessed by an analysis of covariance model
with terms of treatment and study site, and a covariate of baseline
score. In Study 1, the treatment group difference between duloxetine and placebo was also evaluated. A maximum-likelihood, repeated-measures analysis for change from baseline to each
postbaseline assessment on the weekly mean 24-hour average
pain score was also performed. The repeated-measures model included fixed terms of treatment, site, week, and treatment by week
interaction, as well as baseline score and baseline score by week
interaction. An unstructured variance-covariance structure was
used. The same analytical models were used to assess treatment
group differences for all continuous secondary efficacy variables.
Categorical variables were analyzed by Fisher exact test. An analysis of variance was used to test whether the demographic and
baseline disease characteristics were comparable among treatment
groups at baseline. As specified in the clinical protocols, 1-sided
tests of significance were performed for all efficacy analyses.
Adverse events were coded using the Medical Dictionary for
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) version 11.0. Treatment-emergent
adverse events (AEs) (i.e., those that emerged or worsened in
severity after initiation of study drug) were tabulated by system
organ class and MedDRA preferred term for each treatment group.
Treatment group differences in the proportion of subjects reporting any AE or specific AEs were evaluated using Fisher exact test.
Change from baseline to final observations on laboratory values
and vital signs were analyzed using a 1-way analysis of variance
with treatment as the main effect. Treatment group differences
in normal or abnormal categories of ECGs were evaluated using
Fisher exact test. For all safety analyses, 2-sided tests were performed as specified in the protocols.
3. Results
3.1. Subjects
A total of 280 patients were randomized into Study 1 and received at least 1 dose of study drug; 124 patients were randomized
into Study 2 and received at least 1 dose of study drug. For each
study, patient disposition is shown in Supplementary Fig. 1 (CONSORT flow diagram). Patient demographic and baseline characteristics are shown in Table 1. There were no statistically significant
differences in demographic or baseline characteristics among the
treatment groups within either study, with the exception of
alcohol use in Study 1 (data not shown).
3.2. Efficacy
The ABT-894 treatment did not result in statistically significant
differences in the change of the weekly mean 24-hour average pain
score from baseline to final observation when compared with placebo in either study (P values for each dose P.457 vs placebo in
Study 1; P = .347 vs placebo in Study 2), nor did it demonstrate statistically significant effects on any secondary outcomes, with the
exception of the ABT-894 4 mg twice daily dose on the BPI-SFAverage of 7 interference scores (P < .05) in Study 1. No significant
effects of ABT-894 were detected in the Neuropathic Pain Scale
(data not shown). The duloxetine group showed statistically significant differences in the change of the weekly mean 24-hour average pain score from baseline to final observation (P = .032 vs
placebo), as well as on 2 secondary outcomes in Study 1 (Table 2).

In a repeated-measures analysis of the change of the weekly mean
24-hour average pain score from baseline to Weeks 1 to 8, ABT-894
did not demonstrate statistically significant effects at any time
point, whereas in Study 1, duloxetine showed statistically significant effects at each time point (Fig. 2).
3.3. Safety
The total number of subjects who reported at least 1 treatmentemergent AE and a summary of the most commonly occurring
(P5%) AEs in the total ABT-894–treated subjects are shown in Table 3. Within each study, there were no statistically significant differences between treatment groups in the proportion of subjects
who reported at least 1 treatment-emergent AE. Most AEs were
mild to moderate in severity, and there was no evidence that the
overall incidence rates of AEs were dose dependent in the ABT894 treatment groups.
In Study 1, 1 subject (2.0%) in the placebo group, 1 subject
(1.8%) in the duloxetine group, and 4 subjects (2.3%) in the
ABT-894 groups reported serious adverse events (SAEs). The
SAEs in the ABT-894 groups were coronary artery stenosis, cellulitis, diverticulitis, pneumonia, third-degree burns, benign lung

neoplasm, benign neoplasm, and nephrolithiasis. One placebo
subject had an SAE of infected skin ulcer, and 1 duloxetine
subject had an SAE of electrolyte imbalance. All of the SAEs were
considered not related or probably not related to study drug by
the investigator. One subject in the duloxetine treatment group
in Study 1 died of pancreatic cancer with metastasis to the liver
(occurred 53 days after the last dose of study drug and was reported by the investigator as a poststudy SAE not related to
study drug). In Study 2, 1 subject (1.5%) in the placebo group
and 4 subjects (6.8%) in the ABT-894 group had treatment-emergent SAEs during the study. SAEs in the ABT-894 group were
hypoglycemic coma, cystitis, pyelonephritis, sepsis, nerve compression, and pulmonary embolism. One placebo-treated subject
had an SAE of diverticulosis. All of the SAEs were considered not
related to study drug by the investigator. No deaths occurred
during Study 2.
AEs were the primary reason for premature discontinuation in
Study 1 of 6 ABT-894 subjects (3.5%), 3 placebo subjects (5.9%),
and 11 duloxetine subjects (19.3%); in Study 2, of 4 ABT-894 subjects (6.8%) and 4 placebo subjects (6.2%). There were no clinically
significant changes in ECG parameters, vital signs, or laboratory
parameters in either study.
4. Discussion
In these 2 double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, a range of
ABT-894 doses (1 mg, 2 mg, 4 mg, and 6 mg twice daily) failed to
demonstrate analgesic efficacy in DPNP as assessed by change from
baseline to final observation in the weekly mean 24-hour average
pain score. Similarly, ABT-894 did not demonstrate efficacy on secondary end points. Duloxetine, included as an active comparator
for assay sensitivity in Study 1, did demonstrate statistically significant efficacy on the primary end point and 2 secondary end points.
The results of the current studies are not consistent with those
seen in an earlier study of ABT-594, a less selective a4b2 NNR agonist, in which ABT-594 significantly reduced average 24-hour pain
ratings compared with placebo in patients with DPNP at all doses
tested [15]. Because of the side effect profile of ABT-594, no therapeutic index could be identified. We expected that a more selective
NNR agonist with better specificity for the a4b2 subtype would
provide similar analgesic effects without limiting safety issues.
The reasons for the failure of ABT-894 to show clinical efficacy in
the current DPNP trials are not clear. Few published trials have included an active comparator such as duloxetine. In study 1, the active comparator duloxetine did show statistically significant
analgesic efficacy, indicating that Study 1 was effectively conducted and not a failed trial. In addition, the studies were large enough to have more than sufficient power to detect efficacy (a total
of 231 patients received ABT-894), and the observed placebo response rates were within the expected range. It is possible that
ABT-594, which is a less selective a4b2 NNR agonist than ABT894, elicits some of its effects via activity at non-a4b2 NNRs. If this
is the case, the preferential affinity of ABT-894 for a4b2 NNRs may
have been a disadvantage that resulted in a lack of analgesic efficacy. Multiple mechanisms of action may be advantageous in
achieving a clinical response, and has been postulated as a potential explanation for the efficacy seen with tricyclic antidepressants
[18].
The exposure levels achieved in both studies were as predicted,
but it is possible that subjects may have required higher exposures
of ABT-894 than predicted from preclinical studies to demonstrate
analgesic efficacy. Although safety and tolerability data from
healthy volunteer studies indicated that higher doses of ABT-894
may not have been suitable for outpatient studies, the lack of
dose-limiting AEs or safety outcomes in the current studies suggest
that the dose range predicted by healthy volunteer studies may
have been too restrictive for a placebo-controlled, randomized trial
in DPNP patients. However, even if ABT-894 doses higher than
6 mg twice daily were tested in a future study and produced analgesic effects, it is possible that the therapeutic index for this compound might still be no better than that for ABT-594 [15]. Taken
together, the results of the ABT-594 and ABT-894 studies conducted to date indicate that it may not be feasible to define a therapeutic index for a4b2 NNRs in the treatment of neuropathic pain.
Overall, ABT-894 up to 6 mg twice daily was well tolerated and
exhibited an AE profile consistent with side effects associated with
NNR activation, e.g., gastrointestinal and nervous system effects.
The most common AEs in the ABT-894 treatment groups (i.e.,
P5% total ABT-894 subjects) were headache, nausea, dizziness,
and fatigue. The increased heart rate of 2 to 3 beats/min observed
in a phase 1 study at a 6 mg twice daily dose of ABT-894 was not
observed in either of the current phase 2 studies. Premature discontinuation rates due to AEs were relatively low at all doses of
ABT-894. In contrast, the active comparator duloxetine showed
analgesic efficacy in Study 1 but had an AE discontinuation rate
exceeding 19%, much higher than for ABT-894 and placebo,
although consistent with previously reported studies of duloxetine
[7,19,22].
Currently available medications specifically approved for DPNP,
such as pregabalin and duloxetine, are not effective in all patients
and have clinically significant side effect profiles. Despite multiple
efforts, no new therapies for DPNP have been approved. Trials of
tanezumab, a monoclonal antibody against nerve growth factor,
were recently halted for diabetic peripheral neuropathy, as well
as for chronic lower back pain and osteoarthritis, due to concerns
over patient safety [12]. Another compound, V3381 (indantadol),
an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist and nonselective monoamine oxidase inhibitor, recently failed to show significant benefit to patients in a phase 2b DPNP study [9].
Lacosamide, a partially subtype-selective sodium channel blocking
anticonvulsant approved for the control of partial-onset seizures,
has shown mixed results in diabetic neuropathy, demonstrating

numerical improvements over placebo but not consistently meeting predefined efficacy end points [16,23,24]. Together, these
results, as well as those reported here with ABT-894, demonstrate
the continued need for new therapies and the challenges in developing new medications for the treatment of DPNP.
