Abstract
This was a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to assess the efficacy and safety of duloxetine, a selective
serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, in 354 female patients with primary fibromyalgia, with or without current major depressive
disorder. Patients (90% Caucasian; mean age, 49.6 years; 26% with current major depressive disorder) received duloxetine 60 mg once daily
(QD) (NZ118), duloxetine 60 mg twice daily (BID) (NZ116), or placebo (NZ120). The primary outcome was the Brief Pain Inventory
average pain severity score. Response to treatment was defined as R30% reduction in this score. Compared with placebo, both duloxetinetreated groups improved significantly more (P!0.001) on the Brief Pain Inventory average pain severity score. A significantly higher
percentage of duloxetine-treated patients had a decrease of R30% in this score (duloxetine 60 mg QD (55%; P!0.001); duloxetine 60 mg
BID (54%; PZ0.002); placebo (33%)). The treatment effect of duloxetine on pain reduction was independent of the effect on mood and the
presence of major depressive disorder. Compared with patients on placebo, patients treated with duloxetine 60 mg QD or duloxetine 60 mg
BID had significantly greater improvement in remaining Brief Pain Inventory pain severity and interference scores, Fibromyalgia Impact
Questionnaire, Clinical Global Impression of Severity, Patient Global Impression of Improvement, and several quality-of-life measures. Both
doses of duloxetine were safely administered and well tolerated. In conclusion, both duloxetine 60 mg QD and duloxetine 60 mg BID were
effective and safe in the treatment of fibromyalgia in female patients with or without major depressive disorder.

1. Introduction
Fibromyalgia is a chronic, often debilitating musculoskeletal pain disorder that is characterized by widespread
pain and muscle tenderness, and often accompanied by
fatigue, stiffness, anxiety, sleep disturbance, and depression
(Hudson and Pope, 1996; Wolfe et al., 1990). Fibromyalgia
is common and occurs in about 2% of the general population
of the United States with more women (estimated at 3.4–
10.5%) than men (0.5%) diagnosed with fibromyalgia
(Neumann and Buskila, 2003; Wolfe et al., 1995).
Although the pathophysiology of fibromyalgia is
unknown, central monoaminergic neurotransmission may
play a role in its etiology. Dysfunction in both serotonin and
norepinephrine systems has been implicated in the etiology
of fibromyalgia (Legangneux et al., 2001; Russell et al.,
1992a,b; Yunus et al., 1992). Both serotonergic and
noradrenergic neurons have also been implicated in the
mediation of endogenous pain inhibitory mechanisms via
the descending inhibitory pain pathways in the brain and

spinal cord (Clark and Proudfit, 1993; Basbaum and Fields,
1984; Millan, 2002). In pathological pain states, these
endogenous pain inhibitory mechanisms may be dysfunctional, contributing to the central sensitization and
hyperexcitability of the spinal and supraspinal pain
transmitting pathways and manifesting as persistent pain
(Coderre and Katz, 1997).
Duloxetine hydrochloride (Cymbaltaw) is a selective
serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor that is
relatively balanced in its affinity for both serotonin and
norepinephrine reuptake inhibition. In a recent randomized,
controlled, 12-week trial comparing duloxetine 60 mg twice
a day (BID) with placebo in the treatment of fibromyalgia in
207 patients with and without major depressive disorder,
duloxetine was found to be an effective and safe treatment
for pain and many of the other symptoms associated with
fibromyalgia, particularly for women (Arnold et al., 2004).
The improvement in fibromyalgia symptoms with duloxetine compared with placebo was independent of comorbid
major depressive disorder. Duloxetine-treated male patients
did not respond significantly on any efficacy measure
compared with placebo-treated male patients. The reasons
for the gender difference were unclear, but may have been
due to the small male subgroup (23 of 207 patients (11%))
or to possible gender differences in fibromyalgia that affect
treatment response (Arnold et al., 2004).
Based on the evidence that duloxetine 60 mg BID was
safe and efficacious in the treatment of fibromyalgia,
particularly in women, we conducted a randomized,
placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel group study to
confirm the safety and efficacy of duloxetine 60 mg BID in
women with fibromyalgia. Because duloxetine was found to
significantly reduce painful physical symptoms associated
with major depressive disorder at 60 mg once a day (QD)
(Goldstein et al., 2004), we also tested the safety and
efficacy of this lower dose in fibromyalgia.
2. Methods
2.1. Overview
The multicenter study was conducted in 21 outpatient research
centers in the United States. Enrollment began in November 2002,
and the study was completed in October 2003. The Institutional
Review Boards approved the protocol, and all patients provided
written informed consent after the study was explained and their
questions answered, and before study procedures were initiated.
Patients were identified by physician referral or advertisement for a
fibromyalgia medication trial.
2.2. Entry criteria
Patients were eligible for the study if they were female
outpatients R18 years of age, met criteria for primary fibromyalgia
as defined by the American College of Rheumatology (Wolfe et al.,
1990), and had a score of R4 on the average pain severity item of
the Brief Pain Inventory (Cleeland and Ryan, 1994) at
randomization. Exclusion criteria included the following: pain
from traumatic injury or structural or regional rheumatic disease;
rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory arthritis, or autoimmune
disease; unstable medical or psychiatric illness; current primary
psychiatric diagnosis other than major depressive disorder, a
primary anxiety disorder within the past year (specific phobias
allowed); substance abuse within the past year; serious suicide risk;
pregnancy or breast-feeding; women who, in the opinion of the
investigator, were treatment refractory or may have had an
involvement in disability reviews that might compromise
treatment response; severe allergic reactions to multiple medications; or prior participation in a study of duloxetine.
Concomitant medication exclusions included use of medications
or herbal agents with central nervous system activity; regular use
of analgesics with the exception of acetaminophen up to 2 g/day
and aspirin for cardiac prophylaxis up to 325 mg/day; chronic use
of sedatives, antiemetics, or antispasmodics; and initiation of or
change in unconventional or alternative therapies.
2.3. Study design
Women who met entry criteria following the screening phase
were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups:
duloxetine 60 mg QD, duloxetine 60 mg BID (forced titration
from 60 mg QD for 3 days to 60 mg BID), or placebo, with
randomization in a 1:1:1 ratio. Random assignment of the patients
to treatment groups was applied within two stratified groups, those
with and those without current major depressive disorder. Patients
were treated in a double-blind manner for 12 weeks. Patients were
seen weekly for the first 2 weeks of the 12-week therapy phase;
thereafter, study visits were scheduled at 2-week intervals. Patients
then entered into a 1-week double-blind study-drug tapering phase
at which time dosage of study drug was reduced to duloxetine
30 mg QD for duloxetine 60 mg QD-treated patients, and
duloxetine 60 mg QD for duloxetine 60 mg BID-treated patients.
2.4. Outcome measures
The protocol-defined primary outcome measure was pain
severity as measured by the self-reported Brief Pain Inventory
(short form) (Cleeland and Ryan, 1994) average pain severity score
that measures average pain severity during the past 24 h on a scale
from 0 (no pain) to 10 (pain as bad as you can imagine). Secondary
outcome measures included the Brief Pain Inventory items for
severity of worst pain and least pain during the past 24 h, pain right
now, and pain interference (from 0 (does not interfere) to 10
(completely interferes)) with general activity, mood, walking
ability, normal work, relations with other people, sleep, and
enjoyment of life. Response to treatment was defined as R30%
reduction in the Brief Pain Inventory 24-h average pain severity
score. Sustained response was defined as R30% reduction from
baseline to endpoint in the Brief Pain Inventory 24-h average pain
severity with a 30% reduction from baseline at a week at least 2
weeks prior to the last, and with at least a 20% reduction from
baseline at every week in between. Other secondary efficacy
measures included the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire, a selfadministered questionnaire that measures components of health
status most affected by fibromyalgia over the past week
(Burckhardt et al., 1991). The total score, which reflected the
6 L.M. Arnold et al. / Pain 119 (2005) 5–15
impact of fibromyalgia, ranged from 0 (no impact) to 80 (maximum
impact). For the tender point assessment, the Fischer dolorimeter
(Fischer, 1986) with a rubber disk of 1 cm2 was applied at a 908
vertical angle to the 18 tender point sites defined by the American
College of Rheumatology criteria (Wolfe et al., 1990), and
pressure was applied at a rate of 1 kg/cm2
/s until the patient
indicated verbally when she first felt discomfort or pain (tender
point threshold recorded in kg/cm2
). The mean tender point pain
threshold was calculated from the 18 points, and the tender point
count was determined by the number of tender points that had a
threshold of %4 kg/cm2
. Other measures included the Clinical
Global Impression of Severity scale, ranging from 1 (normal, not at
all ill) to 7 (among the most extremely ill patients) (Guy, 1976), the
Patient Global Impression of Improvement scale, ranging from 1
(very much better) to 7 (very much worse), and the clinician-rated,
17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (score range 0 (not at
all depressed)–52 (severely depressed)) (Hamilton, 1960). Patientreported health outcomes were measured by the Quality of Life in
Depression Scale (McKenna and Hunt, 1992), the Medical
Outcomes Study Short Form 36 (SF-36) (Ware et al., 1993), and
the Sheehan Disability Scale (Sheehan et al., 1996). The safety of
duloxetine was assessed by treatment-emergent adverse events,
discontinuation pattern, laboratory analysis, and vital signs.
2.5. Statistical analysis
This study required the enrollment of 345 patients to have at
least 80% power to detect a treatment group difference of K1.2
points in the baseline-to-endpoint mean change on Brief Pain
Inventory average pain severity score between duloxetine 60 BID
and placebo. The sample size was determined using a two-sided
test with aZ0.05, assuming a common standard deviation of 2.66
and a discontinuation rate of 30%. The Brief Pain Inventory
average pain severity score was chosen a priori as the primary
outcome measure to test the efficacy of duloxetine in the treatment
of pain associated with fibromyalgia, and thus the Type 1 error was
controlled at the significance level of 0.05 for the analysis of this
variable. The purpose of collecting several secondary efficacy
measures was to confirm the findings on the primary measure using
different instruments. A multiplicity adjustment was not performed
for the secondary measures because it was not the intent of the
study to assess the secondary measures at the same experimental
significance level as was established for the primary variable.
All randomized patients with a baseline and at least one
post-baseline visit with efficacy data were included in the
efficacy analyses, while all randomized patients were included
in the safety analyses. Changes from baseline to endpoint on
the Brief Pain Inventory average pain severity score, and the
other efficacy measures were analyzed primarily by an analysis
of covariance (ANCOVA) model with the terms of treatment,
investigator, and baseline score. Furthermore, for the Brief Pain
Inventory average pain severity score, the area under the curve
of improvement scores (postbaseline minus baseline) over visit
intervals was evaluated. The greater the area under the curve,
the greater the treatment effect on pain reduction over time.
Due to the skewed distribution of the area under the curve,
rank-transformed area under the curve scores were analyzed
using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) model with the terms
of treatment and investigator. As a secondary analysis,
longitudinal changes from baseline on continuous efficacy
measures were analyzed using a mixed-effects model for
repeated measures analysis (Mallinckrodt et al., 2001). The
model included the fixed, categorical effects of treatment,
investigator, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction, as well as
the continuous, fixed covariates of baseline and baseline-by-visit
interaction. The hypothesis that major depressive disorder status
at baseline might have an impact on the response to duloxetine
treatment was tested using an ANCOVA model as described
earlier, with the addition of the major depressive disorder status
at baseline and the treatment-by-subgroup interaction.
Path analysis (Retherford and Choe, 1993; Lu, 2003) was used
to test the direct treatment effect on pain reduction. In this analysis,
two regression models were employed to describe the following
protocol-specified causal relationships: first, the treatment has an
effect on pain reduction (direct effect) after accounting for the
indirect effect through improvement of depressive symptoms
(Model 1); second, the treatment improves depressive symptoms
(Model 2). The significance of the direct treatment effect was
tested by Student’s t-test for the treatment coefficient in Model 1,
where change in the Brief Pain Inventory average pain severity
score was a dependent variable, and treatment, baseline,
investigator, and changes in the Hamilton Depression Rating
Scale total score were independent variables. In Model 2, the
change in the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale total score was a
dependent variable, and the treatment and baseline were used as
independent variables. The indirect treatment effect was computed
as the product of the coefficient for change in Hamilton Depression
Rating Scale total score in Model 1 by the coefficient for the term
of treatment in Model 2. The percentage of direct and indirect
effects on the total treatment effect (the sum of the direct and the
indirect effect) was computed and presented.
For categorical variables, treatment group differences were
evaluated using Fisher’s exact test. Continuous baseline measures
and safety parameters were evaluated using the ANOVA model
with the terms of treatment and investigator. Laboratory values
were rank-transformed prior to analysis. Treatment effects were
tested at a two-sided significance level of 0.05. Interaction effects
were tested at a significance level of 0.10. Throughout this article,
the term ‘significant’ indicates statistical significance, and the
‘mean change’ refers to ‘least-squares mean change’.
3. Results
3.1. Patient disposition
A total of 745 women were screened to enroll 354
women who met the entry criteria and were randomly
assigned to one of three treatment groups: duloxetine 60 mg
QD, duloxetine 60 mg BID, or placebo. One hundred
eighteen patients received duloxetine 60 mg QD, 116
patients received duloxetine 60 mg BID, and 120 patients
received placebo. One hundred thirty-eight (39%) patients
withdrew during the 12-week therapy phase, 41 (35%) from
the duloxetine 60 mg QD group, 45 (39%) from the
duloxetine 60 mg BID group, and 52 (43%) from the
placebo group (PZ0.407) (Fig. 1). Significant differences
were seen in rates of patients discontinuing due to adverse
events (duloxetine 60 mg QD, 25 (21.2%, PZ0.055 vs.
L.M. Arnold et al. / Pain 119 (2005) 5–15 7
placebo), duloxetine 60 mg BID, 27 (23.3%, PZ0.025 vs.
placebo), placebo 14 (11.7%)); lack of efficacy (duloxetine
60 mg QD, 7 (5.9%, PZ0.033 vs. placebo), duloxetine
60 mg BID, 4 (3.4%, PZ0.003 vs. placebo), placebo 18
(15.0%)); and withdrawal of informed consent (duloxetine
60 mg QD, 1 (0.8%, PZ0.001 vs. placebo), duloxetine
60 mg BID, 4 (3.4%, PZ0.042 vs. placebo), placebo 13
(10.8%)).
3.2. Baseline clinical and demographic characteristics
The majority of the patients were Caucasian (89.5%),
followed by Hispanic (8.2%), African descent (2.0%) and
East/Southeast Asian (0.3%). The mean (SD) age of the
enrolled patients was 49.6 (10.9) and 26% of the enrolled
patients had current major depressive disorder. No
significant differences among treatment groups were
observed in any of the patient demographics or clinical
characteristics including origin, age, gender, height, weight,
primary diagnoses of major depressive disorder, or
secondary diagnosis of anxiety. No significant differences
among treatment groups were observed for the baseline
clinical variables (Table 1) or for baseline scores on the
SF-36, Quality of Life in Depression Scale, or Sheehan
disability Scale (Table S1 in Appendix).
3.3. Efficacy
The changes in the Brief Pain Inventory average pain
severity score over time are illustrated in Fig. 2. Compared
with the placebo group, the duloxetine 60 mg QD group and
the duloxetine 60 mg BID group had a significantly greater
improvement in the Brief Pain Inventory average pain
severity score, beginning at week 1 and continuing through
week 12. There were no significant differences in pairwise
comparisons between duloxetine 60 mg QD and 60 mg
BID. When comparing the area under the curves on the
Brief Pain Inventory average pain severity score, both
duloxetine 60 mg QD (mean of area under the curveZ152.2
(medianZ122.0)) and duloxetine 60 mg BID (mean of area
under the curveZ160.5 (medianZ139.5)) were statistically
superior (P!0.001) to placebo (mean of area under the
curveZ79.8 (medianZ61.25)). An analysis of the changes
in the Brief Pain Inventory average pain severity score in
patients who completed the study demonstrated results
similar to those observed in the intent-to-treat analysis.

Compared with patients on placebo who completed the
study, those who completed the study on duloxetine 60 mg
QD had a significant (P!0.001) improvement in the Brief
Pain Inventory average pain severity score (difference,
K1.44 (95% CI:K2.16, K0.72)), and patients who
completed the study on duloxetine 60 mg BID also had a
significant (P!0.001) improvement in the Brief Pain
Inventory average pain severity score (difference, K1.31
(K2.05, K0.58)). There were no significant differences in
pairwise comparisons between duloxetine 60 mg QD and
duloxetine 60 mg BID in patients who completed the study.
The changes in the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire
total score over time are illustrated in Fig. 3. Significant
treatment-group differences between placebo and both
duloxetine 60 mg QD and duloxetine 60 mg BID were
observed beginning 1 week after randomization and
continuing through week 12. There were no significant
differences in pairwise comparisons between duloxetine
60 mg QD and duloxetine 60 mg BID.
Duloxetine 60 mg QD was statistically superior to
placebo on all other secondary efficacy measures except
for the mean tender point pain threshold and number of
tender points with a low threshold. Duloxetine 60 mg BID
was statistically superior to placebo on all secondary
measures except for Hamilton Depression Rating Scale
score (Table 2). There were no significant differences
between duloxetine 60 mg BID and duloxetine 60 mg QD.
The repeated measure analyses demonstrated results similar
to those observed in the mean change analyses.
Analysis of the Brief Pain Inventory average pain
severity score response rates (defined as R30% reduction
from baseline to endpoint) revealed significant differences
for both duloxetine 60 mg QD (55% (64/116); P!0.001)
and duloxetine 60 mg BID (54% (61/114); PZ0.002)
compared with placebo (33% (39/118)). The 50% response
rate at endpoint in the Brief Pain Inventory average pain
severity score revealed significant differences for both
duloxetine 60 mg QD (41% (48/116); PZ0.003) and

duloxetine 60 mg BID (41% (47/114); PZ0.003) compared
with placebo (23% (27/118)). Analysis of the Brief Pain
Inventory average pain severity score sustained response
showed that significantly more patients achieved sustained
response over time on both duloxetine 60 mg QD (44%) and
60 mg BID (43%) doses compared with placebo (19%) (P!
0.001 vs. both duloxetine doses). No treatment-by-major
depressive disorder interaction was observed for the primary
efficacy measure (PZ0.294) (Brief Pain Inventory average
pain severity score), suggesting that the effect of duloxetine
on reduction of pain was similar in patients with or without
major depressive disorder.
The path analysis for the Brief Pain Inventory average
pain severity score showed that, for both duloxetine
treatment groups, the direct treatment effect of duloxetine
on pain accounted for the major portion of the total effect.
The direct effect of duloxetine 60 mg QD on the reduction
of the Brief Pain Inventory average pain severity score
accounted for 75.6% of the total treatment effect (PZ
0.006); the indirect treatment effect through improvement in
depressive symptoms accounted for 24.4% of the total
treatment effect. The direct effect of duloxetine 60 mg BID
on the reduction of the Brief Pain Inventory average pain
severity score accounted for 86.9% of the total treatment
effect (PZ0.0007); the indirect treatment effect through
improvement in depressive symptoms accounted for only
13.1% of the total treatment effect. In the subgroup that was
defined by diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD),
patients with a current diagnosis of MDD (NZ91)
demonstrated significant differences between duloxetine
treatment groups and placebo (PZ0.005 for duloxetine 60
QD, PZ0.003 for duloxetine 60 BID) on reduction in Brief
Pain Inventory average pain severity score. Patients without
a current diagnosis of MDD (NZ257) also demonstrated
significant differences between duloxetine treatment groups
and placebo (PZ0.004 for duloxetine 60 QD, PZ0.005 for
duloxetine 60 BID) on reduction in Brief Pain Inventory
average pain severity score. There was no significant
therapy-by-subgroup interaction observed (PZ0.294).
3.4. Health outcomes
Both duloxetine treatment groups were significantly
superior to placebo on several SF-36 subscales, including
the mental subscore, bodily pain, mental health, role limit
emotional, role limit physical, and vitality, as well as the
Quality of Life in Depression total score, and the Sheehan
Disability Scale total score and subscores for work, social
life, and family life. In addition, duloxetine 60 mg QD was
superior to placebo on the SF-36 subscale of social function
and duloxetine 60 mg BID was superior to placebo on the
SF-36 subscale of physical functioning (Table S2 in
Appendix).
3.5. Safety
Of the 354 randomly assigned patients, 95 placebotreated (79.2%), 109 duloxetine 60 mg QD-treated (92.4%;
PZ0.005 vs. placebo), and 105 duloxetine 60 mg BIDtreated (90.5%; PZ0.018 vs. placebo) patients reported at
least one treatment-emergent adverse event. Patients in the
duloxetine 60 mg QD and 60 mg BID groups reported
nausea, dry mouth, constipation, decreased appetite and
anorexia significantly more frequently than did placebotreated patients (Fig. 4). Additionally, diarrhea and
nasopharyngitis were reported by patients treated with
Fig. 3. Least-squares (LS) mean change from baseline in the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) total score for all randomized patients. Duloxetine

duloxetine 60 mg QD significantly more frequently than
patients treated with placebo. Somnolence, increased
sweating, feeling jittery, and nervousness were reported
significantly more frequently by patients on duloxetine
60 mg BID compared with placebo-treated patients. There
were no significant treatment group differences in the
percentage of serious treatment-emergent adverse events
(SAE). During the study, one (0.9%) duloxetine 60 mg BIDtreated patient experienced a SAE of appendicitis, and one
(0.8%) duloxetine 60 mg QD-treated patient experienced a
SAE of blood creatine phosphokinase increase and a hepatic
enzyme increase. A total of 66 patients discontinued during
the therapy phase due to adverse events, with significant
differences between duloxetine 60 mg BID- and placebotreated groups (PZ0.025) (duloxetine 60 mg QD, 25
(21.2%); duloxetine 60 mg BID, 27 (23.3%); placebo 14
(11.7%)). Sixty-four percent of all patients who discontinued due to adverse events did so during the first 4 weeks
of the study.
Compared with placebo-treated patients, both duloxetine 60 mg BID- and duloxetine 60 mg QD-treated
patients experienced a slight, but significant, mean
increase in alkaline phosphatase and a mean decrease in
chloride. These mean differences were within normal
reference ranges and were not considered clinically
relevant. There was a slight but significant mean decrease
in weight from baseline to endpoint for duloxetine 60 mg
QD- (mean change (SD) (kg): K0.29 (2.46); PZ0.036)
and 60 mg BID- (mean change (SD): K0.44 (2.67); PZ
0.009) compared with placebo (mean change (SD): 0.38
(2.19)). There were no statistically significant treatment
group differences in mean change of heart rate. For
systolic and diastolic blood pressure, there was a
significant difference between the duloxetine 60 mg BID
and placebo groups (PZ0.03 for both measures), with
placebo-treated patients experiencing a decrease in
systolic (mean change (SD): K1.57 (12.61)) and diastolic
(mean change (SD): K1.23 (8.80)) blood pressure, and
duloxetine 60 mg BID-treated patients experiencing an
increase in systolic (mean change (SD): 1.32 (14.03)) and
diastolic blood pressure (mean change (SD): 1.32 (8.95)).
These changes were not considered clinically relevant.
Two patients (one patient randomized to placebo, and one
patient randomized to duloxetine 60 mg BID) experienced
sustained elevation of blood pressure, but the treatment
group differences were not significant (defined as a sitting
diastolic blood pressure R90 mmHg and an increase
from baseline of at least 10 mmHg, or sitting systolic
blood pressure R140 mmHg and an increase from
baseline of at least 10 mmHg, for 3 consecutive visits).
Among patients who continued in the 1-week studydrug tapering phase (nZ220), 61 (27.7%) patients
reported at least one discontinuation-emergent adverse
event: 22 (30.6%) duloxetine 60 BID-treated patients, 30
(38%) duloxetine 60 mg QD-treated patients, and 9
(13%) placebo-treated patients (PZ0.002). A significant
treatment-group difference was observed for insomnia
(PZ0.019), with a greater number of duloxetine 60 mg
QD-treated patients reporting insomnia during discontinuation compared with placebo-treated patients (PZ
0.03). In duloxetine 60 mg QD-treated patients, the
discontinuation-emergent adverse events reported by
R2% of patients included dizziness, insomnia, headache,
myalgia, nausea, diarrhea, abnormal dreams, depression,
anxiety, and emotional disorder. In duloxetine 60 mg
BID-treated patients, the discontinuation-emergent
adverse events reported by R2% of patients included
dizziness, nausea, headache, diarrhea, fatigue, myalgia,
abnormal dreams, depression, arthralgia, and edema
peripheral.

4. Discussion
In this randomized, double-blind, 12-week trial, duloxetine 60 mg QD and 60 mg BID had significantly greater
efficacy than placebo on most outcome measures in the
treatment of women with American College of Rheumatology-defined primary fibromyalgia. Compared with placebo,
both doses of duloxetine significantly reduced pain, as
measured by the primary efficacy measure (Brief Pain
Inventory average pain severity score) beginning in the first
week of treatment and continuing throughout the 12 weeks
of therapy. Response rates demonstrated greater pain
reduction for both duloxetine groups compared with
placebo, and patients in the duloxetine groups were more
likely to achieve a sustained response over time. In addition,
the improvement in fibromyalgia symptoms with both doses
of duloxetine compared with placebo was independent of
the presence or absence of major depressive disorder.
Twenty-six percent of the patients had current major
depressive disorder, which is consistent with community
samples of adults with fibromyalgia in which about one
third report major current problems with depression (White
et al., 2002). The results of the present study, suggest that
duloxetine is efficacious in fibromyalgia patients with or
without current depression. Duloxetine also demonstrated a
direct effect on pain reduction that was significantly greater
than the indirect effect attributed to improvement in
depressive symptoms. Therefore, the effect of duloxetine
on reduction of pain associated with fibromyalgia appears to
be independent of its effect on mood. Although the
pathophysiology of fibromyalgia is unknown, duloxetine, a
potent selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake
inhibitor, may correct a functional deficit of serotonin and
norepinephrine neurotransmission. Abnormalities of monoaminergic neurotransmission may be shared between major
depressive disorder and fibromyalgia, but the independent
effects of duloxetine on reduction in pain suggest that pain
modulating effects in spinal and supraspinal pathways are
not dependent on modulation of mood. Indeed, human
experimental studies suggest that there is a complex
relationship between pain and depression (Schreiber et al.,
2003; Gormsen et al., 2004).
These results confirm findings from the previous study
comparing duloxetine to placebo in the treatment of
fibromyalgia patients with or without major depressive
disorder (Arnold et al., 2004). In the present study, in which
two doses of duloxetine were evaluated, there were no
significant differences between the duloxetine 60 mg QD
and duloxetine 60 mg BID treatment groups in efficacy
outcomes. However, only the duloxetine 60 mg BID dose,
compared with placebo, significantly improved the tender
point assessments. These results are consistent with the
previous study of duloxetine in fibromyalgia in which
duloxetine 60 mg BID significantly improved the tender
point measures compared with placebo (Arnold et al.,
2004). A higher dosage of duloxetine might therefore be
necessary to significantly improve tenderness, one of the
common features of fibromyalgia. Previous fibromyalgia
studies using tricyclic antidepressants found minimal
improvement in tender point measures (Arnold et al.,
2000; O’Malley et al., 2000), suggesting that tender points
are less responsive to treatment. The dolorimeter method of
tender point assessment used in the present study and in the
previous trial of duloxetine (Arnold et al., 2004) offers
promise as a more reliable technique than manual
assessments for monitoring change over time. However, a
definition of a clinically meaningful response in tender point
counts and pressure pain thresholds as measured by the
dolorimeter has yet to be established (Arnold, 2005). Both
doses of duloxetine were well tolerated by most patients and
safely administered. Significantly more duloxetine-treated
patients than placebo-treated patients reported treatmentemergent adverse events, but these events were generally
mild to moderate in severity. Clinical laboratory assessments, vital signs, and physical findings were stable relative
to baseline and no clinically relevant differences were
detected between treatment groups.
Significantly more patients in the duloxetine 60 mg BID
group than the placebo group discontinued treatment due to
adverse events. These findings differ from the previous trial
of duloxetine 60 mg BID in the treatment of fibromyalgia, in
which there were no differences between treatment groups
in discontinuation due to treatment-emergent adverse events
(Arnold et al., 2004). Notably, most patients in the present
study who discontinued due to adverse events did so within
the first 4 weeks of the study. Therefore, the difference
between the studies might be explained by the slower
titration of duloxetine in the previous study, in which
patients were started on duloxetine 20 mg QD and underwent titration to 60 mg BID over 2 weeks. By contrast,
patients in the present study were started on 60 mg QD and
underwent titration to 60 mg BID over just 3 days. These
results suggest that some patients would have better
tolerability with a lower duloxetine starting dose and slower
titration. The present study also included a 1-week
discontinuation phase in which significantly more duloxetine-treated patients reported discontinuation-emergent
adverse events, most commonly dizziness, than placebotreated patients. Tapering the duloxetine dose at the end of
therapy is recommended.
Several limitations of this study should be considered.
First, the results are based on an acute treatment trial of 12
weeks, and the results may not generalize to a longer
duration of treatment. Furthermore, about 38% of all
patients did not complete the study. Future studies should
evaluate the long-term efficacy of duloxetine in fibromyalgia, a chronic condition that will likely require treatment for
more than 3 months. Second, the results of this study may
not generalize to individuals with certain forms of
psychopathology or secondary fibromyalgia, because
patients with these conditions were excluded from the
study. Third, this study included only women because it was
L.M. Arnold et al. / Pain 119 (2005) 5–15 13
designed to confirm the results from the previous duloxetine
fibromyalgia trial in which duloxetine-treated women, but
not duloxetine-treated men responded significantly more
than same sex placebo-treated patients on efficacy measures
(Arnold et al., 2004). Therefore, the results of this study
cannot be generalized to men. Studies that include men with
fibromyalgia are planned to reexamine the efficacy of
duloxetine in men. Finally, this study did not include an
active comparator, because it was intended to confirm and
extend previous findings of the efficacy of duloxetine
compared with placebo in the treatment of fibromyalgia
(Arnold et al., 2004). Future studies should compare the
efficacy of duloxetine with other medications, such as
tricyclic antidepressants that inhibit both serotonin and
norepinephrine and have a consistent, moderate efficacy in
fibromyalgia (Arnold et al., 2000).
In summary, this randomized, placebo-controlled study
provides substantial evidence and confirms previous
findings that treatment with duloxetine 60 mg BID for up
to 12 weeks is safe and effective in the treatment of
fibromyalgia in women with or without major depressive
disorder. In addition, this study provides evidence that
duloxetine at the lower dose of 60 mg QD is also safe and
effective in these patients.
