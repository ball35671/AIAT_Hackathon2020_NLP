Abstract
Objective:
Painful physical symptoms are common in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and can negatively
affect patient outcomes. Duloxetine has demonstrated efficacy in treating MDD and other certain painful
conditions; this study specifically evaluated patients with both MDD and MDD-associated pain.
Methods:
This randomized, double-blind clinical trial enrolled adult outpatients with MDD (DSM-IV-TR criteria;
Montgomery–A˚sberg Depression Rating Scale [MADRS] total score
20) and at least moderate pain
(Brief Pain Inventory, Short Form [BPI] average pain rating
3). Patients received placebo (
N
¼ 266) or
duloxetine (
N
¼ 261) 60 mg once daily (QD) (after starting dose of 30 mg QD for 1 week). This study
replicated another study evaluating MDD and MDD-associated pain.
Clinical trial registration: Clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01070329).
Main outcome measures:
Co-primary outcomes were the MADRS total score (change from baseline at 8 week endpoint) and BPI
average pain rating (overall main effect over 8 weeks of treatment). The Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS)
global functional impairment score at week 8 assessed functioning as a secondary outcome. Changes were
analyzed using mixed-effects model repeated measures (MMRM), and the MADRS remission rate (total
score
12 at 8-week endpoint) was analyzed using the Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel test.
Results:
Both co-primary objectives and the first two gated secondary objectives were achieved: compared with
placebo, duloxetine significantly improved the mean MADRS total score, BPI average pain rating, SDS global
functional impairment score, and remission of depression at 8-week endpoint (all
p
50.01). The third gated
secondary objective, evaluating remission of depression at the last two non-missing visits, was not achieved.
The within-group MADRS remission rate was greater for duloxetine-treated patients with
50% (versus
550%) improvement in BPI average pain (
p
50.001). Safety outcomes were similar to previous reports.
This study did not address the effects of duloxetine on MDD and comorbid pain of a known origin.
Conclusions:
These results replicated findings supporting the efficacy and tolerability of duloxetine compared to placebo
as treatment for depression and pain in patients with MDD and at least moderate pain associated with MDD.

Introduction
Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) frequently
exhibit both emotional and painful physical symptoms1–3
that have been linked with poorer clinical outcomes4,5.
Duloxetine, a serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake
inhibitor, is approved for the treatment of MDD and for
generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and also for the management of painful conditions, including diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia, and chronic
musculoskeletal pain in patients with chronic low back
pain and chronic pain due to osteoarthritis6
.
While many previous studies of duloxetine as treatment
for MDD measured pain improvement as an outcome, pain
severity was not generally included in the study entry criteria. Not including results presented in Gaynor et al.7 and
this brief report, there have been two prior randomized,
placebo-controlled trials that examined the efficacy of
duloxetine in the treatment of MDD in patients with a
pre-specified severity of associated pain at baseline8,9.
Because these studies produced dissimilar results, further
study was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of duloxetine
in treating the painful physical symptoms associated with
MDD specifically in patients with MDD and at least moderate pain at baseline. Specifically, two additional clinical
studies were designed and executed. The current report
presents results of the study designed to replicate
Gaynor et al.7
.
Patients and methods
Design and participants
All methods in the current study were the same as Gaynor
et al.7 with one exception: the first study was conducted in
the United States and Europe while the current study was
conducted in the United States and Puerto Rico. This
multicenter, phase 4, 8-week, randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled, parallel group study was conducted
at 37 study sites in the United States and Puerto Rico
between March 2010 and March 2011. Briefly, a screening
period (5 to 30 days) was followed by an 8-week doubleblind acute treatment phase and an optional 2-week taper
period. Adult (18 years of age) male or female outpatients with a current episode of MDD (Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition–
Text Revision [DSM-IV-TR] criteria and confirmed by the
Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview, with a history of at least one previous episode of depression; and
at both the screening and randomization visits, a
Montgomery–A˚ sberg Depression Rating Scale [MADRS]
total score of 20) and at least moderate pain (score of 3
on the Brief Pain Inventory–Short Form [BPI] average
pain rating) and a Clinical Global Impression of Severity
(CGI-S) score 4 were eligible for the study. For a list of
key inclusion/exclusion criteria as well as key restrictions
regarding concomitant medication usage, see Gaynor
et al.7
. Study participants were randomized (1:1 ratio) to
an oral dose of duloxetine 60 mg once daily (QD) or placebo QD; patients assigned to duloxetine 60 mg QD
started on duloxetine 30 mg QD for 1 week and then
titrated up to duloxetine 60 mg QD for 7 weeks.
The protocol was approved by study center Ethical
Review Boards. Patients provided written informed consent before participating and after being fully informed
regarding the nature of the procedures involved. The
study was conducted in accordance with regulatory standards of Good Clinical Practice and the Declaration of
Helsinki (1996) and all applicable local regulations. The
trial is registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01070329).
Primary outcome measures
The co-primary efficacy measures of this study were the
overall mean change from baseline in the BPI average pain
rating through 8 weeks (overall main effect of treatment)
and the mean change in the MADRS total score from
baseline at 8 weeks. The short form of the BPI10 is a
patient-rated, Likert-type scale that measures the severity
of pain (4 items) and the interference of pain on function
(7 items). Items are scored from 0 (no pain/does not interfere) to 10 (pain as severe as you can imagine/completely
interferes). The MADRS11, a depression rating scale
designed to be particularly sensitive to change in patients
treated with antidepressant medication, was administered
by appropriately trained site personnel. The scale includes
10 items focusing on core symptoms of depressive illness,
scored from 0 to 6, with a maximum total score of 60. The
primary efficacy measure was calculated as the sum of 10
MADRS items. Reductions in score over time are interpreted as improvement in the patient’s status.
Secondary outcome measures
A gatekeeper strategy12 was employed for sequentially testing five gated secondary measures, as further described in
the statistical analyses section below. Functioning was
assessed using the mean change from baseline at the
8-week endpoint in the Sheehan Disability Scale
(SDS)13 global functional impairment score. The SDS is
a widely used and well validated patient-rated scale that
measures the extent to which emotional symptoms disrupt
patient functioning in three life domains (work/school
work, social life/leisure activities, family life/home responsibilities) on a scale of 0 (not at all) to 10 (extremely)13.
Scores of 5 and above in any functional domain indicate
significant functional impairment14. The global functional
impairment score is the sum of three life domains13.

Remission of MDD was defined as a MADRS total score of
12 at the 8-week endpoint. In order to assess improvement in depression for duloxetine versus placebo for an
extended period of time, remission defined as a MADRS
total score of 12 at the last two non-missing study visits
was also evaluated. The MADRS total score mean changes
from baseline to week 4 and to week 2 were included as
gated secondary outcome measures.
Other non-gated a priori defined secondary measures
included the Patient Global Impression of Improvement
(PGI-I) scale14. Also, a related physician-administered
scale, the CGI-S14 was used to assess severity of depression.
The relationship between improvement in pain and
improvement in MDD was evaluated by assessing remission of depressive symptoms (defined as a MADRS total
score of 12 at the 8-week endpoint) for patients reporting
reduction in pain (as measured by change in BPI average
pain rating from baseline to the 8-week endpoint) of at
least 30% and at least 50%. The 30% cutoff was based on a
report by Farrar et al.15 assessing studies of several painful
conditions, which found that improvements in pain of at
least 30% were associated with PGI-I ratings of ‘much
improved’ or ‘very much improved’. The 50% cutoff,
which is an even more stringent definition of improvement, was also considered by the authors to reflect a
highly meaningful improvement.
The CGI-S rating was recorded at baseline visits only
(Visits 1 and 2). The PGI-I rating was recorded at all postbaseline visits. All other measures were collected at every
study visit.
Safety measures included the occurrence of treatmentemergent adverse events (TEAEs) and serious adverse
events (SAEs), rates and reasons for early discontinuation,
vital signs, laboratory assessments, and suicide-related
events (behavior and/or ideation) as assessed by the
Columbia–Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS)16.
Statistical analyses
Statistical methods are presented in detail in Gaynor
et al.7
. Briefly, the primary method of analysis for both
co-primary efficacy measures was the mixed-effects
model repeated measures (MMRM) approach. The
models included the fixed, categorical effects of treatment,
investigator, visit, and treatment by-visit interaction, as
well as the continuous, fixed covariates of baseline score
and baseline score-by-visit interaction. An unstructured
(co)variance structure was used to model the withinpatient errors. The overall main effect of treatment for
the BPI average pain rating and the contrast between
treatments at the 8-week endpoint for the MADRS total
score were pre-specified as primary evidence of efficacy for
the comparison between duloxetine 60 mg QD and
placebo.
As a sensitivity analysis, mean change from baseline at
the 8-week endpoint for MADRS total score was analyzed
using a last-observation-carried-forward (LOCF) approach
and a fixed-effects analysis of covariance (ANCOVA)
model that included treatment, investigator, and
baseline score.
In order to control for experiment-wise type I error
during multiple comparisons, a gatekeeper strategy was
employed for sequential testing of five gated secondary
hypotheses that duloxetine 60 mg QD was superior to placebo QD. Testing for statistical significance stopped when
a hypothesis failed to show statistical significance favoring
duloxetine (p40.05)12. The five gated secondary measures assessed using the gatekeeper strategy were the following (in order of testing): (1) the SDS global functional
impairment score, assessed as mean change from baseline
at 8-week endpoint; (2) remission defined as the percentage of patients with MADRS total score 12 at the 8-week
endpoint; (3) remission defined as the percentage of
patients with MADRS total score 12 at the last two
non-missing acute study visits; (4) MADRS total score
mean change from baseline to week 4; and (5) MADRS
total score mean change from baseline to week 2. The SDS
global functional impairment score was analyzed using the
same approach (MMRM) as that employed for the co-primary measures. Remission rates and BPI response rates
(proportion of patients with at least 30% or 50% reductions in average pain score) were analyzed using a LOCF
approach and the Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel test with
stratification by investigator. The differences between
treatments at week 4 and at week 2, using the same
MMRM model employed for the primary measure
(MADRS total score at week 8), served as the evidence
of efficacy for the comparison between treatments for the
gated secondary objectives 4 and 5.
For other a priori analyses described, the experimentwise type I error rate was not controlled. BPI pain severity
(e.g. worst pain, least pain, pain right now) and interference (all) item scores were analyzed using the same
MMRM approach as that described above for the BPI average pain rating. The SDS individual item scores were analyzed using the same MMRM approach as the primary
analysis for MADRS total score. Remission rate defined
as a MADRS total score of 12 at the 8-week endpoint
was compared between subgroups of patients taking duloxetine who either had, or did not have, at least a 30% or a
50% improvement in BPI average pain rating at the
8-week endpoint using the Cochran-Mantel–Haenszel
test with stratification by investigator. BPI response rates
(proportion of patients with at least 30% or 50% reduction
in BPI average pain rating) were analyzed using a LOCF
approach and the Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel test with
stratification by investigator. The percentage of patients
with each TEAE and the percentage of patients that discontinued due to adverse events (AEs) were analyzed using

Fisher’s exact test. The mean changes from baseline in
vital signs were analyzed using a LOCF approach and a
fixed-effects ANCOVA model that included investigator,
treatment and baseline. The mean changes from baseline
to the 8-week endpoint in laboratory measurements was
analyzed using an LOCF approach and the significance of
differences between treatment groups were assessed based
on rank-transformed data. Throughout this report the term
‘significant’ is used to refer to statistical significance
(p  0.05).
Results
Patient disposition
A total of 527 patients were randomly assigned to duloxetine (N ¼ 261) or placebo (N ¼ 266) treatment.
Completing the double-blind treatment period were 209
patients who received duloxetine treatment (80.1%) and
217 patients who received placebo (81.6%). Patient
disposition is reported in Figure 1. Reasons for discontinuation were not significantly different between the treatment groups.
Baseline characteristics
Baseline characteristics are presented in Table 1. The
mean age of randomized patients was 44.7 years, and
approximately 69% of patients were female. There
were no significant differences between treatment
groups in the patient demographic variables, the severity
of pain or interference of pain with functioning, severity of
depressive symptoms, or global functional impairment.
The treatment groups did not differ in their psychiatric
history as it related to number of previous episodes of
depression or to duration of the current episode of
depression.
Depression and related measures
Patients treated with duloxetine reported significantly
greater improvement (reduction) in depressive symptoms
as measured by MADRS total score from baseline at the
8-week endpoint as compared with placebo-treated
patients (14.96  0.58 versus 10.77  0.57 or 48.3%
versus 34.8% improvement from baseline, respectively,
p50.001). The mean change from baseline over 8 weeks
in MADRS total score is shown in Figure 2. The MADRS
total score from baseline at 8-week endpoint was also significantly greater for duloxetine versus placebo by LOCF
sensitivity analysis (13.75  9.16 and 9.78  9.21,
respectively, p  0.001).
For remission defined as a MADRS total score 12 at
8-week LOCF endpoint, a significantly higher percentage
of patients receiving duloxetine (n ¼ 95, 37.3%) versus
placebo (n ¼ 61, 23.0%) met the criteria (p50.001).
However, for remission defined as a MADRS total score
12 at the last two non-missing visits, the percentage of
duloxetine-treated patients who met the criteria (n ¼ 40,
15.7%) was not significantly different from the percentage
of placebo-treated patients (n ¼ 31, 11.7%) (p ¼ 0.173);
thus, this objective was not achieved.
Pain measures
The co-primary efficacy outcome of mean change from
baseline over 8 weeks (overall main effect of treatment)
for the BPI average pain rating (MMRM method) demonstrated a significantly greater improvement (reduction) for
patients treated with duloxetine (1.66  0.10) compared
to those treated with placebo (1.17  0.10) (p50.001).
Patients in the duloxetine and placebo groups reported
27.7% and 18.9% overall reductions in average pain
rating, respectively (p50.001). As shown in Figure 3,
patients treated with duloxetine also had greater improvement in their average pain rating at weeks 2, 4, and 8
compared with patients treated with placebo (all pvalues50.01). Further, greater improvements with duloxetine versus placebo were observed for the other pain
severity ratings (i.e., worst pain [p50.001], least pain
[p ¼ 0.003], pain right now [p50.001]), as well as ratings
of interference of pain with functioning (all p50.05),
across the 8-week treatment period (Table 2).
The proportion of patients reporting 50% or greater
improvement in BPI average pain rating at the 8-week
LOCF endpoint was 46.3% with duloxetine and 33.6%
with placebo (p ¼ 0.004), while 56.1% of duloxetinetreated patients and 46.0% of placebo patients experienced 30% or greater reductions in average pain rating
(p ¼ 0.022).

Remission of depressive symptoms by pain
improvement in duloxetine-treated patients
Duloxetine-treated patients who had at least 30% or 50%
improvement in BPI average pain rating at the 8-week
LOCF endpoint had rates of remission (MADRS 12
at the 8-week LOCF endpoint) that were higher
(both p  0.001) compared with those who did not achieve
30% or 50% improvement on the BPI average pain rating
(Figure 4). The remission rate for patients taking duloxetine who had at least a 30% improvement in BPI average
pain versus those who did not was 54.5% versus 15.2%;
thus remission rates were more than three times greater for
patients taking duloxetine who reported at least 30%
improvement in pain versus those who did not.

Other measures of symptoms and global
functioning
Overall symptom improvement was further assessed using
the PGI-I score recorded by patients. Compared to placebo-treated patients, the least squares (LS) mean PGI-I
score indicated greater improvements for duloxetinetreated patients at each individual study visit as well as
overall (p  0.01, MMRM approach). Ratings of
‘1 ¼ very much better’ or ‘2 ¼ much better’ were reported
by a greater percentage of patients in the duloxetine group
(53.3%) compared to placebo (26.8%) (p50.001).
For the SDS global functional impairment score, the
duloxetine treatment group demonstrated significantly
greater improvement from baseline at the 8-week endpoint
compared to placebo (46.4% versus 31.8% improvement
from baseline, respectively, p50.001). Also, improvements from baseline at the 8-week endpoint in the three
individual SDS items were greater with duloxetine versus
placebo (p50.001) (Table 3).
Per the rules of the gatekeeper strategy, testing for statistical significance stops once a hypothesis fails to show
statistical significance favoring duloxetine (p40.05).
Thus, the comparisons between duloxetine and placebo
in MADRS total score at week 4 and week 2 were not
evaluated.
Safety
Drug compliance (defined at each visit as 80% to 120% of
prescribed capsules were taken) was 87.5% for patients
receiving duloxetine (223/255) and 86.4% for patients
receiving placebo (229/265) (no significant betweengroup difference).
There was no significant difference between the duloxetine and placebo groups with regard to the percentage of
patients who discontinued due to TEAEs (5% and 3.8%,
respectively, p ¼ 0.529). There were no specific TEAEs
that led to differential discontinuation between treatment
groups. Depression was the most frequently reported TEAE
that led to study discontinuation (no patients in the duloxetine treatment group and four patients in the placebo
treatment group). The TEAEs that were reported in at
least 5% of duloxetine-treated patients and at least twice
the rate of placebo are shown in Table 4. Nausea
(p ¼ 0.002), somnolence (p ¼ 0.016), and diarrhea
(p ¼ 0.024) were reported significantly more often by
Table 2. BPI pain severity and interference scores: overall LS mean changes from baseline over 8-week treatment period (MMRM).

in 8 (3.1%) and 0 patients (0%; p ¼ 0.003), respectively.
SAEs during the double-blind treatment period were
reported by one patient in the duloxetine group (noncardiac chest pain) and three patients in the placebo
group (ankle fracture, gangrene, and suicidal ideation;
one report of each) (p ¼ 1.00). The SAE of non-cardiac
chest pain, reported by a patient in the duloxetine group,
was considered by the investigator to be related to study
drug. The SAE of suicidal ideation, reported by a patient in
the placebo group, was identified as a reason for study discontinuation and was not considered to be related to study
drug. No deaths occurred during the study.
With regard to vital signs (changes from baseline to
8-week LOCF endpoint), there were no significant
between-group differences in mean pulse rate (p ¼ 0.071)
or systolic blood pressure (p ¼ 0.063). Diastolic blood pressure increased significantly more in the duloxetine group
(1.86  0.46 mmHg) than in the placebo group
(0.05  0.45 mmHg) (p ¼ 0.004). Patients in the duloxetine group reported significantly greater weight loss
(0.66  0.14 kg) versus placebo-treated patients
(0.09  0.13 kg) (p ¼ 0.002). With regard to laboratory
values (LS mean change [standard error] from baseline to
LOCF endpoint), duloxetine-treated patients experienced
increased alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase
(ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and hemoglobin (1.27  0.72, p ¼ 0.001 compared to placebo; 2.38 

experienced a decrease in these analytes (1.21  0.70,
0.16  0.92, 0.58  1.05 and 0.01  0.02, respectively). Changes in chloride levels were significantly
greater among duloxetine-treated versus placebo-treated
patients (1.08  0.17 versus 0.46  0.16, p ¼ 0.014).
Changes in creatinine levels were significantly greater
among placebo-treated versus duloxetine-treated patients
(2.85  0.77 versus 0.49  0.80, p ¼ 0.01). Lastly, there
was no statistically significant difference between treatment groups for the number and percentage of patients
with suicide-related outcomes during treatment as measured by the C-SSRS.
Discussion
This study assessed the impact of duloxetine 60 mg QD on
depressive symptoms and associated painful physical symptoms in patients with MDD and with at least moderate
pain severity at the time of study entry. Both co-primary
objectives were positive, indicating that patients treated
with duloxetine had statistically significantly greater
improvement, compared with placebo, in depression as
measured by the MADRS total score (p50.001) and in
pain as measured by the BPI average pain rating
(p50.001) in this 8-week double-blind study. Compared
with placebo, patients receiving duloxetine also experienced significantly greater improvements in global functioning, based on change in the SDS global functional
impairment score from baseline at 8 weeks (p50.001),
and a significantly higher percentage of duloxetine-treated
patients met criteria for remission of depression (MADRS

total score 12) at the 8-week endpoint (p50.001), meeting the first two gated secondary objectives. However,
when remission was evaluated over the period of time represented by the last two non-missing visits (third gated
secondary objective), the treatment groups did not statistically separate.
With regard to non-gated secondary objectives, overall
reductions from baseline over the 8-week study were
greater for duloxetine versus placebo in each of the individual BPI items for pain severity (all p50.01) and painrelated interference in daily life (all p50.05).
Of note, duloxetine-treated patients with a 30% reduction in pain were greater than three-fold times more likely
to have remission of depressive symptoms than those without such a reduction. These findings are consistent with
those reported by Fava et al.4
, who found in a post-hoc
analysis that improvements in painful physical symptoms
were associated with higher rates of remission of depressive
symptoms, even after accounting for improvements in core
emotional symptoms.
Several study limitations should be noted. While duloxetine is approved for several chronic painful conditions in
patients without comorbid MDD (e.g. diabetic nerve pain,
chronic low back pain, osteoarthritis pain), patients with
MDD and pain of a known origin were specifically
excluded from the current study in order to focus on the
nonspecific pain commonly associated with MDD. As
such, these results cannot speak to the effects of duloxetine
on MDD or pain in patients with MDD and comorbid pain
of a known origin. This was a short-term study, and does
not address the efficacy of duloxetine for depression or
associated pain during longer-term treatment; further, as
a fixed-dose study, the results do not speak to other dosages
that might be used in clinical practice. Because duloxetine
was the only active drug evaluated in this study, the results
cannot be generalized to other antidepressants, and even
general comparison to other medications is made difficult
by the paucity of studies assessing treatment of both MDD
and associated painful physical symptoms.
While this study replicated most of the findings of
Gaynor et al.
7
, there were minor differences. These differences might have been the result of using different study
sites and different countries. In addition, pain identified
with depression is not well defined, which could lead to
some variability in patient selection or assessment, despite
use of the same protocol.
Finally, pain associated with depression is not clearly
defined in psychiatric nomenclature, and for this study was
determined via investigator assessment by ruling out pain
of a known origin in potential subjects. Thus, some of the
observed pre-existing pain conditions could potentially
have been associated with either pain associated with
depression (allowed) or with pain of a known origin (not
allowed) or both. The subjective nature of both depression
and pain is an ongoing issue in these types of studies, and
our attempts to control for it included randomization as
well as asking investigators to be thorough when ruling out
pain of other known origins.
Conclusions
This replication study demonstrated that duloxetine 60 mg
QD is safe and efficacious in the treatment of MDD and
associated painful physical symptoms. Thus, the data from
this study as well as from the studies reported by Gaynor
et al.7 and Brecht et al.9 in patients with MDD and at least
moderate pain at baseline consistently support the efficacy
of duloxetine in treatment of depression and painful physical symptoms associated with depression.
