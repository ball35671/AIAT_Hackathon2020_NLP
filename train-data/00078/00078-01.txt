Objective. To assess the efficacy and safety of
duloxetine, a serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake
inhibitor, in subjects with primary fibromyalgia, with or
without current major depressive disorder.
Methods. This study was a randomized, doubleblind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 18 outpatient research centers in the US. A total of 207 subjects
meeting the American College of Rheumatology criteria
for primary fibromyalgia were enrolled (89% female,
87% white, mean age 49 years, 38% with current major
depressive disorder). After single-blind placebo treatment for 1 week, subjects were randomly assigned to
receive duloxetine 60 mg twice a day (n  104) or
placebo (n  103) for 12 weeks. Co–primary outcome
measures were the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire
(FIQ) total score (score range 0–80, with 0 indicating no
impact) and FIQ pain score (score range 0–10). Secondary outcome measures included mean tender point pain
threshold, number of tender points, FIQ fatigue, tiredness on awakening, and stiffness scores, Clinical Global
Impression of Severity (CGI-Severity) scale, Patient
Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-Improvement)
scale, Brief Pain Inventory (short form), Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36, Quality of Life in Depression Scale, and Sheehan Disability Scale.
Results. Compared with placebo-treated subjects,
duloxetine-treated subjects improved significantly more
(P  0.027) on the FIQ total score, with a treatment
difference of 5.53 (95% confidence interval 10.43,
0.63), but not significantly more on the FIQ pain score
(P  0.130). Compared with placebo-treated subjects,
duloxetine-treated subjects had significantly greater
reductions in Brief Pain Inventory average pain severity
score (P  0.008), Brief Pain Inventory average interference from pain score (P  0.004), number of tender
points (P  0.002), and FIQ stiffness score (P  0.048),
and had significantly greater improvement in mean
tender point pain threshold (P  0.002), CGI-Severity
(P  0.048), PGI-Improvement (P  0.033), and several
quality-of-life measures. Duloxetine treatment improved fibromyalgia symptoms and pain severity regardless of baseline status of major depressive disorder.
Compared with placebo-treated female subjects (n 
92), duloxetine-treated female subjects (n  92) demonstrated significantly greater improvement on most
efficacy measures, while duloxetine-treated male subjects (n  12) failed to improve significantly on any
efficacy measure. The treatment effect on significant
pain reduction in female subjects was independent of
the effect on mood or anxiety. Duloxetine was safely
administered and well tolerated.
Conclusion. In this randomized, controlled, 12-
week trial (with a 1-week placebo lead-in phase), duloxetine was an effective and safe treatment for many of the
symptoms associated with fibromyalgia in subjects with
or without major depressive disorder, particularly for

outcome measures.
Fibromyalgia is a chronic musculoskeletal pain
disorder of unknown etiology, characterized by widespread pain and muscle tenderness, and often accompanied by fatigue, sleep disturbance, and depressed mood
(1,2). Fibromyalgia occurs in 2% of the general population in the US and is more common in women than in
men (3.4% of women and 0.5% of men) (3). There are
few reported effective treatments and no Food and Drug
Administration–approved treatments for fibromyalgia,
which is associated with substantial morbidity and disability.
The pathophysiology of fibromyalgia is unknown,
but abnormalities in central monoaminergic neurotransmission might play a role. There is evidence of dysfunction in both serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT])
and norepinephrine (NE) systems in patients with fibromyalgia (4–7). Both 5-HT and NE have also been
implicated in the mediation of endogenous analgesic
mechanisms via the descending inhibitory pain pathways
in the brain and spinal cord (8–10). Dysfunction of
5-HT– and NE-mediated descending pain-inhibitory
pathways is a potential mechanism for the pain experienced by patients with fibromyalgia. Antidepressants
that increase 5-HT– and NE-mediated neurotransmission are commonly used to treat fibromyalgia and other
chronic pain conditions (11). Prior treatment studies
with antidepressant medications suggested that inhibition of both the 5-HT and NE reuptake transporters was
more effective in treating fibromyalgia than inhibition of
either transporter alone (11,12). Two recent meta-analyses of trials of tricyclic medications that inhibit both
5-HT and NE reuptake found a consistent, moderate
efficacy for these agents (13,14). However, many patients with fibromyalgia cannot tolerate the sedative and
other adverse effects associated with tricyclic agents. As
an alternative to tricyclic agents, selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which are likely to be better
tolerated, have had mixed results in treatment studies of
fibromyalgia (12,15–18).
Duloxetine hydrochloride is a potent 5-HT and
NE reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) that is relatively evenly
balanced with similar affinity for both 5-HT and NE
reuptake inhibition. Duloxetine lacks significant affinity
for muscarinic, histamine 1, 1-adrenergic, dopamine,
5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT1D, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, and opioid receptors. Because of the proposed role of 5-HT and
NE as key mediators of descending pain pathways,
duloxetine has been studied in several animal models of
persistent and neuropathic pain and found to be effective in reducing pain-related behaviors at doses that did
not cause neuromuscular dysfunction (19–21). In these
animal models, duloxetine was more potent than venlafaxine, amitriptyline, or desipramine and more effective than the SSRI paroxetine and the selective NE
inhibitor thionisoxetine in reducing persistent painrelated behaviors in animals (20). The findings from
these preclinical studies suggested that duloxetine might
be an effective treatment for some forms of persistent
pain in humans.
Abnormalities in 5-HT and NE neurotransmission are also involved in the pathophysiology of major
depressive disorder, which is frequently comorbid with
fibromyalgia (1). Patients with major depressive disorder
commonly present with painful physical symptoms, such
as headache, back pain, stomach aches, and poorly
localized musculoskeletal pain, although it is not known
whether major depressive disorder is associated with
altered pain processing or whether the pain associated
with major depressive disorder has an etiology similar to
that of pain in fibromyalgia (22–24). Duloxetine has
been shown to be a safe, tolerable, and effective antidepressant at doses of 60–120 mg/day (25–27). In a previous trial, duloxetine also significantly reduced painful
physical symptoms associated with major depressive
disorder (28).
Based on the evidence from preclinical and clinical studies of duloxetine showing potential efficacy in
the treatment of persistent pain symptoms and the
painful physical symptoms associated with depression,
we hypothesized that duloxetine would be safe and
efficacious in reducing pain severity and the impact of
fibromyalgia in patients with or without current major
depressive disorder. To test this hypothesis on behalf of
the Duloxetine Fibromyalgia Trial Group (see Appendix
A), we conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled,
double-blind, parallel-group study to assess the safety
and efficacy of duloxetine, titrated to 60 mg twice a day,
in 207 outpatients meeting the American College of
Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for fibromyalgia (2) with
or without current major depressive disorder. The dose
of 120 mg/day was selected based on results of a previous
clinical trial of fibromyalgia suggesting that patients
might respond better to higher doses of antidepressants
(16). This is one of the largest clinical trials ever
conducted for the treatment of fibromyalgia, and, to our
knowledge, the only study to include an evaluation of the
impact of comorbid major depressive disorder on response to treatment.
DULOXETINE VERSUS PLACEBO IN FIBROMYALGIA 2975
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Overview. The study was conducted in 18 outpatient
research centers (5 university sites and 13 independent research centers) in the US. Enrollment began in July 2001, and
the study was completed in March 2002. The Institutional
Review Boards approved the protocol, and all subjects provided written informed consent after the study was explained
and their questions answered, and before study procedures
were initiated. Subjects were identified by physician referral or
responded to an advertisement for a fibromyalgia medication
trial.
Entry criteria. Female or male subjects were eligible
for the study if they were 18 years of age or older and met the
ACR criteria for fibromyalgia (2). Only subjects with primary
fibromyalgia were enrolled; those with associated rheumatic or
other medical disorders that contributed to the symptoms of
fibromyalgia were excluded. Subjects were required to score
4 on the pain intensity item of the Fibromyalgia Impact
Questionnaire (FIQ) (score range 0–10, with 10 indicating very
severe pain) (29) at visits 1 (screening) and 2 (the placebo
lead-in phase [see below]). Subjects were included if they
were judged to be reliable and had an educational level and
degree of understanding that allowed them to communicate
intelligibly.
Exclusion criteria included the following: pain from
traumatic injury or structural or regional rheumatic disease;
rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory arthritis, or autoimmune
disease; unstable medical or psychiatric illness; current dysthymia, which is more treatment resistant than major depression,
or primary psychiatric disorder other than major depressive
disorder; substance abuse in the last year; history of psychosis;
pregnancy or breast feeding; unacceptable contraception in
those of childbearing potential; involvement in disability reviews that might compromise treatment response; use of an
investigational drug within 30 days; prior participation in a
study of duloxetine; severe allergic reactions to multiple medications; intolerance to 3 psychoactive drugs or 1 SSRI; and
failure to respond to 2 adequate regimens of 2 different
classes of antidepressants for depression or fibromyalgia.
Concomitant medication exclusions included use of
medications or herbal agents with central nervous system
activity (antidepressants required a 7-day washout prior to visit
2 except for monoamine oxidase inhibitors, which required a
14-day washout, and fluoxetine, which required a 30-day
washout); regular use of analgesics with the exception of
acetaminophen up to 2 grams/day and aspirin up to 325
mg/day; chronic use of sedatives, antiemetics, or antispasmodics; episodic use of anticoagulants; 3 months stable therapy
with antihypertensives, hormones, antiarrhythmics, antidiarrheals, antihistamines, cough/cold preparations (excluding dextromethorphan), or laxatives; and initiation of or change in
unconventional or alternative therapies.
Study design. The 3–30-day screening phase was followed by a 1-week, single-blind, placebo lead-in phase at visit
2. Subjects received placebo for 1 week in an attempt to obtain
an unbiased evaluation of the baseline variables, including
safety measures. At visit 3, subjects were randomized to 1 of
the following 2 treatment groups: duloxetine or placebo in a
1:1 ratio. Assignment to treatment groups was determined by a
computer-generated random sequence using an interactive
voice response system. Treatment was double-blind for 12
weeks. Subjects were evaluated weekly (visits 3–5) for the first
2 weeks of the 12-week therapy phase; thereafter, study visits
were scheduled at 2-week intervals (visits 6–10). Subjects
randomized to receive duloxetine underwent a double-blind
forced titration from 20 mg/day to 60 mg twice a day during the
first 2 weeks of the therapy phase, as follows: 20 mg every day
for 5 days, 20 mg twice a day for at least 3 days, 40 mg twice a
day for at least 2 days, and 60 mg twice a day for the remainder
of the study beginning at visit 5. The number of placebo
capsules was similarly adjusted to maintain the blinding.
Outcome measures. The protocol-defined co–primary
outcome measures were pain severity as measured by the FIQ
pain item and the FIQ total score (29). The total score
reflected the impact of fibromyalgia and ranged from 0 (no
impact) to 80 (maximum impact). Secondary outcome measures included the FIQ items for fatigue, morning tiredness,
and stiffness (29). At the start-up meeting, study physicians or
qualified study personnel were trained and certified in the
performance of dolorimetry; reliability testing was not performed. For the tender point assessment, the Fischer dolorimeter (30) with a rubber disk of 1 cm2 was applied at a 90°
vertical angle to the 18 tender point sites defined by the ACR
criteria (2), and the pressure was increased at a rate of 1
kg/cm2
/second until the subject indicated verbally that he/she
first felt discomfort or pain (tender point pain threshold
recorded in kg/cm2
). The mean tender point pain threshold
was calculated from 18 points, and the tender point count was
determined by the number of tender points that had a threshold of 4 kg/cm2
.
Other secondary measures included the Clinical
Global Impression of Severity (CGI-Severity) scale, ranging
from 1 (normal, not at all ill) to 7 (among the most extremely
ill patients) (31), and the Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-Improvement) scale, ranging from 1 (very
much better) to 7 (very much worse). Subjects also completed
the Brief Pain Inventory (short form) (32), which measured
pain severity during the past 24 hours (from 0 [no pain] to 10
[pain as bad as you can imagine]) and interference (from 0
[does not interfere] to 10 [completely interferes]) with general
activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relations with
other people, sleep, and enjoyment of life. Multiple measures
of pain were included because there is no current consensus
about the evaluation of pain in fibromyalgia. The measures
assessed pain during different time frames and determined the
impact of pain on several functions.
Other secondary objectives were to determine whether
the effects of duloxetine 60 mg twice a day on the FIQ pain
score and total score were independent of the presence or
absence of a current major depressive disorder as defined by
the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,
Fourth Edition (DSM-IV). The severity of depressive and
anxiety symptoms was measured by the Beck Depression
Inventory-II (33) and the Beck Anxiety Inventory (34), respectively. The impact of duloxetine compared with that of placebo
on subject-reported outcomes was measured by the Medical
Outcomes Study Short Form 36 (SF-36) (35), the Quality of
Life in Depression Scale (36,37), and the Sheehan Disability
Scale (38). The safety of duloxetine 60 mg twice a day was
assessed by discontinuation pattern, treatment-emergent ad2976 ARNOLD ET AL
verse events, vital signs, electrocardiograms (EKGs), and
laboratory analysis.
Schedule of assessments. The screening protocol (visit
1) included the medical history and the Mini International
Neuropsychiatric Interview (39) to identify DSM-IV Axis I
psychiatric disorders (40). Subjects also underwent a physical
examination, EKG, and laboratory tests, and completed the
FIQ. A digital tender point examination confirmed the diagnosis of fibromyalgia by ACR criteria (2). At the 1-week
placebo lead-in phase (visit 2) and at each subsequent visit, the
FIQ was completed, vital signs were checked, and adverse
events and concomitant medication were reviewed. At randomization (visit 3), laboratory tests and all of the efficacy
measurements were completed. From the randomization visit
to the end of the study (visits 3–10), the Brief Pain Inventory
was completed at each visit, and the tender point assessment,
CGI-Severity scale, PGI-Improvement scale, Beck Depression
Inventory-II, Beck Anxiety Inventory, and laboratory tests
were completed or performed at weeks 4, 8, and 12. Additional
evaluations at the final visit included a physical examination,
laboratory tests, EKG, SF-36, Quality of Life in Depression
Scale, and Sheehan Disability Scale.
Statistical analysis. This study was designed to enroll
200 patients so that it would have at least 90% power to detect
a treatment group difference of 1.4 points in pain severity as
measured by the pain item in the FIQ. The use of a 1.4-point
difference in FIQ pain score was based on the desire to power
this study to demonstrate a moderately large effect size (0.65)
for duloxetine using point and variance estimates based on the
results of the Arnold et al study in 2002 (16) comparing
fluoxetine with placebo under similar circumstances. The
present study was not powered using the FIQ total score
because its higher relative variability would have required a
considerably greater sample size. Analyses were also conducted to determine whether the treatment effect of duloxetine in fibromyalgia was independent of its effect on major
depressive disorder. The interaction of treatment with major
depressive disorder status was not included in the power
calculations due to limited preprotocol information concerning
this effect. We anticipated that the power for testing this
interaction effect would be slightly less than that for the
treatment-group-only comparisons; however, the use of a
sample size that provides a high level of power (90%) based on
treatment group comparisons was expected to provide reasonable power for the interaction assessment.
Longitudinal changes from baseline on continuous
efficacy measures were analyzed using a mixed-effects model
for repeated measures analysis (41), defined a priori in the
protocol as the primary analysis. The model included the fixed,
categorical effects of treatment, investigator, visit, and interaction of treatment with visit, as well as the continuous, fixed
covariates of baseline and interaction of baseline with visit. An
unstructured covariance matrix was used to model the withinsubject errors. As a secondary analysis, changes from baseline
to end point (the last observation carried forward [LOCF]
method) were analyzed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with the terms of treatment, investigator, and
baseline scores. When previous use of antidepressants was not
balanced at baseline between treatment groups, that subgroup
was added to the ANCOVA model to assess treatment effect
on the two primary measures. Furthermore, for the FIQ pain
score, the area under the curve (AUC) of improvement scores
(postbaseline minus baseline) over visit intervals was evaluated. The greater the AUC value, the greater the treatment
effect on pain reduction. Due to the skewed distribution of the
AUC, the rank-transformed AUC scores were analyzed using
an analysis of variance (ANOVA) model with the terms of
treatment and investigator.

jor depressive disorder status at baseline and treatment groups
was tested using an ANCOVA model as described above, with
the addition of the major depressive disorder status at baseline
and the interaction of treatment with subgroup. This model
was also used for the subgroup analysis for the subgroups
defined by other factors.
Path analysis (42) was performed to test the direct
treatment effect on pain reduction. In this analysis, 3 regression models were employed to describe the following protocolspecified causal relationships: first, the treatment has an effect
on pain reduction (direct effect) after accounting for the
indirect effect through improvement of depressive or anxiety
symptoms (model 1); second, the treatment improves depressive symptoms (model 2) or anxiety symptoms (model 3). In
this analysis, the significance of the direct treatment effect was
tested by Student’s t-test in the first regression model (model
1), where change in the pain measure (FIQ pain score or Brief
Pain Inventory average pain severity score) was a dependent
variable, and treatment, baseline, investigator, and changes in
the Beck Depression Inventory-II and Beck Anxiety Inventory
scores were independent variables. In the other 2 regression
models (models 2 and 3), for changes in Beck Depression
Inventory-II and Beck Anxiety Inventory scores, respectively,
the treatment and baseline were used as independent variables. The percentage of direct and indirect effects on the total
treatment effect (the sum of the direct and the two indirect
effects) was computed and presented.
For categorical variables, treatment group differences
were evaluated using Fisher’s exact test. Continuous baseline
measures and continuous safety parameters were evaluated
using the ANOVA model described above. Treatment effects
were tested at a two-sided significance level of 0.05. Interaction
effects were tested at a significance level of 0.10. Throughout
this article, the term “significant” indicates statistical significance, and the “mean change” refers to “least-squares mean
change” when presenting efficacy results.
RESULTS
Subject disposition. A total of 555 subjects were
screened to identify 215 subjects who met entry criteria.
Of these 215 subjects, 207 were randomized to receive
study treatment. This was the intent-to-treat sample, of
which 104 subjects received duloxetine and 103 subjects
received placebo (Figure 1). There were no significant
between-group differences in subject discontinuation for
any reason. Eighty-three subjects withdrew during the
acute therapy phase, 46 (44%) from the duloxetine
group and 37 (36%) from the placebo group (P  0.257).
The mean  SD duration of treatment was 58.7  32.1
days for duloxetine and 65.6  28.7 days for placebo
(P  0.116).
Baseline clinical and demographic characteristics. The majority of the subjects were women (89%)
and white (87%). Thirty-eight percent of the enrolled
subjects had current major depressive disorder. The only
significant between-group difference in any baseline
characteristic (Table 1) or clinical variable (Tables 2 and
3) involved a previous history of antidepressant use for
treatment of either mood or pain symptoms, which was

more common in the placebo group. Female and male
subjects were similar in demographics, baseline variables, and major depressive disorder status with the
exception of the two tender point assessments. Compared with male subjects, female subjects had significantly more tender points (mean  SD 16.88  1.97
versus 14.87  3.84; P  0.001) and significantly lower
mean tender point pain thresholds (mean  SD 2.21 

Efficacy. The changes in the FIQ total score and
pain score over time are illustrated in Figures 2 and 3.
Compared with the placebo group, the duloxetine group
had a significantly greater improvement in the FIQ total
score at the last visit of the acute therapy phase (week
12), as well as at week 4. The treatment group difference
in FIQ pain score was not significant at week 12 (P 
0.130); however, it was significant at early visits of the study
(weeks 1, 2, and 4). Results are summarized in Table 4.
Most of the secondary outcome measures improved significantly more in the duloxetine group compared with the placebo group (Table 4). The Brief Pain
Inventory interference items that improved significantly
were general activity, mood, walking ability, normal
work, sleep, and enjoyment of life.
The duloxetine group had significantly greater
improvement (by ANCOVA) in the FIQ total score,
with a difference of 4.52 (95% confidence interval
[95% CI] 8.86, 0.17) (P  0.042), and marginally
significant improvement in the FIQ pain score, with a
difference of 0.71 (95% CI 1.42, 0.01) (P  0.052),
after accounting for the significant group difference in
prior antidepressant use at baseline. When comparing
the AUCs on the FIQ pain score, duloxetine treatment
demonstrated a significant superiority over placebo
(median AUC 75.5 versus 27, respectively; P  0.041).

27.7% and 16.7% for the duloxetine and placebo groups,
respectively (P  0.06). No interaction of treatment with
major depressive disorder was observed for the primary
efficacy measures (P  0.862 for FIQ total score and
P  0.677 for FIQ pain score), suggesting that the effect
of duloxetine on reduction of fibromyalgia symptoms
was similar in subjects with or without major depressive
disorder.
Efficacy analysis on female subjects. The interaction of treatment with sex approached the significance
level of 0.1 for the FIQ total score (P  0.101) and FIQ
pain score (P  0.121). Compared with placebo-treated
female subjects, duloxetine-treated female subjects had
significantly greater improvement in both the FIQ total
score (P  0.029) and FIQ pain score (P  0.035). A
significantly higher percentage of duloxetine-treated
women than placebo-treated women had a decrease of
50% in the FIQ pain score (30.3% versus 16.5%; P 
0.035). The interaction of treatment with sex was significant for two secondary measures, the Brief Pain Inventory average pain score (P  0.046) and the Sheehan
Disability Scale total score (P  0.007). Duloxetinetreated female subjects improved significantly more than
placebo-treated female subjects on all of the secondary
efficacy measures that demonstrated treatment group
differences for all randomized subjects. The male subjects receiving duloxetine did not respond significantly
on primary or secondary efficacy measures.

The path analysis for the FIQ pain score and the
Brief Pain Inventory average pain severity score, performed as a secondary analysis to further evaluate
treatment effect on pain reduction in the female subjects, showed that, for both measures, the direct treatment effect on pain accounted for a major portion of the
total effect. The direct effect of duloxetine on the
reduction of the FIQ pain score accounted for 61.1% of
the total treatment effect (P  0.313); the indirect
treatment effect through improvement in depressive
symptoms accounted for 38.5% of the total treatment
effect, and improvement in anxiety accounted for only
0.5% of the total treatment effect. The direct effect of
duloxetine on the reduction of the Brief Pain Inventory
average pain severity score accounted for 83.3% of the
total treatment effect (P  0.015); the indirect treatment
effect through improvement in depressive symptoms
accounted for 15.3% of the total treatment effect, and
improvement in anxiety accounted for 1.5% of the total
treatment effect. The path analysis also suggested that
there was more indirect effect from change in depressive
symptoms than anxiety symptoms, but neither effect was
significant.
Safety. Of the 207 randomized subjects, 94
duloxetine-treated subjects (90.4%) and 77 placebotreated subjects (74.8%) reported at least one
treatment-emergent adverse event (P  0.003). A total
of 29 subjects discontinued during the therapy phase due
to adverse events, with no statistically significant differences between treatment groups (18 in the duloxetine
group [17.3%] and 11 in the placebo group [10.7%]; P 
0.229) (Figure 1). Duloxetine-treated subjects reported
insomnia, dry mouth, and constipation significantly
more frequently than did placebo-treated subjects. Most
treatment-emergent adverse events were of mild or
moderate severity. There were no significant treatment
group differences in the percentage of severe treatmentemergent adverse events.
Duloxetine-treated subjects had small, but significant, increases from baseline to end point in heart rate
(mean  SD change 3.53  11.56) (P  0.005).
Duloxetine-treated subjects also experienced small, nonsignificant increases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (mean  SD changes of 1.26  15.31 mm Hg and
0.58  8.36 mm Hg, respectively). Three subjects (2
randomized to the duloxetine group and 1 randomized
to the placebo group) experienced sustained hypertension, but the treatment group difference was not statistically significant. Mean change in weight was not statistically different between treatment groups.
Compared with placebo-treated subjects,
duloxetine-treated subjects experienced small, but significant, increases from baseline to end point in levels of
aspartate transaminase, creatine phosphokinase, and
cholesterol, and significant decreases in levels of calcium
and chloride. These mean differences were within normal reference ranges and were not considered clinically
relevant. No subject experienced elevated corrected QT
intervals during the study.

DULOXETINE VERSUS PLACEBO IN FIBROMYALGIA 2981
DISCUSSION
In this randomized, double-blind, 12-week trial,
duloxetine had significantly greater efficacy than placebo on most outcome measures in the treatment of
subjects with ACR-defined primary fibromyalgia at a
fixed dose of 60 mg twice a day. This is the first
medication trial of fibromyalgia to use a structured
psychiatric interview to identify comorbid DSM-IV–
defined major depressive disorder and to include subjects with and without current major depressive disorder.
In the subgroup analysis, the improvement in fibromyalgia symptoms with duloxetine compared with placebo
was independent of the presence or absence of major
depressive disorder. The effect on mood was measured
by the Beck Depression Inventory-II, which showed
marginal improvement in the duloxetine group compared with the placebo group (P  0.052). Duloxetine
demonstrated a direct effect on pain reduction in female
subjects that was significantly greater than the indirect
effect attributed to improvement in mood and anxiety
symptoms. Therefore, the effect of duloxetine on the
reduction of pain associated with fibromyalgia appears
to be independent of its effect on mood. These results
confirm the findings from prior studies of fibromyalgia
with the tricyclic agents amitriptyline and cyclobenzaprine, and with the SSRI fluoxetine, which found no
significant relationship between improvement in fibromyalgia symptoms and change in depression scores,
although none of these prior studies evaluated the
impact of currently diagnosed major depressive disorder
(12,16,43).
The pathophysiology of fibromyalgia remains unknown. Duloxetine, a potent SNRI, may correct a functional deficit of 5-HT and NE neurotransmission. Although the pathophysiology of major depressive
disorder and fibromyalgia may share abnormalities in
central monoaminergic neurotransmission, the independent effect of duloxetine on reduction in pain suggests
that pain-modulating effects in the spinal and supraspinal pathways are not dependent on the modulation of
mood. Consistent with this hypothesis, previous fibromyalgia trials of tricyclic medications have used doses that
are subtherapeutic for major depressive disorder, making it unlikely that their moderate effects on reduction of
pain were due to antidepressant properties (13,14).
Compared with placebo-treated female subjects,
duloxetine-treated female subjects improved significantly on most efficacy measures, while duloxetinetreated male subjects did not respond significantly on
any efficacy measure compared with placebo-treated
male subjects. The reasons for the sex differences in
response are unclear. Because the male subgroup was
small (23 of 207 subjects [11%]), reflecting the much
higher prevalence of fibromyalgia in women (3), the
results of the study may not be generalizable to all men
with fibromyalgia. Studies of larger samples of men with
fibromyalgia are needed to reexamine the efficacy of
duloxetine in men. There may also be sex differences in
fibromyalgia that affect treatment response. Notably,
female subjects had significantly more tender points and
lower mean tender point pain thresholds at baseline
than did male subjects. Other studies of fibromyalgia
clinical features found that women had significantly
more tender points than men, as well as more fatigue,
sleep disturbance, irritable bowel syndrome, and “pain
all over” (44). The disparate presentations of fibromyalgia in women and men suggest that there might be sex
differences in the pathophysiology of fibromyalgia that
could affect response to treatment, but more study is
needed.
The improvement in tender point measures in
duloxetine-treated subjects compared with placebotreated subjects was the most significant change of the
efficacy measures, and improvement was evident in both
women and men. The significant improvement in the
number of tender points and in the tender point pain
threshold in the duloxetine group compared with the
placebo group is notable, because previous fibromyalgia
studies using tricyclic antidepressants found minimal
improvement in tender point measures (13,14). These
results suggest that duloxetine improves pain and tenderness, the hallmark characteristics of fibromyalgia.
The dolorimeter method of tender point assessment
used in the present study is more quantitative and might
be a more reliable technique than manual assessments
for monitoring change over time in a clinical trial.
Dolorimetry provides an objective measure of the pressure pain threshold that is relatively independent of
distress and less influenced by psychological factors than
are manual tender point counts (45,46).
Duloxetine was safely administered and well tolerated. Significantly more duloxetine-treated subjects
than placebo-treated subjects reported treatmentemergent adverse events, most commonly insomnia, dry
mouth, and constipation, but these events were generally
mild or moderate in severity. There were no significant
differences between treatment groups in subject discontinuation due to treatment-emergent adverse events.
The safety findings are in general agreement with the
findings in other studies of duloxetine in patients with
major depressive disorder (25–27).
2982 ARNOLD ET AL
Several limitations of this study should be considered. First, the co–primary outcome measure, the FIQ
pain score, did not improve significantly in the duloxetine group compared with the placebo group at the last
visit of the acute therapy phase. The FIQ pain item
might be problematic as an outcome measure because
subjects retrospectively rate their pain over the prior
week, which may be more difficult to recall than their
pain over the past 24 hours. However, the AUC improvement in pain as measured by the FIQ pain score
indicated that duloxetine-treated subjects had superior
reduction in pain compared with placebo-treated subjects. In addition, the secondary measure of pain, the
Brief Pain Inventory average pain score, improved significantly with duloxetine treatment, as did the Brief
Pain Inventory measure of interference from pain. The
SF-36 component for bodily pain also improved significantly in the duloxetine group compared with the placebo group. Therefore, the weight of the evidence
supports improvement in painful symptoms of fibromyalgia with duloxetine treatment, especially for women,
who improved significantly on all measures of pain.
Furthermore, duloxetine-treated female subjects were
significantly more likely than placebo-treated female
subjects to have a decrease of 50% in the FIQ pain
score, which represents clinically meaningful improvement. Second, because the duration of treatment was 12
weeks, the results may not be generalizable to longer
treatment periods. Furthermore, 40% of all subjects
did not complete the study. Future studies should assess
the long-term efficacy of duloxetine in fibromyalgia.
Third, individuals with several forms of lifetime psychopathology were excluded. Thus, the results may not be
generalizable to individuals with certain forms of
psychopathology such as primary anxiety disorders or
bipolar disorder. Individuals with secondary fibromyalgia and unstable medical or psychiatric illness were
also excluded, and the results may not be generalizable to patients with these conditions. Finally, because
subjects who had shown no reponse in 2 adequate
antidepressant trials were excluded, the results may
not be generalizable to those who are resistant to
treatment with antidepressants.
In summary, in this 12-week, randomized,
placebo-controlled trial, duloxetine at 60 mg twice a day
was found to be efficacious on most outcome measures
in subjects with primary fibromyalgia with or without
major depressive disorder, particularly in women, and
was safe and well tolerated.
