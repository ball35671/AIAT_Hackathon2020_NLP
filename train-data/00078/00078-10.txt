Abstract
The aim of this study was to examine the efficacy and safety of duloxetine, a balanced and potent dual reuptake inhibitor of serotonin and
norepinephrine, in the management of diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain. Serotonin and norepinephrine are thought to inhibit pain via
descending pain pathways. In a 12-week, multicenter, double-blind study, 457 patients experiencing pain due to polyneuropathy caused by
Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes mellitus were randomly assigned to treatment with duloxetine 20 mg/d (20 mg QD), 60 mg/d (60 mg QD), 120 mg/d
(60 mg BID), or placebo. The diagnosis was confirmed by a score of at least 3 on the Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument. The primary
efficacy measure was the weekly mean score of the 24-h Average Pain Score, which was rated on an 11-point (0–10) Likert scale (no pain to
worst possible pain) and computed from diary scores between two site visits. Duloxetine 60 and 120 mg/d demonstrated statistically significant
greater improvement compared with placebo on the 24-h Average Pain Score, beginning 1 week after randomization and continuing through the
12-week trial. Duloxetine also separated from placebo on nearly all the secondary measures including health-related outcome measures.
Significantly more patients in all three active-treatment groups achieved a 50% reduction in the 24-h Average Pain Score compared with
placebo. Duloxetine treatment was considered to be safe and well tolerated with less than 20 percent discontinuation due to adverse events.
Duloxetine at 60 and 120 mg/d was safe and effective in the management of diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain.

1. Introduction
Diabetes is commonly associated with a peripheral
neuropathy that often results in significant pain. The pain
has been described as an ‘aching, burning, stabbing, or
tingling’ sensation, and often affects sleep. Tricyclic
antidepressants (TCAs), certain anticonvulsants (e.g. gabapentin), and opioid analgesics are currently used to treat the
neuropathic pain due to diabetic peripheral neuropathy, but
often are limited by efficacy or significant side effects
(Kapur et al., 1992; McQuay et al., 1996).
Serotonin (5-HT) and norepinephrine (NE) have been
implicated in the modulation of endogenous analgesic
mechanisms via the descending inhibitory pain pathways in
the brain and spinal cord (Basbaum and Fields, 1984; Clark
and Proudfit, 1993; Fields and Basbaum, 1999; Fields et al.,
1991). An imbalance in these inhibitory mechanisms may
contribute to central sensitization and hyperexcitability of
the spinal and supraspinal pain transmitting pathways
leading to persistent pain [reviewed by Coderre and Katz
(1997)] (Ren and Dubner, 2002).
Duloxetine hydrochloride [(Cymbaltaw), (C)-N-methylg-(1-naphthalenyloxy)-3-(2-thiopene)-propanamine] is a
relatively balanced and potent dual reuptake inhibitor of
both 5-HT and NE (SNRI) transporters with weak affinity
for the dopamine transporter and insignificant affinity at
more than 60 neurotransmitter receptors including muscarinic, histamine, opioid, glutamate and GABA receptors

and Bymaster, 2002).
Duloxetine is effective in animal models of persistent and
neuropathic pain (Iyengar et al., 2004) suggesting that
duloxetine could be efficacious in the treatment of persistent
pain conditions in humans. Since efficacy occurs at doses
that do not impair performance on the rotorod test of
neurological function, duloxetine is likely to be nonsedating and non-ataxic (Iyengar et al., 2004), making it a
good clinical candidate.
In several randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
studies, duloxetine at 60–120 mg per day (Detke et al.,
2002a,b; Goldstein et al., 2002; Nemeroff et al., 2002) was
an effective treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD)
based on traditional measures of efficacy, such as the
Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. Duloxetine also produced significant improvement on visual analog scales
(VAS) ratings of painful physical symptoms associated with
depression, including overall pain, back pain, shoulder pain,
headache, and general somatic symptoms, despite the fact
that patients were not selected for pain type or pain severity
and the studies were not statistically powered for these
measures. Path analysis demonstrated that greater than 50%
of the reduction in painful physical symptoms of MDD was
a direct effect of duloxetine, rather than a secondary effect
of improving depression.
Consistent with duloxetine’s effects on the painful
physical symptoms in MDD and the existing evidence that
dual 5-HT and NE reuptake inhibitors are effective in
treating pure pain disorders such as neuropathic pain
conditions (Sindrup and Jensen, 1999), the potential
analgesic efficacy of duloxetine was evaluated in patients
with neuropathic pain due to diabetic peripheral neuropathy
who did not have depression. The current study describes
the efficacy and safety of duloxetine in reducing pain
severity in diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain (DPNP)
patients.
2. Methods
2.1. Study design
This was a parallel-group, double-blind, randomized, placebocontrolled study of patients who met criteria for diabetic
neuropathy as assessed by history and the physical exam portion
of the Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument (MNSI)
(Sheehan et al., 1998). The primary objective was to evaluate the
efficacy of duloxetine 20, 60, or 120 mg/d (administered 20 mg
QD, 60 mg QD and 60 mg BID, respectively), on the treatment of
pain associated with diabetic neuropathy as compared with
placebo. Each site’s ethics committee approved the study protocol
in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.
Patients provided written informed consent prior to participation in
any study-related procedures.
2.2. Patients
Patients, at least 18 years of age, had daily pain due to
polyneuropathy caused by Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes mellitus,
which was present for a minimum of 6 months. This pain had to
have begun in the feet with relatively symmetrical onset. The
diagnosis was confirmed by a score of at least 3 on the MNSI.
Patients were required to have a minimum score of 4 on the 24-h
Average Pain Score rated on an 11-point (0–10) Likert scale.
Patients were excluded if, over the past year, they met Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSMIV) criteria for Axis I diagnosis of MDD, depression-partial
remission, dysthymic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder,
alcohol or eating disorders as determined by the Mini International
Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). Patients were excluded if they
had any current or historical DSM-IV diagnosis of mania, bipolar
disorder, or psychosis as determined by the MINI. Patients were
also excluded if they had pain that could not be clearly
differentiated from, or conditions that might interfere with, the
assessment of the DPNP, such as peripheral vascular disease
(ischemic pain); neurological disorders unrelated to diabetic
neuropathy (e.g. phantom limb pain from amputation); skin
condition in the area of the neuropathy that could alter sensation
(e.g. plantar ulcer); other painful conditions (e.g. arthritis). Patients
were also excluded if they had a history of substance abuse or
dependence within the past year or had a positive urine drug
screen, if they received treatment within the last 30 days that had
not received regulatory approval, had taken excluded medications
within 7 days of baseline, received treatment with a MAOI or
fluoxetine within 30 days of baseline, or had used an opioid within
3 days of baseline. Patients were allowed to take a maximum of 4 g
of acetaminophen per day, but no other analgesic medication used
to treat diabetic neuropathic pain.
2.3. Treatments
Patients (457) were randomly assigned to duloxetine 20, 60,
120 mg/d, or placebo in a 1:1:1:1 ratio for the 12-week therapy
phase (see Fig. 1) as determined by a computer-generated random
sequence using an interactive voice response system (IVRS).
Patient numbers were assigned consecutively at each study site to
each patient who entered the study. The IVRS was used to assign
blister cards containing study drug to each patient confirmed
through IVRS entry of a confirmation number found on the card.
Patients were seen weekly for the first 5 weeks of treatment and
then bi-weekly thereafter.
2.4. Efficacy measures
Efficacy was assessed primarily using the weekly mean change
from baseline to endpoint on the 24-h Average Pain Score
[11-point (0–10) Likert scale] (referred to as the 24-h Average Pain
Score, hereafter), computed from diary scores recorded at the time
of the evening dose between two site visits. In addition to average
pain severity, the diary included ratings of worst pain severity over
the prior 24 h, average pain during the night once they had gone to
bed, and acetaminophen use over the past 24 h. Secondary
measures included Average Daily Severity and Average Night
Pain Severity (weekly mean scores of the 24-h Average Pain
Severity and Average Night Pain Severity), Worst Pain Severity,
110 D.J. Goldstein et al. / Pain 116 (2005) 109–118
severity and interference portions of the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI)
(Cleeland and Ryan, 1994) at each visit; Clinical Global
Impression of Severity (CGI-Severity) Scale (NIMH 1976) and
Patients Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-Improvement)
Scale (Guy, 1976) at randomization, Weeks 4, 8, and 12; the
sensory portion of the Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SFMPQ) (Melzack, 1987), Dynamic Allodynia at randomization and
Week 12, the Short Form-36 Health Status Survey (Ware et al.,
1993), and the EQ-5D version of the Euro Quality of Life
instrument (Kind, 1996). Changes in mood and anxiety were
measured using the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) (Beck
et al., 1996) and the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) (Beck et al.,
1988), respectively, at randomization and Week 12.
2.5. Safety assessments
Safety measures recorded at every visit included spontaneously
reported adverse events, concomitant medications, weight, supine
heart rate and blood pressure, and the occurrence of significant
hypoglycemic events. Blood chemistry, hematology, HgbA1c, and
lipids were collected at Visit 1 and Week 12. For those who
discontinued from the study, those assessments were collected at
their last visit.
Sustained hypertension was defined as three consecutive visits
with the following:
† Sitting systolic blood pressure R130 mmHg and an increase
from baseline of 10 mmHg, or
† Sitting diastolic blood pressure R85 mmHg and an increase
from baseline of 10 mmHg.
2.6. Statistical analysis
This study was designed to enroll 440 patients. With 110
patients per arm, this study would have at least 90% power to
detect a treatment group difference of K1.20 points in the weekly
mean of 24-h Average Pain Severity between duloxetine 60 mg
BID and placebo treatment groups after 3 months of acute therapy.
The sample size was determined using a 2-sided test with aZ0.05
and assuming a common standard deviation of 2.2 and a
discontinuation rate of 35%.
All analyses were conducted on an intent-to-treat basis. All
randomized patients were included in safety analyses and all
randomized patients with at least one post-baseline assessment
were included in the efficacy evaluations. After randomization,
weekly average scores on 24-h average pain, worst pain, and night
pain were calculated for the diary entries collected in days between
weeks; the baseline for the three variables was calculated by taking
the average of last three non-missing diary data given the
consideration that previous medications had effect on the first
few days after the screening visit. For either case, the mean score
was set to be missing if the number of diary entries was less than 3.
A likelihood-based mixed-effects model repeated measures
analysis was the protocol-specified primary efficacy analysis for
continuous efficacy measures with longitudinal observations. The
model included the fixed categorical effects of treatment,
investigator, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction, as well as
the continuous fixed covariates of baseline and baseline-by-visit
interaction. An unstructured covariance matrix was used to model
the within-patient errors. The primary treatment comparisons were
the contrasts between duloxetine treatment groups and placebo at

the last visit of the study (Week 12) on the change scores.
Satterthwaite’s approximation was used to estimate denominator
degrees of freedom. The dose–response trend for the primary
efficacy measure was tested using a repeated measures analysis
model where therapy was replaced by dosage and placebo was
excluded and the overall dose effect was reported. For the
continuous efficacy measures collected once at baseline and once
at the last visit of the study, change from baseline to endpoint was
assessed using an ANCOVA model, which contained terms of
treatment, investigator, and baseline. For either statistical model,
Type III sum-of-squares for the least-squares mean was used for
testing the differences between treatment groups.
Path analysis (Retherford and Choe, 1993) was performed to
test the direct treatment effect on pain reduction. In this analysis,
pre-specified pathways (Fig. 2) described the causal relationships
for the testing: the treatment has effect on pain reduction (direct
effect), and the treatment effect on mood or anxiety symptoms has
impact on pain reduction (indirect). The significance of the direct
treatment effect was tested by a Student’s t-test in the regression
model where change in 24-h average pain was a dependent
variable, and treatment, baseline, investigator, change on BDI, and
change on BAI were regressors. In addition, with two other
regression models on change on BDI and BAI, respectively, the
indirect treatment effect via change in BDI (or BAI) was a result of
multiplying treatment coefficient by the coefficients of the
corresponding change in the first described regression model.
The percentage of direct and indirect effects on the total treatment
effect was computed and presented. When an indirect pathway had
no impact on pain reduction (i.e. the coefficient between pain
reduction and change was positive) that particular path was
removed from the path analysis.
Continuous baseline measures and continuous safety measures
were evaluated using a fixed effect (treatment, investigator)
ANOVA. Categorical variables were analyzed using Fisher’s
exact test. Average daily dose of acetaminophen use was calculated
over days on therapy for each patient. Treatment group differences
were evaluated using the ANOVA model on the rank-transformed
data since the distribution of the data was skewed. For the same
reason, the rank transformed change from baseline to endpoint, the
last non-missing observations during the trial, on laboratory
analytes were analyzed using the ANOVA model.
For all the analyses, treatment effects were tested at a 2-sided
significance level of 0.05. Throughout this manuscript, the term
‘significant’ indicates statistical significance (P%0.05), and the
term ‘mean change’ refers to the least-squares mean change for the
continuous efficacy variables.
3. Results
3.1. Patient disposition
Patient disposition is shown in Fig. 3. Of the 763
screened patients, 457 patients entered and 344 (75.3%)
completed the study. The duloxetine 60 mg/d (13.2%)
and 120 mg/d (19.5%) treatment groups had more discontinuations due to adverse events than the placebo treatment
group (5.2%; P!0.001).
3.2. Demographics
The patient demographics and baseline assessments are
shown by treatment group in Table 1. Most patients had
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (88.4%) with a mean duration of
diabetes of 11.3 years and of diabetic neuropathy for 3.7
years. The majority of patients were male with percentages
ranging from 51% in the placebo group to 69% in the
60 mg/d treatment group.

the 60 mg/d group, and 57 (52%) in the 120 mg/d group.
The number of patients achieving a 50% reduction in the 24-
h Average Pain Score was significantly greater for all
three active-treatment groups when compared with placebo
(P!0.05).
The results of secondary efficacy measures are summarized in Table 2. Both duloxetine 60 and 120 mg/d treatment
groups produced significantly greater improvement over
placebo for all pain measures (Worst Pain, Night Pain, BPI
Average Pain Severity, BPI Worst Pain Severity, BPI Least
Pain Severity, BPI Pain Severity Right Now, SF-McGill
total score), except dynamic allodynia. The duloxetine 60
and 120 mg/d treatment groups also demonstrated significant improvement on measures of general illness severity
and improvement (CGI-Severity and PGI-Improvement).
Patients treated with duloxetine 20 mg/d were significantly
better than placebo on the measures of worst pain score, SFMcGill total score, and CGI-Severity.
The analysis of the individual SF-McGill sensory pain
components revealed that a significantly higher percentage
of duloxetine 120 mg/d patients reported improvement in
shooting, stabbing, sharp, hot-burning, and splitting pain
sensations when compared with placebo patients (Table 3).
A significantly higher percentage of duloxetine 60 mg/d
patients reported improvement in stabbing and sharp pain
sensations when compared with placebo patients.
The comparison of the average daily dose of supplemental acetaminophen/analgesic use indicated that duloxetinetreated patients had reduced pain severity and required
less supplemental analgesic compared with placebo.
The duloxetine 60 and 120 mg/d groups used significantly
less supplemental analgesic than the placebo group
(P%0.01; see Fig. 5), and the duloxetine 20 mg/d group
used numerically less than the placebo group (PZ0.080).
Baseline dynamic allodynia scores were very low indicating
that most patients lacked pain induced by brush stroking and
did not show significant differences across the treatments at
endpoint. Similarly, baseline depression and anxiety
symptom severities, assessed by BDI and BAI, respectively,
were low and the decrease in these scores across the study
and differences among the treatments were not significant
(see Table 2).
Most health outcomes measures, the SF-36 Health Status
Survey, BPI Interference, and EQ-5D, summarized in
Table 2, improved significantly more for patients treated
with duloxetine 60 and 120 mg/d compared to those treated
with placebo. Exceptions included the SF-36 Physical
Component that lacked significant difference across treatment groups and the Mental Component and General Health
Perceptions that demonstrated significantly greater
improvement for duloxetine 120 mg/d treatment group
compared with the placebo treatment group.

(PZ0.003 vs. placebo). The total treatment effect of
duloxetine 60 mg/d vs. placebo observed on the reduction
in 24-h average pain was decomposed into three effects as
follows: 94.8% direct effect, 0.2% indirect effect through
improvement on mood (change in BDI), and 5.1% indirect
effect through improvement on anxiety symptoms (change
in BAI). For duloxetine 120 mg/d, there was no effect of
improvement on the BAI on the change in the 24-h Average
Pain Score. When the anxiety component was removed
from the analysis, the direct treatment effect on 24-h
Average Pain Score was significant (P!0.001 vs. placebo)
and accounted for 88.6% of the total treatment. The indirect
treatment effect through change in BDI accounted for 11.4%
of the total effect.
3.5. Safety
3.5.1. Adverse events
A total of 49 (10.7%) patients discontinued due to adverse
events (Fig. 3). There were group differences with the fewest
discontinuations for the duloxetine 20 mg/d group (4.3%)
and the most for the duloxetine 120 mg/d group (19.5%).
Treatment-emergent adverse events by treatment with a
significant difference in reporting frequency from placebo
are shown in Table 4. Two adverse events (somnolence and
constipation) showed a significant difference between
duloxetine 60 mg/d and placebo. Most adverse events
were mild or moderate, except severe somnolence, which
was reported significantly more frequently by the duloxetine
120 mg/d treatment group than the other treatment groups,
which had no severe somnolence reports.
Some pain adverse events (back pain, arthralgia, and
pruritis) were reported significantly less frequently by the
duloxetine 60 and 120 mg/d groups compared with placebo.
Placebo-treated patients reported significantly greater
incidence of lower limb edema and peripheral swelling
than duloxetine-treated patients.
A total of 19 patients experienced serious adverse events,
defined as any event resulting in or prolonging hospitalization or death, life threatening experience, severe or
permanent disability during the study. Among serious
adverse events reported as reason for discontinuation, one
death occurred due to accidental drowning in the placebo
group. Serious adverse events occurring in more than one
patient included chest pain (placebo: 1 [0.9%]; duloxetine
20 mg/d: 1 [0.9%]), hypergylcemia NOS (placebo: 1
[0.9%]; duloxetine 120 mg/d: 1 [0.9%]), and myocardial
infarction (duloxetine 20 mg/d: 1 [0.9%]; duloxetine
120 mg/d: 1 [0.9%]). There were no significant treatment
group differences in occurrence.
3.5.2. Laboratory data
Although mean changes in several laboratory analytes
differed statistically significantly across treatments groups,
the mean changes were small and none were considered
clinically meaningful. Compared with placebo-treated
patients, the duloxetine 120 mg/d group had a statistically
significant mean decrease in uric acid, chloride, and
gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), and increase in
bicarbonate. The 60 mg/d group had decreases in sodium,
chloride, and alanyl leucine transferase (ALT). Alkaline
phosphatase showed a dose-related increase.
There were no statistically significant treatment-group
differences in the incidence of treatment-emergent abnormal hematology analytes. Hematology analytes showed
several statistically significant differences; however, these
mean changes were not considered clinically relevant.
Duloxetine lacked adverse effects on glycemic control or
lipids and, consistent with this finding, had no significant
difference among treatment groups in number of hypoglycemic events (Table 5).

3.5.3. Vital signs and electrocardiographic results
The incidence of sustained hypertension was 6 (5%), 9
(8%), 1 (1%), and 3 (3%) for the duloxetine 20, 60,
120 mg/d, and placebo treatment groups, respectively.
There was no difference between the duloxetine treatment
groups and placebo in the percentage of cases of sustained
hypertension. Compared with the placebo group, the
duloxetine 60 and 120 mg/d treatment groups had a
statistically significant mean decrease in QT interval
(K14.25 and K11.49 ms, respectively).
4. Discussion
In this randomized, double-blind, 12-week trial, duloxetine at 60 and 120 mg/d demonstrated significantly greater
efficacy than placebo on most outcome measures in the
management of pain due to polyneuropathy caused by Type 1
or Type 2 diabetes mellitus. Specifically, pain reduction was
significant for average pain, worst pain, least pain, night pain,
and pain ‘right now.’ Patient- and clinician-rated global
improvement scores were also significantly improved. In
addition, duloxetine at 120 mg/d appeared to work best on
pain described as shooting, stabbing, sharp, hot-burning, and
splitting. Patients treated with duloxetine not only reported
improvement on measures of pain but also used significantly
less supplemental analgesic as well. Furthermore, path
analysis showed that duloxetine affected pain directly rather
than indirectly through mood improvement.
In addition to relieving pain, treatment with duloxetine
was also associated with significant improvement in daily
functioning. In particular, there was a reduction of
interference with activity as measured by the BPI and
improvement in quality of life, as measured by the EQ-5D
scale. These effects highlight the clinical relevance of
duloxetine management of DPNP.
The reduction in pain severity demonstrated in this trial
is consistent with the previously reported findings that
duloxetine was effective in treating pain in animal models
(Iyengar et al., 2004) and extends the finding of reduced
severity of painful physical symptoms in depressed patients
treated with duloxetine (Detke et al., 2002a,b; Nemeroff
et al., 2002). These results are also consistent with human
clinical data on 5-HT/NE and known 5-HT/NE pathways
that suggest targeting both pathways is better than targeting
each individually (Sindrup and Jensen, 1999).
In general, duloxetine was well tolerated and safe
during this 12-week study. There were more discontinuations due to adverse events in the duloxetine 60 and
120 mg/d treatment groups than in the placebo treatment
group; however, only two adverse events (somnolence and
constipation) were reported more frequently by the
60 mg/d treatment group than by the placebo treatment
group. With regard to safety issues of central importance to
patients with diabetes, duloxetine does not appear to
adversely affect glycemic control, lipid profiles, or QTc
interval, or show clinically relevant changes in heart rate
and blood pressure (Detke et al., 2002a). The lack of
significant cardiovascular changes due to duloxetine
therapy in these patients suggests that duloxetine-treated
patients with diabetes mellitus do not require additional
cardiovascular assessments than they do for their underlying diabetes.
The efficacy of duloxetine 60 and 120 mg/d was similar
in this trial, but duloxetine 60 mg/d produced fewer
discontinuations for adverse events and a slightly reduced
frequency of treatment-emergent adverse events. Duloxetine is currently approved by the FDA for the management of DPNP at a dose of 60 and 120 mg/d. Although the
higher dose of 120 mg/d did not produce significantly
greater improvement than 60 mg/d and was less well
tolerated, it was safe and effective and may be an
appropriate dose for patients who require additional pain
relief.
The exclusion of patients with depression and anxiety by
the MINI was confirmed by the low scores on the BDI and
BAI. As a consequence, antidepressant or anxiolytic effects
by duloxetine could not be demonstrated; however, the
absence of depressive and anxiety symptoms at baseline,
confirmed by the results of path analysis, indicate that
analgesic effects were not dependent on improvement of
mood or anxiety symptoms.
4.1. Strengths and limitations
In this trial, the patient population was limited due to
exclusion of patients whose comorbid conditions and concomitant medications might have interfered with interpretation of efficacy or safety; thus, further study will be
required to generalize these findings to all patients with
DPNP. In addition, this condition requires prolonged
therapy and evaluation for a longer duration than the 12
weeks presented. Finally, future studies with an active
comparator would allow for a more complete evaluation of
the benefits of duloxetine in DPNP. Strengths of the current
study include the use of a randomized, prospective design,
multiple clinically significant measures related to both
efficacy and safety, and an adequate dose range to assess the
dose–response relationship. It is also important to note that
patients were not allowed to take other drugs used to treat
neuropathic pain.
In sum, this study demonstrates that duloxetine is
effective in managing DPNP and that this is not an indirect
effect of improved mood. Presumably, this effect is due to
the ability of duloxetine to enhance both 5-HT and NE
function in descending modulatory pain pathways. Thus,
duloxetine has a distinct efficacy in managing the persistent
pain condition associated with diabetic neuropathy and
efficacy in treating the emotional and painful physical
symptoms associated with depression.
