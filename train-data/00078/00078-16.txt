abstract
The mechanisms underlying central neuropathic pain are poorly understood. Pain inhibitory mechanisms
including sertononergic and norepinephrine systems may be dysfunctional. In this randomized, doubleblinded, placebo-controlled trial we evaluated the effects of duloxetine on pain relief (spontaneous pain
and evoked pain), tolerability, health status, and quality of life in patients with central pain related to
cerebrovascular lesions or spinal cord lesions. At baseline and eight weeks following start of treatment
subjects were evaluated with standard measures of efficacy: pain intensity (primary efficacy variable),
quantitative sensory testing, health status and quality of life (secondary efficacy variables). Forty-eight
patients received escalating doses of either duloxetine (60 and 120 mg/day) or matching placebo capsules. In both groups, patients started with 1 capsule per day. If pain relief was insufficient, patients were
titrated to a higher dose. A trend towards a decrease in mean pain score after eight weeks was observed
for duloxetine treatment (p = 0.056). Duloxetine alleviated dynamic (p = 0.035) and cold allodynia
(p < 0.001) significantly better than placebo. Tactile pain and pressure pain thresholds did not improve
significantly. The duloxetine group showed a significant improvement for the bodily pain domain of
the SF36 (p = 0.035). No significant differences were observed in the other domains of the SF36, the Pain
Disability Index, and the EQ-5D. While this trial showed no significant effect on pain intensity, duloxetine
revealed a biologic effect. It would be worthwhile to suspend our judgement and to perform more studies
to evaluate the role of duloxetine in modulation of the symptoms of central neuropathic pain.

1. Introduction
Central neuropathic pain (pain associated with lesions of the central nervous system) has been estimated to occur in up to 8% of patients after stroke and in about 40% of patients with spinal cord
injury [30,33]. The mechanisms underlying central neuropathic pain
are poorly understood. Aberrant neural activity in deafferentated
circuits, a post lesion imbalance between facilitating and inhibitory
neural pathways, and alterations in the processing of incoming
noxious and non-noxious stimuli are proposed as pathophysiologic
features of central neuropathic pain [24,28,40]. Neuronal hyperexcitability and disinhibition give rise to spontaneous pain, accompanied by hyperalgesia and (mechanical and thermal) allodynia which
may be particularly severe and distressing [21].
Despite the availability of multiple pharmacologic approaches
(evidence-based treatments with tricyclic antidepressants, gabapentin and pregabalin, opioids, and lidocaine intravenously), treatment for this kind of pain remains a major clinical challenge. In
view of this, pain reduction rather than pain relief has to be the
goal of any treatment [24,26,32].
Recently, duloxetine was shown to be effective in randomized
clinical trials of diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain and chronic
pain conditions, such as fibromyalgia [17,31,38]. Given the absence of other effective pharmacological treatments for central
pain, any medication providing some benefit in terms of symptom amelioration and quality of life improvement in patients
with neuropathic pain has to be evaluated. Therefore, we tested,
in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, the effects of duloxetine on pain relief (spontaneous pain and evoked

pain, e.g. allodynia and hyperalgesia evoked by mechanical or
thermal stimuli), health status, and quality of life in patients with
central neuropathic pain.
2. Methods
2.1. Patients
The study was approved by the medical ethical committee of
the Academic Medical Center (AMC). Eligible patients visiting our
outpatient hospital clinic (between January 2008 and March,
2008 inclusive) were recruited.
Prerequisites for entering the study included age 18 years or
older; written informed consent; suffering from severe neuropathic pain, visual analog scale score six and higher caused by lesion or dysfunction in the central nervous system. The pain had
to persist for at least six months, and had started after sustaining
the lesion or dysfunction in the central nervous system. Additionally, the disease process or lesion affecting the central somatosensory system had to be concordant with the distribution of pain.
Neuropathic pain was described by at least one of the following:
burning pain, paroxysmal episodes of shooting pain, or pain on
light touch. Additionally, patients had to score above three on
the douleur neuropathique 4 Questions (DN4) [5]. Patients were
not eligible or not recruited, if they: were pregnant; had a history
of intolerance, hypersensitivity, or known allergy to duloxetine;
had a known history of significant hepatic, renal, or psychiatric disorder; using antidepressants for treatment of depression. Patients
taking concomitant analgesic medication were allowed to enter
the study if neuropathic pain treatment was on a stable regimen
at least six weeks before start of the study. Analgesic treatment
with antidepressants, however, was to be discontinued at least
30 days before receiving study medication. No new analgesic therapies were to be initiated at any time during the trial.
2.2. Study design, randomization, and treatment
The study consisted of an eight-week double-blind treatment in
which a blinded adaptation in response to patients’ needs was
applied.
The randomization procedure consisted of three steps and was
conducted at the AMC Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Bioinformatics (CEBB).
First and prior to the randomization of patients, study codes 1
to N (the sample size) were assigned to the placebo or duloxetine
arm by simple, computerized random sampling (clorandm.exe)
and listed accordingly (step 1).
Second, consecutive patients who met all inclusion criteria were
randomly assigned to treatment with a flexible-dose placebo (1 to
2 capsules a day) or flexible-dose duloxetine (1 to 2 capsules of
60 mg/day) by a method of minimization while taking three prognostic factors, each with two categories, into account: diagnosis,
sex, age (step 2). These prognostic factors were weighed by 4, 2,
and 1, respectively, to reflect their relative importance to balance
for. Hence, diagnosis was considered the most important prognostic factor with age the least important one among these three. The
two diagnostic categories were central pain related to cerebrovascular lesions or spinal cord lesions; age was dichotomized by the
presumed median age of the base population of 53 years of age.
The randomization procedure by minimization was performed
using MINIM software written by Evans, Day, and Royston [2].
Once randomized, the patient was assigned a study code number manually selected at random (step 3) from the corresponding
list of study code numbers for the placebo or the duloxetine arm,
available from step 1.
The association between type of treatment and study code was
only known at CEBB and at the hospital pharmacy department.
Both departments were not involved in patient care.
The lists of study codes from step 1 were used by the hospital
pharmacist to prepare identical, correspondingly coded medication
bottles containing identical capsules of duloxetine or placebo.
Patients received escalating doses of either duloxetine (60 and
120 mg/day,) or matching placebo capsules (daily orally intake of
1 or 2 capsules) titrated at a one-week interval based on response
and tolerability. At baseline each coded medication bottle was supplied by the hospital pharmacist to the blinded treating physician.
In both groups, patients started with one capsule per day (containing either 60 mg of duloxetine or placebo). If the response (i.e. pain
relief) was insufficient (defined as a pain reduction of less than 1.8
on a visual analog scale), patients were given two capsules (i.e. two
capsules of either 60 mg of duloxetine or placebo). All patients received, respectively, active medication or matching placebo capsules and followed the same oral dosing schedule (once daily in
the evening). A single downward dose titration after a one-weekinterval was allowed, after which the patient remained on the final
dosage during the remainder of the study period.
Outpatient clinic visits occurred at baseline, at the start of the
randomized trial, and at the end of week eight. At weeks two, four,
and six, out-of-hospital consultations took place by telephone. Patients, pain specialists, and all other health care personnel involved
in the conduct of the study were blinded to individual treatment
assignments for the duration of the study.
2.3. Assessments
Before start of treatment, patient history and a physical examination provided information about the pain localization, pain characteristics, opioid use, and the need for adjuvant analgesics. The
patients’ existing medical therapy (including analgesics) was continued during the study period. The primary efficacy parameter
was pain intensity score recorded by the patients (at baseline,
end of each week, and eight weeks following treatment), on a visual analog scale (VAS), using a pain diary.
The mean pain score (in both groups) at the end was based on
the average of nine (VAS) pain scores measured regularly during
the last 72 h of treatment. Health status and quality of life (QOL)
questionnaires (secondary outcomes) were completed before start
of treatment and eight weeks following the start of treatment.
Health status and QOL measurements included the Pain Disability
Index (PDI), the EQ-5D, and the Medical Outcomes Short-form
Health Survey questionnaire 36 (SF36) [8,13,27]. In addition, the
Patients Global Impression of Change (PGIC) was gathered at the
end of follow-up.
The PDI asks subjects to rate the degree to which chronic pain
interferes with activities in each of seven domains: family/home
responsibilities, recreation, social activity, occupation, sexual
behavior, self-care, and life-supporting activities. The total range
is 0–70 points with higher scores indicating more perceived
disability.
The EQ-5D consists of two sections. The first section (EQ-5D
health status profile) contains a description of the health state in
five dimensions: ‘mobility’, ‘self-care’, ‘usual activities’, ‘pain/
complaints’, and ‘anxiety/depression’. Patients indicate for each
dimension whether they experience no, some, or serious health
problems. An individual health status profile results, e.g.: no problems with mobility and with self-care, some problems with usual
activities and with anxiety/depression, and serious problems with
pain/discomfort. Each health status profile is converted into a single utility score using a previously determined scoring algorithm
based on a time trade-off elicitation technique during interviews
with non-institutionalized adults from the general UK population
268 J.H. Vranken et al. / PAIN
152 (2011) 267–273
[23]. The utility score ranges from as low as minus 0.594 indicating
serious problems on all dimensions to unity indicating no problems at all. By convention, death takes the value of zero. The second section (EQ-5D VAS) indicates the perception by the patient
of his overall health on a 100 mm VAS (zero denoting worst imaginable health state, and 100 best imaginable health state).
The SF36 questionnaire compromises 36 items, which fall into
eight domains including physical functioning (Physical), role-physical functioning (Role), bodily pain (Pain), general health perception (Health), energy/vitality (Vitality), social functioning (Social),
role-emotional functioning (Emotional), and mental health (Mental). Responses are summed and then transformed into a scale from
zero (for poor health) to 100 (good health) for each domain.
The Patient Global Impression of Change measures the global
change from baseline according to patient on a 7 point, Likert
scale: very much improved, much improved, minimally improved,
no change, minimally worsened, much worse, very much worse.
Quantitative sensory testing (secondary outcome) was carried
out in the skin area with maximal pain or dysesthesia, before start
of treatment and eight weeks following the start of treatment.
Tactile pain threshold (static allodynia) was evaluated by calibrated von Frey’s filaments (nominal force: 26–1,10,000 mg,
Somedic Sales AB, Hörby, Sweden). The filament was applied vertically to the test site and slow pressure was applied until the filament began to bend. The time needed to bend the filament was
standardized to approximately 1–2 s and the stimulus was maintained for 1–2 s and then removed [25]. Von Frey hair applications
were separated by at least 30 s to reduce the likelihood of anticipatory responses. The von Frey filaments were applied in ascending
order of stiffness. If a VAS-score of 6 or more was reported for a given intensity, no stronger stimuli were applied. The intensity of
brush-induced (dynamic) tactile allodynia was assessed by stroking (three times) the most painfully sensitive area of the skin
gently with a brush (SENSELab™ Brush 05, Somedic Sales AB,
Hörby, Sweden). Allodynia was considered to be present if stroking
the skin evoked a clear sensation of pain. The intensity of allodynia
within the area of maximal pain was marked on a VAS (as the highest score of three consecutive VAS-scores). Cold allodynia was assessed by placing an acetone drop on the area of greatest pain.
Subsequently, patients scored pain evoked by this acetone drop
on a VAS. The intensity of mechanical static (punctuate) hyperalgesia to von Frey hair stimulation was assessed with von Frey hair
No. 16 (nominal force: 24,000 mg). Pinprick-evoked pain was
scored in a similar fashion as brush-evoked pain (as the highest
score of three consecutive VAS-scores). Pressure pain threshold
was determined using a hand-held electronic pressure algometer
(Somedic AB, Hörby, Sweden). A circular probe with an area of
1 cm2 with a pressure application of 30 kPa/s was used. Patients
were asked to indicate when they could no longer stand the pain.
The algometer recorded the pressure (kPa) at that point.
The safety of duloxetine was assessed based on the occurrence,
nature, and severity of adverse events.
2.4. Sample size, calculation, and statistical analysis
The sample size calculation was based on data from two recent
trials by our group in patients suffering from central neuropathic
pain [36,37]. Based on these trials, the average score on a visual
analog scale for pain was expected to be 7.3 for patients treated
with placebo. With a sample size of 24 in each group the study will
have 90% power to detect a clinically relevant 25% decrease in
mean VAS-score for pain from 7.3 (placebo group) to 5.4 (duloxetine), assuming that the common standard deviation is 2.0 and
using a two-group t-test with a 0.05 two-sided significance level.
Data were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis (ITT) including
the patients who received at least one dose of randomized study
medication. Normally distributed data are expressed as mean values (±SD). Non-normally distributed data are expressed as medians
with the interquartile range (IQR). Group differences after eight
weeks following the start of treatment were assessed using a
two-group t-test. In case of significant baseline differences between groups or in case of non-significant baseline differences
pointing in the same direction as significant differences at eight
weeks, correction for baseline scores was performed by analysis
of covariance or by two-group t-tests or non-parametric Mann–
Whitney U-tests of change scores from baseline, depending on data
distributions. Differences in PGIC were tested for significance by
applying the non-parametric Jonckheere-Terpstra test for ordered
alternatives. The numbers needed to treat (NNT) per patient with
a reduction of pain by at least 30% or 50%, respectively, are reported along with their confidence intervals [1,3]. The frequency
of reported adverse events was analyzed by Chi-square test or
Fisher’s exact test where appropriate. For all tests, a significance level of p < 0.05 was used. Statistical analyses were performed without prior knowledge of which group represented the placebo
group. The group code was unveiled just before the test results
were interpreted.
3. Results
3.1. Patients
Patient disposition is summarized in Fig. 1. Of a total of 85
screened patients, 48 patients were randomized and received
study medication. Thirty-five screened patients were excluded
for failing to meet the eligibility criteria. Two patients withdrew
after randomization, before taking any study medication and were
not included in the ITT population. They were replaced by the first
consecutively screened patients with identical prognostic characteristics to prevent disturbing the randomization procedure by
the method of minimization (see Section 2).
Patient characteristics, cause of central pain, analgesic treatment of the ITT population, and results from quantitative sensory
testing are shown in Table 1. The two groups (n = 24 per group)
were similar with respect to baseline demographic and disease
characteristics (diagnosis, baseline pain intensity, quantitative sensory testing, and analgesic treatment). Among the duloxetine-treated group, 15 patients were taking 120 mg per day, and 8 patients
were taking 60 mg per day. In the placebo group, 19 patients were
taking two capsules per day and 2 patients were taking one capsule
per day. At the end of the study, the mean duloxetine dosage (±SD)
was of 99.1 mg (±29.2 mg).
3.2. Pain intensity scores
Weekly mean pain scores for both groups are displayed in Fig. 2.
Mean pain intensity VAS-scores (±SD) before and after eight weeks
of treatment (end of trial) changed from 7.2 (±0.8) to 6.1 (±1.7) in
the placebo group (i.e. 15% pain reduction), and from 7.1 (±0.8) to
5.0 (±2.0) in the duloxetine group (more than 2 points on the VAS;
29.6% pain reduction). A trend towards a statistically significant
decrease in mean pain score at endpoint was observed for duloxetine treatment compared with placebo treatment (p = 0.05). A
covariance analysis of the same data to account for the small,
non-significant difference between the groups at the baseline
assessment (7.2 against 7.1) pointing in the same direction as this
trend resulted in a corrected p-value of 0.056. No difference in response to duloxetine was observed between patients with spinal
cord injury (n = 18) and patients with stroke (n = 6) (p = 0.61, data
not shown). The NNT per patient with a reduction of pain by 30% or
50% was 3.4 (95% CI: NNT (benefit) 2 to NNT (benefit) 46.8) and 24
J.H. Vranken et al. / PAIN
152 (2011) 267–273 269
(95% CI: NNT (harm) 5.5 to infinity to NNT (benefit) 3.8),
respectively.
3.3. Health status and quality of life assessment
The PDI, the EQ-5D health utility, and EQ-5D VAS-scores are
shown in Table 2. Follow-up observation showed no significant difference in the outcome scores between the two groups. However, a
trend towards a statistically significant decrease in PDI at endpoint
was observed for duloxetine treatment compared with placebo
treatment (p = 0.063, after correction for baseline differences).
The SF36 domain scores at baseline and eight weeks following
the start of treatment are presented in Table 3. Each of the eight
domains of the SF36 was analyzed separately. Duloxetine treatment led to a significant improvement in the bodily pain domain
(p = 0.035, after correction for baseline differences). No significant
alterations were reported in the other domains of the SF36.
3.4. Global impression of change
Four patients in the placebo group considered their situation
minimally improved, sixteen judged their situation unchanged,
and another four experienced a minimally worsening of the situation at the end of follow-up. In the duloxetine group one patient
experienced very much improvement, four much improvement,
six minimally improvement, ten experienced no change, one experienced minimally worsening and another one much worsening of
their situation compared to baseline. More often than the placebo
group, the duloxetine group had the impression that change had
occurred for the better (p = 0.014).
3.5. Quantitative sensory testing
Results from quantitative sensory testing are displayed in Table
4. Baseline measurements did not differ between both groups.
Maximum evoked pain score by brush (dynamic tactile allodynia)
(p = 0.019) and pain evoked by an acetone drop (cold allodynia)
(p < 0.001) were reduced significantly by duloxetine compared
with placebo. In contrast, there were no significant differences
among both groups for tactile pain threshold (static allodynia, calibrated von Frey’s filaments) and for pressure pain threshold
(determined with an algometer) at the end of the trial. Additionally, pain scores in response to mechanical pinprick stimuli
(mechanical static hyperalgesia) were not significantly modified
by the treatment with duloxetine.
3.6. Safety
Duloxetine was generally well tolerated with few reported side
effects. The most frequently reported adverse events were central
nervous system-related (dizziness, decreased intellectual performance, and somnolence) and nausea. The incidence of these

adverse events (mild or moderate in intensity) did not differ significantly between treatment groups (Table 5). Somnolence, however,
was reported significantly more frequently in the duloxetine-treated patients (p = 0.003).
4. Discussion
In this double-blinded, placebo-controlled study, a flexible-dose
regimen (60–120 mg, once daily) of duloxetine failed to show a
statistically significant improvement compared with placebo in
mean pain intensity change from baseline through eight weeks of
treatment. Additionally, duloxetine was not efficacious in reducing
disability or improving quality of life in patients with central neuropathic pain caused by brain or spinal cord injuries. There was,
however, a significant improvement in the bodily pain subscale
of the SF36 (secondary pain-related outcome measures) following
eight weeks of duloxetine administration. Furthermore, duloxetine
reduced significantly evoked pain produced by either brush (dynamic allodynia) or cold stimulus (cold allodynia).
The abnormal pain perception (spontaneous continuous pain
and abnormally evoked pain) in central neuropathic pain syndromes results from multiple mechanisms including neuronal
overexcitation of the NMDA receptor complex, involvement of
ion channels and alterations in the processing of incoming noxious
and non-noxious stimuli. Additionally, pain inhibitory mechanisms
including both serotonergic and norepinephrine systems may be
dysfunctionally contributing to the central sensitization and
hyperexcitability of the spinal and supraspinal transmitting pathways [24,28,39,40]. Thus, drugs targeting this imbalance in inhibitory mechanisms may reduce central pain symptoms.
Duloxetine has been shown to be efficacious in the prevention
and/or reversal of pain in several preclinical models of neuropathic
pain (attenuation of thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical
allodynia) in rodents [4,20]. Additionally, clinical studies have provided convincing evidence that duloxetine alleviates painful symptoms in fibromyalgia and painful diabetic neuropathy [17,31,38].
The efficacy of duloxetine in the treatment of central neuropathic
pain, however, has not yet been evaluated.
In our study, duloxetine produced greater reduction in pain
score than placebo but the treatment difference did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.056, after correction for small, non-significant baseline differences). Damage of the aforementioned
descending inhibitory pathways at spinal and supraspinal level,
produced by a lesion in the brain or the spinal cord may prevent
antinociceptive actions of duloxetine in response to noxious stimuli [6]. Secondary outcome measurements including the EQ-5D
(measurement of health), the PDI (assessment of disability) and seven from the eight domains of the SF36 (quality of life) did not differ between both groups at the end of the trial. The results from
these secondary outcome parameters are not surprising because
patient’s distress also results from other factors (than pain) which
add to suffering, including altered emotional well being, irreversible disabilities due to brain or spinal cord injury, changes in body
perception, changes in professional and social function, increased
dependency, and distress from retrospection [7,19]. Enhancement
of monaminergic function by duloxetine may have various consequences for nociceptive signalling with pain transmission pathways. Because specific signs and symptoms of neuropathic pain
may respond differently to treatment, symptom-based analysis
using quantitative sensory testing (including static, dynamic and
cold allodynia, mechanical hyperalgesia and pain pressure threshold determination) was performed [18,22].
The discrepancy in duloxetine responsiveness between the
different forms of evoked pain supports previous evidence suggesting that the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of these
signs/symptoms differ [10,15,35]. Patients suffering from central
neuropathic pain almost always experience thermal sensory
deficits within the painful area. In physiological circumstances,
application of cold is normal, effective for reducing pain sensation
(cold inhibition of pain). Cold allodynia seems to be the result of a
hyperexcitability of nociceptive pathways induced by central sensitization and/or disinhibition. Loss of thermosensory integration
results in loss of the mechanism for cold inhibition of pain (thermosensitive disinhibition hypothesis) [9,29]. Dynamic mechanical
allodynia is elicited by activation of mechanoreceptors that normally convey non-noxious tactile sensations. Hence, this pathological sensation can only result from profound abnormalities in the
somatosensory processing in the central nervous system [15].
These findings are clinically relevant because dynamic mechanical allodynia and cold allodynia are the most prevalent types of
evoked pain in neuropathic pain patients [12]. Additionally,
dynamic brush- evoked allodynia is clinically related to pain produced by wearing clothing on the affected area or inadvertent
touch and can be of disabling severity. In the present study the
severity of allodynia was reduced without a significant change in
overall pain. In this view, quantitative sensory testing distinguished specific subtypes of pain responsive to duloxetine. This
mechanism-based classification of pain instead of regarding central neuropathic pain (related to cerebrovascular lesions or spinal
cord lesions) as a single entity may lead to more effective

treatment targeting the underlying pain mechanism in the individual patient [32]. Alternatively, questionnaires, such as the Neuropathic Pain Scale and the Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory
assessing spontaneous ongoing or paroxysmal pain, evoked pain
(i.e. mechanical and thermal allodynia/hyperalgesia) and dysesthesia/paresthesia. These questionnaires, however, are not yet validated in the Dutch language.
Duloxetine-treated patients experienced a decrease in pain
intensity of more than 2 points on the VAS or approximately 30%
which is considered to be a patient-determined, clinically important response regardless of disease type, age, sex, baseline pain,
or treatment group [14]. Additionally, duloxetine-treated patients
scored significantly better than placebo-treated patients for the
bodily pain domain of the SF36. More often than the placebo group,
the duloxetine group had the impression that change had occurred
for the better (PGIC).
The inconclusive outcome of this trial (despite a sample size
large enough to detect significant changes in the primary outcome
measure) may be attributable to the higher placebo response (pain
intensity decreased with 15%) in this study which is inconsistent
with values shown in two other studies on central neuropathic
pain evaluating pregabalin (pain reduction in the placebo-treated
group of 7% and 1%, respectively) [34,37]. A high placebo response
in clinical trials is associated with a reduced likelihood of demonstrating statistical superiority of treatment compared to placebo
[11]. In our study, several strategies have been used to reduce
the placebo effect. A flexible dose of duloxetine was evaluated in
patients with central neuropathic pain. Trials with flexible-dose
design may, twice as likely, demonstrate significant differences between treatment medication and placebo than fixed-dose trials
[11]. Additionally, this study design aimed to reflect the real-life
management of neuropathic pain in which physicians tailor the
dosage of prescribed drugs based on individual patients’ responses
(i.e. adequate pain relief). In clinical practice, flexible dosing of a
drug optimizes the balance of efficacy and tolerability [16].
Although, well established and validated primary and secondary
outcome measurements were used to evaluate the outcome of this
study, valid biological markers would complement these more
subjective patient measures [11]. Hence, quantitative assessment
of evoked pain may be used as a relatively objective measure to
evaluate the effectiveness of neuropathic pain treatment.
4.1. Limitations of this study need to be considered when interpreting
these results
One might argue that patients in this trial did not receive the
drug for a sufficient length of time. Although, most studies, using
antidepressants for other neuropathic pain syndromes, have demonstrated pain improvements within 1–3 weeks, it is important to
emphasise that longer duration of treatment may be necessary to
confirm long-term treatment effectiveness (clinical practise) and
to demonstrate widespread beneficial effects of pain relief on the
various components of quality of life. Because our patients experienced severe pain, concomitant analgesic medication was continued during the trial. Neuropathic pain treatment, however, was
on a stable regimen and no new analgesic therapy was allowed
to be initiated during the trial. Additionally, the proportion of patients taking additional pain medication was well balanced across
treatment groups and analysis demonstrated a similar treatment
effect of duloxetine regardless of whether patients used any concomitant analgesics.
Fourteen patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria in the present
study previously participated in a randomized controlled trial on
the effect of pregabalin on central neuropathic pain. Eight patients
were randomized to the duloxetine group, the remaining six
patients to the placebo group. In addition, 13 patients in the
present study received (combination therapy including) pregabalin
as concomitant analgesic treatment; seven patients were randomized to the duloxetine group and six patients to the placebo group.
Hence, considering the apparently equal distributions of patients
over the two study arms, confounding by participation in a previous pregabalin trial or by concomitant pregabalin treatment in the
present trial seems unlikely.
Treatment with duloxetine was well tolerated. The overall incidence of side effects did not differ between the placebo group and
the duloxetine group. The most frequently occurring adverse
events, somnolence (significantly increased compared with placebo-treated patients) and decreased intellectual performance,
were mild in intensity.
In summary, this was the first study of duloxetine in patients
with central neuropathic pain. The study protocol was designed
to provide a regimen of treatment that is consistent with typical
product utilization (every day clinical practice) and allows the
individual to receive a dose that provides optimal efficacy and tolerability. While this trial showed no significant effect on pain
intensity, duloxetine revealed a biologic effect demonstrated by a
statistically significant reduction in the severity of dynamic and
cold allodynia, a significant improvement in the bodily pain domain and trends toward (p = 0.056) an analgesic effect and an
improvement in disability (PDI, p = 0.063). It would be worthwhile
to suspend our judgement and to perform more studies to evaluate
the clinical relevance of the role of duloxetine in modulation of the
symptoms of central neuropathic pain.
