Background Duloxetine, a selective serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor, has been shown to be effective in
treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain and approved for the management of patients with diabetic peripheral
neuropathic pain (DPNP) in the United States, European Union, and many other countries. This study assessed the
efficacy and safety of duloxetine in Chinese patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain.
Methods This double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, flexible-dose study treated adult patients with diabetic
peripheral neuropathic pain and baseline Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) 24-hour average pain severity ratings ≥4 with
duloxetine 60 mg to 120 mg once daily or placebo for 12 weeks. Dose adjustments of duloxetine or matching placebo
were based upon investigator’s judgment of clinical response. Change from baseline to endpoint in BPI average pain was
the primary efficacy outcome. Secondary outcome measures included BPI-severity and -Interference, Patient Global
Impression of Improvement, Clinical Global Impressions of Severity, EuroQol: 5 Dimensions, Athens Insomnia Scale, and
safety measures.
Results Of 215 patients randomized, 88.4% and 82.1% of patients in placebo and duloxetine groups, respectively,
completed the study. Mean change from baseline to
endpoint in BPI average pain was not statistically different
between the treatment groups (P=0.124). Duloxetinetreated patients showed significantly greater pain
reduction compared with those in placebo group at weeks
1, 2, and 4 (P=0.004, P=0.009, and P=0.006, respectively),
but not at weeks 8 (P=0.125) and 12 (P=0.107).
Duloxetine-treated patients experienced statistically
significant improvement in Patient Global Impression of
Improvement, Clinical Global Impression of Severity, area
under the curve for pain relief, BPI-severity pain right now,
and BPI-interference walking ability. Patients treated with
duloxetine 120 mg once daily showed significantly greater
pain reduction on the Brief Pain Inventory average pain
score relative to placebo. Duloxetine-treated patients
reported nausea, somnolence, anorexia, and dysuria
significantly more than placebo.

Conclusions Although the primary study endpoint was not
achieved, the overall observed response pattern suggests
the efficacy of duloxetine in the treatment of Chinese patients
with diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain. The safety profile
for duloxetine is similar to that reported in other global trials.

T

he World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that
180 million people have diabetes mellitus worldwide
and 50% of these people develop diabetic peripheral
neuropathy (DPN) (WHO 2008)1
 and 10%–20% of them
develop diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain (DPNP).2-4 In
China, 2.4% of the population in the age group of 24–64
years in 1995 had diabetes mellitus and the prevalence rates
are rising (WHO 2008). DPNP is a major cause of decreased
quality of life in patients with diabetes.

DPNP is a chronic, slowly-progressing complication of
diabetes mellitus typically occurring after prolonged
periods of suboptimal glycemic control.5,6 It is typically
associated with impaired function of peripheral sensory
nerves, although motor nerves can also be affected. The
pain is often described as an “aching, burning, stabbing,
or tingling” sensation, and it often affects sleep and
mood.7,8 The pathophysiology of DPNP, although not
fully understood, has been extensively reviewed.9
In chronic pain states, the endogenous pain inhibitory
mechanisms, both in the brain and the spinal cord, were
shown to be dysfunctional.10,11 Impairment in these
inhibitory mechanisms may be a part of the central
sensitization of the pain-transmitting pathways
contributing to the manifestation of chronic pain.12 These
pain inhibitory mechanisms are modulated by serotonin
and noradrenaline.10 Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are
widely used to treat chronic pain because these
compounds are known to modulate, among others,
serotonin and noradrenaline systems.13,14 The TCAs seem
to benefit patients with painful diabetic neuropathy13 and
other chronic pain conditions.14,15 However, TCAs as a
class are burdened by many side effects likely related to
their considerable affinity for a number of different
neuronal receptors.16 Duloxetine, a selective serotonin
and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor, has been shown to
be effective in treatment of DPNP17-19 and approved for
management of patients with DPNP in the United States,
European Union, and many other countries. Its safety and
tolerability profile also appears to be more favorable than
that of TCAs.20,21
This study was designed to investigate the efficacy and
safety of duloxetine 60 mg to 120 mg once daily
compared with placebo since the clinical data on the
efficacy and safety of duloxetine in Chinese patients with
DPNP were not available.
METHODS
Study design
This was a phase 3, multicenter, parallel, double-blind,
randomized, placebo-controlled study with 3 study
periods (Figure 1). Study Period I was approximately 3 to
30 days, during which patients were screened for study
eligibility. Study Period II comprised approximately 12
weeks of double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment.
Patients who met entry criteria were enrolled, stratified
based on presence or absence of major depressive
disorder (MDD), and randomly assigned 1:1 to either
flexible dose duloxetine or placebo. Patients within the
treatment groups were then randomly assigned 1:1 to take
medication either in the morning or evening. All patients
randomized to duloxetine were initially treated with 30
mg once daily for 1 week and increased the dosage to 60
mg once daily. The dosage was increased to 120 mg once
daily any time after 2 weeks in those patients who did not
respond to the duloxetine 60 mg treatment based on the
investigator’s judgment of clinical response. The dosage
was returned to 60 mg once daily in patients who did not
tolerate the increased dosage. Study period III was a
2-week, double-blind tapering period. Patients who
completed the treatment period entered the drug-tapering
period during which patients treated with 120 mg once
daily duloxetine received 60 mg once daily for 1 week
and 30 mg once daily for 1 week and those treated with
60 mg once daily received 30 mg once daily for 2 weeks.
This tapering period was conducted to reduce the
frequency of discontinuation-emergent adverse events.
This study was conducted in accordance with the ethical
principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and its
guidelines. The Ethical Review Boards at each
investigative site provided written approval of the study
protocol and the informed consent document. No
protocol-related procedures were performed before
patients signed the informed consent document.
Patients
Male or female outpatients ≥18 years of age who
presented with pain due to diabetic peripheral neuropathy
and had a rating of ≥4 on the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI)
24-hour average pain item (hereafter referred to as BPI
average pain) were included in this study.22 Patients had
to have daily pain for ≥6 months before entry into the 
3186 Chin Med J 2010;123(22):3184-3192
study and the pain must have begun in the feet with
relatively symmetrical onset. The disease diagnosis was
confirmed by a score of ≥3 on the clinical portion of the
Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument.23
Patients with unstable glycemic control (ie. glycosylated
hemoglobin >12%), and/or any medical or other
condition that could compromise participation were
excluded. Patients were also excluded from the study if
they had mania, bipolar disorder, psychosis, or were at
risk for suicide as judged by the investigator or had a
rating of ≥2 on question 9 of the Beck Depression
Inventory-II.24 Patients taking any monoamine oxidase
inhibitors within 14 days before visit 2 were also
excluded. Patients who had a history of hepatic
dysfunction or other serious medical conditions were also
excluded.
Treatment
Study medication was provided in capsules containing
either 30 mg or 60 mg of duloxetine hydrochloride as
enteric-coated pellets or matching placebo. Throughout
the study, patients took 1 or 2 capsules in the morning or
in the evening; however, the full daily dose of duloxetine
was contained in either the morning or evening study
drug dose. That is, for patients assigned to the duloxetine
treatment group, only one of the daily doses, either the
morning or the evening one, contained the active drug.
Efficacy measures
The primary efficacy outcome measure was the BPI
average pain item, which is a patient self-reported rating
of the pain severity over the previous 24 hours. Ratings
range from 0 (no pain) to 10 (pain as bad as you can
imagine).
The secondary efficacy outcome measures assessed in
this study were: BPI-severity (BPI-S) and
BPI-interference (BPI-I),22 which are patient’s assessment
of pain severity and its interference with function; the
area under the curve (AUC) for the BPI average pain
relief; BPI average pain 30% and 50% response rates
defined as at least a 30% or a 50% pain reduction,
respectively, from baseline to endpoint (defined as the
last postbaseline measurement obtained during the acute
phase of each patient) and sustained response rate defined
as at least 30% pain reduction from baseline to endpoint
with at least 30% reduction from baseline to any visit
preceding the last visit, and at least 20% reduction from
baseline at every visit in between; the Clinical Global
Impressions of Severity (CGI-S) which is the clinician’s
overall rating of the illness severity;25 the Patient Global
Impression of Improvement (PGI-I) which is the patient’s
perceived change in overall well-being;25 and the Athens
Insomnia Scale (AIS) which is a patient-rated scale of
sleep difficulty.26
Patient self-reported health outcomes were assessed at
baseline and at the last visit by the EuroQoL
Questionnaire-5 dimensions (EQ-5D) instrument. The
EQ-5D questionnaire consists of 5 items: mobility,
self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and
anxiety/depression. For each item, the patient chooses 1
of the 3 options that best describes his or her status. The 3
options reflecting increasing degrees of difficulty are
coded as 1, 2, or 3. Scores from the 5 items formed a
5-digit code that describes the respondent’s health state.
This 5-digit code is then converted to a weighted United
Kingdom (UK) and United States (US)-based index
(called EQ-5D index) using population values provided
by the UK and US EuroQoL group. The EQ-5D index
scores were used for the analysis.
Safety measures
During the study, adverse events were collected through
the patient’s spontaneous report at every visit, regardless
of whether events were perceived to be related to the
study drug. These events were captured as actual
verbatim terms and coded to Medical Dictionary for
Regulatory Activities terms from the Medical Dictionary
for Regulatory Activity (MedDRA version 11.0) by Lilly
medical personnel. In addition, discontinuations caused
by adverse events were recorded. Study site personnels
were instructed to alert Lilly of any serious adverse
events including deaths, prolonged hospitalization,
life-threatening events, persistent disability, and
congenital abnormality. For this protocol, suicidal risk
was also considered a serious adverse event. Vital signs,
including systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate,
and weight were collected at all scheduled study visits.
Standard laboratory tests, including chemistry and
hematology panels, were performed at baseline and at the
last visit during the acute treatment phase.
Statistical analyses
Sample size was determined using an 85% power to
detect treatment group difference of 1.20 points in the
baseline-to-endpoint mean change on the BPI average
pain rating between duloxetine and placebo treatment
groups. A total of 208 patients were to be enrolled, with
104 patients in each treatment group, to achieve the
treatment group differences estimated using a 2-sided t
test with α=0.05, a standard deviation of 2.5, and
discontinuation rate of 25%.
All analyses were conducted on an intent-to-treat basis,
meaning that data were analyzed for all patients who
entered the acute treatment phase, even if the patient did
not take the assigned treatment, did not receive the
correct treatment, or did not comply with the protocol.
Treatment effects were evaluated based on a 2-sided
significance level of 0.05 and interaction effects at 0.10.
No adjustments for multiple comparisons were made.
When the change from baseline to endpoint was assessed,
only patients with a baseline and ≥1 postbaseline
measurement were included. Missing data were imputed
using last-observation-carried-forward (LOCF) approach.
Unless otherwise specified, Fisher’s exact test was used 
Chinese Medical Journal 2010;123(22):3184-3192 3187
to assess the treatment difference for categorical variables.
When an analysis of variance (ANOVA) model was used
to analyze a continuous efficacy variable, the model
contained the terms of treatment and investigator. The
significance of treatment-by-investigator interaction was
evaluated in a separate model when necessary. Similar
logic was applied to an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA)
model, which refers to the ANOVA model with baseline
values added as a covariate. In this study, the stratifying
variable MDD status at baseline (Yes/No) was also added
to the above ANCOVA model for all secondary efficacy
analyses and health outcome analyses. Type III
sum-of-squares for the least-squares (LS) means was used
for the statistical comparison using ANOVA or ANCOVA
when there was no interaction term involved. For the
ANOVA or ANCOVA models where the interaction term
was included, the Type II sum-of-squares for the LS
means was employed.
For efficacy, variables collected at multiple postbaseline
visits, mixed-model repeated measure analysis (MMRM)
was also conducted. The model included MDD status,
investigator, treatment, visit, treatment-by-visit
interaction as fixed effects and patients as random effects,
as well as the covariate, baseline, and the
baseline-by-interaction. Unstructured variance-covariance
matrix was used to estimate within-group errors. The
Kenward-Roger method was used to estimate
denominator degrees of freedom.
Subgroup, including demographics and baseline disease
characteristics, change from baseline to endpoint in BPI
average pain was analyzed using the previously described
ANCOVA model, with additional terms of the subgroup
and the subgroup-by-treatment interaction. The primary
statistical testing was for the treatment-by-subgroup
interaction.
In addition to the described prespecified analyses, after
the unblinding, a post-hoc analysis was performed to
examine the efficacy in patients who remained on
duloxetine 60 mg once daily for the entire study versus
patients whose dose at any point was increased to 120 mg
once daily as measured by change in BPI average pain
rating. Statistical Analysis Software (SAS, version 9.1)
was used to perform all statistical analyses in this study.
RESULTS
The study was conducted at 11 sites in China by 11
investigators specialized in endocrinology. The first
patient visit occurred on December 19, 2006 and the last
patient visit was completed on February 5, 2008.

Patient disposition, demographics, and disease
characteristics
Of the 215 patients enrolled, 92 (84.4%) patients
receiving placebo and 87 (82.1%) patients receiving
duloxetine completed the 12-week acute treatment phase
of the study (Figure 2). The rates of discontinuation for
any reason were not significantly different between the
treatment groups (P=0.716).

Efficacy of duloxetine
The LS mean changes (±standard error) from baseline to
endpoint of BPI average pain, as assessed by LOCF, the
primary efficacy endpoint, were –2.31±0.18 and
–2.69±0.19, in placebo and duloxetine treatment groups,
respectively; these did not meet the statistical significance
(P=0.124). However, the results of the MMRM analysis
of the BPI average pain ratings over time showed
significant separation between placebo and duloxetine
treatment at weeks 1, 2 and 4 (P=0.004, P=0.009, and
P=0.006, respectively), but not at weeks 8 (P=0.125) and
12 (P=0.107) (Figure 3). The AUC analysis showed
significantly greater pain relief measured by BPI average
pain (P=0.048) in duloxetine-treated patients (158.7±13.4)

as compared with placebo-treated patients (129.0±13.0).
The secondary efficacy measures, as assessed by the
LOCF approach, are shown in Table 2. The BPI-S item
“pain right now” (P=0.012) and the BPI-I item “walking
ability” (P=0.016) were significantly decreased
(improvement) during the 12-week treatment with
duloxetine compared with placebo-treated patients (Table
2). Among the other secondary efficacy measures, CGI-S
(P=0.036) and PGI-I (P=0.028) were significantly
improved in duloxetine-treated patients as compared with
placebo-treated patients at endpoint (Table 2).
Patients treated with duloxetine had numerically higher
30% and 50% response rates on BPI average pain
compared with placebo-treated patients (Table 2).
Similarly, a higher percentage of patients in the
duloxetine group (62.5%) met the criteria for sustained
response as compared with the placebo group (50.5%),
but the difference was not significant (Table 2). All other
secondary efficacy measures, including health outcomes
measures, were numerically but not significantly
improved in patients treated with duloxetine as compared
with placebo (Table 2).
The results of the MMRM analyses of the BPI-S items
and BPI-I items are shown in Table 3. Results for BPI-S
average pain have been described above. For the
remaining BPI-S items, the duloxetine-treated patients
experienced significantly greater improvement compared
with placebo-treated patients via significant mean
decreases on the BPI-S least pain, worst pain and pain
right now ratings, BPI-I with mood, walking ability,
general activity, sleep, and normal work.
For the subgroup analyses, a significant treatment-bysubgroup interaction was observed on the analysis of
mean change from baseline to endpoint of the BPI
average pain for gender and duration of diabetic
neuropathy (Table 4). Duloxetine-treated patients in the

The significant interaction P values of subgroups are bolded for gender and
duration of diabetic neuropathy. BPI: Brief Pain Inventory; DN: diabetic
neuropathy; DPNP: diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain; MDD: major
depressive disorder; SD: standard deviation.
The mean change in BPI average pain did not exhibit a
significant treatment-by-subgroup interaction (P=0.543)
with respect to MDD status (Table 4). The difference
between placebo and duloxetine treatment groups (in the
MDD subgroup) was also not significant (P=0.811) due
to high placebo response (–3.05) as compared with
duloxetine (–2.69). The placebo response in patients
without MDD was much less (–2.16).
The post-hoc analysis of the mean change from baseline
to endpoint for the BPI average pain comparing patients
who remained on duloxetine 60 mg once daily for the
entire study, patients whose dosage of duloxetine at any
point was increased to 120 mg once daily, and patients
randomized to placebo found that there was a significant
difference between patients on placebo and those taking
duloxetine 120 mg once daily (P=0.014). Conversely,
there was no significant difference between placebo
versus duloxetine 60 mg once daily (P=0.772) or
duloxetine 60 mg versus duloxetine 120 mg (P=0.145).
Safety and tolerability
One sudden death occurred in the duloxetine group while
on 120 mg once daily. The patient, a 56-year-old man
with type 2 diabetes mellitus and a history of multiple
diabetes complications was hospitalized due to acute
myocardial infarction and multiple cerebral infarctions.
During the hospitalization, the patient experienced
respiratory failure and renal insufficiency but recovered.
The investigator stated that these events were not related
to the study drug or protocol procedure. Two days after
discharge from the hospital, the patient was dead, but the
cause of death was unknown. The investigator stated that
the death was possibly related to the concurrent
myocardial infarction, multiple cerebral infarction,
respiratory failure, and renal insufficiency. However, no
autopsy was performed.
Overall, the rate of serious adverse events was not
significantly different between the 2 treatment groups. A
total of 4 patients, 2 from each treatment group,
experienced 11 serious adverse events: 4 from the
placebo-treated group and 7 from the duloxetine-treated
group.
Compared with placebo, patients treated with duloxetine
reported a statistically significantly higher rate of the
following treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs):
nausea (P=0.001), somnolence (P=0.015), anorexia
(P=0.010), and dysuria (P=0.009) (Table 5). Among
duloxetine-treated patients, TEAEs reported at the rate of
≥10% were: nausea, somnolence, dizziness, constipation,
lethargy, and anorexia. Headache, dizziness, and
therapeutic response unexpected were TEAEs reported at
the rate ≥10% in placebo-treated patients. Significantly
more duloxetine-treated patients (16.7%) discontinued the
study due to any adverse event compared with
placebo-treated patients (3.7%) in this study (P=0.008).

DISCUSSION
This double-blind, placebo-controlled trial assessed the
efficacy of duloxetine 60 mg to 120 mg once daily over
12 weeks of acute treatment in patients with DPNP in
China. Mean change in BPI average pain from baseline to
endpoint, the primary outcome measure per protocol, was
not significantly different between duloxetine and
placebo treatment groups as assessed by the LOCF
approach. However, the BPI average pain was
significantly reduced with duloxetine treatment at weeks
1, 2, and 4 in an MMRM analysis. The separation
between duloxetine and placebo at weeks 8 and 12 was
not significant. It is important to note that the pain
reduction on BPI average pain with duloxetine treatment
(LS mean change –2.69 based on LOCF approach) is
about the same as reported in other duloxetine DPNP
studies with similar duration of treatment — for example,
–2.66 in the HMAW study,17 –2.66 in the HMAVa study,19
and –2.65 in the HMAVb study.27 In the current study, the
baseline-to-endpoint change in the placebo group was
substantially higher — LS mean change –2.31 — as
compared to the response in previous studies — LS mean
change –1.96 in the HMAW,17 –1.48 in the HMAVa,19
–1.82 in the HMAVb.27
In light of the observed placebo response and a number of
BPI-S and BPI-I items showing statistically significant
differences, along with the significant improvements
observed in the area under the curve, CGI-S, and
particularly PGI-I, the efficacy of duloxetine in the
treatment of DPNP among Chinese patients may be
suggested.
Although the 30% and 50% pain response rates were not
statistically significantly different between the 2
treatment groups, the observed treatment group
differences of 9.7% and 4.3%, respectively, in favor of
duloxetine are noteworthy since a 30% pain reduction is
considered to be clinically significant.28 In this study,
54.8% of the patients receiving duloxetine 60 mg to 120
mg once daily had at least a 50.0% pain reduction on the
BPI average pain item and 71.2% of these patients had at
least a 30% reduction.
It is difficult, with certainty, to identify reason(s) for
unexpected outcomes of any clinical study. Nevertheless,
one can propose several possibilities: (1)The impact of
ethnicity and cultural heritage on the complex mechanism
of placebo response is not fully understood,29-32 but a
higher placebo response in Asian studies compared with
western studies has been reported in a number of trials
using subjective outcome measures.33-37 (2)This study
included patients (19.3% in placebo and 16.0% in
duloxetine group) with MDD; these patients may have a
high placebo response. It is noted that 50% of
antidepressant trials involving MDD fail to demonstrate
differences between study drug and placebo.38 Thus, the
heightened placebo response to pain seen in the current
study may be related to the MDD inclusion criterion. (3)
Pain studies, because they rely solely on subjective
outcomes measures, occasionally fail even with the use of
an agent with proven efficacy.39,40 In this study, the
amount of pain reduction observed during the acute
treatment period is comparable to that seen in other
placebo-controlled studies in patients with DPNP,17,19,27
indicating the consistency of duloxetine’s therapeutic
response. (4) Diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain tends
to fluctuate on a day-to-day basis. It is possible that a
number of study participants, especially patients taking
placebo, had their office visits scheduled on days when
pain was scored below their average across the past visit
interval. That would also lead to a higher placebo
response. Use of patient diaries, particularly electronic
ones, would help overcome this methodological issue
since the weekly mean of average pain score would be
computed by averaging the daily score over the past
weeks. However, this study did not employ electronic
diaries and therefore cannot confirm this speculation. (5)
As shown in Figure 3, there was a sharp decrease of BPI
average pain ratings in the placebo arm between visit 5
and visit 6. Upon further examination, it was found that 7
placebo-treated patients and 6 duloxetine-treated patients
had average pain ratings that dropped by ≥3 points during
that period. From a clinical point of view, a change in
pain severity of this magnitude is inconsistent with a
chronic condition such as DPNP.
An important characteristic of this study is the flexibility
of the dosing regimen, which reflects common clinical
practice in which higher dosages are given only to
patients with a suboptimal response to lower dosages.
The post-hoc analysis of the primary efficacy variable by
maximum duloxetine dosage during the treatment phase
(60 mg once daily or 120 mg once daily versus placebo)
indicated a dose-dependent pattern of pain reduction
demonstrating a statistically significant greater pain
reduction in the duloxetine 120 mg once daily subgroup
compared with placebo, while only a numerically greater
reduction was observed in the duloxetine 60 mg once
daily subgroup.
Overall, the similar magnitude of pain reduction with
duloxetine treatment compared to global studies, and the
significant treatment difference compared with placebo in
many secondary efficacy outcomes, especially PGI-I
observed in this study, indicated that the patients taking
duloxetine indeed benefited throughout the study.
This study has some limitations. The treatment duration
in this study was only 12 weeks and could not assess
whether patients would benefit from a long-term
treatment. Since placebo-controlled studies of long
duration in painful conditions are considered unethical, it
is worth noting that a recently published open-label,
uncontrolled study in the western population showed that
the effect of duloxetine in DPNP was maintained over a
6-month period.41 Additionally, pain severity was 
Chinese Medical Journal 2010;123(22):3184-3192 3191
assessed using patients’ self-reporting scales and some
level of bias cannot be excluded. However, with pain
being a very personal and subjective experience the use
of a validated instrument like BPI in combination with
the clinicians’ rated CGI-S is a widely accepted practice.
The safety profile of duloxetine in this study with 100%
of patients of East Asian origin residing in China is
consistent with the findings of previous studies conducted
with patients of different origins.17-20,27 In general,
duloxetine was safe and well-tolerated during the
12-week acute treatment period. Significantly (P=0.008)
more patients in the duloxetine group (n=15)
discontinued the study because of adverse events
compared with patients in the placebo group (n=4).
Similar or slightly higher percentages of patients
discontinued because of adverse events in other
duloxetine chronic pain studies including studies of
fibromyalgia,42-44 osteoarthritis knee pain,45 and chronic
low back pain.46
The overall percentage of patients who reported ≥1 TEAE
in the duloxetine-treated group compared with the
placebo group was not significant. The most frequently
reported TEAEs in the duloxetine group were nausea,
somnolence, anorexia, and dysuria, and all were
significantly higher compared with placebo group. These
findings are consistent with those reported by patients
having other chronic pain conditions treated with
duloxetine.19-21, 44-47
In conclusion, although the primary endpoint of the study
was not achieved, the overall pattern of observed
responses suggests efficacy of duloxetine 60 mg and,
particularly, 120 mg once daily in the treatment of
Chinese patients with DPNP. The safety profile for
duloxetine is similar to that reported in other global trials.
