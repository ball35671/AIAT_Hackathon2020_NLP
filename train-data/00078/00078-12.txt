ABSTRACT
Indianapolis, Indiana, USA
Abstract Objective. Assess efficacy and safety of duloxetine, a selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake
inhibitor, on the reduction of pain severity, in patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain
(DPNP).
Methods. This was a multicenter, parallel, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial that
enrolled 348 patients with pain due to peripheral neuropathy caused by type 1 or type 2 diabetes
mellitus. Patients (N = 116 per group) were randomly assigned to receive duloxetine 60 mg once
daily (QD), duloxetine 60 mg twice daily (BID), or placebo, for 12 weeks. The primary outcome
measure was the weekly mean score of 24-hour average pain severity evaluated on an 11-point
Likert scale. Secondary outcome measures and safety were evaluated.
Results. Compared with placebo-treated patients, both duloxetine-treated groups improved significantly more (P < 0.001) on the 24-hour average pain score. Duloxetine demonstrated superiority
to placebo in all secondary analyses of the primary efficacy measure. A significant treatment effect
for duloxetine was observed in most secondary measures for pain. Discontinuations due to adverse
events were more frequent in the duloxetine 60 mg BID- (12.1%) versus the placebo- (2.6%) treated
group. Duloxetine showed no adverse effects on diabetic control, and both doses were safely
administered and well tolerated.
Conclusions. In this clinical trial, duloxetine 60 mg QD and duloxetine 60 mg BID were effective
and safe in the management of DPNP.

Introduction
iabetes mellitus is predicted to afflict 220
million people worldwide by the year 2010
[1]. The prevalence of diabetes in the adult U.S.
population is estimated to be 7.8%, and may be
as high as 12–14% in people over 40 years [2].
Approximately 30–60% of patients with diabetes

develop long-term complications of peripheral
neuropathy, and up to 10–20% of these patients
experience pain [3–5] often described as a steady
aching or burning pain and characterized by hyperalgesia, allodynia, and paresthesia [6–8].
Serotonergic and noradrenergic neurons have
been implicated in the mediation of endogenous
pain inhibitory mechanisms via descending inhibitory pain pathways in the brain and spinal cord
[9,10]. In pathological pain states, these endogenous pain inhibitory mechanisms may be dysfunctional, contributing to the central sensitization
and hyperexcitability of the spinal and supraspinal

pain transmitting pathways and manifesting as
persistent pain [11]. In rodents, duloxetine has
demonstrated efficacy in the formalin and capsaicin models of persistent pain, the partial sciatic
nerve ligation [12], and L5/L6 spinal nerve ligation models of neuropathic pain [8]. Preclinical
models of central sensitization suggest that duloxetine is effective in the treatment of persistent
pain [13]. This is likely due to the effect of duloxetine on central sensitization rather than on nociception, suggested by its minimal efficacy in the
tail-flick model of acute nociceptive pain. These
results are indicative of pain inhibitory effects of
duloxetine in the treatment of neuropathic, persistent, and inflammatory pain, but not in acute
nociceptive pain. Because central sensitization
and disinhibition mechanisms are believed to be
involved in the development and maintenance of
chronic neuropathic pain, including diabetic
peripheral neuropathic pain (DPNP), duloxetine
was considered to be a good clinical candidate for
evaluating treatment of DPNP.
Duloxetine hydrochloride (Cymbalta®) is a
selective serotonin (5-HT) and norepinephrine
(NE) reuptake inhibitor that is relatively balanced
in its affinity for both 5-HT and NE reuptake
inhibition [14] and it is the first U.S. Food and
Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug for
the management of DPNP. In a randomized, controlled, 12-week trial comparing duloxetine
60 mg once daily (QD) and duloxetine 60 mg
twice daily (BID) or 20 mg QD with placebo in
the management of 477 patients [15] with DPNP
and without depression, duloxetine was found to
be effective and safe for DPNP management.
Based on this evidence [15], two more independent studies were conducted to assess the safety
and efficacy of duloxetine 60 mg QD and 60 mg
BID in the management of patients with DPNP.
The first of these two studies [16] confirmed findings reported earlier [15], and the second study is
reported here.
Methods
Overview
Enrollment for this study extended from November 2003 to March 2004 and was conducted
in 26 centers worldwide. This was a Phase III,
multicenter, parallel, double-blind, randomized,
placebo-controlled trial. The study protocol was
approved in accordance with the principles of the
Declaration of Helsinki, and all patients provided
written informed consent.
Entry Criteria
Patients were eligible for the study if they were
≥18 years, and presented with pain due to bilateral
peripheral neuropathy caused by type 1 or type 2
diabetes mellitus. The pain had to begin in the feet
and with relatively symmetrical onset. The daily
pain must have been present for at least 6 months,
and the diagnosis was to be confirmed by a score
of at least 3 on the Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument (MNSI). Patients had to have a
mean score of ≥4 when assessed for 24-hour average pain severity on the 11-point Likert scale
(from the patient diary prior to randomization),
and stable glycemic control. Patients were
excluded if they were pregnant or breastfeeding,
had prior renal transplant or current renal dialysis,
or had a serious or unstable illness, symptomatic
peripheral vascular disease, or other medical condition or psychological conditions that might
compromise participation in the study. Patients
were also excluded if they had a current (≤1 year)
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) [17] Axis I diagnosis
of major depressive disorder (MDD), dysthymia,
generalized anxiety disorder, alcohol, or eating
disorders as determined by the Mini International
Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) [18], or if they
had a DSM-IV diagnosis or a previous diagnosis
of mania, bipolar disorder, or psychosis. Other
exclusion criteria included historical exposure to
drugs known to cause neuropathy, history of substance abuse or dependence within the previous
year (excluding nicotine and caffeine), a positive
urine drug screen for any substances of abuse
or excluded medication, or a history of a medical condition including pernicious anemia and
hypothyroidism that could have been responsible
for neuropathy, and treatment with a monoamine
oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) or fluoxetine within
30 days of randomization. Patients were excluded
if they had severe allergic reactions to multiple
medications, and prior participation in a study of
duloxetine.
Concomitant medication exclusions included
chronic use of antidepressants, antiemetics, analgesics with the exception of acetaminophen up
to 4 g/day and aspirin up to 325 mg/day. Antimanics, antimigraine medications, antipsychotics,
benzodiazepines, capsaicin, chloral hydrate, guanethidine, topical lidocaine, MAOIs, narcotics,
psychostimulants, oral and injectable steroids,
and anticonvulsants were excluded. Concomitant
medication inclusions (chronic and episodic) were
antacids, antiasthma agents, aminophylline, birth

control medication, cough/cold preparations (that
did not contain dextromethorphan), diuretics,
inhaled and topical steroids, hypoglycemics,
insulin, laxatives, theophylline, anticoagulants,
antibiotics, antidiarrheals, and antihistamines.
Medications including angiotensin-converting
enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor
agonists, antiarrythmics, anticoagulants, calcium
channel blockers, and others were allowed provided the patient had been on a stable dose for
3 months prior to enrollment.
Study Design
This study was designed to enroll 330 patients to
three treatment groups. With 110 patients per
arm, the study had at least 90% power to detect a
treatment-group difference of −1.20 points in the
baseline-to-endpoint mean change on the weekly
mean of 24-hour average pain severity between
duloxetine 60 mg BID and placebo treatment
groups. The sample size was determined using a
two-sided test with α = 0.05, and assuming a common standard deviation of 2.2 and a discontinuation rate of 35%.
Patients who met entry criteria following an up
to 3-week screening phase (study period I) were
randomized to treatment with duloxetine 60 mg
QD, duloxetine 60 mg BID, or placebo, with randomization performed at visit 3 in a 1:1:1 ratio.
Assignment to treatment groups was determined
by a computer-generated random sequence using
an Interactive Voice Response System. Patients
received either of (or a combination of, depending
on their randomly assigned treatment) the following: 30 mg capsules of duloxetine hydrochloride
or placebo capsules identical to duloxetine capsules. Patients randomly assigned to all treatment
groups were instructed to take two capsules (by
mouth) every morning and every evening. Study
period II consisted of a 12-week, double-blind
acute therapy period and 1-week study drug tapering period. Visits to the site occurred weekly for
the first 2 weeks, biweekly for the next 10 weeks,
and then weekly for the next week. All patients
randomized to duloxetine treatment were treated
initially with 60 mg QD. After 3 days, those
patients randomized to the 60 mg BID treatment
group received 60 mg BID. Patients in the 60 mg
QD treatment group continued at 60 mg QD.
At Visit 2 (week prior to randomization) through
Visit 10 (week 12), patients received a diary and
at Visit 3 through Visit 10 (week 12), patients
received study drug. At Visit 10, the patient’s study
drug dose was halved to 30 mg QD and 60 mg QD
for the duloxetine 60 mg QD- and 60 mg BIDtreated group, respectively. The efficacy and safety
evaluation of duloxetine versus placebo was conducted using data from the 12-week acute therapy
period where duloxetine 60 mg was administered
at a full dosage.
Efficacy Measures
The primary efficacy measure was the change in
the weekly mean of the 24-hour average pain
scores (referred to as the 24-hour average pain
score) as measured by an 11-point Likert scale
that was completed daily by the patients in a diary.
At Visit 2, site personnel dispensed daily diaries
and educated patients on proper completion of
the diary. The mean score in a week was determined by averaging the daily scores (among the
days in the week) on the 24-hour average pain
collected from the diary. Overall study diary compliance was defined as being compliant at each
visit in the study period from Visit 4 through Visit
10. A patient was considered to be compliant with
the diary at a certain visit if the patient completed
at least 80% of the diary over the total days since
the last visit. Scores for 24-hour average pain,
worst pain, and night pain were derived from the
patient diary collected at each visit. Protocolspecified response at endpoint was defined as a
30% reduction from baseline to endpoint in the
24-hour average pain score. Responses based on
50%, 75%, and 100% reductions from baseline
were also reported. Sustained response at endpoint was defined as a 30% reduction from baseline to endpoint in the 24-hour average pain
severity with a 30% reduction from baseline at a
week at least 2 weeks prior to the last, and with at
least a 20% reduction from baseline at every week
in between.
Secondary efficacy measures for pain were the
weekly mean of daily worst pain and night pain on
the 11-point Likert scale (collected from patient’s
diary), Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) [19], the ShortForm McGill Pain Questionnaire (sensory portion) (SF-MPQ) [20] (sum of 11 pain descriptor
terms—throbbing, shooting, stabbing, sharp,
cramping, gnawing, hot-burning, aching, heavy,
tender, and splitting; the pain intensity for each
pain descriptor was rated on a scale of 0 = none,
1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe), and
dynamic allodynia. Dynamic allodynia was
assessed by the clinician using a brush stroke (to
the same body location at baseline and endpoint)
to elicit pain severity from the patient. The patient
was asked to answer whether a brush swept over

the skin caused pain. The score range was from a
scale of 0 (no pain) to 3 (severe pain). The interference portion of the BPI was completed by the
patient to measure how much pain had interfered
with patient outcomes. Other secondary measures
included the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating
Scale (HAMD17) [21,22], the Clinical Global
Impression of Severity (CGI-Severity) scale [23],
and Patient Global Impression of Improvement
(PGI-Improvement) scale. The average daily
intake of acetaminophen taken for DPNP was
recorded.
Schedule of Assessments
The screening portion of the protocol (Visits 1–3)
included the medical history and the MINI [18]
to determine whether patients met criteria for
excluded primary DSM-IV Axis I diagnoses.
Patients also underwent a physical exam, electrocardiogram (ECG), and laboratory tests. At randomization (Visit 3), and at each subsequent visit
the diary was collected, vital signs were checked,
and adverse events and concomitant medication
were reviewed. BPI and CGI-Severity were
completed at Visits 3, 6, 8, and 10. The PGIImprovement was measured at Visits 6, 8, and 10.
The HAMD17, SF-MPQ, and dynamic allodynia
were measured at Visits 3 and 10.
Safety Assessments
Safety was evaluated by measuring discontinuation rates, treatment-emergent adverse events
(TEAEs), serious adverse events, vital signs,
weight, laboratory analyses, ECGs, frequency of
significant hypoglycemic events, and electrophysiology assessments.
Statistical Analysis
All analyses were conducted on an intent-to-treat
basis. Treatment effects were evaluated based on a
two-sided significance level of 0.05, and interaction effects at 0.10. The change from baseline to
endpoint (the last nonmissing observation after
randomization) on the continuous efficacy measures was analyzed using an analysis of covariance
(ancova) model with the terms of treatment, investigator, treatment-by-investigator interaction, and
baseline scores. When the interaction was not statistically significant, the treatment-group contrasts
were made from the model without interaction.
Type II sum-of-squares for the least-squares
means were used. Repeated measure analysis [24]
was used as the secondary methodology to demonstrate the invariance of the results and the time
course of the treatment effect. The model included
terms of the treatment, investigator, visit, and
treatment-by-visit interaction, as well as the covariate of baseline score and baseline-by-visit interaction. The unstructured covariance was used in
the model, and the analysis was implemented using
SAS PROC MIXED. An analysis of variance
(anova) model with the terms of treatment and
investigator was used to analyze the continuous
safety measures or the corresponding ranktransformed data (labs and daily average of concomitant acetaminophen use). Proportions were
analyzed using Fisher’s exact test. Time to first
response (30% reduction from baseline) and time
to the first visit where sustained response was
observed were analyzed by a log-rank test.
Path analysis [25,26] was used to assess the direct
treatment effect on pain reduction after accounting
for the possible treatment effect on mood. This
analysis tested the null hypothesis that change in
the 24-hour average pain score depended on
change of mood, as measured by HAMD17 total
score, versus the alternative that the reduction in
24-hour average pain score was due to a direct
analgesic effect of the treatment and was independent of the treatment effect on mood.
Throughout the article, the term “significant”
indicates statistical significance, and “mean
change” refers to “least-squares mean change.”
Results
Patient Disposition
A total of 475 patients were screened to enroll 348
patients who met entry criteria and were randomly
assigned to duloxetine 60 mg QD, duloxetine
60 mg BID, or placebo (116 patients in each
group). Fifty-two (15%) patients withdrew for all
reasons during the acute therapy phase, 15 (13%)
from the duloxetine 60 mg QD group, 21 (18%)
from the duloxetine 60 mg BID group, and 16
(14%) from the placebo group. Twenty-two
(6.3%) patients discontinued due to adverse
events, 5 (4.3%) from the duloxetine 60 mg QD
group (P = 0.72 vs placebo), 14 (12.1%) from the
duloxetine 60 mg BID group (P = 0.01 vs placebo),
and 3 (2.6%) from the placebo group.
Baseline Clinical and Demographic Characteristics
The majority of the patients in the study were
Caucasian (99.7%) with a mean age of 58.8 years
(Table 1). The mean duration of diabetes was
13.8 years. Type 2 diabetes was the most prevalent

(84.5%), and the mean MNSI score at the time of
screening was 5.0. At baseline, there was a significant difference between treatment groups for the
MNSI score, with placebo-treated patients having
a slightly higher score (P = 0.036). At baseline,
the mean dynamic allodynia score was 0.38 and
HAMD17 total score was 3.89.
Efficacy
In the mean change analyses, duloxetine 60 mg
QD and 60 mg BID were statistically superior to
placebo on the primary and all secondary measures
(Table 2) except for HAMD17 total score and
dynamic allodynia. After adjusting for the baseline
MNSI score, the P value for the primary analysis
did not change. There was no significant difference in efficacy measures between duloxetine
60 mg QD and 60 mg BID. The repeated measure
analysis showed that duloxetine was significantly
superior to placebo beginning 1 week after randomization and continuing through the study
in the analyses of the 24-hour average pain
(Figure 1), worst pain severity, and night pain
scores. Duloxetine was significantly better than
placebo in reducing BPI Severity scores for worst
pain, least pain, average pain, and pain right now
using both mean change analysis and repeated
measure analysis (Figure 2). There were no statistically significant differences among treatment
groups for study diary compliance.
Both duloxetine groups were superior to placebo on CGI-Severity and PGI-Improvement
scores, and demonstrated an improvement in the
total score of the sensory component of the SFMPQ. The 24-hour average pain severity response
rate at endpoint showed significant superiority for
both duloxetine 60 mg QD (68.14%, P < 0.001)
and duloxetine 60 mg BID (64.04%, P = 0.002)
compared with placebo (43.36%). A 50%, 75%,
and 100% reduction in the 24-hour average pain
response rate at endpoint was achieved by 30%,
11%, and 4% of patients, respectively, in the
placebo group, 50%, 20%, and 5% of patients,
respectively, in the duloxetine 60 mg QD group,
and 39%, 22%, and 8% of patients, respectively,
in the duloxetine 60 mg BID group. Duloxetine
60 mg QD (60.18%, P = 0.002) and duloxetine
60 mg BID (57.02%, P = 0.008) also demonstrated
significant superiority to placebo (38.94%) at
achieving sustained response at endpoint. Compared with placebo, patients in both of the duloxetine treatment groups achieved first response
and sustained response in a significantly shorter
amount of time (P < 0.001).
The path analysis for the 24-hour average pain
score showed that the direct treatment effect of
duloxetine on pain accounted for the major portion of the total effect (98.0% and 92.7% for
duloxetine 60 mg BID and 60 mg QD vs placebo,
respectively).

Duloxetine Treatment of Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathic Pain 353
adjusted for the concomitant acetaminophen use
still showed significant superiority of both duloxetine groups to the placebo group.
In the BPI Interference scale, both duloxetine
doses were significantly superior to placebo at
reducing scores in all measures (P < 0.05), except
relationship with other people item (P = 0.146)
and mood item (P = 0.053) for 60 mg QD-treated
patients (Table 2).
Safety
Of the 348 randomly assigned patients, 57 (49.1%)
placebo-, 71 (61.2%) duloxetine 60 mg QD-
(P = 0.086 vs placebo), and 73 (62.9%) duloxetine
60 mg BID- (P = 0.047 vs placebo) treated patients
reported at least one TEAE. Patients in both
duloxetine groups reported treatment-emergent
nausea, somnolence, hyperhidrosis, and anorexia
significantly more frequently than placebo-treated
patients. Additionally, vomiting and constipation
were reported by duloxetine 60 mg BID-treated
patients significantly more frequently than
placebo-treated patients. Twenty-two patients
discontinued during the therapy phase due to
adverse events (duloxetine 60 mg QD, 5 [4.3%];
duloxetine 60 mg BID, 14 [12.1%]; placebo
3 [2.6%]), with significant differences between
duloxetine 60 mg BID- and placebo-treated
groups (P = 0.010). Eighty-six percent of patients
who discontinued due to adverse events did so
during the first 4 weeks of the study. Vomiting
(3.4%) and nausea (1.7%) were reported as reasons for discontinuation in >1% of duloxetine
60 mg BID-treated patients. Ten (2.9%) patients
experienced 13 serious adverse events with no significant treatment-group differences. These included 4 (3.4%) placebo-treated patients (events:
anemia, cerebrovascular accident, chest pain,
chronic obstructive airways, dyspnea, melaena,
pneumonia), 4 (3.4%) duloxetine 60 mg QDtreated patients (events: atrial fibrillation, cholecystitis, diabetes mellitus, nephrolithiasis), and 2
(1.7%) duloxetine 60 mg BID-treated patients
(events: urinary calculus, ventricular extrasystoles). The weekly average of significant hypoglycemic events showed no significant differences
between treatment groups.
Duloxetine 60 mg QD-treated patients experienced a mean increase in alkaline phosphatase,
aspartate transaminase/serum glutamic oxaloacetic
transaminase, inorganic phosphorous, fasting
glucose, and uric acid compared with placebotreated patients. Duloxetine 60 mg BID-treated
patients experienced a mean increase in cholesterol, alkaline phosphatase, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and bicarbonate HCO3, and a
mean decrease in urea nitrogen compared with
placebo treated patients. These mean differences
were transient, and generally of low magnitude
and not considered to be clinically relevant. There
were no significant treatment-group differences
observed in any of the mean change analyses of
electrophysiology measures.
There was a slight but significant mean
decrease in weight from baseline to endpoint for
duloxetine 60 mg BID- (mean change [SD]:
−0.90 kg [2.39]; P = 0.006) treated patients compared with placebo-treated patients. There was a
significant mean increase in heart rate from baseline to endpoint for duloxetine 60 mg BID- (mean
change [SD] beats/minute: 4.22 [10.72]; P = 0.005
vs duloxetine 60 mg QD; P < 0.001 vs placebo)
treated patients compared with duloxetine
60 mg QD- (mean change [SD]: 0.47 [9.02]), and
placebo- (mean change [SD]: −0.82 [10.97])
treated patients. These changes were not of clinically relevant magnitude. There were no significant treatment-group differences in mean change
of systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Seventeen
patients (7 [6.1%] placebo-, 4 [3.5%] duloxetine
60 mg QD-, and 6 [5.2%] duloxetine 60 mg BIDtreated) experienced sustained elevation of blood
pressure (defined as a sitting diastolic blood pressure ≥85 mm Hg and an increase from baseline of
at least 10 mm Hg, or sitting systolic blood pressure ≥130 mm Hg and an increase from baseline
of at least 10 mm Hg, for three consecutive visits),
but the treatment-group differences were not
significant.
Placebo-treated patients experienced mean
increases in QT interval and PR interval compared with duloxetine 60 mg BID-treated patients
who experienced mean decreases in QT interval
(mean change [SD]: −10.44 [25.76]; P < 0.001) and
PR interval (mean change [SD]: −4.14 [14.81];
P = 0.006).
Twenty-three of the 348 patients reported at
least one adverse event that emerged during the
1-week drug taper phase (7 [6.0%] duloxetine
60 mg BID-treated group, 8 [6.9%] duloxetine
60 mg QD-treated group, and 8 [6.9%] placebotreated group, all events reported in <1% of
patients except hypertension [1.7%] in duloxetine
60 mg BID-treated patients), with no significant
treatment-group differences in the overall incidence of taper-emergent adverse events or in any
single taper-emergent adverse event.

Discussion
In this randomized, double-blind, 12-week trial,
duloxetine at doses of 60 mg QD and 60 mg BID
had significantly greater efficacy than placebo on
most outcome measures in the management of
patients with DPNP. Compared with placebo,
both doses of duloxetine significantly reduced
pain, beginning in the first week of management
and continuing throughout the 12 weeks of therapy. Response rates demonstrated greater pain
reduction for both duloxetine groups compared
with placebo, and patients in the duloxetine
groups were more likely to achieve a sustained
response over time. Farrar et al. 2001 [27] analyzed the pooled results of 10 placebo-controlled
studies involving patients with chronic pain syndromes (diabetic neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, chronic low back pain, fibromyalgia, and
osteoarthritis) in order to corroborate the association between change in pain intensity numeric
rating scale and an improvement in quantifiable
measures of clinical status. Their results indicate
that on average a reduction of approximately two
points from baseline on an 11-point pain rating
scale (shown to be equivalent to a 30% reduction
on pain severity from baseline) corresponds to a
clinically meaningful improvement. In this study,
the 24-hour average pain severity was reduced
about two points and the response rate (defined as
30% reduction from baseline to endpoint) showed
significant superiority for both duloxetine 60 mg
QD and duloxetine 60 mg BID compared with
placebo. Significant pain reduction was observed
on the 24-hour worst, and night pain scores,
respectively, thus stressing the clinical relevance of
duloxetine in the management of DPNP.
A significant treatment effect was observed for
both duloxetine treatment groups for most BPI
Interference items. Duloxetine was not statistically
superior to placebo on the HAMD17 total score
and dynamic allodynia. Given the dynamic allodynia rating at baseline of less than 1 on a scale of
0–3, the patients did not have much room for
improvement on this measure.
Duloxetine is known to be an effective antidepressant, raising the question as to how much of
the pain reduction effect may be attributed to
relief of depressive symptoms, and what would be
the impact on mood when the drug was used for
the management of pain on patients who do not
have MDD. The potential confounding relationship between pain and mood was recognized when
this study was designed, which is why patients
with a clinical diagnosis of depression were
excluded. This does not preclude the possibility
that patients had subclinical depression. Thus,
HAMD17 was used to measure the mood change
in the trial and the change in HAMD17 was taken
into account for the evaluation of pain reduction
by the path analysis. A HAMD17 score of ≤7 is
often used as an indicator of remission in the
MDD population. In this study, since patients
with a clinical diagnosis of depression were
excluded, the HAMD17 score at baseline was low
(3.89) and well below the standard remission criterion. This might explain the lack of an antidepressant effect observed in this study. The path
analysis showed that the reduction of pain was a
direct treatment effect on pain modulation, and
cannot be attributed to an antidepressant effect.
In addition, the analyses on HAMD17 total
showed that the mean changes from baseline to
endpoint were very similar between duloxetinetreated patients and placebo-treated patients,
which suggests that duloxetine has a neutral effect
on mood for those patients who do not have clinically diagnosed MDD.
Duloxetine is relatively balanced in its affinity
for both 5-HT and NE reuptake inhibition [14].
These results confirm findings from previous
studies where duloxetine 60 mg QD and 60 mg
BID demonstrated superiority over placebo in
improving DPNP [15,16], and are consistent with
data that suggest that drugs with inhibition of
5-HT and NE reuptake are effective in the management of DPNP [28]. These results are also
consistent with findings that duloxetine is effective
in treating pain in animal models [13] and in
reducing severity of painful physical symptoms in
depressed patients [29–31]. Since noradrenergic
and serotonergic neurons modulate the endogenous pain inhibitory pathways [9,10], the ability of
duloxetine to exert its effects on both these neurotransmitter systems may explain its effectiveness
in this clinical trial.
In the present study, there were no significant
differences between the duloxetine 60 mg QD and
duloxetine 60 mg BID treatment groups in efficacy outcomes. However, the study was not adequately powered to detect a difference between
duloxetine 60 mg QD and duloxetine 60 mg BID
treatment groups. Patients treated with duloxetine
60 mg BID took significantly less concomitant
acetaminophen during the study than placebotreated patients, and this finding provided some
evidence of additional efficacy of duloxetine 60 mg
BID.

Duloxetine Treatment of Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathic Pain 355
Both doses of duloxetine were well tolerated by
most patients and safely administered. Significantly more duloxetine 60 mg BID-treated
patients than placebo-treated patients reported
TEAEs, but these events were generally mild to
moderate in severity. Although 17 patients had
sustained elevation in blood pressure, several factors may explain this rate. The majority of patients
(73.6%) were known to have hypertension as a
secondary condition, and 7.2% of patients were
known to have diabetic nephropathy, which
predisposed them to elevated blood pressure.
Although observed, sustained elevations in blood
pressure were not likely to result from duloxetine
use, as four placebo- versus one duloxetine 60 mg
QD- and two duloxetine 60 mg BID-treated
patients experienced sustained elevation in blood
pressure. Duloxetine treatment did not result in
QTc prolongation. The lack of significant cardiovascular changes due to duloxetine therapy in
these patients and other studies [29,30,32,33] suggests that patients with diabetes mellitus do not
require more intensive assessment of their cardiovascular status when treated with duloxetine than
they require for their underlying diabetes. There
were no treatment-group differences in any of
the electrophysiology measures of nerve function,
indicating that the reduction in pain was not
related to deterioration of nerve function. Clinical
laboratory assessments, vital signs, and physical
findings were stable relative to baseline and no
clinically relevant differences were detected
between treatment groups.
Significantly more patients in the duloxetine
60 mg BID group than the placebo group discontinued treatment due to adverse events. Most
patients who discontinued due to adverse events
did so within the first 4 weeks of the study. This
could be due to the titration of duloxetine in which
patients were started on 60 mg QD and underwent titration to 60 mg BID over just 3 days, suggesting that some patients would have better
tolerability with a lower duloxetine starting dose
and slower titration.
Several limitations of this study should be considered. The results are based on an acute treatment trial of 12 weeks, and may not generalize to
a longer duration of treatment, and DPNP, a
chronic condition, likely requires management for
more than 12 weeks. Further evaluation of the
long-term efficacy of duloxetine on DPNP would
be required to assess the effects on progression of
neuropathy. Since patients were selected from
among those with very limited or stable medical
conditions, and stable doses of concomitant medications, the generalizability of the results to typical outpatients is limited.
In summary, this randomized, placebocontrolled study provides substantial evidence and
confirms previously reported findings that treatment with duloxetine 60 mg QD and 60 BID for
up to 12 weeks is safe and effective in the management of DPNP.
