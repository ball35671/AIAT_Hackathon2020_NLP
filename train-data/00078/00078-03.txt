Flexible Dosed Duloxetine in the Treatment of
Fibromyalgia: A Randomized, Double-blind,
Placebo-controlled Trial

and MADELAINE M. WOHLREICH
ABSTRACT. Objective. To investigate the efficacy of flexible dose duloxetine 60–120 mg/day on changes in
fibromyalgia (FM) symptoms assessed by the Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I)
scale.
Methods. Outpatients ≥ 18 years of age who met American College of Rheumatology criteria for
FM, and had ≥ 4 score on the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) average pain item, were randomized to
duloxetine (n = 263) or placebo (n = 267) for 24 week double-blind treatment (primary endpoint at
Week 12). Key secondary measures included BPI average pain severity, patient-rated scales assessing mood, anxiety, pain, sleep, and stiffness, Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S),
Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory, Cognitive and Physical Functioning Questionnaire, Beck
Depression Inventory (BDI), Beck Anxiety Inventory, and Medical Outcome Study Short-Form
Health Survey (SF-36).
Results. At Week 12, duloxetine-treated patients reported significantly greater global improvement
with mean PGI-I scores of 2.8 compared to 3.4 in the placebo group (p < 0.001). Significantly more
duloxetine- versus placebo-treated patients (57% vs 32%; p < 0.001) reported feeling “much” or
“very much better” (PGI-I score ≤ 2). There was significantly greater improvement with duloxetine
versus placebo treatment in BPI average pain severity, mood (including BDI total), anxiety
(patient-rated only), stiffness, CGI-S, fatigue, all SF-36 domains (except role-physical and physical
component summary), and being less bothered by pain or sleep difficulties. Treatment-emergent
adverse events occurring significantly more frequently with duloxetine included: nausea, headache,
constipation, dry mouth, dizziness, diarrhea, and hyperhidrosis.
Conclusion. Treatment with duloxetine 60, 90, and 120 mg/day was associated with feeling much
better, pain reduction, being less bothered by sleep difficulties, and improvement in mood, stiffness,
fatigue and functioning. (Clinical trial registry NCT00673452). (First Release Sept 15 2010;

Fibromyalgia (FM) is characterized by chronic widespread
musculoskeletal pain and tenderness1. Other symptoms
commonly associated with FM include fatigue, stiffness,
nonrestorative sleep, depressed mood, anxiety, and cognitive difficulties2. The chronicity and severity of FM symptoms negatively influence quality of life and lead to functional impairment and disability3. FM affects about 2%–4%
of the population in the United States and is more frequently reported in women than men4.
There is emerging evidence of the underlying mechanisms responsible for FM symptoms. Dysfunction of serotonin and norepinephrine transmission, which mediate
endogenous analgesic mechanisms via the descending
inhibitory pain pathways in the central nervous system, may
play a key role. Individuals with dysfunctional pain inhibition often experience abnormal or heightened pain sensitivity5, which is common in patients with FM6. Imbalance or
deficiency in serotonin and norepinephrine is also associated with depression, anxiety, and cognitive deficits7.
Research suggests that treatment with serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI) increases transmission
of these neurotransmitters and improves disease states associated with serotonin and norepinephrine deficiencies8.

potent SNRI that has US Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) approval for management of major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, pain due to diabetic
peripheral neuropathy, and FM. Several clinical questions
that were not completely answered in prior trials of duloxetine in FM included the range of optimal dosing and efficacy treating other common symptoms reported by patients
with FM such as fatigue, difficulty sleeping, and cognitive
impairment. Although the dosage approved by the FDA for
treatment of FM is 60 mg/day, previous studies assessed 120
mg/day (administered either as 60 mg twice daily or 120 mg
once daily)9,10,11,12, and the results suggested that this dose
may provide additional efficacy on some secondary measures. However, the 120 mg dose was less well tolerated,
with higher dropout rates due to adverse events10,11, suggesting that an intermediate dose (e.g., 90 mg/day) may be
better tolerated. The current randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group trial of duloxetine was
designed to address some of these important clinically relevant questions using the Patient Global Impression of
Improvement as the primary outcome measure. We report
the safety and efficacy of flexible dose duloxetine 60
mg/day, 90 mg/day, and 120 mg/day in the treatment of FM
from the first 12 weeks (primary endpoint) of the 24-week
study. The results of the continuation phase of the study will
be presented separately.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Overview. This phase IV study was conducted under protocol
FIJ-US-HMGB (trial registration NCT00673452) in 48 research centers in
the United States and Puerto Rico. Enrollment began June 2, 2008, and the
study was completed July 31, 2009. The institutional review boards
approved the protocol, which was developed in accord with the ethical
guidelines of good clinical practice and the Declaration of Helsinki. All
patients provided written consent after the study was explained and their
questions answered, and before study procedures were initiated. Patients
were identified by physician referral or public announcements directed
towards individuals with FM.
Entry criteria. Male and female outpatients were eligible for the study if
they were ≥ 18 years of age, met criteria for FM as defined by the American
College of Rheumatology1, and scored ≥ 4 on the average pain item of the
Brief Pain Inventory (BPI; modified short form)13 at visit 1 (screening) and
visit 2 (randomization). Patients were included if they were judged to be
reliable and had a level of understanding that allowed them to communicate
intelligibly and provide informed consent.
Patients were excluded if they had any of the following: current or diagnosed within the past year with any primary psychiatric disorder other than
major depressive disorder (MDD) or generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)
defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,
Fourth Edition (DSM-IV); clinically judged to be at serious risk of suicide;
had any unstable medical illness that was likely to require intervention or
hospitalization; pain symptoms unrelated to FM that could interfere with
interpretation of outcome measures; regional pain syndromes; multiple surgeries or failed back syndrome; a confirmed current or previous diagnosis
of rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory arthritis, or other autoimmune disease; severe liver disease; pregnant or breast-feeding; or history of substance abuse within the past year. Patients were also excluded if they had
been treated with an adequate trial of duloxetine and did not respond or
could not tolerate duloxetine; were judged by the opinion of the investigator to be treatment-refractory in FM; or those in whom treatment response
might be compromised by disability compensation issues.
Prior to randomization, patients were required to discontinue any medications that might interfere with the evaluation of pain improvement,
including analgesics (with the exception of up to 325 mg/day of aspirin for
cardiac prophylaxis and acetaminophen up to 2 g/day for pain), all anti -
depressants, including tricyclics, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and SNRI. Patients entering the study on stable sleep medication were allowed to continue the medication during the
study. Episodic use (up to 3 nights per week) of chloral hydrate, zolpidem,
zopiclone, and zaleplon were allowed to facilitate sleep. Patients were
encouraged not to initiate or alter ongoing nonconventional/alternative
therapies such as acupuncture, biofeedback, or cognitive-behavioral therapy for the duration of the study.
Study design. This was a 24-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled trial to confirm the efficacy of duloxetine (60 mg–120
mg once daily) on patient-rated global improvement in FM symptoms.
There was a 5 to 30 day screening phase, during which patients were to
wash out excluded medications prior to study entry at visit 2. A minimum
of 7 days of washout was required for most medications, but monoamine
oxidase inhibitors required a minimum of 14 days, and fluoxetine required
30 days. For evaluation of the primary endpoint, the acute phase was 12
weeks’ duration, double-blind, and placebo-controlled. After Week 12,
patients in the placebo group were transitioned to active treatment and all
patients continued for an additional 12 weeks of double-blind treatment.
Results of the continuation phase will be reported separately. An optional
2-week drug-tapering phase was offered at the end of the 12-week continuation phase or for patients who discontinued early after receiving at least
2 weeks of study medication.
Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 in a double-blind fashion to duloxetine 60 mg once daily (QD) or placebo by a computer-generated random
sequence using an interactive voice response system (IVRS). The protocol
employed a variable transition to active treatment strategy, whereby investigators and patients were told that active study drug would be initiated
sometime between randomization and Week 4, thereby blinding the onset
of active treatment to reduce the patient’s expectations of experiencing side
effects or improved symptoms. For patients randomized to duloxetine,
active medication was initiated the morning after the randomization visit.
Duloxetine was initiated at 30 mg QD and was escalated to 60 mg QD after
1 week. At the Week 4 and Week 8 visits, duloxetine dose was automatically escalated via IVRS by 30 mg QD for those patients who had < 50%
reduction from baseline in their BPI 24-hour pain score and the investigator had endorsed a dose increase. Dose escalation/reduction was
double-blind, and neither the patient nor the investigator was informed
whether dose escalation/reduction had occurred. If the patient could not tolerate the dose increase, it was reduced to the pre-escalation dose via IVRS.
During the drug-tapering phase, those patients who had received duloxetine 60 mg QD experienced dosage reduction to 30 mg QD for 1 week and
then received placebo for a second week. The dosage of patients who had
received duloxetine 90 mg QD or 120 mg QD was reduced to 60 mg QD
for 1 week, then 30 mg QD for a second week.
Efficacy measures. The protocol-defined primary outcome measure was the
Patient’s Global Impressions of Improvement (PGI-I)14. This is a categorical scale on which patients provide ratings of their overall impression of
how they are feeling since treatment began with the following choices: 1 =
very much better, 2 = much better, 3 = a little better, 4 = no change, 5 = a
little worse, 6 = much worse, 7 = very much worse.
Secondary outcome measures included the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI;
short form); the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI)15; the Clinical
Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S)14; the Patient’s Global Impressions
of Severity (PGI-S)14 (assessed only at baseline); the Massachusetts General
Hospital Cognitive and Physical Functioning Questionnaire (CPFQ)16; the
Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI)17; the Beck Depression Inventory-II
(BDI-II)18; the 36-item Medical Outcome Study Short-Form Health Survey

(SF-36)19; and 11-point Likert scales assessing severity of depressed mood,
anxiety, stiffness, and how much the patient is bothered by sleep difficulty
and pain (score range 0 = not present to 10 = extremely).
Formal cognitive assessment with standardized tests was conducted in
a subset of patients at selected sites as an exploratory outcome, and these
results will be presented separately.
Tolerability and safety measures included incidence of discontinuation
due to adverse events, treatment-emergent adverse events, changes in vital
signs, and changes in standard laboratory variables that included blood
count, electrolytes, and liver function.
Statistical methods. The primary objective of the study was to determine
whether duloxetine 60–120 mg QD provided significant improvement
compared with placebo in the PGI-I at the Week 12 endpoint. The study
was designed to enroll 261 patients in each treatment group in order to have
at least 85% power to detect a difference of –0.4 points on the PGI-I
between treatment with duloxetine versus placebo. The a priori protocoldefined difference at endpoint was estimated using a mixed-effects model
repeated measures (MMRM) approach20.
Secondary outcomes were included to provide additional assessments
of duloxetine’s efficacy in treating FM and to provide a better understanding of duloxetine’s effect on other symptom domains associated with FM.
Analyses were done on an intent-to-treat basis. All randomized patients
with a baseline and at least one post-baseline visit were included in the efficacy analyses, and all randomized patients were included in the safety
analyses. All tested hypotheses were considered statistically significant if
the 2-sided p value was ≤ 0.05 unless otherwise specified.
A restricted maximum likelihood-based MMRM analysis was utilized
on longitudinal changes from baseline for continuous efficacy measures.
The MMRM approach accounts for bias caused by non-random missing data
due to early discontinuation because of adverse events or lack of efficacy
better than the last observation carried forward (LOCF) method20. The
model included the fixed categorical effects of treatment, investigator, visit,
and treatment-by-visit interaction, as well as the continuous, fixed covariates of baseline score and baseline score-by-visit interaction. An unstructured covariance matrix was used to model the within-patient errors.
Significance tests were based on least-squares means and Type III
sum-of-squares. Efficacy results presented are from the MMRM analysis
unless otherwise noted. LOCF changes from baseline to endpoint were analyzed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with the terms of
treatment, investigator, and baseline scores. Mean refers to the least-squares
mean, which is the estimated mean from a specific model (MMRM or
LOCF ANCOVA). Continuous baseline measures were evaluated using
fixed effects (treatment, investigator) analysis of variance (ANOVA), and
categorical baseline measures were evaluated using Fisher’s exact test.
Continuous safety measures were analyzed using MMRM, ANOVA, or
ANCOVA as described above, and categorical safety measures were analyzed using Fisher’s exact test. Rank-transformed laboratory analytes were
analyzed using the ANOVA model to assess treatment differences.
Pain response was defined 2 ways: as at least a 30% and at least a 50%
reduction from baseline to endpoint in BPI average pain score. Sustained
response was defined as at least 30% reduction from baseline to LOCF endpoint, with at least 30% reduction from baseline at an earlier visit than the
last visit, and remained at least a 20% reduction from baseline at every visit
in between, if there were any intervening visits. In addition, response was
also observed using the baseline observation carried forward (BOCF) to the
endpoint approach in which endpoints were imputed with corresponding
baseline values if the patients dropped out early in the study.
The influence of a specific subgroup (age, gender, ethnic origin, and
baseline MDD/GAD status) on the PGI-I at endpoint was analyzed using an
ANCOVA model with all the terms described above and the additional
terms of the subgroup and the subgroup-by-treatment interaction. The primary statistical testing was for the treatment-by-subgroup interaction,
which was tested at level 0.1 in order to identify the heterogeneity of treatment effects across subgroups. Treatment group differences were evaluated
within each category of a subgroup regardless of the significance level of
the treatment-by-subgroup interaction. For the subgroup of origin, all the
ethnic groups that had fewer than 10% of the patients in the study were
combined.
RESULTS
Patient disposition and characteristics. Patient disposition
is summarized in Figure 1. A total of 824 patients were
screened to enroll 530 patients who met the entry criteria
and were randomly assigned duloxetine 60–120 mg/day
(n = 263) or placebo (n = 267). The percentage of patients in
each treatment group who completed the first 12 weeks of
the study was 66.9% and 70.0% (p = 0.456), respectively.
The most frequently reported reason for discontinuation was
experiencing an adverse event, which was significantly
more frequent in the duloxetine group (15.6%) as compared
with placebo (9.0%; p = 0.024). Other reasons for discontinuation did not differ significantly between treatments.
There were no statistically significant between-treatment
group differences in demographic characteristics. The
majority of the patients were female (93.2%), with a mean
age of 50.2 ± 11.1 years; 77.4% were Caucasian and 15.7%
were Hispanic. Fewer than 20% of the study population had
a diagnosis of comorbid MDD and fewer than 10% had a
diagnosis of comorbid GAD. Table 1 summarizes baseline
clinical assessments, which did not have significant
between-treatment group differences. Overall, pain severity
was moderate, with mean BPI average pain scores of 6.5 ±
1.6. Patients reported baseline stiffness and being bothered
by pain and sleep difficulties. About 19% of the patients
entered the study on stable sleep medications, which they
could continue unchanged during the study. About 21% of
patients in both the placebo and duloxetine groups took
sleep medication during the study, including the patients on
stable sleep medication and those who took intermittent
sleep medication up to 3 nights per week after baseline.
Overall, patients reported feeling mildly to moderately ill at
baseline, and the clinical impression of their illness severity
was moderate.
Efficacy. After 12 weeks of treatment, patients who received
duloxetine versus placebo had significantly reduced
(improved) mean PGI-I scores (2.8 vs 3.4; p < 0.001).
Significant between-treatment differences in the mean PGI-I
scores began with the visit that followed treatment initiation,
and these differences continued to be significant at each subsequent visit to endpoint (Figure 2). At endpoint, the percentage of patients treated with duloxetine who felt “much
better” (PGI-I score of 2) to “very much better” (PGI-I score
of 1) was significantly greater than among patients treated
with placebo (57% vs 32%; p < 0.001). Treatment-by-subgroup interaction on the average LOCF endpoint PGI-I was
not significant for age (p = 0.315), sex (p = 0.468), race
(p = 0.461), comorbid depression (p = 0.621), or comorbid
anxiety (p = 0.405).
Improvement in secondary efficacy measures was signifRheumatology

Arnold, et al: Duloxetine and patient improvement 2581
icantly greater in patients treated with duloxetine compared
to placebo for CGI-S, all MFI subscales, BPI pain severity
(Table 2) and average pain interference scores (Figure 3),
and BDI total scores for depression severity (Table 3). In
addition, patients treated with duloxetine versus placebo had
significantly greater mean changes in improvement from
baseline on Likert scale scores rating severity of depressed
mood, anxiety, and stiffness, and being bothered by pain and
sleep difficulties (Figure 4). Throughout the study, 21% of
the patients took concomitant sleep medication.
Duloxetine treatment was also associated with significant
improvement on the SF-36 mental component summary and
the following domains: bodily pain, general health, mental
health, physical functioning, role-emotional, social functioning, and vitality (Table 3).
Cognitive and physical functioning assessed by the
CPFQ total score at baseline revealed that patients in both
treatment groups on average had moderately diminished
functioning (Table 1). After 12 weeks of treatment, endpoint
scores had improved to “minimally diminished” in both
groups, and between-treatment differences were not significant (Table 2).
Treatment with duloxetine versus placebo was associated
with significantly greater response rates defined as a 30%
and a 50% improvement from baseline in BPI 24-hour average pain severity utilizing both LOCF and BOCF methods
(Table 4). In addition, treatment with duloxetine versus
placebo was associated with significantly more patients who
experienced at least a 2 point decrease from baseline to the
12-week endpoint (LOCF) in BPI 24-hour average pain
severity, but there was no between-treatment significance on
this measure with BOCF analysis. The number of patients
who sustained a 30% improvement in BPI 24-hour average
pain to endpoint (LOCF) was significantly greater in duloxetine- versus placebo-treated patients.
The final dose distributions of duloxetine at Week 12
were: 60 mg, n = 137 (52.1%); 90 mg, n = 62 (23.6%); and
120 mg, n = 64 (24.3%). Mean BPI 24-hour average pain
scores and PGI-I scores reported by patients before and after
dose increase are summarized in Table 5. Overall, there was
a significant improvement in pain severity for patients who
were escalated to and stayed on the 90 mg dose. Significant
improvement in pain was also seen for patients who were
escalated to 120 mg. PGI-I scores improved from feeling

“better” to “much better” after dose escalation to 90 mg, but
scores remained the same after dose escalation to 120 mg.
Safety. Of the 530 randomly assigned patients, significantly
more patients treated with duloxetine (n = 218, 82.9%)
reported having at least one adverse event as compared with
placebo-treated patients (n = 191, 71.5%; p = 0.002). Most
of these events (73.1% of 409 events) were mild to moderate in severity. Patients in the duloxetine versus placebo
group reported significantly more nausea (31.6% vs 9.7%;
p < 0.001), headache (17.1% vs 9.0%; p = 0.006), constipation (13.3% vs 4.1%; p < 0.001), dry mouth (11.8% vs 4.5%;

0.007), and middle insomnia (1.9% vs 0.0%; p = 0.030).
Among these events, those that were severe and significantly greater with duloxetine treatment included constipation
(n = 6, 2.3% vs n = 0 in the placebo group; p = 0.015) and
hyperhydrosis (n = 5, 1.9% vs n = 0 in the placebo group;
p = 0.030).
There were no significant treatment group differences in
the rate of serious adverse events (SAE). In the duloxetine
group, one SAE (0.4%) was reported: an intervertebral disc
protrusion. In the placebo group, there were 6 SAE reported: chest pain (n = 1, 0.4%), muscle spasms (n = 1, 0.4%),
myocardial infarction (n = 1, 0.4%), non-cardiac chest pain
(n = 1, 0.4%), pancreatitis (n = 1, 0.4%), and suicidal
ideation (n = 1, 0.4%).
There were statistically significant between-treatment
differences in mean change in weight over the 12 weeks,
which were less than 1 kg in either treatment group (duloxetine, –0.62 kg; placebo, 0.21 kg; p < 0.001). These changes
were not considered clinically relevant.
Mean changes in heart rate were significantly different
between the duloxetine and placebo groups (1.76 bpm
vs –0.20 bpm; p = 0.003), but mean changes in systolic and
diastolic blood pressure did not differ statistically between
treatment groups. One patient in each of the treatment
groups met criteria for sustained elevation in diastolic blood
pressure (supine diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mm Hg and
an increase from baseline of ≥ 10 mm Hg for at least 3 consecutive visits). One patient in the placebo group met criteria for sustained systolic blood pressure (supine systolic
blood pressure ≥ 140 mm Hg and an increase from baseline
of ≥ 10 mm Hg for at least 3 consecutive visits).
Statistically significant differences were observed in
mean change from baseline to endpoint in patients treated
with duloxetine versus placebo for some clinical laboratory

DISCUSSION
Ours is the first study of duloxetine treatment in patients
with FM that assessed changes in the Patient’s Global
Impression of Improvement (PGI-I) as the primary measure.
In this double-blind, randomized trial duloxetine 60–120
mg/day had significantly greater improvement, compared
with placebo, on the PGI-I after 12 weeks of treatment.
Compared with placebo, duloxetine 60–120 mg/day reduced
(improved) PGI-I scores beginning with the first assessment
following treatment initiation (2 weeks).
Because FM is perceived by patients to be more than a
painful condition21, assessing the global impression of

Arnold, et al: Duloxetine and patient improvement 2585
improvement may be a more clinically relevant measure
than improvement in pain. In a post-hoc analysis of 4 clinical trials in patients with FM that had improvement in pain
as a primary outcome9,10,11,12, PGI-I outcomes of feeling
“better” or “very much better” were found to be correlated
with improvement in multiple symptom domains that
included physical functioning, fatigue, and influence of
symptoms on daily living, as well as pain22.
In our study significantly more patients reported that they
felt “much better” or “very much better” after 12 weeks of
treatment with duloxetine versus placebo. Patients treated
with duloxetine compared to those treated with placebo
reported significant improvement in self-assessments of
mood (Likert and BDI), anxiety (Likert only), stiffness, and
being bothered by pain and sleep difficulties, fatigue, as well
as a significant reduction in pain interference with general
activity, walking ability, normal work, relations with others,
sleep, and enjoyment of life. In addition, there were significant improvements in patient-rated health-related quality of
life assessments for bodily pain, general health, mental
health, physical functioning, role-emotional, social functioning, vitality, and the mental component summary on the
SF-36.
Although cognitive dysfunction is another commonly
reported symptom domain in patients with FM21, few FM
treatment trials have systematically assessed cognition. Our
study explored possible outcome measures to evaluate cognitive dysfunction in patients with FM. Results from the
self-report cognitive measure, the CPFQ, did not differ significantly between treatments at endpoint. The CPFQ was
developed to measure cognitive and executive dysfunction
in mood and anxiety disorders and has been validated in
depressed outpatients23 but not in patients with FM. In this
trial, fewer than 20% of the study population had comorbid
MDD and fewer than 10% had comorbid GAD. The mean
CPFQ total score at endpoint indicated that cognitive functioning had improved somewhat to “minimally diminished”
in both groups. These results suggest that perhaps the CPFQ
is not an adequate measure of cognitive functioning in
patients with FM if they are not depressed or anxious.
Further, the CPFQ may be problematic as an outcome measure because patients retrospectively assess their cognitive
and physical functioning over the prior month, and because
the responses on the questionnaire refer to how diminished
functioning has become relative to “normal,” it may be difficult for patients to provide a response indicating improvement. The Multiple Ability Self-Report Questionnaire24 has
been shown to be sensitive to change in clinical trials with
intervention in patients with FM25, and may be a better
assessment for perceived cognitive difficulties in this patient
population, because it assesses the frequency of experiencing difficulty in performing daily cognitive tasks.
This is also the first study to explore the efficacy of duloxetine 90 mg/day in the treatment of FM. In those patients
who had < 50% reduction in pain severity after 4 weeks’
treatment with duloxetine 60 mg, double-blind escalation to
90 mg resulted in reduced pain severity in some patients, and
on average they reported feeling “much better.” Titration to
higher doses of duloxetine was double-blind to reduce the
expectation of improvement with a dose increase. For those
patients who did not experience the expected reduction in
pain severity after 4 weeks’ treatment with 90 mg, their dose
was increased to 120 mg, after which their pain severity
decreased, and on average they reported feeling “a little better.” These results may support usual clinical practice for
increasing the dose of duloxetine to improve efficacy, and
suggest that the duloxetine 90 mg daily would be an appropriate intermediate dosage to manage FM.
The safety and tolerability findings in our study were
consistent with those reported in previous studies in FM
patients treated with duloxetine 60 and 120 mg/day9,10,11,12.
There are limitations of the acute phase of this study that
should be considered. First, the use of a single patient-rated
assessment of improvement in global FM symptoms cannot
provide information regarding specific symptom response.
Second, the instrument used to assess cognitive functioning
in this study has not been validated in FM, and there remains
a need to develop instruments that adequately assess this
domain in FM. Third, the results of the acute phase of this
study may not generalize to patients with some psychiatric
comorbid disorders, unstable medical or comorbid pain disorders, or patients who were treatment-refractory or disabled, because patients with these conditions were excluded
from the study.

In summary, in patients with FM, with or without
MDD or GAD, duloxetine 60–120 mg/day improved
pati ent-reported global improvement beginning after 2
weeks of treatment and continued through to the 12-week
endpoint. Increasing the dose in patients with inadequate
pain response was associated with further pain reduction,
and suggests that duloxetine 90 mg/day may be an appropriate intermediate dosage for some patients. Duloxetine
treatment resulted in improvement in function and in other
common associated symptoms, including fatigue, depressive and anxiety symptoms, stiffness, and being bothered by
sleep difficulties. Consistent with 4 earlier trials of duloxetine in the treatment of FM, duloxetine was safely administered, and tolerated by most patients.
