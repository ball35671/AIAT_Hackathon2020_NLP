Abstract
The primary objectives of this study were to assess the efficacy and safety of duloxetine for reducing pain severity in fibromyalgia
patients with or without current major depressive disorder. This was a 6-month, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled study. In total, 520 patients meeting American College of Rheumatology criteria for fibromyalgia were randomly
assigned to duloxetine (20 mg/day, 60 mg/day, or 120 mg/day) or placebo, administered once daily, for 6 months (after 3 months,
the duloxetine 20-mg/day group titrated to 60 mg/day). The co-primary outcome measures were the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) average pain severity score and Patient Global Impressions of Improvement (PGI-I) score. Safety was assessed via treatment-emergent
adverse events, and changes in vital sign, laboratory, and ECG measures. Compared with placebo-treated patients, those patients
treated with duloxetine 120 mg/day improved significantly more on the co-primary outcome measures at 3 months (change in BPI
score [2.31 vs 1.39, P < 0.001] and PGI-I [2.89 vs 3.39, P = 0.004]) and at 6 months (change in BPI [2.26 vs 1.43, P = 0.003]
and PGI-I [2.93 vs 3.37, P = 0.012]). Compared with placebo, treatment with duloxetine 60 mg/day also significantly improved the
co-primary measures at 3 months and BPI at 6 months. Duloxetine was efficacious in patients both with and without major depressive disorder. There were no clinically significant differences between treatment groups in changes in vital signs, laboratory measures,
or ECG measures. Study results demonstrated that duloxetine at doses of 60 mg/day and 120 mg/day appears to be safe and efficacious in patients with fibromyalgia.

1. Introduction
Fibromyalgia affects about 2% of the US general
population and is characterized by chronic, widespread
pain [42,43]. The American College of Rheumatology
criteria for fibromyalgia include widespread pain for at
least 3 months and pain on palpation in 11 of the 18 tender-point sites [26,44]. Moreover, a variety of other
symptoms such as fatigue, headache, and sleep disturbance often accompany the widespread pain [44]. Mood
disorders are also common, with 25–40% of patients
with fibromyalgia reporting current major depressive
disorder (MDD) [1,2].
Although the underlying mechanisms responsible for
fibromyalgia are not well understood, dysfunction of
central serotonin and norepinephrine systems may play
a key role. Both serotonin and norepinephrine have
been implicated in the mediation of endogenous pain
mechanisms via the descending inhibitory pain pathways [3,6,28]. Dysfunction in these systems could be
involved in central sensitization and in hyperexcitability
of the spinal cord and supraspinal pain-transmitting
pathways [3,6,28,31,32,45]. Duloxetine hydrochloride,
a selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor that is relatively balanced in its affinity for serotonin
and norepinephrine reuptake transporters, is approved
by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the
treatment of MDD [10,11] and generalized anxiety disorder [20,24], and for the management of diabetic
peripheral neuropathic pain [29,39]. Two 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies provided support
that duloxetine was efficacious in the reduction of pain
and well-tolerated in patients with fibromyalgia. In the
first study [1], duloxetine 60 mg twice a day (BID) was
well-tolerated; however, the improvement associated
with duloxetine treatment was not statistically significant on the primary pain measure in the overall study
population, but was significant in the female subpopulation, which comprised 89% of the overall study population. The second study [2], which included only women,
found that both 60 mg once a day (QD) and 60 mg BID
were efficacious on pain and nearly all other efficacy
measures, including health outcome assessments. In
both studies, duloxetine was equally efficacious in
female patients with or without MDD.
Based on the evidence that duloxetine 60 mg QD and
60 mg BID were well-tolerated and efficacious in the
treatment of fibromyalgia, we conducted another randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to further assess the efficacy and safety of duloxetine at
20 mg/day, 60 mg/day, and 120 mg/day, administered
once daily for 6 months in women and men with fibromyalgia with or without comorbid MDD. This was
the first study of duloxetine for fibromyalgia of this
duration. Furthermore, in addition to evaluating the
efficacy of duloxetine on change in pain severity, a
co-primary measure to determine the effect of duloxetine
on global improvement was included. The study also
included secondary measures of fatigue, mood,
tender-point threshold, health-related quality of life,
and functional impairment.
2. Methods
2.1. Overview
The study was conducted in 38 outpatient research centers
in the USA and Puerto Rico between June 2005 and June 2007.
Each clinical study site’s Institutional Review Board approved
the protocol, which was developed in accordance with the ethical standards of Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and the Declaration of Helsinki. Patients provided written informed consent
before participation in any study-related procedures. Patients
were identified by physician referral or advertisement for a
fibromyalgia medication trial.
2.2. Entry criteria
Female and male outpatients at least 18 years of age
who met criteria for fibromyalgia as defined by the American College of Rheumatology were recruited for this study.
Patients were required to have a score P4 on the average
pain severity item (in the past 24 h) of the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI-modified short form) [8] at screening and at baseline. Patients with or without current MDD were included
and evaluated for the presence of psychiatric disorders using
the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI)
[35]. Training was provided to psychiatrists, psychologists,
or individuals with at least 6 months of experience in the
administration of psychiatric scales at site start-up meetings
either in person or remotely via video conferencing. Each
site was also supplied with a CD-ROM containing training
for the completion of the MINI and other efficacy, health
outcome, and safety measures.
Exclusion criteria included any current primary psychiatric
diagnosis other than MDD; pain symptoms unrelated to fibromyalgia that could interfere with interpretation of outcome
measures; regional pain syndromes; multiple surgeries or failed
back syndrome; a confirmed current or previous diagnosis of
rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory arthritis, or other autoimmune disease; unstable medical or psychiatric disorders; severe
liver disease; current pregnancy or breast-feeding; or a history
of substance abuse within the past year. Patients who were
judged by the investigator to be treatment-refractory or whose
response might be compromised by disability compensation
issues in the opinion of the investigator were also excluded.
Prior to randomization, patients were required to discontinue any medications that might interfere with the evaluation
of pain improvement, including analgesics (with the exception
of up to 325 mg/day of aspirin for cardiac prophylaxis and
acetaminophen up to 2 g/day for pain), antidepressants, anticonvulsants, or other medications taken for fibromyalgia or
pain. Sedating antihistamines and episodic use (up to 40 total
days of use during the 6 months of treatment) of chloral
hydrate, zolpidem, zolpiclone, and zaleplon were allowed to
facilitate sleep. Patients were encouraged not to initiate or alter
I.J. Russell et al. / Pain 136 (2008) 432–444 433
non-conventional/alternative therapies such as acupuncture,
biofeedback, or cognitive-behavioral therapy for the duration
of the study.
2.3. Study design
This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
multicenter, parallel group study of patients with a diagnosis
of fibromyalgia with or without current MDD. There was a
1-week screening phase, which was followed by 3-month (15
weeks) double-blind, randomized treatment with duloxetine
(20 mg/day, 60 mg/day, or 120 mg/day) or placebo once daily,
for evaluation of the primary endpoint. All remaining patients
continued for an additional 13 weeks of double-blind, placebocontrolled treatment. In this paper, 6-month treatment refers
to the entire 28 weeks of double-blind treatment (secondary
endpoint). All patients completing the 6-month, double-blind
treatment phase were eligible to enter an additional 28 weeks
of treatment (this will not be reported here). A 2-week taper
occurred at the end of the additional 28 weeks or for patients
who discontinued after receiving at least 2 weeks of treatment.
Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:2:2:2 ratio to once
daily duloxetine 20 mg/day, 60 mg/day, 120 mg/day, or placebo, respectively. Patients randomly assigned to duloxetine
60 mg/day were started at 30 mg/day for 1 week, then titrated
to 60 mg/day. Patients randomly assigned to 120 mg/day were
started at 30 mg/day for 1 week, then titrated to 60 mg/day for
1 week, and then to 120 mg/day. Patients randomly assigned to
duloxetine 20 mg/day had their dose blindly increased to
60 mg/day after 3 months on study drug when they entered
the second half of the 6-month, double-blind treatment phase
(20/60 mg/day). The 20-mg/day dosage was included to help
establish the minimally effective duloxetine dose. Assignment
to treatment groups was determined by a computer-generated
random sequence and each stratum (depressed and nondepressed) was randomly assigned within sites to achieve a relative balance across treatments.
During the taper phase, those who had received duloxetine
60 mg/day experienced dosage reduction to 30 mg/day for 1
week and then received placebo for a second week. The dosage
of patients who had received duloxetine 120 mg/day was
reduced to 60 mg/day for 1 week, then 30 mg/day for a second
week. Patients who had received duloxetine 20 mg/day or placebo received placebo for the entire 2-week taper phase.
2.4. Outcome measures
The co-primary outcome measures were the average pain
severity item of the BPI-modified short form [8] that measures
average pain severity during the past 24 h on a scale from 0 (no
pain) to 10 (pain as bad as you can imagine) and the Patient
Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I) scale [18] ranging
from 1 (very much better) to 7 (very much worse). The
response rate, defined as a P50% reduction in the average pain
score from baseline to endpoint, was determined at both 3
months and 6 months. The number needed to treat (NNT)
was based on the 50% response rates at 3 months and at 6
months. NNT was calculated as 1 divided by the absolute risk
reduction (ARR) where the ARR was the difference between
the duloxetine and placebo response rates. The numbers were
then rounded up to the nearest whole number.
Secondary efficacy measures included the Fibromyalgia
Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) [5], Clinical Global Impressions-Severity (CGI-S) [18], tender-point pain assessments
using the Fischer dolorimeter (Pain Diagnostics and Thermography, Great Neck, NY) [13], including mean tenderpoint pressure pain thresholds, the Multidimensional Fatigue
Inventory (MFI) [36], the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD17) [19], the Sheehan Disability Scale
(SDS) [34], the 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36)
[38], and the EuroQoL Questionnaire-5 Dimensions (EQ5D) [23].
The safety of duloxetine was assessed through collection of
spontaneously reported adverse events, vital signs, and weight
that were recorded at baseline and each visit through study
completion. An adverse event was considered treatment-emergent if it was new or a worsening of a pre-existing symptom
upon initiation of treatment compared with the event reported
at baseline. Adverse events were coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) version 9.1.
Centralized electrocardiograms (ECGs) and laboratory
tests (hematology and clinical chemistry) were conducted at
screening, at several visits throughout the study periods, and
at endpoint. Urinalysis and a drug screen were undertaken
during the screening phase for the evaluation of inclusion/
exclusion criteria.
2.5. Statistical analyses
The a priori-defined primary objective of the study was to
determine whether duloxetine 120 mg/day provided significant
improvement compared with placebo in both co-primary outcomes at the 3-month endpoint. The study was designed to
enroll 140 patients each in the duloxetine 120 mg/day and placebo groups so as to have at least 85% power to detect a treatment group difference of 1.2 points between duloxetine
120 mg/day and placebo in the change in the average pain
severity score from baseline to endpoint, and at least 80%
power to detect a difference in the PGI-I at endpoint of 0.68
in the same two groups for the same treatment period. Overall
Type I error regarding the multiple comparisons associated
with the co-primary endpoints, multiple doses of duloxetine,
and multiple timepoints for assessment was maintained at
the 0.05 level through implementation of a gatekeeper strategy
[41].
Secondary outcomes were included to provide additional
assessments of duloxetine’s efficacy in treating fibromyalgia
and to provide a better understanding of duloxetine’s potential
effect on other symptom domains associated with fibromyalgia. As such, multiplicity adjustments were not conducted for
the secondary outcomes.
All analyses were conducted on an intent-to-treat basis
unless otherwise specified. All randomly assigned patients were
included in the safety analyses, and all patients with a baseline
and at least one post-baseline measurement were included in
the efficacy analyses. For continuous efficacy variables, with
the exception of the PGI-I scores, treatment group differences
in change from baseline to endpoint were examined using an
analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with treatment and
investigator as main effects and the baseline score as the covariate. Endpoint was defined as each patient’s last observation
within the respective 3- and 6-month treatment periods. The
434 I.J. Russell et al. / Pain 136 (2008) 432–444
PGI-I scores at endpoint were analyzed using an ANCOVA
model with treatment and investigator as fixed effects, with
the PGI-Severity (PGI-S) score [18] at baseline as a covariate.
The PGI-S scale is a patient-rated measure of illness severity
which is similar to the CGI-S, and that reflects the patient’s
impression of his/her illness severity at a given point in time.
Pairwise comparisons between treatment groups were based
on evaluating the difference in type II least-squares mean (LS
mean) from the above ANCOVA models. Treatment-by-investigator interactions were evaluated, but the interaction term was
not included in the ANCOVA model, irrespective of its statistical significance. Analysis of subgroups based on age, race, sex,
and MDD status at baseline were conducted using similar
ANCOVA models, with the addition of terms for the subgroup
effect and treatment-by-subgroup interaction. Treatment effects
between subgroups were considered to differ significantly when
the treatment-by-subgroup interaction P-value was 60.10.
To assess the robustness of the co-primary endpoints, a
similar ANCOVA analysis in which the baseline observation
was carried forward (BOCF) for all patients discontinuing
early was implemented post hoc for the BPI average pain
score. Similarly, for the PGI-I, mean scores at endpoint were
reassessed with all discontinuing patients assigned an endpoint
PGI-I score of 4, corresponding to ‘‘no change”. These analyses assume no treatment benefit or deficit for patients who did
not complete the 3- or 6-month acute treatment phases in the
respective 3- and 6-month analyses.
Demographic and baseline disease characteristics and
changes from baseline to endpoint in ECG parameters, vital
signs, and weight were evaluated using a main effects analysis
of variance (ANOVA) model containing terms for treatment
and investigator. Unless otherwise specified, ‘‘baseline” refers
to the last non-missing observation at or before the randomization visit, and ‘‘endpoint” refers to the last non-missing
observation in the period of analysis (3 months or 6 months).
Categorical outcomes were compared between treatment
groups using Fisher’s exact test. Treatment effects were evaluated based on a two-sided significance level of 0.05 and interaction effects at a significance level of 0.10. Throughout this
article, the term ‘‘significant” indicates statistical significance.
A gatekeeper strategy [41] was employed for sequentially testing secondary hypotheses and was ordered based on regulatory
requirements and considerations at the time of study design. If
the primary hypotheses were statistically significant at the 0.05
two-sided level, the first secondary gatekeeper hypothesis was
tested. If this comparison was statistically significant at the
0.05 two-sided level, subsequent secondary hypotheses were
tested in sequence until a null hypothesis in the sequence failed
to be rejected. The sequential testing was conducted in the following order: the comparison between duloxetine 60 mg/day
and placebo on the change from baseline to endpoint on the average pain severity score and the endpoint of the PGI-I (3-month
comparison); the comparison between duloxetine 120 mg/day
and placebo on the change from baseline to endpoint on the average pain severity score and the endpoint of PGI-I (6-month comparison); the comparison between duloxetine 60 mg/day and
placebo on the change from baseline to endpoint on the average
pain severity score and the endpoint of PGI-I (6-month comparison); the comparison between duloxetine 120 mg/day and placebo on the change from baseline to endpoint on the SDS total
score (6-month comparison); the comparison between duloxetine 60 mg/day and placebo on the change from baseline to endpoint on the SDS total score (6-month comparison); the
comparison between duloxetine 120 mg/day and placebo on
the change from baseline to endpoint on the SDS total score
(3-month comparison); and the comparison between duloxetine
60 mg/day and placebo on the change from baseline to endpoint
on the SDS total score (3-month comparison).
Response profiles over time for efficacy measures were evaluated using a likelihood-based, mixed-effect repeated-measures
model that contained categorical effects for treatment, visit,
investigator, and treatment-by-visit interaction, as well as the
continuous fixed covariates for baseline score and baselineby-visit interaction. Visitwise treatment group comparisons
were based on the difference in LS means derived from type
III sums of squares.
Path analysis [30] was performed to quantify the amount of
treatment benefit attributed to a direct analgesic effect as compared to the indirect effect on pain mediated through improvement in depressive symptoms. In this analysis, two regression
models were employed to partition the overall treatment effect
into direct and indirect components. Please see Arnold et al. [1]
for statistical details of the methodology.
3. Results
3.1. Patient disposition
A total of 1010 patients were screened to enroll 520
patients who met the entry criteria and were randomly
assigned to either duloxetine 20 mg/day (N = 79), duloxetine 60 mg/day (N = 150), duloxetine 120 mg/day
(N = 147), or placebo (N = 144). The percentage of
patients in each of the above treatment groups that completed the 3-month treatment phase was 63.3%, 64.7%,
64.6%, and 58.3% (P = 0.645), respectively. The most
frequently reported reasons for discontinuation were
adverse events, lack of efficacy, and patient decision
(Fig. 1). Overall, treatment groups did not significantly
differ with respect to any specific reason for discontinuation. There was a numeric trend toward increasing
rates of discontinuation due to adverse events (AEs)
associated with increasing duloxetine dose (duloxetine
120 mg/day [22.5%], duloxetine 60 mg/day [14.7%], duloxetine 20 mg/day [10.1%], placebo [11.8%]) with a statistically significantly higher rate of discontinuation due
to AEs associated with the 120 mg/day group compared
with the placebo group (P = 0.029). In contrast, a nonsignificant, inverse trend toward decreasing rates of discontinuation due to lack of efficacy was associated with
increasing duloxetine dose [duloxetine 120 mg/day
(4.1%), duloxetine 60 mg/day (7.3%), duloxetine
20 mg/day (10.4%), placebo (8.9%)] was demonstrated.
A total of 325 patients continued the study for 3
months. This included 49 duloxetine 20 mg/day patients,
whose dose was increased to duloxetine 60 mg/day for
the final 3 months. A total of 278 patients (85.5% of
those entering the additional 3 months) completed the
6-month treatment phase. The percentage of patients
I.J. Russell et al. / Pain 136 (2008) 432–444 435
completing the entire 6 months of treatment was 57.0%
(45/79) for the duloxetine 20/60 mg/day group, 54.7%
(82/150) for the duloxetine 60 mg/day group, 53.7%
(79/147) for the duloxetine 120 mg/day group, and
50.0% (72/144) for the placebo group.
3.2. Baseline clinical and demographic characteristics
Most of the patients were women (94.8%), white
(84.2%), and, on average, 51 years of age. There were
no significant differences between treatment groups in

demographics or baseline disease characteristics
(Table 1).
3.3. Efficacy and health outcomes
3.3.1. Three month treatment phase
Unlike patients receiving duloxetine 20 mg/day,
patients treated with duloxetine 60 mg/day and duloxetine 120 mg/day experienced significantly greater
improvement in pain severity compared with placebotreated patients, as measured by the change from baseline in the average pain severity score (Table 2). The
mean endpoint PGI-I score was significantly lower (better) in patients treated with duloxetine for each of the
three doses compared with patients treated with
placebo.
Significant improvement in the average pain severity
score (Fig. 2) and in the PGI-I score (Fig. 3) occurred
as early as 1 week after starting treatment for both the
duloxetine 60 mg/day and 120 mg/day treatment
groups. In addition, duloxetine-treated patients showed
similar improvement in the average pain severity score
and PGI-I score compared with placebo regardless of
the presence or absence of MDD at baseline (Table 2).
For secondary measures, both duloxetine 60 mg/dayand duloxetine 120 mg/day-treated patients demonstrated significantly greater improvements compared
with placebo-treated patients in the CGI-S score, FIQ
total score, SF-36 mental component score, and some
of the MFI domains, but did not achieve significance
on the other secondary efficacy and health outcome
measures (Table 2). In addition, the BOCF analysis
for the average pain severity score demonstrated significant improvement in pain severity in the duloxetine
120 mg/day (2.25, P < 0.001) and 60 mg/day (1.92,
P = 0.027) groups but not in the 20 mg/day group
(1.86, P = 0.102) compared with the placebo group
(1.34). The PGI-I at endpoint assessments assuming
a value of ‘no change’ for discontinuing patients were
consistent with the above findings: duloxetine 120 mg/
day (3.39, P = 0.004), 60 mg/day (3.40, P = 0.007), duloxetine 20 mg/day group (3.45, P = 0.052) compared
with the placebo group (3.69).
No significant treatment-by-investigator interactions
were observed during either 3 months or 6 months of
treatment for the average pain severity score, PGI-I
score, SDS Global Functioning score, and those measures and timepoints relating to the primary and secondary gatekeeper objectives.
Response rates, defined as a P50% improvement
from baseline to the 3-month endpoint in the average
pain severity score, were significantly greater for duloxetine 120 mg/day (40.1%; P = 0.003), but not for duloxetine 60 mg/day (34.0%; P = 0.067) or for duloxetine
20 mg/day (32.5%; P = 0.200) compared with placebo
(23.7%). Post hoc analyses also showed that response
rates defined by P30% reduction from baseline to 3-
month endpoint in the average pain severity score were
significantly higher for duloxetine 120 mg/day (52.1%;
P = 0.008) and for duloxetine 60 mg/day (50.7%;
P = 0.016), but not for duloxetine 20 mg/day (46.8%;
P = 0.147) compared with placebo (36.0%). The number
needed to treat (95% CI) for duloxetine 20 mg/day,
60 mg/day, and 120 mg/day was 12 (4.6, 1), 10 (4.8,
1), and 7 (3.7, 18.1), respectively.
The path analysis demonstrated that the direct analgesic effect of duloxetine 60 mg/day on the reduction
in the average pain severity score accounted for 62.2%
(P = 0.183) of the total treatment effect at 3 months.

(P = 0.581), and race (P = 0.374) were not significant.
In men, the LS mean changes from baseline to endpoint
during the 3-month treatment period were similar to the
overall results although the number of men in each
treatment group was small (duloxetine 120 mg/day
[n = 4], 2.18; duloxetine 60 mg/day [n = 14], 2.17;
duloxetine 20 mg/day [n = 2], 0.70; placebo [n = 7],
0.68). The LS mean changes were similar between
patients 65 years and younger (duloxetine 120 mg/day
[n = 129], 2.39; duloxetine 60 mg/day [n = 129],
2.03; duloxetine 20 mg/day [n = 68], 1.90; placebo
[n = 131], 1.37) and patients older than 65 years (duloxetine 120 mg/day [n = 13], 1.07; duloxetine 60 mg/
day [n = 15], 2.10; duloxetine 20 mg/day [n = 9],
1.97; placebo [n = 8], 2.08). Similar results were
found among racial groups.
Post hoc evaluations of changes in HAMD17 total
score in patients diagnosed with MDD at study entry
found LS mean changes of 4.8 for placebo (n = 30),
6.0 for duloxetine 20 mg/day (n = 22), 6.6 for duloxetine 60 mg/day (n = 30) and 7.8 for 120 mg/day
(n = 29). Only the latter group demonstrated statistically significant improvement compared with placebo
(P = 0.022).
3.3.2. Six month treatment phase
At the 6-month endpoint, patients treated with duloxetine 20/60 mg/day, duloxetine 60 mg/day, and duloxetine 120 mg/day all experienced significantly greater
improvement in change from baseline in the average
pain severity score compared with patients receiving placebo (Table 2). The mean endpoint PGI-I score was significantly lower (better) in the duloxetine 20/60 mg/day
and duloxetine 120 mg/day groups, but not the duloxetine 60 mg/day group, compared with the placebo
group. Duloxetine-treated patients showed similar
improvement in the average pain severity score and
PGI-I compared with placebo-treated patients regardless of whether they had comorbid MDD.
For secondary measures, all the duloxetine treatment
groups demonstrated significant improvement compared with the placebo group in the CGI-S and MFI
mental fatigue domain. The other efficacy and health
outcome measures that achieved significance in the duloxetine treatment groups compared with the placebo
group included the MFI physical fatigue domain and
EQ-5D (duloxetine 20/60 mg/day) and the MFI physical
fatigue, reduced motivation, and reduced activity
domains, as well as SF-36 mental component score (duloxetine 120 mg/day).
Response rates, defined as a P50% improvement
from baseline to the 6-month endpoint on the average
pain score, were significantly greater for duloxetine 20/
60 mg/day (36.4%; P = 0.025), duloxetine 60 mg/day
(32.6%; P = 0.045), and duloxetine 120 mg/day (35.9%;
P = 0.009) compared with placebo (21.6%). Post hoc
analyses also showed that response rates defined by
P30% reduction from baseline to 6-month endpoint in
the average pain severity score were significantly higher
for duloxetine 20/60 mg/day (51.9%; P = 0.045), but not
for duloxetine 60 mg/day (47.2%; P = 0.118) or duloxetine 120 mg/day (49.3%; P = 0.054) compared with placebo (37.4%). The number needed to treat (95% CI) for
duloxetine 20/60 mg/day, 60 mg/day, and 120 mg/day
was 10 (4.7, 148.6), 7 (4.1, 26.6), and 7 (3.6, 42.7),
respectively.
The path analysis demonstrated that the direct analgesic effect of duloxetine 60 mg/day on the reduction
in the average pain severity score accounted for 69.1%
(P = 0.250) of the total treatment effect at 6 months.
The indirect treatment effect through improvement in
depressive symptoms accounted for 30.9% (P = NS) of
the total treatment effect. The direct effect of duloxetine
120 mg/day on the reduction in the average pain severity
score accounted for 82.3% (P = 0.060) of the total treatment effect at 6 months. The indirect treatment effect

through improvement in depressive symptoms
accounted for 17.7% (P = NS) of the total treatment
effect.
The treatment-by-subgroup interactions on the average pain severity score for sex (P = 0.353), age
(P = 0.922), and race (P = 0.685) were not significant.
In men, the LS mean changes from baseline to endpoint
were similar to the overall results although the number
of men in each treatment group was small (duloxetine
120 mg/day [n = 4], 2.02; duloxetine 60 mg/day
[n = 14], 2.41; duloxetine 20 mg/day [n = 1], 1.35; placebo [n = 7], 0.46). The LS mean changes were similar
between patients 65 years and younger (duloxetine
120 mg/day [n = 129], 2.29; duloxetine 60 mg/day
[n = 129], 1.98; duloxetine 20/60 mg/day [n = 68],
2.20; placebo [n = 131], 1.42) and older than 65 years
(duloxetine 120 mg/day [n = 13], 1.91; duloxetine
60 mg/day [n = 15], 2.31; duloxetine 20/60 mg/day
[n = 9], 2.77; placebo [n = 8], 1.90). Similar results
were found among racial groups.
In patients diagnosed with MDD at study entry, LS
mean changes in HAMD17 total score at 6 months were
4.8 for placebo (n = 30), 5.2 for duloxetine 20/
60 mg/day (n = 22), 6.9 for duloxetine 60 mg/day
(n = 30) and 7.2 for 120 mg/day (n = 29). Treatment
group differences were not statistically significant when
compared with placebo.
3.4. Safety and tolerability
The safety and tolerability of the duloxetine groups
were compared with the placebo group across the entire
6-month treatment period. The proportions of patients
who discontinued due to an adverse event during the
6-month study period were significantly different across
treatment groups: duloxetine 20/60 mg/day (11.4%),
duloxetine 60 mg/day (15.3%), duloxetine 120 mg/day
(27.2%), and placebo (13.2%, P = 0.005). Despite this
global difference, there were no significant differences
in the incidence of any specific adverse event among
any of the duloxetine treatment groups as compared
with the placebo group.
Fifteen treatment-emergent adverse events occurred
in at least one of the duloxetine groups at a frequency
greater than 5% and twice the rate of the placebo group
(Table 3), with nausea consistently reported as the most
common treatment-emergent adverse event in all of the
treatment groups. A total of 20 patients reported at least
one serious adverse event. Serious adverse events were
infrequent and did not demonstrate any pattern with
respect to the system organ class designation. Only
asthma (1 placebo patient and 1 duloxetine 60 mg/day
patient) and suicidal ideation (1 placebo patient and 1
duloxetine 120 mg/day patient) were reported by more
than 1 patient during the 6-month study period.
Mean changes in heart rate and supine systolic and
diastolic blood pressure for the duloxetine treatment
groups did not differ significantly from those for the placebo group, except for systolic blood pressure (duloxetine 60 mg/day, 3.0 mm Hg; placebo, 1.1 mm Hg,
P = 0.019). A total of 10 patients met criteria for sustained elevation in blood pressure (supine diastolic
blood pressure P90 mm Hg and an increase from baseline of P10 mm Hg for at least 3 consecutive visits, or
supine systolic blood pressure P140 mm Hg and an
increase from baseline of P10 mm Hg for at least 3 conTable 3

secutive visits), including 6 (4.2%) on duloxetine 60 mg/
day, 2 (1.4%) on duloxetine 120 mg/day, and 2 (1.4%)
on placebo. Neither the incidence of sustained elevation
in blood pressure nor the incidence of hypertension,
reported as a spontaneous adverse event, differed significantly between any of the duloxetine groups when compared with the placebo group. The mean change in
weight over the 6 months of therapy was less than
1 kg for all of the treatment groups. Additionally, no
significant differences occurred between the duloxetine
groups and the placebo group in mean change from
baseline to endpoint in the QTc interval or in the incidence of treatment-emergent abnormal ECG values
including heart rate, QTcB, and QTcF.
Statistically significant differences (all P < 0.05) were
observed in mean change from baseline to endpoint
between the duloxetine and placebo groups for some
clinical laboratory values and included the following:
alkaline phosphatase (Units/L) (duloxetine 20/60 mg/
day, 3.13; duloxetine 60 mg/day, 2.58; placebo, 0.44);
chloride (mmol/L) (duloxetine 20/60 mg/day, 0.49;
duloxetine 60 mg/day, 0.17; duloxetine 120 mg/day,
0.32; placebo, 0.41); cholesterol (mmol/L) (duloxetine
60 mg/day, 0.03; duloxetine 120 mg/day, 0.04; placebo, 0.27); c-glutamyl transferase (Units/L) (duloxetine 20/60 mg/day, 2.15; placebo, 0.86); sodium
(mmol/L) (duloxetine 20/60 mg/day, 0.66; placebo,
0.07); eosinophils (tril/L) (duloxetine 120 mg/day, 0.02;
placebo, 0.01); hematocrit (actual count) (duloxetine
20/60 mg/day, 0.00; placebo, 0.01); hemoglobin
(mmol/L) (duloxetine 20/60 mg/day, 0.16; duloxetine
60 mg/day, 0.13; duloxetine 120 mg/day, 0.17; placebo, 0.25); mean cell hemoglobin (femtomole) (duloxetine 60 mg/day, 0.00; duloxetine 120 mg/day, 0.00;
placebo, 0.02); mean cell volume (femtoliter) (duloxetine 120 mg/day, 0.66; placebo, 0.12); monocytes (bill/
L) (duloxetine 20/60 mg/day, 0.05; placebo, 0.01); and
platelet count (bill/L) (duloxetine 120 mg/day, 10.48;
placebo, 1.10). However, these differences in mean
changes between treatment groups were small and not
considered to be clinically relevant. No significant differences in the percentage of patients exhibiting treatmentemergent abnormal chemistry or hematology analytes at
any time were observed, with the exception of creatine
kinase (higher levels) in the duloxetine 20/60 mg/day
(15.3%, P = 0.038) and duloxetine 120 mg/day (13.6%,
P = 0.036) treatment groups compared with the placebo
group (5.7%). However, the mean change in creatine
kinase levels was not significantly different between the
active treatment groups and placebo.
4. Discussion
In this randomized, double-blind trial, both duloxetine 60 mg/day and 120 mg/day had significantly greater
efficacy, compared with placebo, on reduction in pain
severity after 3 months and 6 months of treatment in
patients with fibromyalgia. Compared with placebo,
duloxetine at both doses significantly reduced pain
beginning in the first week of therapy. Global improvement, as assessed by the patient (PGI-I) and the clinician
(CGI-S), was significantly improved after 3 months in
the duloxetine groups and maintained through 6 months
of treatment compared with the placebo group (except
60 mg/day group for PGI-I). The FIQ total score and
SF-36 mental component summary were significantly
improved at 3 months in both duloxetine groups compared with the placebo group.
The results of this study showing improvement in
pain, FIQ scores, and patient-rated global improvement
in fibromyalgia patients on duloxetine are similar to previously published results [1]. Improvement in mean tender-point threshold was not significantly different
between duloxetine- and placebo-treated patients in this
study, but was significantly improved at the 120 mg/day
dosage, compared with placebo, in the two earlier duloxetine studies [1,2]. Significant improvement in tender-point threshold appears to be a difficult outcome
to achieve [28]. Recent clinical trials of fibromyalgia
have not included tender-point assessments as an efficacy measure [9,15,22,33,37], and the usefulness of the
tender-point evaluation in clinical practice is the subject
of debate [7,25].
Fatigue is a common, disabling symptom reported by
patients with fibromyalgia [27]. While duloxetine did not
significantly improve the MFI general fatigue score
compared with placebo at the 3-month or 6-month endpoints, all doses of duloxetine at the 6-month endpoint
significantly improved the MFI mental fatigue domain
compared with placebo. Because the mental fatigue
domain consists of four questions relating to attention/concentration, it is possible that treatment with
duloxetine may improve some of the cognitive dysfunction often reported by patients with fibromyalgia [27].
Consistent with the previous duloxetine studies in
fibromyalgia, patients experienced an improvement in
pain regardless of the presence of MDD [1,2]. Both in
prior studies and in the present study, path analysis
showed that the majority of duloxetine’s effect on pain
is direct rather than mediated through improvement in
MDD symptoms. Whereas it is important to note that
improvement in pain of duloxetine-treated patients with
fibromyalgia was not dependent on mood improvement,
the antidepressant effect of duloxetine may be quite relevant in this disorder where many patients have comorbid
mood disorders. Additionally, effect sizes [21] for
improvements in HAMD17 scores in patients with
MDD who where randomized to duloxetine 60 mg/day
or 120 mg/day, were 0.45 and 0.63 for the 3-month
phase, respectively, and 0.42–0.53 for the 6-month treatment phase, respectively, which is indicative of a clinically significant antidepressant effect [4,12].
I.J. Russell et al. / Pain 136 (2008) 432–444 441
Unlike a previous study in fibromyalgia [1], male and
female patients treated with duloxetine showed similar
improvement in the average pain severity score after both
3 months and 6 months of treatment. Consistent improvement was also found in patients <65 and P65 years of age
and by race. The treatment-by-subgroup interactions for
sex, age, and race were all not significant, a finding that
supports the consistency of duloxetine’s effect across each
of these subgroups when taking the positive within-group
treatment effects into consideration.
The duloxetine 20 mg/day dosage was included in this
study to determine the ineffective or minimally effective
dose for the treatment of fibromyalgia. The 20 mg dose
did not significantly improve the average pain severity
score compared with placebo, making it the highest ineffective dose in this study. A study of duloxetine in diabetic neuropathic pain using the same doses also
established 20 mg as the highest ineffective dose [16].
The safety and tolerability findings in this study were
consistent with what has been found with duloxetine in
other patient populations, including the previous fibromyalgia studies. The most common treatment-emergent
adverse events, such as nausea, headache, and dry
mouth, occurred almost entirely within the first 3
months of the study. A pooled analysis of nearly
24,000 duloxetine patients from 64 studies found that
the large majority of the most commonly reported treatment-emergent adverse events occur early in treatment
and were mild or moderate in severity [14]. Moreover,
an analysis of eight pooled double-blind duloxetine
studies found that the most common treatment-emergent adverse event, nausea, which presents in the first
few weeks of treatment, tends to resolve within a few
days to a week [17]. In support of the relatively benign
cardiovascular findings in this study, a recent analysis
of more than 8500 duloxetine-treated patients from 42
placebo-controlled studies found no increased cardiovascular risk associated with this medication [40].
Several limitations of this study should be considered.
Although this is one of the longest trials of a medication
treatment for fibromyalgia that has been published, the
results may not generalize to treatment periods greater
than 6 months. Additionally, the results of the study
may not generalize to patients with excluded or unstable
psychiatric or medical disorders, or comorbid pain disorders. No active comparator was included because this
study was intended to confirm and extend the previous
findings of safety and efficacy of duloxetine compared
with placebo in the treatment of fibromyalgia. There
may have been variability in whether patients were
potentially treatment-refractory because the interpretation relied on the investigator’s judgment. The lack of
significance between treatment groups in some safety
measures could be attributed to the study not being sufficiently powered to detect these differences. Also,
because this was a monotherapy medication trial,
patients were required to discontinue medications used
to treat fibromyalgia before enrollment, which may have
deterred patients with more severe illness from enrolling.
Finally, given the relatively large number of safety, tolerability and secondary efficacy assessments included in
this trial, the presence or absence of statistical significance in these outcomes should be regarded as supportive or exploratory data and considered in conjunction
with established levels of clinically significant improvement, wherever possible.
This study provides further evidence that duloxetine at
dosages of 60 mg/day and 120 mg/day for up to 6 months
appears to be safe and efficacious in the treatment of fibromyalgia in patients with or without MDD. Because most
published drug studies in fibromyalgia and other pain
conditions are of 3 months’ duration or shorter, the finding of positive results at 6 months provides a more robust
assessment of duloxetine’s efficacy.
