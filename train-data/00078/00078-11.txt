OBJECTIVE—To compare the efficacy and safety of duloxetine and amitriptyline in painful
diabetic neuropathy (PDN).
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS—In this randomized, double-blind, cross-over,
active-control trial, 58 patients received amitriptyline and duloxetine orally once daily at bedtime, each for 6 weeks with optional dose uptitration fortnightly. Single-blinded placebo washout was given for 2 weeks between the two treatments and a single-blinded placebo run-out
phase of 4 weeks was given at the end of the treatment period. Pain relief was measured by the
patient’s global assessment of efficacy, using a visual analog scale (0–100) as a primary end point,
and overall improvement and adverse events were assessed as secondary outcome measures.
Median pain score reductions of .50%, 25–50%, and ,25% were considered good, moderate,
and mild responses, respectively.
RESULTS—There was a significant improvement in pain with both treatments compared with
their baseline values (P , 0.001 for both). Good, moderate, and mild pain relief was achieved in
55, 24, and 15% of patients, respectively, on amitriptyline and 59, 21, and 9% of patients,
respectively, on duloxetine. There were no significant differences in various other outcome
measures between the groups. Of the reported adverse events, dry mouth was significantly more
common with amitriptyline than duloxetine (55 vs. 24%; P , 0.01). Although, numerically,
more patients preferred duloxetine, overall this was not statistically significant (48 vs. 36%;
P = 0.18).
CONCLUSIONS—Both duloxetine and amitriptyline demonstrated similar efficacy in PDN.
A large, multicentric clinical trial in other populations could possibly demonstrate the superiority
of either drug.

T
he management of painful diabetic
neuropathy (PDN) includes intensive glycemic control and drugs for
pain relief. The American Diabetes Association recommends amitriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant, as the first choice;
however, titration to higher doses is
limited by its anticholinergic adverse effects (1). The selective serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, duloxetine,
is approved by the Food and Drug
Administration for the treatment of
PDN. It attenuates persistent pain mechanisms, including the central sensitization and hyperexcitability of the spinal
and supraspinal pain-transmitting pathways. Duloxetine has been evaluated in
placebo-controlled trials for a variety of
chronic pain, including PDN (2–6). It
not only relieves pain but also improves
functionality and quality of life in patients
with PDN. An extensive search of literature did not reveal any head-to-head comparison of duloxetine with amitriptyline,
an established first-line therapy for PDN
(1). Thus, the current study was planned
to compare the efficacy and safety of duloxetine with amitriptyline in PDN.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND
METHODS—Patients of either sex
with type 2 diabetes, aged between 18
and 75 years, who were on stable glucoselowering medications during the preceding month and who had PDN for at least
1 month were considered for the study.
Patients who had a pain score of .50%,
as assessed by visual analog scale (VAS),
were enrolled in the study. Those previously exposed to medications for PDN,
regardless of dose and duration, were
considered after 2 weeks of placebo washout in a single-blind manner. The study
was initiated after approval by the institutional ethics committee and was conducted following the principles of the
Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed
consent was obtained from each subject
prior to enrollment.
PDN was confirmed by 1) the patient’s medical history, 2) a diabetic neuropathy symptom (DNS) score of .1
point (7), 3) a diabetic neuropathy examination (DNE) score of .3 points (8), 4) a
modified neuropathy symptom score
(NSS) (9,10), and 5) increased thresholds
on the vibration perception test and
monofilament test. Patients were excluded if they had any clinically significant or unstable medical or psychiatric
illnesses. Patients with other causes of
neuropathy; renal dysfunction (serum
creatinine .132 mmol/L); liver disease
(alanine aminotransferase and aspartate
aminotransferase more than three time
times the normal level); epilepsy; psychiatric illness; uncontrolled hypertension;
malignancy; substance abuse; those taking anticonvulsants, antidepressants, local anesthetics, or opioids; those who
were pregnant; lactating women; or those

being treated with any investigational
drug within the last 30 days were excluded from the study.
A 14-week, randomized (computergenerated randomization of blocks of four),
double-blind, cross-over, active-control
with optional dose titration, equivalence
clinical trial was conducted. All patients
underwent an initial 2-week run-in period
in order to achieve a baseline state (during
which the patients were withdrawn from
any existing medication for PDN), followed by 6 weeks of treatment with each
drug and a washout period of 2 weeks
between the two therapies. At the end of
14 weeks, patients entered a 4-week runout phase, during which placebo response
was evaluated in a single-blind manner.
Three doses each of amitriptyline (10,
25, or 50 mg once daily at bed time) and
duloxetine (20, 40, or 60 mg once daily
at bed time) were used in the study.
Wockhardt Limited (Mumbai, India)
and Sun pharmaceutical Industries Limited
(Mumbai, India) provided amitriptyline
and duloxetine, respectively, as free samples. Treatment was started with the lowest dose of either drug, with fortnightly
assessments with optional uptitration.
The primary end point of the study
was the reduction in the median pain
score from baseline, as assessed by the
patient’s global assessment of efficacy by
the VAS (0–100 points). Secondary end
points included the assessment of pain by
the short-form McGill Pain Questionnaire
(11); an 11-point Likert scale for pain (0 =
no pain and 10 = excruciating pain); overall improvement by DNE score, DNS
score, modified NSS, and the 24-point
Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression
(12); change in sleep pattern (increased,
unchanged, or decreased); and patient
self-evaluation of overall change on the
basis of a 7-point patient global impression of change (PGIC) scale. Treatmentemergent adverse events (TEAEs) were
assessed by clinical and laboratory evaluation of fasting and postprandial plasma
glucose, A1C levels, lipid profile, urea,
creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase/
alanine aminotransferase, and alkaline
phosphatase. The patient’s preference of
treatment was assessed by direct questionnaire. Demographic characteristics
were noted and all the parameters were
measured before and after treatment
with both drugs and compared.
Uptitration was done after assessment
of the therapeutic response and tolerability by the above-mentioned scores. Blinding and randomization were carried out
by an independent person unrelated to
the study. The drug packets were administered to patients serially according to the
patient’s reporting sequence. A median
pain score reduction on the basis of the
VAS of .50%, between 25 and 50%, and
,25% were considered as good, moderate, and mild responses, respectively.
Overall improvement in pain intensity of
$30 and $50% also was assessed. Assessments for depression and change in
sleep pattern were performed at the beginning and end of each of the treatments,
PGIC was assessed at the end of each
treatment period, and patient preference
of treatment was carried out fortnightly
after beginning the second treatment,
whereas all other assessments were performed at each of the 2-weekly followup visits. The investigator administered
the drug and performed assessment for
the efficacy and safety at each visit and
was accessible by telephone to all patients
throughout the study. No additional dose
escalation was carried out in the case of
appearance of adverse events, lack of benefit with the initial two doses (no benefit
on patient VAS), patient’s satisfaction
with pain relief, the highest dose was
reached, or patient’s noncompliance. Patients were reminded by telephone calls
for the due visits and also were traced for
missed visits. In case of a missed visit, the
patient was given the scheduled dose if
he/she turned up during the stipulated
time of 2 weeks or else the placebo washout
was given and the next scheduled drug
was started. Patients were not allowed
any pain medication other than up to
3 g per day paracetamol as a rescue medication during the trial period, except
24 h prior to assessment. Compliance
was assessed by direct questioning
and pill counting. Success of blinding
was assessed by the accuracy of the
physician’s prediction at the end of the
study.
Statistical analysis
The sample size calculation was based on
the means and SDs observed for pain
scores in previous trials of duloxetine
versus placebo and amitriptyline versus
placebo in PDN. The efficacy of both
drugs was estimated to be 70%. To prove
that there is no difference in efficacy
between the two treatments, with twosided significance levels of 2.5% and
power of 80%, a within-subject SD of
20%, and a maximum-allowable difference of 10%, the total number of patients
to be included was 44. Because of its
cross-over design, with 40% noncompliance and loss to follow-up, we decided to
include a total of 60 patients in the study.
The primary and secondary efficacy analyses were performed on the intention-totreat population, defined as patients who
received at least one dose of randomized
study medication and had at least one
postbaseline efficacy assessment. Values
are expressed as means 6 SD, median

with interquartile range (IQR), and numbers and percentages.
The median pain scores, the patient
VAS, the Likert pain scale, and the McGill
Pain Questionnaire were compared using
the Wilcoxon matched-pair test. In addition, data from all visits were compared
with baseline scores using the Friedman
test for intragroup comparison. PGIC was
compared by the McNemar-Bowker test.
The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale,
altered sleep pattern, percentage of patients showing improvement, treatment
preference, and incidence of adverse
events were compared using the x2 test
or Fisher exact test. Baseline parameters
were compared by the Student paired or
unpaired t test, x2 test, or Fisher exact
test. A P value ,0.05 was considered significant. SPSS (version 12.0) was used to
perform analysis.
RESULTS—The study was conducted
between March 2009 and April 2010.
Patient demography, clinical characteristics, and disposition through the study
period are summarized in Table 1 and
Fig. 1, respectively. Of 203 patients
screened, 86 were found to be eligible
and 65 patients reported for randomization following the run-in period. Of a total
of 58 patients, 53 (91%) completed the
study with .80% compliance. The reasons for noncompliance included frequent follow-up visits and long distance
from home to the hospital. Scores at baseline both before and after the crossover
were similar in the two groups, and,
thus, the data were pooled. No patient
suffered from depression as per the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. Previously
tried treatments for neuropathic pain included the use of pregabalin in 20%, amitriptyline in 8%, and duloxetine and
gabapentin in 2% of patients each.
With duloxetine, 59% (n = 34) of patients showed good improvement, 22%
(n = 13) showed moderate improvement,
and 9% (n = 5) showed mild improvement. With amitriptyline, 55% (n = 32)
of patients showed good improvement,
24% (n = 14) showed moderate improvement, and 16% (n = 9) showed mild improvement (Fig. 2).
Overall pain relief of .30% was observed in 64 and 62% of patients with
duloxetine and amitriptyline, respectively, and .50% improvement was seen
in 59 and 55% of patients with duloxetine
and amitriptyline, respectively. No significant difference in the efficacy between the
two treatments was observed on other
scales as well (McGill Pain Questionnaire and Likert scale), and both drugs
significantly relieved pain at 6 weeks
(P , 0.001 for both). Significant improvement in sleep and overall well being
was observed with both drugs (P , 0.001
for both).
Of the total study population 5, 14,
and 30% preferred 20, 40, and 60 mg
duloxetine, respectively, whereas 5, 22,
and 9% preferred 10, 25, and 50 mg of
amitriptyline, respectively, based on pain
relief and tolerability. In the whole
cohort, 48% (n = 28) of patients preferred
duloxetine and 36% (n = 21) of patients
preferred amitriptyline, but it was not statistically significant (P = 0.18). In addition,
16% of patients had no preference, out of
which 9% were equally satisfied and 7%
were equally dissatisfied with either treatment options. Forty-eight percent (n = 28)
of patients with amitriptyline and 65%
(n = 38) with duloxetine were uptitrated
to their highest doses of 50 and 60 mg,
respectively. Significantly more patients
preferred a higher dose of duloxetine

(n = 17) compared with amitriptyline (n = 5;
P , 0.02).
Table 2 depicts TEAEs with the two
drugs. The events were similar between
amitriptyline (n = 111) and duloxetine
(n = 112). The number of mild TEAEs
with duloxetine was higher compared
with amitriptyline (P , 0.02), whereas
the number of moderate to severe TEAEs,
limiting dose uptitration and requiring intervention or discontinuation of the drug,
was higher with amitriptyline (P , 0.01).
Moderate to severe TEAEs were more
common with amitriptyline compared
with duloxetine (51 vs. 24% of patients;
P , 0.01). Of all the events, dry mouth
was significantly more common with amitriptyline (P , 0.01). The more common
adverse events reported with duloxetine
were constipation and somnolence. No
significant change in weight was noticed
with either therapy. The mean A1C levels
improved from 8.2 to 7.8% (P , 0.01).
The fasting and postprandial plasma
glucose levels, lipid profile, and renal
and liver function tests did not change
significantly with either of the drugs
over the treatment period. The investigator was able to identify the prescribed
drug correctly in 34% of the patients at
the run-out phase. The median VAS (IQR)
score increased from 26 (10–40) to 40
(20–54) at the end of run-out phase (P ,
0.001), and the average run-out duration
was 21 6 12 days.
CONCLUSIONS—The current study
compared the efficacy and safety of
duloxetine with amitriptyline head to
head in patients with PDN. Both drugs
demonstrated comparable efficacy and safety
as per the established pain-rating scales for
PDN. Although, numerically, more patients
preferred duloxetine over amitriptyline, this
did not reach the level of significance.
In the present trial, both duloxetine
and amitriptyline demonstrated similar
efficacy (.30% pain relief). More than
50% improvement in pain score was observed in 59% of patients with duloxetine,
compared with 49–52% in various
placebo-controlled trials (4,5,13), and
55% with amitriptyline, compared with
51–58% in other placebo-controlled and
active-control trials (14–16). Improvement in pain was significant with both
drugs as per patient assessment by the
VAS, the 11-point Likert scale, and the
McGill Pain Questionnaire. These findings
are in concordance with previous studies (17,18) where pain evaluation was
confirmed by similar well-established
pain-evaluation scores. In addition, neuropathy status was evaluated using wellestablished scales like the DNS score, DNE
score, and modified NSS, which also demonstrated significant improvement. The
pain scores demonstrated pain resurgence
during the washout and run-out phase
(Fig. 2). This suggests that the drugs do
not affect the basic pathophysiology of
PDN; however, it also is too short a duration of therapy to comment on the same.
There was comparable improvement in
sleep with both drugs, as per the sleep
score. There was a significant improvement in A1C over the trial period, and
thus the reduction in cumulative glycemic
burden can be expected to contribute to
the pain relief and may have a confounding effect on the efficacy assessment
(13,19). However, this is negated because
of the cross-over study design and demonstration of pain resurgence during the
washout and run-out phases.
The various published placebocontrolled studies on duloxetine for treating PDN have parallel designs for efficacy

and safety evaluation (3,20). The current
study has a cross-over design and dose
titration was gradual, from a low 20–60
mg daily compared with trials evaluating
20–120 mg fixed daily doses. It was considered appropriate to plan two weekly
evaluations because previous trials have
demonstrated efficacy within 2 weeks of
the onset of therapy. Therefore, the study
was planned to be of shorter duration
(i.e., 6 weeks of active drug therapy compared with a duration of 12–52 weeks, as
in other trials [5,21]). The most preferred
effective doses were 60 mg duloxetine
and 25 mg amitriptyline, which are lower
than the recommended dose range of 60–
120 mg and 25–150 mg for duloxetine
and amitriptyline, respectively (1,22,23).
Even at these doses, moderate pain relief
was achieved, and as conferred in the previous studies the lower doses of amitriptyline are effective because of the possible
lower body size and weight of the Indian
population (17,18,24).
The overall safety assessment was
comparable for both duloxetine and
amitriptyline, except for the intensity of
adverse events. Dose escalation with
amitriptyline was limited by its TEAEs
(especially dry mouth). There were no
significant differences in the laboratory
parameters before and after the treatment,
suggesting the safety of both drugs. Adverse events with both drugs were comparable with those reported in the previous
studies (5,13,14,17,20,21,25).
The strengths of the study include the
randomized, active-control, cross-over,
double-blind, and adequately powered
design with a good compliance rate. In
addition, use of multiple established rating scales for evaluating neuropathy as
well as efficacy and gradual dose uptitration enhanced the outcome evaluation. The
study was limited by the lack of a placebo
arm, which might have enhanced the
sensitivity in pain relief with the test drug
in PDN. However, the placebo used during
the run-out phase in a single-blind manner
led to the reappearance of pain in most of
the patients necessitating intervention.
In conclusion, both amitriptyline and
duloxetine demonstrated comparable efficacy, safety, and tolerability in the management of PDN. A similar head-to-head
comparison in a multicentric clinical trial
using a larger sample size could possibly
demonstrate the superiority of either drug.
