Abstract—Background: Serotonin (5-HT) and norepinephrine (NE) are involved in pain modulation via descending
inhibitory pathways in the brain and spinal cord. Objective: To assess the efficacy of duloxetine, a dual reuptake inhibitor
of 5-HT and NE, on the reduction of pain severity, as well as secondary outcome measures in patients with diabetic
peripheral neuropathic pain (DPNP). Methods: In this double-blind study, patients with DPNP and without comorbid
depression were randomly assigned to treatment with duloxetine 60 mg once daily (QD), duloxetine 60 mg twice daily
(BID), or placebo for 12 weeks. The primary outcome measure was the weekly mean score of 24-hour average pain severity
on the 11-point Likert scale. Secondary measures and health outcome measures were also assessed. Results: Duloxetine 60
mg QD and 60 mg BID demonstrated improvement in the management of DPNP and showed rapid onset of action, with
separation from placebo beginning at week 1 on the 24-hour average pain severity score. For all secondary measures for
pain (except allodynia), mean changes showed an advantage of duloxetine over placebo, with no significant difference
between 60 mg QD and 60 mg BID. Clinical Global Impression of Severity and Patient’s Global Impression of Improvement evaluation demonstrated greater improvement on duloxetine- vs placebo-treated patients. Duloxetine showed no
notable interference on diabetic controls, and both doses were safely administered. Conclusions: This study confirms
previous findings that duloxetine at 60 mg QD and 60 mg BID is effective and safe in the management of diabetic
peripheral neuropathic pain.

Diabetes mellitus is a condition that is often associated with painful neuropathy. Diabetes affects approximately 17 million people in the United States,
and it has been predicted that 220 million people
worldwide will be afflicted by 2010.1 The lifetime
incidence of distal neuropathy was estimated to be
37% to 45% for patients with type 2 diabetes and
54% to 59% for patients with type 1 diabetes.2 Patients often report superficial pain presenting as allodynia, sharp, stabbing, or burning pain in the feet,
numbness, and tingling.3 Various agents have been
evaluated in randomized controlled clinical trials
and are currently used to treat diabetic peripheral
neuropathic pain (DPNP). These include tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) such as amitriptyline,4 imipramine,5 and desipramine,6 believed to potentiate CNS
activity of serotonin (5-HT) and norepinephrine (NE)
projections in nociceptive modulatory circuits,7 and
certain anticonvulsants such as gabapentin.8 However, these drugs are often limited by their anticholinergic, -adrenergic-blocking, and CNS side effects.
Both noradrenergic and serotonergic neurons are
involved in modulating nociceptive transmission in
the brain and spinal cord,9,10 thereby indicating that
they modulate the endogenous pain inhibitory pathways. An imbalance in these inhibitory mechanisms
may contribute to the central sensitization and hyperexcitability of the spinal and supraspinal pain
transmitting pathways. This imbalance may manifest as persistent pain11 similar to that experienced
by patients with DPNP.
Duloxetine hydrochloride, hereafter referred to as
duloxetine, is a selective 5-HT and NE reuptake inhibitor that is relatively balanced in its affinity for
both 5-HT and NE reuptake inhibition12 and is the
first Food and Drug Administration–approved prescription drug for the management of DPNP. In clinical trials, duloxetine has been shown to be safe and
effective in the treatment of depression13-15 and can
significantly reduce painful physical symptoms associated with major depressive disorder (MDD).16
Based on preclinical17 and clinical16 studies of duloxetine, this compound was tested in an earlier
study to explore its effects in humans with DPNP.18

loxetine 20 mg once daily (QD), 60 mg QD, or 60 mg
twice daily (BID) or placebo for 12 weeks.18 Based on
evidence that duloxetine was safe and effective in
the management of DPNP,18 two independent confirmatory studies, the first of which is reported here,
were conducted to assess the safety and efficacy of
duloxetine in patients with DPNP. In the present
study, patients with DPNP and without comorbid
depression were randomly assigned to treatment
with duloxetine 60 mg QD, duloxetine 60 mg BID, or
placebo for 12 weeks.
Methods. Overview. Enrollment for this study, which was conducted in 28 study centers, began in October 2002 and ended in
August 2003. This was a Phase III, multicenter, parallel, doubleblind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. The ethical review
board (ERB) provided approval of the study protocol in accordance
with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. The ERB was
composed of medical professionals and nonmedical members
whose responsibility was to verify that the safety, welfare, and
human rights of the patients participating in the clinical trial
were protected. Investigators were responsible for monitoring the
safety of patients who entered the study, and various safety measures were evaluated during the study. This study had no planned
interim analysis. All patients provided written informed consent
after the study was explained and before the performance of any
protocol procedures and administration of the study drug.
Entry criteria. Female and male patients were eligible for the
study if they were aged 18 years or older and presented with
DPNP caused by type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus. The pain had
to begin in the feet and with relatively symmetric onset. The daily
pain must have been present for at least 6 months, and the diagnosis was to be confirmed by a score of at least 3 on the Michigan
Neuropathy Screening Instrument (MNSI). Patients had to have a
mean score of 4 (between Visit 2 and Visit 3 before randomization), when assessed by 24-hour average pain severity on the
11-point Likert scale from the patient diary, a stable glycemic
control assessed by a physician investigator, and a glycosylated
hemoglobin (HbA1c) 12% (high HbA1c [9.0% to 9.5%] is associated with rapid progression of microvascular complications). Only
patients who were judged to be reliable and had an educational
level and degree of understanding that allowed them to communicate intelligibly were included in the study. Patients were excluded if they were pregnant or breastfeeding, had previous renal
transplant or current renal dialysis, or had a serious or unstable
cardiovascular, hepatic, renal, respiratory, or hematologic illness,
symptomatic peripheral vascular disease, or other medical conditions or psychological conditions that might compromise participation in the study. Patients were also excluded if they had a
current (1 year) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV), Axis I diagnosis of MDD,
dysthymia, generalized anxiety disorder, alcohol, or eating disorders as determined by the Mini International Neuropsychiatric
Interview (MINI),19 or if they had a previous diagnosis or a
DSM-IV diagnosis of mania, bipolar disorder, or psychosis determined either by patient history or by diagnosis using specific
MINI modules. Other exclusion criteria were historical exposure
to drugs known to cause neuropathy, history of substance abuse or
dependence within the previous year (excluding nicotine and caffeine), a positive urine drug screen for any substances of abuse or
excluded medication, or a history of a medical condition, including
pernicious anemia and hypothyroidism, or treatment with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) or fluoxetine within 30 days of
randomization. Patients were excluded if they had severe allergic
reactions to multiple medications and prior participation in a
study of duloxetine.
Concomitant medication exclusions included chronic use of antidepressants, antiemetics, and analgesics with the exception of
acetaminophen up to 4 g/day and aspirin up to 325 mg/day. Antimanics, antimigraines, antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, capsaicin,
chloral hydrate, guanethidine, topical lidocaine, MAOIs, narcotics,
psychostimulants, oral and injectable steroids, and anticonvulsants were excluded. Concomitant medication inclusions (chronic
and episodic) were antacids, antiasthma agents, aminophylline,
birth control medication, cough/cold preparations (that did not
contain dextromethorphan), diuretics, inhaled and topical steroids, hypoglycemics, insulin, laxatives, theophylline, anticoagulants, antibiotics, antidiarrheals, and antihistamines. Medications
including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin
II receptor agonists, antiarrhythmics, anticoagulants, calcium
channel blockers, and others were allowed provided the patient
had been on a stable dose for 3 months before enrollment.
Patients were excluded if they had frequent or severe allergic
reactions with multiple medications, had an alanine aminotransferase laboratory value  1.5 times the upper limit of normal
(ULN), and a serum creatinine laboratory value  1.5 times ULN.
Study design. Visit 1 and Visit 2 occurred before randomization where entry criteria were evaluated for the patients. Those
who continued to meet all inclusion criteria and no exclusion
criteria proceeded to randomization at Visit 3. Randomization was
performed at the site level in that randomization codes were assigned to sites in blocks, but there was no further stratification.
After a 3-week assessment and screening period, patients with
DPNP and without comorbid depression were randomly assigned
to treatment with duloxetine 60 mg QD, duloxetine 60 mg BID, or
placebo in a 1:1:1 ratio. Assignment to a treatment group was
determined by a computer-generated random sequence using an
interactive voice response system (IVRS). The IVRS was used to
assign blister cards containing study drug to each patient. Site
personnel confirmed that they had located the correct blister card
by entering a confirmation number found on the card into the
IVRS. Throughout the course of the study, enrollment and patient
progress was tracked using the IVRS. Patients were instructed to
begin treatment the morning after randomization. The placebocontrolled, double-blind treatment phase lasted for 13 weeks. The
first 12 weeks of the study period was considered the acute therapy phase, and the last week was used for drug tapering. The
duloxetine 60 mg QD treatment group was started at 60 mg QD,
and at the last week of the study period, the patients’ dose was
decreased to 30 mg QD. Patients who were randomized to duloxetine 60 mg BID were started initially at 60 mg QD for 3 days,
and dosage was increased to 60 mg BID. At the last week of the
study period, the patients’ dose was decreased to 60 mg QD. Patients, investigators, and all other personnel involved with the
conduct of the study were blinded to individual treatment assignments for the duration of the study.
Efficacy measures. The primary efficacy measure for this
study was the reduction in weekly mean of the 24-hour average
pain scores (computed from diary scores between two site visits),
as measured by an 11-point (0  no pain, 10  worst possible
pain) Likert scale that was completed daily by the patients in a
diary. A reduction of approximately 2 points or approximately
30% in the 11-point pain intensity numerical rating scale represents a clinically important difference.20 Protocol-specified response at endpoint was defined as a 30% reduction from baseline
to endpoint in the 24-hour average pain score. Sustained response
was defined as a 30% reduction from baseline to endpoint in the
24-hour average pain severity with a 30% reduction from baseline
at a week at least 2 weeks before the last, and with at least a 20%
reduction from baseline at every week in between. The amount of
acetaminophen that was used to relieve pain over the past 24
hours was also recorded in the patients’ diary. The secondary
efficacy measures collected were pain severity for worst pain (referred to as 24-hour worst pain score hereafter) and night pain
(recorded daily by patients in a diary) as measured by the 11-point
Likert scale, the Patient’s Global Impression of Improvement
(PGI-Improvement) scale21 recorded at weeks 4, 8, and 12, the
Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) (severity),22 and the Clinical Global
Impression of Severity (CGI-Severity)21 scales recorded at randomization, weeks 4, 8, and 12, and the Sensory Portion of the Short
Form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ),23 the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD17)24,25 and dynamic allodynia
that was recorded at randomization and week 12.
Health outcomes measures. The impact of duloxetine compared with placebo on patient-reported health outcomes was measured by the interference portion of the BPI, Short Form 36
(SF-36),26 and European Quality of Life Instrument 5D version
(EQ-5D).27 The SF-36 was completed by the patient and measured
how the patient perceived general status. The SF-36 consisted of
36 items that calculated eight health domains: bodily pain, general health, mental health, physical functioning, role–physical,
1412 NEUROLOGY 67 October (2 of 2) 2006
role– emotional, social function, and vitality. The EQ-5D was completed by the patient to measure how severe the patient perceived
general health. The interference portion of the BPI was completed
by the patient to measure how much pain had interfered with
several patient outcomes, such as general activity, mood, walking
ability, sleep, and relationships with other people.
Pharmacokinetic evaluation. Blood samples were collected for
pharmacokinetic evaluation of plasma duloxetine concentrations
at steady state.
Safety assessments. Safety measures evaluated during the
study were discontinuations, treatment-emergent adverse events
(TEAEs), vital signs (sitting blood pressure and heart rate),
weight, electrocardiograms, and laboratory analyses. Electrophysiology assessment was performed using nerve conduction studies
to determine whether duloxetine degraded motor and large sensory nerve (ulnar motor and sensory nerves, and peroneal motor
nerve) function. The frequency of significant hypoglycemic events
was elicited by a questionnaire derived from the results of the
Diabetes Control and Complications Trial. A patient considered to
have sustained elevation in blood pressure after randomization
met the following criteria: sitting diastolic blood pressure  85
mm Hg and increase from baseline of 10 mm Hg for three consecutive visits, or sitting systolic blood pressure  130 mm Hg and
increase from baseline of 10 mm Hg for three consecutive visits.
Statistical analysis. This study was designed to enroll 330
patients in 1:1:1 ratio to the three treatment groups (placebo,
duloxetine 60 mg QD, and duloxetine 60 mg BID). With 110 patients per arm, this study would have at least 90% power to detect
a treatment group difference of 1.20 points in the baseline-toendpoint mean change on the weekly mean of 24-hour average
pain score between duloxetine 60 mg BID and placebo treatment
groups. The sample size was determined using a two-sided test
with   0.05 and assuming a common SD of 2.2 and a discontinuation rate of 35%.
An intent-to-treat principle was used in the analyses of all
efficacy variables, i.e., patients were analyzed based on their randomized treatment assignment, even if the patient did not take
the assigned treatment, did not receive the correct treatment, or
did not follow or complete the protocol. For each efficacy variable,
the analysis included all randomized patients with a baseline and
at least one nonmissing postbaseline observation.
Baseline was defined as the last nonmissing observation at or
before randomization, and endpoint was defined as the last nonmissing observation in the acute therapy phase. For the efficacy
measures, the treatment group differences in change from baseline to endpoint were evaluated using the analysis of covariance
(ANCOVA) model (with the terms of treatment, investigator, and
the baseline). As specified in the protocol, the primary treatment
contrast was to compare duloxetine 60 mg BID with placebo using
the Type III sum of squares for the least-square means, and thus,
no adjustments for multiple pairwise comparisons were made. The
treatment-by-investigator interaction was evaluated using the
above model with the addition of the interaction term using
the Type II sum of squares. Significant interaction was evaluated
at the significance level of 0.10. The longitudinal observations on
the efficacy variables were also analyzed using a repeatedmeasures analysis. The statistical inferences from the two different analytical methodologies demonstrated a high degree of
consistency for all of the efficacy variables. Therefore, results from
the ANCOVA were presented for the majority of the variables
except for the primary efficacy measure, for which the results
from both methodologies were presented. The weekly mean scores
for the three pain scores (24-hour average pain, night pain, and
24-hour worst pain) were computed from patients’ daily diaries. If
the nonmissing diary count was 3, the mean score was set as
missing.
Proportions were analyzed using the Fisher exact test. The
average daily dose of acetaminophen used for DPNP relief was
calculated from dosage collected from the patient’s diary during
the acute therapy and was analyzed using an analysis of variance
(ANOVA) model on the rank-transformed data, because the distribution was skewed. The same approach was applied to the evaluation of weekly average number of significant hypoglycemic
episodes.
Changes in vital signs, EKGs, and electrophysiology variables
were evaluated using an ANOVA model with the terms of treatment, investigator, and treatment-by-investigator interaction,
whereas laboratory analytes were evaluated in the ranktransformed format, because the distribution of raw data for most
of the analytes was skewed.
Throughout the manuscript, the term significant indicates statistical significance, and when presenting efficacy results, the
mean change refers to least-squares mean change.
Results. Patient disposition, demographics, and disease
characteristics. The flow of patient progress through the
trial is shown in figure 1. A total of 561 patients were
screened to identify 334 patients who were randomized to
study treatment. One-hundred eight patients received placebo, 114 patients received duloxetine 60 mg QD, and 112
patients received duloxetine 60 mg BID. Patient demographics and clinical characteristics at baseline are shown
in table 1. The majority of patients were male (61.1%) and

white (78.1%). The mean patient age was 60.7 years. The
mean duration of diabetes in all patients was 10.2 years,
with type II diabetes being the most prevalent (91%). The
mean MNSI score was 5.6 out of a possible maximum score
of 10, with a higher score indicating a greater degree of
neuropathy.
Eighty-six patients withdrew from the study during the
acute therapy phase: 29 (25%) from the duloxetine 60 mg
QD-treated group, 34 (30%) from the duloxetine 60 mg
BID-treated group, and 23 (21%) from the placebo-treated
group (figure 1).
At baseline, a significant difference among treatment
groups was observed for the BPI average interference
score. The mean BPI average interference score was highest in the duloxetine 60 mg BID treatment group (5.0),
followed by the duloxetine 60 mg QD treatment group (4.7)
and the placebo treatment group (4.2).
Efficacy. The mean change from baseline to week 12 on
the 24-hour average pain score is presented in table 2, and
the mean change from baseline to each postbaseline visit is
shown in figure 2. Both duloxetine 60 mg QD and 60 mg BID
were significant compared with placebo, thereby demonstrating a highly significant treatment effect of duloxetine on the
management of DPNP as measured by the primary efficacy
variable. A treatment-by-investigator interaction was observed (p  0.007) on the 24-hour average pain score. The
interaction was mainly caused by Investigator 004. The results from Investigator 004 showed that mean changes of
24-hour average pain scores for duloxetine 60 mg BID and
placebo were opposite to the direction postulated: duloxetine 60 mg BID–treated patients got worse compared with
baseline, whereas placebo-treated patients improved compared with baseline. The effect seen by Investigator 004 is
qualitatively different from all other investigators. When
Investigator 004 was excluded from the analysis, the
treatment-by-investigator interaction was no longer significant, and both duloxetine 60 mg BID and duloxetine 60
mg QD remained significant compared with placebo (p 

0.001). Therefore, with or without Investigator 004, the
results demonstrated a highly significant treatment effect
of duloxetine in the management of DPNP as seen on the
primary efficacy variable. Duloxetine 60 mg QD and 60 mg
BID treatment groups showed a significant decrease in
pain severity compared with placebo beginning at week 1
and continuing throughout the study, with no significant
difference between the duloxetine 60 mg QD and 60 mg
BID treatment groups. The mean difference from placebo
at endpoint was 1.32 (95% CI 1.95 to 0.69) for the
duloxetine 60 mg QD treatment group and 1.44 (95% CI
2.08 to 0.81) for the duloxetine 60 mg BID treatment
group.
In the mean change analyses, duloxetine 60 mg QD and
60 mg BID were significant compared with placebo on all
secondary measures (table 2) except for HAMD17 total
score and dynamic allodynia. Analyses of the 24-hour
worst pain severity revealed that both duloxetine 60 mg
QD and 60 mg BID were significant compared with placebo. Mean change analysis in night pain score showed
that both duloxetine 60 mg QD and 60 mg BID were significant compared with placebo, beginning 1 week after randomization and continuing through the study. Both
duloxetine 60 mg QD and 60 mg BID were significant
compared with placebo on all BPI-Severity, CGI-Severity,
and PGI-Improvement scale scores, as well as in improving
the total score of the SF-MPQ.
A treatment-by-investigator interaction (p  0.10) was
observed for 24-hour worst pain severity, night pain severity, BPI individual severity score, and SF-MPQ total score.
This interaction was no longer significant when Investigator 004 was excluded from the analyses, while the significance of the differences between duloxetine treatment
group and placebo remained the same.
For the HAMD17 total score, placebo was significant compared with duloxetine 60 mg BID. This finding, however, was
likely due to noise of the data and was not clinically relevant
because at baseline, due to exclusion criteria, patients demonstrated extremely low mean baseline HAMD17 total scores
(range of 3.31 to 3.55), as patients with depression were excluded from this study. Significant differences were observed

for both duloxetine 60 mg QD and 60 mg BID in the 24-hour

the 24-hour average pain response, as specified by the protocol as the criterion for response, was achieved by 42% of
patients in the placebo-treated group, 63% in the duloxetine
60 mg QD–treated group (p  0.003 vs placebo), and 69% in
the duloxetine 60 mg BID–treated group (p  0.001 vs placebo). A 50% reduction in the 24-hour average pain response
was achieved by 27% of patients in the placebo-treated
group, 43% in the duloxetine 60 mg QD–treated group (p
 0.05 vs placebo), and 53% in the duloxetine 60 mg
BID–treated group (p  0.001 vs placebo). Duloxetine 60
mg QD (p  0.004) and 60 mg BID (p  0.001) demonstrated significance compared with placebo at achieving
sustained response. Sustained response was achieved by
54% of duloxetine 60 mg QD– and 62% of duloxetine 60
mg BID–treated patients compared with 34% of placebotreated patients.
Concomitant acetaminophen use during the acute therapy phase. The median average daily dose for concomitant acetaminophen used for DPNP collected from the
patient diary during the acute therapy phase indicated
that patients treated with duloxetine 60 mg BID used a
significantly lower median daily dose of concomitant acetaminophen compared with patients treated with duloxetine 60 mg QD or placebo-treated patients (figure 3).

Health outcomes analyses. In the SF-36 health survey,
duloxetine 60 mg QD was significantly better than placebo
in the physical component summary and the domains of
physical functioning, role limitations due to physical problems, and vitality (table 3). Duloxetine 60 mg BID was
significantly better than placebo in the physical component
summary and domains of bodily pain, general health perceptions, mental health, physical functioning, and role limitations due to physical problems. In the analysis of the
EQ-5D, duloxetine 60 mg QD and 60 mg BID were both
significantly better than placebo. Duloxetine 60 mg BID
was significant compared with placebo at reducing scores
in all BPI interference scales.
A significant treatment-by-investigator interaction was
observed for physical functioning and bodily pain on the
SF-36 and the EQ-5D index score. The interaction was no
longer significant when Investigator 004 was excluded,
and the results of statistical comparison remained the
same.
Pharmacokinetic evaluation. Plasma duloxetine concentrations in patients taking duloxetine 60 mg BID were
96.6 (SD  83.3) ng/mL, and those in patients taking duloxetine 60 mg QD were 41.3 (SD  37.4) ng/mL.
Safety. Adverse events. Of the 334 randomly assigned patients, 79 placebo-treated patients (73.1%), 102
duloxetine 60 mg QD–treated patients (89.5%) (p  0.002
vs placebo), and 96 duloxetine 60 mg BID–treated patients
(85.7%) (p  0.029 vs placebo) reported at least one TEAE.
Table 4 shows the top 10 TEAEs by decreasing frequency.
Patients in both duloxetine-treated groups reported
treatment-emergent nausea, fatigue, somnolence, increased
sweating, and dry mouth significantly more frequently than
placebo-treated patients. Additionally, compared with
placebo-treated patients, dizziness and diarrhea were reported significantly more frequently by duloxetine 60 mg
QD–treated patients, and constipation, insomnia, decreased
appetite, asthenia, erectile dysfunction, and tremor were reported significantly more frequently by duloxetine 60 mg
BID–treated patients. Forty-five patients (13.5%) discontinued during the therapy phase because of adverse
events (duloxetine 60 mg QD, 17 [14.9%]; duloxetine 60
mg BID, 20 [17.9%]; placebo, 8 [7.4%]), with differences
between duloxetine 60 mg BID– and placebo-treated
groups (p  0.025). Nausea (5.3%) and dizziness (2.6%)
were reported as reasons for discontinuation in 1% of
duloxetine 60 mg QD–treated patients. Nausea (5.4%),
fatigue (2.7%), and somnolence (2.7%) were reported as
reasons for discontinuation in 1% of duloxetine 60 mg
BID–treated patients.
A serious adverse event was defined as any adverse
event from the study resulting in one of the following outcomes (or was significant for any other reason): death,
initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization, a lifethreatening experience, persistent or significant disability/
incapacity, or congenital anomaly/birth defect. No deaths
were reported during the study. Twelve patients (3.6%)
experienced serious adverse events with no significant
treatment group differences. These included 5 duloxetine
60 mg QD–treated patients (4.4%) (events: congestive cardiac failure, coronary artery stenosis, hip fracture, prostate cancer, hypokalemia, hyponatremia), 2 duloxetine 60
mg BID–treated patients (1.8%) (events: blood calcium increased, concussion), and 5 placebo-treated patients (4.6%)
(events: atrioventricular block second degree, carcinoma,
chronic obstructive airways disease exacerbated, diabetic
ulcer, fatigue, hypertension).
Twenty-eight (8.4%) of the 334 patients reported at
least one adverse event that emerged during the 1-week
drug taper phase (7 duloxetine 60 mg QD–treated patients
[6.1%], 10 duloxetine 60 mg BID–treated patients [8.9%],
and 11 placebo-treated patients [10.2%]; no events occurred in 1% of patients in either duloxetine treatment
group, and in the placebo-treated group, the events reported by 1% of patients were headache [2.8%] and arthralgia [1.9%]). There were no significant treatment
group differences in the overall incidence of taperemergent adverse events or in any single taper-emergent
adverse event.

Laboratory data, vital signs, and electrocardiographic
data. Although duloxetine-treated patients showed
changes in chemistry laboratory assessments, these
changes were of low magnitude and not considered clinically relevant. Duloxetine 60 mg QD– and 60 mg BID–
treated patients experienced a significant mean increase in
alkaline phosphatase (ALKPH) compared with placebotreated patients. Duloxetine 60 mg BID–treated patients
experienced a significant mean decrease in chloride and
uric acid and duloxetine 60 mg QD–treated patients experienced a significant mean increase in inorganic phosphorous compared with placebo-treated patients. Bilirubin
was elevated in association with elevation of aspartate
transaminase/serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase in
one duloxetine 60 mg QD–treated patient and with elevation of creatine phosphokinase (CPK) in one placebotreated patient. In this 12-week study, duloxetine did not
seem to adversely affect lipid profiles (table 5) or glycemic
control (table 6).
There were no significant mean changes in ulnar and
peroneal nerve function measures from baseline to endpoint in patients receiving duloxetine 60 mg QD, duloxetine 60 mg BID, or placebo. Duloxetine did not prolong
the QT interval. There were no significant treatment
group differences in mean change of systolic and diastolic
blood pressure. Patients treated with duloxetine 60 mg
BID experienced a slight but significant mean increase in
heart rate (2.41 beats per minute [bpm]) compared with
duloxetine 60 mg QD–treated patients (0.35 bpm) and
placebo-treated patients (0.99 bpm), and patients in both
duloxetine-treated groups experienced a slight but significant mean decrease in weight (1.37 kg in each group)
compared with placebo-treated patients (0.01 kg). However, neither of these effects was considered clinically
relevant.
Discussion. Diabetes mellitus is common in the
United States, and it is estimated that the prevalence of neuropathy in diabetic patients is 30% in
hospital patients and 20% in community patients.28
Over time, neuropathic pain can become a common
complication. The first line of management of DPNP
has involved administration of TCAs with reuptake
inhibitory activity for both 5-HT and NE and anticonvulsants.4,6,29,30 However, because this condition
primarily affects the elderly, these patients may be
more susceptible to the -adrenergic blocking, anticholinergic, and cardiac conduction effects associated
with TCAs. Other treatments have involved capsaicin cream and isosorbide dinitrate spray.
Although head-to-head comparison studies have
not been conducted, a great deal of evidence suggests
that dual 5-HT and NE reuptake inhibitors provide
better efficacy, whereas randomized trials of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) overall
have shown minimal efficacy of SSRIs in relieving
DPNP.31-33 Treatment with the 5-HT and NE reuptake inhibitor venlafaxine at high doses resulted
in lower pain intensity and greater pain relief.34 Various other studies have shown that venlafaxine may
be useful in treating pain associated with diabetic
neuropathy.35-37 However, at low doses, it is predominantly serotonergic, whereas higher doses add substantial noradrenergic effects.36 Duloxetine has a
higher affinity for both 5-HT and NE transporters38
and is relatively balanced in its affinity for both
5-HT and NE reuptake inhibition.12 It is effective in
treating pain in animal models.17,39 It is also effective

in reducing the severity of painful physical symptoms associated with depression in patients with
MDD.16,40 Because noradrenergic and serotonergic
neurons may modulate the endogenous pain inhibitory pathways,9,10 the ability of duloxetine to exert its
effects on both these neurotransmitter systems may
explain its effectiveness in this clinical trial.
This study confirms previous findings that duloxetine at 60 mg QD and 60 mg BID was safe and
demonstrated robust evidence of efficacy in the management of DPNP.18 Both studies were adequately
designed and powered a priori to ensure that a statistical comparison of efficacy between placebo- and
duloxetine-treated groups could be undertaken. In
both studies, beginning in week 1, duloxetine was
significant compared with placebo in improvement of
a priori– declared primary outcome measure, the 24-
hour average pain score. An earlier study conducted18 also included a dose of duloxetine 20 mg to
establish a subtherapeutic dose in the management
of DPNP. The 20 mg QD dose of duloxetine did not
show significant separation from placebo on the primary efficacy measure and many secondary efficacy
measures. Effect size presentation for 24-hour average pain score, response rate, and sustained response rate clearly and consistently demonstrated
that duloxetine 60 mg QD was more efficacious than
duloxetine 20 mg QD. In the study presented here,
significant pain reduction was demonstrated on the
24-hour average pain score, worst pain score, night
pain score, and various health outcome measures.
This demonstrates the clinical relevance of the
changes in pain severity observed.
Although the HAMD17 rating scale showed that
placebo was significant compared with duloxetine 60
mg BID, this difference was not clinically relevant
because patients had low mean baseline HAMD17
scores (3.4) due to exclusion criteria. A HAMD17
score of 7 is often used as an indicator of remission
in the MDD population. These patients were normal
with regard to mood disorder; thus there was minimal room for improvement in mood.
The incidence of serious adverse events was low,
and no deaths occurred during the study. The only
adverse events leading to discontinuation in 1% of
duloxetine-treated patients were nausea, dizziness,
somnolence, and fatigue. Although nausea was the
most frequently reported adverse event, it usually
occurred at the beginning of treatment and decreased quickly over time. Patients in the present
study were started on duloxetine 60 mg QD and underwent titration to 60 mg BID over just 3 days.
Results from a previous study in patients with MDD
suggest that initiating duloxetine treatment at 30
mg QD for 1 week, followed by escalation to 60 mg
QD, may reduce the risk of treatment-emergent nausea when compared with starting at 60 mg QD.41
These results suggest that some patients would have
better tolerability with a lower duloxetine starting
dose and slower titration. In this study, no adverse
effects on glycemic control or lipid profiles were detected. Duloxetine did not prolong the QT interval or
cause a significant change in blood pressure compared with placebo. There were no clinically relevant
changes in heart rate or weight that were experienced by patients taking duloxetine 60 mg QD or 60
mg BID in this trial. The lack of significant
treatment-group differences in any of the electrophysiology measures indicated that duloxetine did
not alter motor and large sensory nerve fiber function in DPNP patients. The safety findings reported
in this study are in general agreement with the findings in other studies that indicate that duloxetinetreated patients with depression do not experience
clinically relevant changes in heart rate and blood
pressure.13,15 In summary, duloxetine was generally
well tolerated, although it is not without side effects.
The efficacy of duloxetine 60 mg QD and that of
duloxetine 60 mg BID were similar, and the numeric
advantage of the higher dose on many outcome measures was not significant. Previous studies have
shown that duloxetine exhibits linear pharmacokinetics with regard to dose and duration of treatment,42 and the results of the trial presented here
show that plasma concentrations in patients taking
duloxetine 60 mg BID were slightly more than twice
those in patients taking duloxetine 60 mg QD. Because duloxetine 60 mg QD represents the lowest
consistently effective total daily dose and considering
the advantage of a once-daily regimen and administration of a lower total daily dose, the recommended
dose of duloxetine in the management of DPNP is 60
mg QD. Although a higher dose may be less well
tolerated, some patients may obtain an additional
benefit from doses up to 60 mg BID.
