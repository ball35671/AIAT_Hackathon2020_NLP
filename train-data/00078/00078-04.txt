Efficacy and Safety of Duloxetine 30 mg/d in Patients
With Fibromyalgia
A Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled Study
Lesley M. Arnold, MD,* Shuyu Zhang, MS,w and Beth A. Pangallo, RN, MSMw
Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of duloxetine 30 mg/d
in adults with fibromyalgia.
Methods: This 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted in the United States, Mexico, Argentina, and Israel and enrolled patients meeting the criteria for
primary fibromyalgia as defined by the American College of
Rheumatology. The primary endpoint was the average pain severity item from the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI)-Modified Short
Form, assessed by an analysis of covariance model using change
from baseline to the modified baseline-observation-carried-forward
endpoint. Secondary endpoints included the Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I) score and the Fibromyalgia
Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) total score and those measuring pain,
depression, anxiety, health outcomes, and safety.
Results: Patients (mean age, 51 y; 95% female; 87% White; 22% with
major depressive disorder) received duloxetine 30 mg/d (N= 155) or
placebo (N= 153). Duloxetine-treated patients did not have a statistically significant BPI-Modified Short Form average pain severity
reduction versus placebo-treated patients (2.04 vs. 1.70; P= 0.202).
There was a significant difference between duloxetine-treated and placebo-treated patients (P< 0.05) for the PGI-I endpoint score (2.97 vs.
3.35) and the changes in FIQ total score (14.62 vs. 9.75) and the
Short-Form Health Survey (SF)-36 mental component score. Discontinuations due to adverse events did not differ significantly between
treatment groups; nausea and dry mouth were the only adverse events
with a significantly higher incidence with duloxetine versus placebo.
Discussion: Duloxetine 30 mg/d did not significantly reduce pain severity in patients with fibromyalgia. However, duloxetine-treated patients reported global improvement in symptoms and function. Safety
findings were consistent with the known duloxetine safety profile.

Fibromyalgia (FM) is characterized by widespread pain
and muscle tenderness often accompanied by sleep disturbances and fatigue.1 The pathophysiology of FM is unknown, but there is evidence that dysfunction in norepinephrine (NE) and serotonin (5-HT) systems could play
a role.2–4 Both 5-HT and NE have been implicated in
the mediation of endogenous pain mechanisms through the
descending inhibitory pain pathway.5–7
Duloxetine hydrochloride (hereafter referred to as
duloxetine) is a relatively balanced and selective 5-HT and
NE uptake inhibitor that lacks significant affinity for other
neuronal receptors or ion channels (including sodium and
calcium channels).8,9 In the United States, it is approved
at a target dose of 60 mg/d for the management of FM.
In addition, duloxetine is approved in the United States
for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD)
and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and the management of diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain and chronic
musculoskeletal pain.10 Treatment with duloxetine at
60 mg/d results in significant improvement in measures of
pain and function and is generally well tolerated in adults
with FM.11–14
In 2 phase 3 FM studies,13,14 patients received 1 week
of duloxetine 30 mg/d before being titrated to a higher dose
of 60 mg/d. At the end of the 1-week titration period, patients on duloxetine 30 mg/d had a statistically significant
reduction in the average pain severity compared with placebo-treated patients. Because patients were then titrated
to 60 or 120 mg/d in these studies, longer term data (ie,
beyond 1 wk) on the efficacy of duloxetine 30 mg/d were not
available. One of these studies13 also included a 20 mg/d
dose arm; there was a statistically significant difference
between the duloxetine 20 mg/d and the placebo in some
efficacy outcomes [Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I) and Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire
(FIQ) total score], although that study was not powered to
detect the treatment differences at this dose. Because of the
possibility that a lower dose of duloxetine (30 mg/d) might
be efficacious for the management of FM, we conducted
this double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate
further the efficacy and safety of duloxetine 30 mg/d in
adults with FM over a period of 12 weeks.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Overview
This was a phase 4, 12-week, parallel-group, doubleblind, placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate the
efficacy and safety of duloxetine 30 mg/d in adults with FM.
The study was conducted in 29 outpatient research centers
in the United States, Mexico, Israel, and Argentina, between September 2009 and November 2010. The Institutional Review Board at each site approved the protocol,
which was developed in accordance with the standards of

Good Clinical Practice and the Declaration of Helsinki. All
prospective patients gave written informed consent for
study participation.
Entry Criteria
Women and men Z18 years of age who met the
American College of Rheumatology 1990 criteria for primary FM1 and had a score of Z4 on the average pain
severity item of the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI)-Modified
Short Form15 were eligible for study participation. Patients
with or without MDD or GAD, as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th ed.
and confirmed by the Mini International Neuropsychiatric
Interview,16,17 were included.
Exclusion criteria included prior treatment with duloxetine; prior participation in a duloxetine study; a history
of substance abuse within the past year; a primary psychiatric disorder other than MDD or GAD within the last
year; a history of psychosis or bipolar disorder; clinically
judged to be at risk of suicide; pregnant or breast-feeding;
pain symptoms unrelated to FM that could interfere with
interpretation of outcome measures; regional pain syndromes; failed back syndrome; chronic localized pain related to any past surgery, and a confirmed current or
previous diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis; inflammatory
arthritis, or infectious arthritis; or an autoimmune disease.
Patients who, in the opinion of the investigator, were
judged to be treatment-refractory or whose response might
be compromised by disability compensation, or had an
unstable medical condition were also excluded. Concomitant medication exclusions included use of medications
or herbal agents with primarily central nervous system activity; regular use of analgesics other than acetaminophen
up to 2 g/day and aspirin up to 325 mg for cardiac prophylaxis; topical lidocaine or capsaicin, antidepressants,
anticonvulsants, barbiturates, muscle relaxants; chronic use
of anti-emetics, hypnotics and sedatives; < 3 months stable
therapy of anti-hypertensives, anti-arrhythmics, diuretics,
and hormones; steroids other than episodic treatment of
symptoms unrelated to FM; and benzodiazepine use for
FM pain. Some analgesics, such as non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs and narcotics, were allowed episodically but only for acute injury or surgery.
Study Design and Treatment
The 5- to 30-day screening period was followed by a
12-week randomized, double-blind treatment period. At
baseline, demographics and baseline measures for study
outcomes were collected (Table 1). The Patient’s Global
Impression of Severity (PGI-S), a patient-rated 7-point
scale that measures the perceived severity of symptoms, and
the Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S) for
Depression, a physician-administered 7-point scale to
evaluate a patient’s severity of depression at the time of
assessment, were only administered at baseline; PGI-I and
Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I) for
Depression, respectively, were administered postbaseline
(see Outcome measures section).
Patients were randomized by a computer-generated
random sequence using an interactive voice response system
to duloxetine 30 mg/d (2 capsules: 1 placebo, 1 duloxetine
30 mg) or placebo (2 capsules: both placebo) in a 1:1 ratio.
The duloxetine and placebo capsules were identical in appearance to maintain the blinding. Patients were instructed
to take 2 capsules at approximately the same time every
day, preferably in the morning without any instructions
regarding whether or not to take with food. Patients in
either treatment group who were diagnosed with MDD
at baseline and whose depression worsened during the
12-week double-blind period were rescued with duloxetine
60 mg/d (two 30 mg capsules) for the remainder of the
treatment period; worsening depression was defined as a
CGI-I for Depression score of 5 (minimally worse), 6 (much
worse), or 7 (very much worse). Patients and investigators
were kept blinded to the rescue criteria and dose increase;
site personnel entered the MDD status at baseline and the
CGI-I for Depression scores through Interactive Voice
Response System (IVRS) at every visit.
Patients who discontinued from the study at any time
or completed the 12-week treatment period had the option
of entering a 1-week double-blind taper period. During the
taper period, patients who received 60 mg/d duloxetine
during the 12-week treatment period received duloxetine
30 mg/d; all other patients received placebo.
Outcome Measures
The primary outcome measure was the 24-hour average pain severity item of the BPI-Modified Short Form, a
self-reported scale that assesses the severity of pain (worst
pain, least pain, 24-hour average, and pain right now) and
the interference of pain on daily function. Each pain item is
rated on an 11-point numerical scale, ranging from 0 (no
pain) to 10 (pain as bad as you can imagine). Interference
scores range from 0 (does not interfere) to 10 (completely
interferes).
Secondary efficacy outcome measures included the
following: PGI-I,18 a patient-rated 7-point scale that
measures perceived global improvement; FIQ,19 a selfadministered 20-item questionnaire that measures the
impact of FM on patient function and outcomes over the

component summary scores are calculated. Safety and tolerability were assessed using discontinuation rates, treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), serious AEs
(SAEs), vital signs, laboratory analytes, and the Columbia
Suicide Severity Scale (C-SSRS),23 which captures the occurrence, severity, and frequency of suicide-related thoughts
and behaviors during the assessment period with additional
follow-up collected for all suicidal and nonsuicidal selfinjurious behavior.
Statistical Analyses
Assuming an effect size of 0.33 and a dropout rate of
5%, the sample size in this study would provide at least
80% power to detect a treatment group difference between
duloxetine 30 mg/d and placebo. For patients who entered
the rescue arm (duloxetine 60 mg/d), the data collected after
the dose change were excluded from all the analyses comparing duloxetine 30 mg/d with placebo.
The primary objective of this study was to assess the
efficacy of duloxetine 30 mg/d in reducing pain severity as
measured by the 24-hour average pain severity item of the
BPI-Modified Short Form. The primary objective was assessed by an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with
terms for treatment and pooled investigator and baseline
score as a covariate using change from baseline to the
modified baseline-observation-carried-forward (modified
BOCF) endpoint. That is, for patients who discontinued
because of an AE, the baseline value was used as the endpoint, and for all other patients, the last nonmissing postbaseline observation before rescue therapy (if any) was used
as the endpoint. A type III sum-of-squares for the leastsquares mean (LSMean) was used to assess the treatment
effect.
The primary efficacy measure was also analyzed by the
ANCOVA model using the last-observation-carried-forward (LOCF) method to impute the missing endpoint and a
likelihood-based, mixed-effects model repeated measures
(MMRM) analysis. The MMRM analysis used all the observations at each postbaseline visit and included the fixed
categorical effects of treatment, pooled investigator, visit,
and treatment-by-visit interaction and the continuous fixed
covariates of the baseline score and the baseline-by-visit
interaction. For most continuous secondary efficacy outcomes, an ANCOVA model with terms for treatment,
pooled investigator, and baseline value of the analysis
variable was used to analyze treatment group differences in
the change from baseline to LOCF endpoint. For PGI-I
and CGI-I, treatment group differences in the LOCF endpoint were analyzed using the ANCOVA model with terms
for treatment, pooled investigator, and baseline value of
PGI-S and CGI-S, respectively.
To evaluate the impact of baseline characteristics, including geographic region (United States or non-United
States), age (< 65 or Z65 y), sex, race [White or non-White
(American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Black or
African American, Hispanic or Latino, Native Hawaiian
or Other Pacific Islander)], MDD at baseline (yes or no),
GAD at baseline (yes or no), and previous analgesic use
(yes or no) on pain improvement, the change from baseline
to LOCF endpoint in the primary efficacy measure was
analyzed using the above ANCOVA model with additional
terms of the subgroup and the subgroup-by-treatment
interaction.
Treatment group differences for the response rate were
compared by Cochran Mantel-Haenszel test controlling for
pooled investigator. Treatment group differences for all
other secondary efficacy outcomes were analyzed using the
ANCOVA model with the LOCF method.
Treatment group differences for categorical safety
(AE) variables were compared using Fisher exact test.
Changes from baseline in vital signs (including sitting
blood pressure, sitting pulse rate, and weight) and laboratory findings were analyzed by the analysis of variance
model, which included terms for treatment and pooled
investigator.
All analyses were conducted on the intent-to-treat
population. Treatment group differences were evaluated on
the basis of a 2-sided significance level of 0.05, and the
treatment by subgroup interactions were assessed at a significance level of 0.10. There was no adjustment for multiple
comparisons. All statistical analyses were performed using
SAS software (version 9.1; SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
RESULTS
Patient Disposition
Flow of patients through the study is shown
in Figure 1. Of the 430 patients screened, 308 were randomly assigned to treatment (placebo, 153; duloxetine,
155). Of those randomized, 121 (78%) of those assigned
duloxetine 30 mg/d and 110 (72%) of those assigned placebo completed the acute therapy period (P = 0.237). In
both treatment groups, the most common reason for early
discontinuation was AEs. There was no statistically significant treatment group difference among reasons for discontinuation from the acute therapy period.
Seventeen patients received rescue therapy with duloxetine 60 mg/d (placebo, 12; duloxetine 30 mg/d, 5), and
of these, 16 patients completed the study. One patient
(assigned placebo) discontinued rescue therapy because
of a lack of efficacy.
Baseline Demographics and Clinical
Characteristics
There were no statistically significant differences between treatment groups for patient demographic or clinical
characteristics at baseline (Table 1). The mean age for the
study population was 51 years, and the majority of patients
were White and female. The mean duration for FM
symptoms was 6.5 years, with 22% of patients diagnosed
with MDD and 6% with GAD at baseline.
Efficacy Measures
Of the 308 patients randomized, 306 (153 in each
treatment group) were included in the primary efficacy
analysis; 2 patients in the duloxetine 30 mg/d treatment

group were lost to follow-up before the postbaseline BPI
average pain severity was collected.
Patients assigned to duloxetine 30 mg/day showed a
numerically greater mean decrease (improvement) in the
BPI average pain severity item score from baseline to
endpoint (modified BOCF) than those assigned placebo,
but the difference between treatment groups was not statistically significant (P = 0.202) (Fig. 2). Analysis using
LOCF methods yielded similar results (Table 2). In a secondary analysis using MMRM, the mean decrease in the
BPI average pain severity score was significantly greater in
the duloxetine 30 mg/d treatment group versus the placebo
at 1 week after treatment initiation, but this difference was
not maintained at subsequent time points (Fig. 2). The
proportion of patients with at least a 30% reduction in the
average pain severity did not differ between the duloxetine
and the placebo treatment groups (49.7% vs. 43.1%;
P = 0.238), nor did the proportion with at least a 50%
reduction in the BPI average pain severity (36.6% vs.
35.9%; P = 0.902).
Treatment by subgroup interactions was not statistically significant for any subgroup analyzed except race
(White or non-White) (P= 0.017). In non-White patients
who were treated with duloxetine 30 mg, there was a statistically significantly greater mean decrease in BPI average
pain versus placebo, whereas in White patients, no statistically significant treatment group difference was observed.

It is noteworthy that the sample size was small for the nonWhite subgroup (placebo, 17; duloxetine 30 mg/d, 22).
The PGI-I, the FIQ total score, and the SF-36 mental
component summary score showed statistically significant
improvement with duloxetine 30 mg/d compared with placebo (Table 2). Patients assigned duloxetine 30 mg/d
showed a numerically greater improvement in other BPI
pain severity items and the mean interference score, the
CGI-I for Depression score, the BAI total score, and the
BDI-II total score, but the difference between treatment
groups did not reach statistical significance (Table 2). In a
post hoc analysis, the mean decrease from baseline to endpoint for the FIQ pain score (LOCF analysis) was greater
with duloxetine 30 mg/day compared with placebo, but the
difference was not statistically significant (LSMean change
2.25 vs. 1.66; P= 0.062). In another post hoc analysis,
significantly more duloxetine-treated patients were considered “responders” on the basis of their PGI-I response at
LOCF endpoint (responded “much better” or “very much
better”) compared with placebo-treated patients (44.4% vs.
32.7%, P= 0.036).
Safety
There was 1 SAE reported during the 12-week treatment period in a placebo-treated patient (irritable bowel
syndrome). No SAEs were reported during the duloxetine
60 mg rescue therapy or during the taper period.
A statistically significantly higher proportion of
duloxetine-treated patients experienced an TEAE compared with placebo-treated patients (64.5% vs. 51.6%;
P = 0.028). The most common TEAEs with an incidence of
at least 5% and twice the rate of placebo in the duloxetine
30 mg/d compared with the placebo treatment group are
summarized in Table 3. A total of 23 patients discontinued
the study because of an AE during the treatment period,
with no significant difference between treatment groups
(Table 3). Nausea, depression, and headache were the only
AEs that led to study discontinuation in >1 patient.
Using the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale, a
clinician-administered questionnaire, three patients in each
treatment group (2.0%) experienced suicidal ideation. No
patient met the criteria for suicidal behavior, suicidal acts,
or nonsuicidal self-injurious behavior at any time after
treatment initiation.
There was a statistically significant difference in the
mean change in the alkaline phosphatase level from baseline to endpoint between the duloxetine 30 mg/d and the
placebo treatment groups (LSMean change 1.18 vs. 1.98;
P = 0.006). No other statistically significant differences in
change in laboratory values were observed between treatment groups. For treatment-emergent abnormal laboratory
values (defined by the central laboratory reference range) at
any time during the acute therapy period, statistically significant differences between treatment groups were observed in the proportion of patients with treatmentemergent high alkaline phosphatase (duloxetine 5.5%,
placebo 0%; P = 0.007) and treatment-emergent low cholesterol (duloxetine 7.5%, placebo 15.3%; P = 0.043). No
other statistically significant differences in the emergence of
laboratory abnormalities were observed between treatment
groups during the acute therapy period. No patient had an
alanine transaminase level Z3 times the upper limit of
normal (ULN) during the study.

There was a statistically significant difference in the
mean change from baseline to endpoint in the sitting
diastolic blood pressure between duloxetine 30 mg/day and
placebo (LSMean change 0.20 vs. 1.79; P = 0.043). There
were no statistically significant differences between treatment groups in the incidence of sustained hypertension
(defined as sitting diastolic blood pressure Z90 mm Hg and
an increase from baseline of 10 mm Hg for 3 consecutive
visits or sitting systolic blood pressure Z140 mm Hg and
an increase from baseline of 10 mm Hg for 3 consecutive
visits) (duloxetine 1.9%, placebo 0.7%; P = 0.623) or in the
systolic blood pressure, pulse, or weight.
DISCUSSION
This study was designed to determine whether duloxetine 30 mg/d, a dose lower than the recommended target
dose of 60 mg/d for management of FM, was efficacious in
reducing pain in adults with FM. In this study, 30 mg/d of
duloxetine was not efficacious in reducing pain severity in
patients with FM after 3 months of treatment. The lack of
efficacy on pain at the 30 mg/d dose of duloxetine is consistent with the results of a positron emission tomography
duloxetine dose-finding study in which 40 mg or more was
necessary to reach 80% occupancy of 5-HT.24 Findings
from multiple studies across several pain indications
support duloxetine 60 mg/d as the target dose.10
However, in the present study, consistent with findings from previous fibromyalgia trials of duloxetine 60 to
120 mg/d,13,14 measures of global symptom improvement
and functioning (PGI-I, FIQ total, and the SF-36 mental
component) improved significantly in the duloxetine 30 mg/d
group.
These results suggest that, despite the lack of demonstration of statistically significant analgesic efficacy with
duloxetine 30 mg/d compared with 60 to 120 mg/d doses,
this lower dose appeared to lessen the overall impact of
psychological and functional symptoms typically experienced by patients with FM. With duloxetine 30 mg/d, patient perception of overall improvement was greater than
with placebo (assessed using PGI-I), mental health was
improved (measured by the SF-36 mental component
score), and there was reduced impact of fibromyalgia as
determined by the total FIQ score, which includes assessment
of pain severity and function and other associated symptoms
of FM. Although chronic pain is the hallmark symptom of
FM, patients often report that other symptoms associated
with FM, such as fatigue, and impairment in function also
negatively impact their lives and require attention in treatment.25 Additional research may be useful in determining
whether this lower dose of duloxetine in combination with
other treatments may be helpful in management of FM.
The most commonly reported TEAEs in this study
were consistent with those reported previously in duloxetine
studies of patients with FM at doses of 60 to 120 mg/d,
although the incidences of some specific TEAEs were generally lower with the 30 mg/d dose of duloxetine.12,26 Although there was a statistically significant increase in the
diastolic blood pressure in the present study, which is
consistent with findings of other duloxetine studies, there
was no significant increase in the pulse or the systolic blood
pressure. As in other duloxetine studies, there was no
statistically significant incidence of sustained hypertension
in duloxetine-treated patients. Generally, the laboratory
findings in this study were consistent with those from other
duloxetine studies. In this study, however, no patient had
an alanine transaminase level Z3 times the ULN during
the study; duloxetine 60 and 120 mg has been associated
with elevated transaminases >3 times the ULN in approximately 1% of patients in other studies.27
This study has limitations. FM is a chronic condition
that usually requires treatment for longer than 3 months.
The results of this 12-week study may not be generalizable
to longer treatment periods. Of this study population,
95% were women; on the basis of published prevalence
figures, women were slightly overrepresented in this FM
population. In addition, patients with a history of certain
psychiatric conditions such as bipolar and schizophrenia,
a current axis I diagnosis other than MDD or GAD, or
an unstable medical condition were excluded from the
study, and so the results may not be generalizable to these
patients.
In summary, this study did not establish the analgesic
30 mg/d of duloxetine in patients with FM. However, patients on this lower dose reported global improvement in
other FM-related symptoms and function and had lower
incidences in some TEAEs when compared with other
duloxetine studies using 60 and 120 mg/d.
