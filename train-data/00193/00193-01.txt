ABSTRACT
Background. In order to improve the treatment of medication-resistant negative symptoms in
schizophrenia, new interventions are needed. Neuropsychological considerations and older reports
in the literature point towards a potential benefit of body-oriented psychological therapy (BPT).
This is the first randomized controlled trial specifically designed to test the effectiveness of
manualized BPT on negative symptoms in chronic schizophrenia.
Method. Out-patients with DSM-IV continuous schizophrenia were randomly allocated to either
BPT (n=24) or supportive counseling (SC, n=21). Both therapies were administered in small
groups in addition to treatment as usual (20 sessions over 10 weeks). Changes in negative symptom
scores on the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS) between baseline, post-treatment and
4-month follow-up were taken as primary outcome criteria in an intention-to-treat analysis.
Results. Patients receiving BPT attended more sessions and had significantly lower negative
symptom scores after treatment (PANSS negative, blunted affect, motor retardation). The differences held true at 4-month follow-up. Other aspects of psychopathology and subjective quality
of life did not change significantly in either group. Treatment satisfaction and ratings of the
therapeutic relationship were similar in both groups.
Conclusions. BPT may be an effective treatment for negative symptoms in patients with chronic
schizophrenia. The findings should merit further trials with larger sample sizes and detailed studies
to explore the therapeutic mechanisms involved.
INTRODUCTION
Despite improvements in antipsychotic treatment schizophrenia patients often experience
persistent symptoms and full remission is infrequent (Sheitman & Lieberman, 1998). Andrews
and co-workers concluded (2003) that current
interventions avert only 13% of the burden of
schizophrenia. Primary negative symptoms and
the deficit syndrome appear to be particularly
treatment-resistant (Arango et al. 2004), and
there is a need to develop new, effective strategies to treat patients with negative symptoms
of schizophrenia.
There are at least two reasons why bodyoriented psychotherapy (BPT), also referred
to in the literature as ‘body psychotherapy’
(Staunton, 2002; Totton, 2003), may be worth
studying in this context: positive reports in
the literature on body-oriented interventions
in schizophrenia, and neuropsychological considerations.
BPT refers back to a long tradition of bodyoriented interventions in psychiatry. At the

beginning of the twentieth century the psychoanalysts Ferenczi and Reich were experimenting
with non-verbal, body-oriented interventions
to overcome perceived limitations of psychoanalytic practice. The earliest trials influenced
by these ideas were undertaken by the
Californian dance therapist Schoop. She started
to work with hospitalized schizophrenia patients
in 1959, and her ‘body-ego technique’ aimed
to focus patients’ attention ‘on body posture
and movement … body-ego boundaries … and
reality contact and experience in movement’
(May et al. 1963; Goertzel et al. 1965). A trial
showed a significant improvement in patients
treated with the technique, compared with
controls, especially in affective contact, motility
and general functioning (Goertzel et al. 1965).
Four further controlled studies – three of
them randomized – compared other bodyoriented interventions with non-specific attention, music therapy or fitness training (Goertzel
et al. 1965; Darby, 1970; Nitsun et al. 1974;
Seruya, 1977). These studies were all conducted
before 1980 and have serious methodological
shortcomings, such as vaguely defined outcome
criteria, no systematic assessment of psychopathology, no recording of medication, and
no intention-to-treat analysis. Nevertheless, the
results suggest favorable effects of the experimental treatments on a variety of outcome
variables, including some indicators of negative
symptoms.
The approach of body-oriented interventions
is based on phenomenological findings (Priebe
& Ro¨hricht, 2001; Ro¨hricht & Priebe, 2002) and
the assumption that movement and emotional
experiences are biologically and experientially
associated. This is supported by close anatomical and functional links between the limbic
system, particularly the extended amygdala,
and the basal ganglia. It is also emphasized by
Trimble’s observation on how ‘movement and
emotion are linked in common speech (hence
‘‘ a moving experience’’)’ (1997: 114).
Two primary negative symptoms in particular
lend themselves to body-oriented interventions:
emotional withdrawal/affective blunting and
motor retardation. Given their non-cognitive
nature, they might be best targeted through
non-verbal methods, combining sensory awareness techniques and emotional movement
stimuli.
It is against this background that the first
author of this paper defined a treatment manual
for BPT with schizophrenia patients suffering
from persistent negative symptoms. We report
here the first randomized controlled trial of
BPT for patients with schizophrenia in recent
history. The trial tested the hypothesis that BPT
is effective in reducing negative symptoms
in out-patients with schizophrenia. To control
for the influence of non-specific attention and
structured group activities BPT was compared
with supportive counseling (SC).
METHOD
Recruitment and procedure
The study was conducted in East London, UK.
Patients were recruited by referrals from community mental health services. The study was
approved by the North East London Strategic
Health Authority Ethics Committee and written
informed consent was obtained from all patients
before trial entry.
We applied the following selection criteria:
age 20–55 years; an established diagnosis
of schizophrenia according to DSM-IV, with
at least two episodes with acute psychotic
symptoms; time since last in-patient treatment
more than 1 month (currently out-patient);
suffering from persistent symptoms of schizophrenia for at least 6 months with a high degree
of negative symptoms at baseline, i.e. Positive
and Negative Symptoms Scale (PANSS) subscore ‘Negative’ o20 and/or one of the
‘Anergia’ items (‘emotional withdrawal’,
‘motor retardation’ or ‘blunted affect’) o6
(6=severe); stable medication prior to entering
the study. Exclusion criteria were: evidence of
organic brain disease; severe or chronic physical
illness; and substance misuse as primary diagnosis. An experienced psychiatrist, blind to the
allocated treatment, carried out all screening,
baseline and outcome assessments; the rater
was trained in the use of assessment instruments. All patients referred to the project were
offered an appointment for a screening interview to establish whether selection criteria were
met. Suitable patients were then further assessed
(details below) within the same interview.
Eligible patients were randomly allocated to
one of the two treatment conditions (BPT or
SC, both in addition to treatment as usual)
670 F. Ro¨hricht and S. Priebe
following the opening of a sealed envelope by
the project co-ordinator, who had no involvement in data collection or assessments. This was
carried out in blocks: once a sufficient number
of patients had been recruited to the study to
fill one treatment group in each condition, the
recruited patients were randomly allocated.
Treatment conditions
All patients in both treatment arms received
psychological group treatments in addition to
the usual care provided by community psychiatric services (TAU). Treatment plans were
not substantially altered during the trial period.
In both conditions, BPT and SC, the group size
was limited to a maximum of eight patients, and
the aim was to provide 20 sessions of 60–90
minutes each over a period of 10 weeks.
The therapists providing treatment in the
study were otherwise not involved in the patients’
care. A part-time dance movement therapist
conducted BPT. Two nurse therapists, also with
previous training and experience in providing psychological therapies for schizophrenia
patients, delivered SC. All therapists had many
years’ experience of working with patients
suffering from schizophrenia and attended
specific training sessions before the trial. Later
they received three supervision sessions each
to ensure adherence to the given treatment
manual (on the basis of written records of each
session).
Body-oriented psychological therapy (BPT)
Different schools of body-oriented psychotherapeutic interventions have developed, but
various authors acknowledge the underlying
coherence and substantial overlap in the applied
intervention strategies (e.g. Guimon, 1997;
Staunton, 2002; Totton, 2003). The treatment
manual used in this study was defined (by the
first author) based on the available evidence and
aimed to integrate different techniques (e.g.
Krietsch & Heuer, 1997; Scharfetter, 1999)
into a clinically focused and syndrome-specific
method (for full description see Ro¨hricht, 2000).
The protocol of the manual was designed to
achieve the following aims:
(1) to overcome communication barriers
through the introduction of non-verbal
techniques;
(2) to refocus cognitive and emotional awareness towards the body (physical reality,
co-ordination and orientation in space);
(3) to stimulate activity and emotional responsiveness;
(4) to promote exploration of self-potentials,
focusing on body strength and capability,
experiencing the body as a source of
creativity, reliability, pleasure and selfexpression;
(5) to modify dysfunctional self-perception;
(6) to address common psychopathological
features such as boundary loss, somatic
depersonalization, and body schema disturbances.
BPT was delivered within a format of defined
sections as follows (intervention examples given
for each section):
(A) Opening circle: checking in: ‘How do you
feel, how does your body feel (i.e. warm, cold,
tense, floppy) ? Describe your level of energy;
where is the centre of your body-awareness ?’
Sitting in a circle on the floor and engaging in
simple warm-up activities and communication
tasks with props such as soft balls, balloons
and beanbags.
(B) Warm up section: standing in a circle,
continuation of warm-up using different body
parts and different qualities of movement, e.g.
swings, stretches, jumps. Grounding, bodycentering and body awareness techniques/
exercises and movements, focusing on basic
physiological functions such as breathing and
pulsation. Travelling movements including different kinds of walks in different directions, at
different speeds and with different qualities, e.g.
brisk, purposeful walk in contrast to lethargic
walk as well as crawling, jumping, turning;
exploring the dimensions of space within and
outside the body.
(C) Structured task section: exploring
immediate vicinity from small to big and in all
three dimensions; demarcating own boundaries
with props, e.g. rope. Identifying a partner,
defining demarcation of own boundaries in
response to feedback. Mirroring exercises
copying each others’ movements; leading and
following from a stationary position and then
travelling with the purpose of exploring the
body-ego as consistent, self-evident and active;
exploring emotionally equivalent movements,
Body-oriented psychological therapy in schizophrenia 671
i.e. stamping, stroking, hiding away, defending.
Creating body image sculptures on paper or in
partners and comparing internal with external
body-schema.
(D) Creative movement section: back in
group circle. Group mirroring with each participant having an opportunity to initiate
movement phrases in the group based either
on pure movement invention stimulated by
rhythmic music, or with a concrete theme like
different sports themes, or related to feelings/
opposites. Creating group sculptures. Reflecting
on how this feels: ‘Can you engage in these
movement exercises ?’, ‘Do you feel stress/
anxiety/discomfort/pleasure/confidence when
leading and/or following ?’
(E) Closing circle: reflecting on group experiences, energy levels, re-focusing on self with
simple body-oriented exercises such as selftouch, verbal integration.
Supportive counseling (SC)
Basic principles of the method are described
elsewhere (Tarrier et al. 1993; Valmaggia et al.
2005). In this study, the therapist focused
on individual difficulties and corresponding
problem-solving strategies regarding the core
negative symptoms. The therapist initially
facilitated a safe and supportive atmosphere
amongst group participants; in the next step
patients were given the opportunity to talk
about specific difficulties in relation to lack of
motivation, difficulties initiating activities, and
lack of emotional responsiveness; the group
then engaged in discussing their experiences,
trying to identify the impact of the symptoms
on their lives and possible contributing factors
to the problems; this was followed by the
therapists’ emphasis on examples of good practice, i.e. well established coping strategies, as
well as creative attempts to identify possible
solutions related to individual difficulties, followed by verbal closure, integrating the different
aspects of the session.
Sample size
In this exploratory trial, the power calculation
was based on the aim to detect a moderate to
large effect size, comparable to effects in published trials on other forms of psychotherapy for
persistent symptoms of schizophrenia (Kuipers
et al. 1997; Durham et al. 2003). A trial with a
total sample of 40–60 patients would provide
55% power of detecting an effect size of 0.
6,
and 81% power for an effect size of 0.
8 with a
two-tailed significance level of 0.
05 (Cohen,
1992; Tarrier et al. 1993).
Primary and secondary outcome assessments
Patients were assessed prior to and at the end
of treatment as well as after a 4-month followup period. The work of the therapists and the
assessing researcher were kept strictly separate
in order to ensure blindness of the assessor,
and patients were requested not to reveal any
details of their treatment during post-treatment
assessments up to the end of the follow-up
interview, when qualitative data was collected.
The primary outcome measure of the study
was the level of negative symptoms as rated on
the corresponding subscale of the PANSS (Kay
et al. 1987). We specifically assessed changes
in ‘ affective blunting’ and ‘decreased spontaneous movement’ (psychomotor retardation),
because these symptoms are regarded as ‘core
negative symptoms’ (Liddle, 2000) of chronic
schizophrenia. Since negative symptoms may
be secondary to extrapyramidal side-effects of
antipsychotic medication, these were recorded
using the Simpson–Angus Extrapyramidal
Symptom Scale (EPS; Simpson & Angus, 1970).
Antipsychotic medication was documented as
chlorpromazine-equivalent (Atkins et al. 1997;
BMA, 2003) at all three points in order to assess
the impact on treatment outcome.
Other psychopathological symptoms (PANSS
positive and PANSS general), and subjective
quality of life (SQOL) were assessed at three
time-points as secondary outcome measures.
The Manchester Short Assessment of Quality
of Life (MANSA; Priebe et al. 1999) was used
to assess SQOL (providing a mean score of
satisfaction ratings in 12 life domains, each
ranging on a Likert scale of 1=‘could not be
worse’ to 7=‘could not be better’).
Patients’ satisfaction with treatment was
measured post-treatment and at follow-up on
the Client’s Assessment of Treatment Scale
(CAT; Priebe et al. 1995), comprising seven
11-point rating scales ranging from 0=extreme
negative answer to 10=extreme positive answer
on different aspects of treatment. At follow-up
the same scale was administered to assess retrospective satisfaction with treatment.
672 F. Ro¨hricht and S. Priebe
We also assessed the quality of the therapeutic relationship after treatment and at
follow-up as a non-specific and potentially
mediating factor. Patients rated the Helping
Alliance Scale (HAS; Priebe & Gruyters, 1993),
which consists of five Likert-type items. The
ratings are summarized, with higher scores
indicating a better quality of the relationship.
Analysis
All data were analyzed using the Statistical
Package for the Social Sciences version 10.
1. for
Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
Analyses were conducted on an intentionto-treat basis. Differences in negative symptom
scores between the experimental intervention
and control groups were tested using analysis
of covariance (ANCOVA), with baseline scores
as covariates. ANCOVA was also conducted
on the mean of satisfaction ratings in the
MANSA post-treatment and follow-up, with
corresponding baseline scores as a covariate.
Another analysis examined the proportion of
patients in each treatment group who showed
an improvement between baseline and posttreatment of 25% or greater in negative
symptom scores.
Changes of medication during participation
in the trial were recorded as both changes in
mean daily equivalents of chlorpromazine and
changes from typical to atypical antipsychotics.
In order to examine the impact of dosage of
antipsychotic medication and extrapyramidal
symptoms on negative symptoms, ANCOVA
analysis of variance was repeated with the
chlorpromazine-equivalents of antipsychotic
medication and the EPS scale total score as
covariates. Furthermore it was intended to
analyze the data based on group allocation
as follows: no change of medication, change
from typical to typical antipsychotic, change
from typical to atypical antipsychotic. Patients’
ratings of treatment and the therapeutic
relationship were analyzed using t tests.
RESULTS
Description of sample
A total of 67 patients were referred for inclusion
in the study, 55 of whom fulfilled the inclusion
criteria. Of these, 45 consented and were
randomized to the treatment conditions. In
total, four groups of patients were treated in
each condition. The detailed flow diagram is
shown in Fig. 1.
Demographic and clinical characteristics of
the study sample (n=45) are shown in Table 1.
None of the variables showed significant
statistical difference between the two groups.
The sample consisted mainly of middle-aged,
single, unemployed individuals, and participants had a long history of mental illness.
The two groups differed significantly with
respect to the average number of therapy
sessions attended: BPT (n=11.
3, S.D.=6.
0); SC
(n=4.
5, S.D.=4.
8); t=4.
0, df=43, p<0.
001.
Dosages of antipsychotic medication as well
as extrapyramidal symptom scale scores did
not differ significantly between the two groups
(Table 2).
Outcome measures
Mean scores of the psychopathology outcome
measures and SQOL measures from baseline
to follow-up are shown in Table 3. The two
groups showed no significant differences in
psychopathological scores at baseline.
Changes of negative symptom severity from
baseline
Controlling for baseline scores, the ANCOVA
of patients’ negative symptom scores showed
a significant effect of the experimental intervention: patients treated with BPT had significantly lower symptom scores after treatment
(PANSS negative: F=5.
0, p=0.
031; blunted
affect: F=10.
8, p=0.
002; motor retardation:

negative: F=7.
0, pf0.
015; blunted affect:
F=5.
6, p=0.
026; motor retardation: F=7.
7,
p=0.
011).
The number of patients with symptom reduction of 20% or more (range 20–46%) from
baseline score was significantly higher in the
BPT group (PANSS negative: n=12/50%
versus n=4/21%). When repeating ANCOVA
with chlorpromazine-equivalents of antipsychotic medication and the EPS scale total score
as additional covariates, the results of the
analyses were not substantially affected by these
covariates. Thus, differences in treatment effects
on negative symptoms were not influenced by
extrapyramidal side-effects or level of antipsychotic medication as measured in this trial.
Body-oriented psychological therapy in schizophrenia 673
Changes of antipsychotic substances from
baseline to post-treatment occurred only in
seven patients (BPT, n=2; SC, n=5), not
allowing for analysis of variance as intended.
A case-by-case analysis showed that in four
patients medication was changed from one
to another atypical antipsychotic, two patients
were changed from typical to atypical antipsychotic, and one patient from atypical to
typical antipsychotic. These changes were not
associated with more or less favorable treatment
outcome.
Other outcome measures
Other psychopathology symptom scores
(PANSS positive, general, and total) as well as
SQOL scores did not differ significantly, either
within or between groups.
Patients’ assessment of treatment was broadly
positive: the mean CAT score did not differ between groups after treatment (BPT: mean=6.
8,
S.D.=2.
0; SC: mean=6.
4, S.D.=1.
9) and at
follow-up (BPT: mean=7.
3, S.D.=1.
9; SC:
mean=6.
7, S.D.=1.
8). Equally, patients’ ratings
of the therapeutic relationship was generally
appreciative and did not differ between groups
after treatment (BPT: mean=7.
2, S.D.=1.
9;
SC: mean=6.
6, S.D.=1.
8) and at follow-up
(BPT: mean=7.

effective in improving persistent and medication-resistant primary negative symptoms
than SC, when given in addition to treatment as
usual.
The findings did not suggest an influence
of potentially confounding factors, i.e. antipsychotic medication, extrapyramidal symptoms, improvement of positive symptoms, on
the different treatment effect in the two groups.
Both groups showed similar treatment satisfaction and ratings of therapeutic relationships.
The effect of BPT, therefore, cannot be explained by non-specific effects as reflected in
treatment satisfaction and the quality of the
therapeutic relationship. Applying the criterion
of 20% reduction on symptom scale scores as
a measure of clinically significant change (as
suggested by Rector et al. 2003), a significantly
higher number of patients in the BPT group
(50%) achieved this degree of response to the
treatment.
Limitations of the study
This was an exploratory trial with a small
sample size. A single therapist administered
BPT, and it remains unclear whether the effect
can be replicated across different therapists
and in other samples and settings. However, the
manualization should help to reduce variation
in the delivery of BPT.
There was a high drop-out rate in the control
group. Some of the clinical improvement may
therefore be attributed to better treatment
adherence in the experimental group and nonspecific effects of more attention and activities.
However, we did not find a difference in indicators of non-specific effects between the two
groups in an intention-to-treat analysis. Also,
the better adherence of patients to BPT shows a
relatively good acceptance of the experimental
treatment, which may be regarded as a positive
effect of BPT itself and facilitate its use in
practice.
Comparison with other trials on negative
symptoms
Compared with results from trials on the
efficacy of atypical antipsychotics on negative
symptoms (reviews Leucht et al. 1999; Mo¨ller,
2000; Chakos et al. 2001), the results of this
study appear encouraging. A review of Chakos
et al. (2001) found effects of clozapine, olanzapine or risperidone on negative symptoms
with an improvement of between 3% and 15%,
i.e. lower than the mean reduction of 20–25% in
this study. Volavka et al. (2002) directly compared clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone and
haloperidol in the treatment of chronic schizophenia. Only in patients treated with clozapine
was a significant improvement in negative
symptoms identified after 8 weeks – comparable
to the findings in this study.
Only a few studies have so far tested
cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) targeting

Body-oriented psychological therapy in schizophrenia 675
negative symptoms in schizophrenia (Tarrier,
2005). Rector & Beck (2001) identified three
studies with medium to large treatment effects
of CBT on negative symptoms as compared
with routine care or supportive therapy. Sensky
et al. (2000) reported a significant improvement
of negative symptoms in both CBT and the
non-specific befriending control condition,
which was sustained after 9 months only in the
CBT group. Rector et al. (2003) remarked that
these changes might have been secondary to
changes in positive and/or depressive symptoms, a concern that does not apply to the
findings of this study. In their own study, Rector
et al. (2003) found that 61% of patients with
persistent symptoms receiving CBT were regarded as treatment ‘ responders’ compared
with 31% in ‘enriched treatment as usual’, and
the effects were not attributable to changes in
positive symptoms and/or depression. However,
the baseline scores for negative symptoms were
significantly lower than in our study. In various
trials (Tarrier et al. 1993; Sensky et al. 2000;
Tarrier et al. 2000) CBT has been associated
with lower drop-out rates than the control
conditions, as has BPT in our study.
There is currently no evidence suggesting that
other non-pharmacological therapies (family
interventions, social skills training, cognitive
remediation, psychoeducation, assertive community treatment) have consistent effects on
negative symptoms in schizophrenia (Bustillo
et al. 2001; Pilling et al. 2002; Turkington et al.
2004).
CONCLUSIONS
In this exploratory trial of BPT we targeted a
highly selective patient group with marked and
dominating negative symptoms of chronic

schizophrenia. BPT was accepted by patients
and associated with a favorable effect. The effect
size was substantial and at least as high as
those reported in the literature for antipsychotic
medication and CBT. The findings may merit
further trials with larger sample sizes and
detailed studies to explore the therapeutic
mechanisms involved. Such studies might lead
to amendments to the approach and manual of
BPT to optimise the therapeutic effect.
If the effects can be replicated, it may be
tested whether BPT can be combined with
other psychological treatments such as CBT to
achieve an increased overall effect or whether
the different strategies should rather be seen as
alternatives, possibly for different subgroups
of patients.
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
The study was supported by the East London
& The City Mental Health Trust and an unconditional grant by Pfizer and Wyeth. We are
grateful to Dr Iris Suzuki for her help with
data collection and Dr Michael Dewey for his
statistical advice.
