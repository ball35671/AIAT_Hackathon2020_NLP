RANDOMISED DOUBLE BLIND STUDY TO COMPARE EFFECTIVENESS
OF HONEY, SALBUTAMOL AND PLACEBO IN TREATMENT OF COUGH IN
CHILDREN WITH COMMON COLD

ABSTRACT
Background: Acute upper respiratory infection is the most common childhood illness
and presents with cough, coryza and fever. Available evidence suggests that cough
medicines may be no more effective than honey-based cough remedies.
Objective: To compare effectiveness of honey, salbutamol and placebo in the treatment
of cough in children with acute onset cough.
Design: Randomised control trial
Setting: Aga Khan University Hospital Paediatric Casualty
Subjects: Children between ages one to twelve years presenting with a common cold
between December 2010 and February 2012 were enrolled.
Outcome measures: Frequency, severity and extent to which cough bothered and
disturbed child and parental sleep were assessed at baseline and over the subsequent
five days through telephone interview using a validated scoring tool.
Results: One hundred and forty five children were enrolled in the study (45- placebo,
57 –honey, 43 –salbutamol). Of the 145 children 51% were male. Honey significantly
reduced the total mean symptom score by day three (p< 0.001). Total mean difference
in scores between day zero to five demonstrated a significant difference of honey’s
efficacy over placebo (p< 0.002) however no difference was noted when compared to
salbutamol (p<0.478). Significant differences in both total as well as each individual
symptom score was detected with honey consistently scoring the best whilst placebo
and salbutamol scored the worst. In paired comparisons honey was superior to placebo
but not salbutamol, whilst salbutamol was not superior to placebo.
Conclusion: Honey was most effective in symptomatic relief of symptoms associated
with the common cold whilst salbutamol or placebo offered no benefit.
INTRODUCTION
Common cold is a viral infection affecting the upper
airways and is defined by the presence of rhinorrhea
and cough for about five days’ duration. Other
symptoms may include acute nasal congestion, fever,
sore throat, myalgia and headache. Common cold
contributes to significant childhood morbidity, sleep
disturbance in child and family members, loss of
school days for the older child, parental anxiety and
low productivity. Cough mixtures are among the most
commonly prescribed medications for coughs and
colds in adults and children (1, 2). Cough mixtures
may have one or more of various medicaments; antitussives, anti-histamines, expectorants, decongestants
or mucolytics. Recent systematic reviews from the
Cochrane database and recommendations from the
American College of Chest Physicians and the World
Health Organisation (WHO) suggest a lack of efficacy
of most cough mixture ingredients whether used
singly or in combination.(3, 4).
Recently there have been blinded trials
suggesting benefit from use of natural demulcents
such as honey, for the treatment of the common cold
(5). It has also been recommended as a soothing agent
for cough in children by the WHO (3). Additionally,
honey has anti-oxidant properties and increases 
February 2014 East African Medical Journal 51
cytokine release, which may explain its anti-microbial
effects and apparent benefit in both common cold and
during skin wound healing (4,7,8). Honey is readily
available, affordable and culturally acceptable to most
parents. However, there has been caution drawn to
possible infantile botulism associated with use of
honey in infants, especially before the age of one year
(10-13). There has not been any such reports from
Africa suggesting that African honey may be safe to
use in children under 12 months of age and unlike
cough mixtures is not associate with any important
adverse effects (5). Paul and colleagues (5) note that
darker honeys, such as the buckwheat variety, consist
of more phenolic compounds than other varieties
and that the associated anti-oxidant effect might
have contributed to the improvement seen in those
children treated with this kind of honey.
Salbutamol is a common ingredient of cough
mixtures and is often prescribed singly or in
combination mixtures for children with the common
cold despite formal evaluation of its efficacy.
Justification for its use is based on its ability to induce
mucociliary clearance of lower airways by increasing
frequency of cilia beat hence faster expectoration (6).
It is also a potent bronchodilator which theoretically
should allow easy expectoration of mucus and
thus a quicker relief of cough symptoms. Some of
the side effects of salbutamol include tachycardia,
palpitations, headache and tremor.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
We conducted a hospital based randomised doubleblinded clinical trial evaluating effectiveness of
honey and salbutamol against that of placebo at
the paediatric casualty of the Aga Khan University
Hospital Nairobi. This is a national tertiary referral
and teaching hospital serving the middle/upperincome society in Nairobi and its environs. The
study was approved by the Aga Khan University
hospital ethics and research committee. Study
patients were recruited from December 2010 through
to February 2012. The study population included
children aged between one and twelve years with
an uncomplicated acute upper respiratory infection.
Exclusion criteria included prior use (48 hours) of any
cough mixture, study agents, oral anti-histamines,
nasal decongestants, steroids or anti-biotics. Other
exclusions were any past history of atopy, asthma or
any chronic lung disease as well as hospitalisation for
lower respiratory tract infection in the past six months.
Cough is a difficult symptom to quantify and
investigators have struggled with identification
of an appropriate outcome measurement for trials
on cough treatment, therefore the Likert scale was
used as its one amongst a few validated tools of
assessing severity of cough in children and has the
benefit of incorporating both child and parental
sleep disturbance as a surrogate for severity of cough
intensity (9).
The Likert scale comprised of five questions, each
having a score from 0 – 6 ranging from “not at all”
to “extremely”. The five questions inquired about
the frequency, severity, how bothersome the cough
was, how it affected the child’s and the parents’ sleep.
Likert scale used is shown in Figure 1 below.
Figure 1
Likert cough assessment severity score
1. How frequent was your child’s coughing
yesterday?
2. How severe was your child’s cough yesterday?
3. How bothersome was last night’s cough to your

child’s ability to sleep?
5. How much did last night’s cough affect your
PARENTS ability to sleep?
6 Extremely _ 5 Very much _ 4 A lot _ 3 Somewhat _
2 A little _ 1 Not Much _O Not at all
Informed written consent from the parent/guardian
was taken at the casualty where for those who
answered at least somewhat (3 points) for a minimum
of two of the three questions related to nocturnal
cough frequency, effect on the child’s sleep, and
effect on parental sleep based on the previous night’s
symptoms at initial assessment. Dispensing of the
study drugs was undertaken following a random
order previously generated by a statistician not
involved in care of study patients. All three study
drugs were prepared, bottled, packaged and labeled
as Study Drug A, B and C by Universal Corporation
Ltd (P.O Box: 1748-00902), based in Kikuyu who
also held the code until after statistical analysis was
completed. The dose prescribed for all the three study
agents was 2.5 ml (age one to two years), 5 ml (age
2-6 years) and 7.5 ml (age six to twelve years) and all
were administered thrice daily for five days. Syrup
salbutamol has 2 mg of active ingredient per 5ml.
The darkest locally available honey was used. Placebo
was a brown colored sugar and alcohol free syrup
with an inert thickening agent whose ingredients
included sodium citrate, citric acid monohydrate,
hypromellose, sodium benzoate, saccharin sodium,
sodium chloride, caramel colour and water. Parents
were then contacted by telephone daily for five days
and the Likert scale questionnaire administered
repeatedly.
Adherence to medications was confirmed at
each telephonic interview as well as any possible
side effects. Patients requiring further evaluations
by doctors and those for whom anti-biotics were
prescribed were excluded from final analysis.

Sample size: To compare that average response for three
groups over six days with repeated measurements
across the three groups made from baseline to day
five, the following formula for sample size per group
is used (17).
n =

d2
Sample size was calculated with the aim to detect a
1-point difference between any two treatment groups
using 0.05 significance with 90% power, giving 37
subjects per group.
Two main outcome variables were considered
in this study; the duration in days from initiation
of treatment till the scores reduced to zero and the
difference in scores between day- 5 and day -0. In
statistical analyses, a generalised linear model was
used to compare the mean treatment group scores
given the repeated measurements on the cough scores.
Tukey’s Honestly Significant Difference was used in
post-hoc test to carry out pair-wise comparisons of
the groups.
RESULTS
The study enrolled 145 children with acute onset
cough but complete data were available for 133
(91.7%). Forty five children received placebo, 57
received honey whilst 43 received salbutamol. Of
those randomised to receive placebo, honey and
salbutamol, those who were lost to follow up or
refused to adhere with medications were six, four
and two study participants respectively for the three
groups. Fifty-one percent of all participants were
male. Table 1 below shows the baseline characteristics
of the components of the Likert scale across the three
groups.

baseline. The total mean score for children on first day of enrollment was 12.88, 13.98 and 14.56 for placebo,
honey and salbutamol respectively (p = 0.29).

Figure 1
Total mean Likert scores (A – placebo, B – honey, C – salbutamol)
By day three honey had significantly reduced the total
mean symptom score (p = 0.001) and this significance
over both salbutamol and placebo was again noted
on days four and five.
The total mean difference in scores between day
5 and day 0 were 8.69, 12.68 and 11.37 for placebo,
honey and salbutamol respectively. Honey again
demonstrated superior effectiveness in reducing
overall symptom score (p = 0.003).
A general linear model with cough scores
measured over the six day period indicated a
statistically significant difference between honey,
salbutamol and placebo (p = 0.000). Paired analysis
of the total mean difference in scores between day
5 and day 0 demonstrated efficacy of honey over
placebo (p = 0.002) but when compared to salbutamol,
there was no statistically significant difference noted
(p = 0.478). Effect of salbutamol was not different
from that of placebo (p = 0.075).
Figure 2
Time interval to clearance of the cough (A – placebo, B – honey, C – salbutamol)
The mean time interval to clearance of cough in days was 5.18, 4.46, 5.0 for placebo, honey and salbutamol
respectively using ANOVA (p = 0.019), indicating that those on honey were first to get complete relief of
their symptoms. This was reconfirmed in paired analysis of mean time interval to clearance of cough score
showing honey superiority over placebo (p = 0.023). However difference in response between honey and
salbutamol was not statistically different (p = 0.11). Effect of salbutamol was comparable to that of placebo
(p = 0.81).

Children administered honey had more reports
of gastrointestinal complaints but none were
significantly more than that of either placebo or
salbutamol group.
The rest of the side effect profile was minimal
with none of the study drugs showing significant
differences over that of placebo.
DISCUSSION
In this study, honey performed better in clearance of
cough symptoms over either placebo or salbutamol
using the Likert score as a tool of validation. Studies
by both Paul in 2007 and Cohen in 2012 comparing
just honey to placebo over single day duration showed
similar results (5, 16).
This study we believe is the first fully blinded
randomised placebo controlled trial evaluating
effectiveness of honey over a five day duration of
the common cold during which honey continued to
show significant difference over placebo.
The putative mechanism of action of honey as a
soother of cough ranges from its possible antioxidant
activity, demulcent and or natural antiseptic/
antibiotic properties (4,7,8). Substitution of cough
mixtures with honey will translate into major cost
savings, a 300 ml bottle of honey costs US$ 4- 6
locally and would be enough to treat four children
thus reducing the real cost per child to approximately
one US dollar whereas a standard cough mixture or
syrup salbutamol will retail at five dollars per bottle
hence five times the cost. Its benefit over salbutamol
continues to emphasise the need to curtail the
widespread abuse of cough mixture prescriptions
worldwide. It positively lends weight to the WHO
directive on the role of demulcents for the common
cold (3).
Although not significant there were more
gastrointestinal side effects with honey over either
placebo or salbutamol.
This study showed no benefit of salbutamol over
either placebo or honey. It was hypothesised that
it may have helped with nocturnal cough and
thus effect of sleep but this was not significant
when analysed. Salbutamol and other short acting
bronchodilators are used as a common ingredient for
many cough mixtures both in Kenya and worldwide
which led us to justify its inclusion as one of our
study agents. Placebo controlled randomised trials
comparing the effectiveness of antihistamines and
dextromethorphan have been conducted by Paul et
al (5) confirming that these individual agents have no
effect on cough symptoms of the common cold but
we have as yet to find similar trials using salbutamol
in the same manner. There was no noted increase
of hand tremor and tachycardia in the study group
using salbutamol as against placebo in this study.
One drawback encountered during this study
was the large number of patients who could not be
initially recruited as they had taken one of the study
drugs, cough mixture or antihistamines prior to
presentation to seek further treatment.
In conclusion, honey has consistently showed benefit
for the cough symptom during the common cold
and this study offers reason to continue to advocate
for its use as a cheaper, safer and easily available
cough mixture. Salbutamol for the common cold
symptoms has not been shown to be useful and hence
its prescription should be avoided.
