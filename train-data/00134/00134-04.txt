Discussion
In this study, non-recombinant urate oxidase was more effective than allopurinol in the prevention and treatment of hyperuricemia, as in the small series reported by Masera et al.

Uric acid levels decreased to 4.1 mg/dl or lower (median,
0.6 mg/dl) in all of our patients with ALL or NHL during treatment with urate oxidase, despite the concomitant administration of cytoreductive chemotherapy. The results we report
probably underestimate the clinical potential of the urate oxidase, since patients with non-B cell ALL were studied during
treatment that is much less intensive than standard remission
induction regimens for this disease.24 Importantly, the more
rapid uricolytic effects of urate oxidase compared to allopuriFigure 1 Comparison of plasma uric acid levels at diagnosis and nol (Figure 1) would be expected to shorten or eliminate

lysis.5,25 In theory, the use of urate oxidase should facilitate
the excretion of phosphorous, as it would obviate the need to
alkalinize the urine, and phosphorus is more soluble in acidic
urine. This prediction could not be tested in the present study
because of the small number of patients at high risk of massive
tumor cell lysis (eg those with B cell ALL or advanced-stage
B cell NHL). Nonetheless, we would emphasize that none of
our B cell ALL or stage III or IV Burkitt NHL cases treated with
urate oxidase had renal failure requiring dialysis. By contrast,
acute renal failure prompted hemodialysis in 10 of 40 patients
with B cell ALL or advanced-stage NHL treated previously at
this center26 and 28 of 133 treated recently in the Pediatric
Oncology Group (six of whom died of complications).27 We
attributed this difference to our recent use of urate oxidase
and the adoption of ‘reduction phase’ therapy as pioneered
by French investigators, which is associated with a lesser
degree of tumor cell lysis than conventional therapy.23
The frequency of allergic reactions complicating the use of
non-recombinant urate oxidase has been uncertain. Masera et
al17 did not observe any adverse effects in their study of 30
patients, in contrast to the 4.5% incidence of allergic reactions, primarily bronchospasm and hypoxemia, noted here. Figure 2 Plasma uric acid levels in patients with B cell ALL or
NHL, determined before and after treatment with chemotherapy and Whether this observation reflects inherent differences in the
