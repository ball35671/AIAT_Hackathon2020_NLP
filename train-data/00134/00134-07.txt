Abstract To evaluate the clinical benefit of the prophylactic use of urate oxidase in children with non-Hodgkin’s
lymphoma (NHL), we analyzed the incidence and complications of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) in children with
B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) or stage
III/IV Burkitt’s lymphoma and a lactate dehydrogenase
(LDH) level ‡500 U/l before and after the introduction of
a protocol amendment to use urate oxidase for the
prophylaxes of TLS. Data from 1791 children with NHL
enrolled in the two subsequent multicenter studies NHLBFM 90 and 95 were evaluated. The presence of the side
effects TLS, anuria, sepsis, and other complications
during the first 2 weeks after admission were registered.
Until March 1996, no urate oxidase was used (period 1).
From November 1997 all children with B-ALL or stage
III and IV B-NHL and LDH ‡500 U/l should receive urate
oxidase prophylactically (period 3). In between (period
2), urate oxidase was given in a minority of hospitals
therapeutically. Initial chemotherapy was identical. Altogether, 78 children (4.4%) developed a TLS. Patients with
B-ALL had the highest risk to develop a TLS (26.4%)
followed by B-ALL/Burkitt’s lymphoma and a LDH
‡500 U/l (14.9%). In period 1, 16.1% and 9.2% of the
latter children developed a TLS or anuria, respectively,
compared to 12.3% and 6.2% in period 3 (p=NS). The
incidence of sepsis remained unchanged (5.0% vs 4.6%).
In children with B-ALL the differences in the incidence
of TLS and anuria between period 3 and period 1 were
more pronounced, reaching significance for anuria
(15.4% vs 3.8%, p=0.03). Our results suggest that patients
with the highest risk to develop a TLS might benefit from
the prophylactic use of urate oxidase.

Introduction
Children with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) have a
80–90% chance of event-free survival with the use of
current highly intensive chemotherapy protocols [2, 10,
17, 18]. Therapy-related morbidity and mortality have a
substantial impact on the outcome of the patients [1, 2, 10,
17].
High tumor cell turnover results in an increased purine
metabolism leading to hyperuricemia. Cytolytic chemotherapy causes tumor cell breakdown with the result of a
rapid increase in plasma uric acid, potassium, and
phosphorus. These symptoms together with hypocalcemia
are the major components of the tumor lysis syndrome
(TLS). Due to formation of urate crystals at low pH in the
renal tubules and collecting ducts urate nephropathy can
develop with the complication of renal insufficiency and
therapy-related death.
Standard prophylaxis of TLS and urate nephropathy
consists of allopurinol, alkalinization, hydration, and a socalled cytoreductive prephase. The use of allopurinol, a
xanthine oxidase inhibitor, prevents the formation of urate
from xanthine. However, it does not decrease preexisting
urate and it may take several days for uric acid levels to
normalize. In addition, allopurinol leads to an increase in
xanthine and hypoxanthine, which itself can cause
nephropathy, and alkalinization of the urine may facilitate
precipitation of calcium phosphates in the kidneys. Urate
oxidase, an enzyme of nonhuman origin, catalyzes the
enzymatic oxidation of uric acid to allantoin, which is 5–
10 times more soluble than uric acid and therefore readily
excreted by the kidneys. Urate oxidase extracted from
aspergillus, Uricozyme, is marketed as standard uricolytic
therapy in France and Italy. It has been shown to reduce

plasma uric acid levels rapidly and effectively [4, 11, 12,
13, 14].
In NHL, TLS is almost exclusively a problem of
patients with Burkitt’s lymphoma and B-cell acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) with increased tumor
load [lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) >500 U/l] [19]. Up to
25% of children with advanced stage Burkitt’s lymphoma
and B-ALL still experience acute renal failure at the onset
of cytoreductive chemotherapy [2, 22]. Therefore, in the
cooperative multicenter study NHL-BFM 95 of the
Berlin-Frankfurt-Mnster group a protocol amendment
was introduced to administer urate oxidase (Uricozyme)
prophylactically for patients with B-ALL or Burkitt’s
lymphoma and a LDH ‡500 U/l as of November 15, 1997.
Despite the proven efficacy of urate oxidase to reduce
plasma uric acid levels and the theoretical advantages of
the enzyme compared to allopurinol, there are only
limited data hinting at a clinical benefit for the use of
urate oxidase as prophylaxis for TLS [8, 11]. Here, we
report the incidence and complications of TLS in children
with NHL who were treated according to the protocols
NHL-BFM 90 and 95 before and after the introduction of
the protocol amendment to use urate oxidase for the
prophylaxis of TLS in patients with B-ALL and Burkitt’s
lymphoma with increased tumor burden (LDH ‡500 U/l).
Patients and methods
Patients
Children and adolescents up to 18 years of age with NHL were
eligible for the trials NHL-BFM 90 and 95. From April 1990 to
December 2001, 1952 patients were registered from 83 centers in
Austria, Germany, and Switzerland. Classification of NHL followed the criteria of the updated Kiel classification and the revised
European-American classification of lymphoid neoplasms [6, 21].
Staging of the patients included clinical examination, bone marrow
aspirates, liquor cytology, ultrasound, bone scan, and computed
tomography magnetic resonance imaging studies of CNS and
involved sites. Staging followed the criteria of the St. Jude staging
system for pediatric lymphoma [9].
Clinical data
Clinical data concerning diagnosis, stage, LDH, initial surgery,
general condition at diagnosis as well as complications at
presentation or during the first 2 weeks were recorded by
participating medical centers on standardized forms for all study
patients. Specifically, the study participants were asked for the
following complications: presence of TLS, oligoanuria, life-threatening bleeding, respiratory complications, ileus, complications after
initial surgery, or hemiparesis. Oligoanuria was not quantified.
Special laboratory values for TLS were not collected. Complete
data sets on TLS, anuria, and sepsis were available for 1791
patients and were further analyzed.
Chemotherapy regimen
Patients were stratified into three different treatment groups
according to NHL entity and clinical stage [17, 18, 20]. Patients
with B-cell lymphoma and B-ALL were stratified into three
different therapy branches in the trial NHL-BFM 90 and four
branches (R1–R4), thereafter in NHL-BFM 95 according to clinical
stage and initial tumor mass estimated by the serum concentration
of LDH [16, 17]. Chemotherapy began with a “prephase,” which
consisted of increasing amounts of dexamethasone, two doses of
cyclophosphamide, and intrathecal therapy for 5 days for all
patients (except patients with completely resected stage I disease in
study NHL-BFM 95) in order to limit the massive cytoreduction by
intensive chemotherapy in the presence of a high tumor burden
(Fig. 1). In the study NHL-BFM 90, cyclophosphamide (200 mg/
m2
) was initially administered daily during the prephase. Due to
severe toxicity of this regimen cyclophosphamide was reduced
from five to two doses as of July 1, 1993. Two to six courses of
high-dose intensive polychemotherapy were administered over a
period of 5–6 days each. The therapy strategy has been described
previously [15, 17]. Patients with anaplastic large cell lymphoma
(ALCL) were treated with a similar strategy [20] while patients
with lymphoblastic lymphoma received an ALL-type therapy [18].
Prophylaxis for tumor lysis syndrome
Supportive treatment during initial chemotherapy consisted of i.v.
hydration with 3–4.5 l/m2 per day and administration of furosemide
if required to achieve a urine flow over 50 ml/m2 per hour for all
patients in both studies NHL-BFM 90 and 95. Until March 1996
(period 1), allopurinol (10 mg/kg per day p.o.) was administered
and alkalinization of the urine (pH 7) performed. Urate oxidase was
not available during this period. Between April 1996 and November 1997 (period 2), the protocol recommended the use of urate
oxidase (Uricozyme) therapeutically in the case of hyperuricemia
(>7 mg/dl) together with reduced renal function or high tumor
burden in a dose of 500–4000 U/m2
/ per day. In November 1997, a
protocol amendment was distributed to all centers to treat all
children with B-ALL or stage III and IV B-NHL and LDH ‡500 U/l
(branches R3 and R4) prophylactically with urate oxidase (Uricozyme) in a dose of 350 U/kg per day i.v. before the initiation of
the prephase and for a further 3–4 days, at least for 48 h after
normalization of plasma creatinine, uric acid, and phosphate
(period 3). The prophylaxis in periods 1–3 is shown in Table 1.
Statistical analysis
Analysis of event-free survival (EFS) was performed using the
Kaplan and Meier method with differences compared by the logrank test. EFS was calculated from the date of diagnosis to the first
event (death from any cause, tumor progress, or second malignancy) or to the date of last follow-up. Patients lost to follow-up (LFU)
were censored at the time of their withdrawal. Differences in the
distribution of different parameters were examined using the c2 or
Fisher’s exact test. Association of TLS and possible risk factors was
explored with logistic regression models. Statistical analyses were
performed using the SAS program (SAS-PC, version 6.12, SAS
Institute Inc., Cary, N.C., USA). Follow-up data were actualized as
of May 1, 2002.

Results
Incidence and risk factors for the development of a TLS
Of 1791 evaluable patients from the studies NHL-BFM
90 and 95, 78 were reported to have developed a TLS and
42 oligoanuria. Table 2 shows the incidence of TLS and
anuria according to the biological entities. Patients with
Burkitt’s lymphoma or B-ALL had the highest incidence
of TLS (4.4%). In patients with T-lymphoblastic lymphoma, other B-cell NHL, or ALCL, the incidence of TLS
was below 2% and anuria occurred in less than 1% of
patients (Table 2). Of the 790 patients with Burkitt’s
lymphoma/B-ALL, tumor burden as indicated by the
plasma level of LDH was the main predictor for the
development of both TLS and anuria (Table 3). However,
patients with a B-ALL had the highest risk to develop a
TLS (26.4%) or anuria (14.1%). In the group of patients
with B-ALL, the incidence of TLS again increased with
increasing level of LDH and the number of peripheral
blasts. However, the peripheral blast count was not a risk
factor in addition to the level of LDH for the development
of TLS or anuria in a logistic regression analysis. Since
the protocol amendment stated that only patients with the
highest risk for the development of TLS (i.e., B-ALL and
Burkitt’s lymphoma stage III/IV with LDH ‡500 U/l)
should receive urate oxidase prophylactically, all further
analyses are restricted to these patients.
Characteristics of patients with Burkitt’s
lymphoma/B-ALL
The patients with B-ALL/Burkitt’s lymphoma stage III
and IV, and LDH ‡500 U/l were at highest risk for the
development of TLS or anuria. Characteristics of these
patients in the time periods in which urate oxidase was
not used (period 1), should be used prophylactically
(period 3), and in the time in between (period 2) are
shown in Table 4. There was no significant difference in
the incidence of patients with B-ALL, LDH >1000 U/l,
number of peripheral blasts in patients with B-ALL and
CNS disease, suggesting that the patient groups were

comparable. However, more patients were reported to
have been critically ill at diagnosis and complications
from primary surgery were more frequent in period 1.
Influence of the protocol amendment
for the prophylactic use of Uricozyme on the incidence
of TLS, anuria, and early treatment-related deaths
Altogether, 414 patients with B-ALL or Burkitt’s lymphoma stage III/IV and LDH ‡500 U/l were available for
the analysis of the influence of prophylactic use of urate
oxidase on the incidence of TLS and anuria. In this highrisk group, 14.9% of the patients developed a TLS. In
period 1, the reported frequency was 16.1% compared to
12.3% in period 3 when urate oxidase should be used
prophylactically (p=0.33, Table 5). The symptom anuria
was reported in 9.2% of patients in period 1 and in 6.2%
of patients in period 3 (p=0.31, Table 5). The incidence of
sepsis during or after the first course of chemotherapy did
not change during the whole study period (Table 5).
Treatment-related deaths after the initial course of
chemotherapy occurred in 4 of 218 children treated in
period 1 compared to none of 130 in period 3 (Table 5).
The probability of event-free survival was not statistically
different between the three study periods (Fig. 2).
We restricted our analysis further to patients with a BALL who had the highest risk for the development of TLS
(26.4%) or renal failure (14.1%). The number of peripheral blast cells or the level of LDH did not differ in
patients with B-ALL between the three study periods. In
period 1, 20.5% and 15.4% of the 78 patients with B-ALL
developed a TLS and anuria, respectively, compared to
9.4% and 3.8% of the 53 patients after introduction of the
protocol amendment to use urate oxidase as prophylaxis
(period 3) (p=0.08 and 0.03, respectively, Table 6).
Again, the incidence of sepsis remained unchanged.
Discussion
Our data on 1791 children and adolescents with NHL
confirm previous findings that TLS is almost completely
restricted to patients with Burkitt’s lymphoma and B-ALL
with high tumor burden [3, 5, 19].
Urate oxidase has been used for the treatment of
hyperuricemia associated with hematologic malignancies
in France and Italy for over 2 decades but was not
available in other countries. During the last few years
even a recombinant form of the enzyme with fewer
allergic side effects became available. Pui and colleges
and Goldman and co-workers compared the use of urate
oxidase with standard allopurinol and alkalinization in
children with leukemia and Burkitt’s lymphoma. Both
groups found a more rapid and significantly greater
decrease in blood uric acid levels in children treated with
urate oxidase as had been shown earlier in a smaller
patient group [4, 8, 12]. Both forms of urate oxidase
produced a very rapid and sharp decrease in uric acid
levels in uncontrolled studies as well [13, 14]. All of these
studies confirm the ability of urate oxidase to decrease the
plasma levels faster to lower levels and more reliably than
has been shown for allopurinol in the treatment of
hyperuricemia in patients with hematologic malignancies.

However, despite these results and theoretical advantages, data supporting clinical benefits for patients with
hematologic malignancies treated with urate oxidase as
compared to standard prophylaxes are almost lacking.
Using the nonrecombinant form of urate oxidase, Uricozyme, the French pediatric NHL group reported a very
low incidence of dialyses (1.7%) during induction chemotherapy for Burkitt’s lymphoma or B-ALL [11]. This
compares favorably to data from the United States (21%)
and the United Kingdom (14.3%), where no urate oxidase
but the same chemotherapy regimen was used [1, 2]. But
the real impact of the use of urate oxidase on these
clinical differences cannot be assessed between different
trials. A steady improvement of renal function was seen
during rasburicase prophylaxis for patients with leukemia
or lymphoma in the study reported by Pui et al. Renal
function was within normal range in all patients by day 6
of treatment and none of the patients required dialyses
after the start of rasburicase therapy. However, there was
no control group in this trial [14]. In the only randomized
study of rasburicase versus allopurinol reported by
Goldman and co-workers, one patient who received
allopurinol required hemodialysis. In contrast, a patient
in the rasburicase group who presented with hyperuricemia and renal insufficiency improved without the need for
dialysis. Altogether, the sample size was too small to
determine a difference in the incidence of renal failure or
need for renal support between the two groups [4]. In an
early study, Masera and colleagues treated a small
number of children with ALL prophylactically with
Uricozyme and found that the incidence of an increase
in plasma urea and creatinine was significantly lower in
this group compared with a historical control group [8].
Further, there are several case reports suggesting that
urate oxidase could be helpful to avoid dialysis in patients
with hematologic malignancies who developed TLS with
renal failure [7, 23]. The results of our study give for the
first time a more direct hint that the use of urate oxidase
as prophylaxis in children and adolescents with NHL at
the highest risk for the development of TLS leads to a
reduction of anuria. No treatment-related death after the
initial course of chemotherapy was reported after the
introduction of urate oxidase prophylaxis. The analyses
can be compared to intent-to-treat analyses since we have
no data on the actual number of patients who received
urate oxidase. However, it can be safely assumed that not
all patients scheduled to get urate oxidase were actually
treated with it because it was not possible for all centers to
organize the drug in time. So our analysis underestimates
the real clinical impact of the prophylactic use of urate
oxidase in our patients. The induction chemotherapy was
almost identical between the studies NHL-BFM 90 and 95
and the patient groups were comparable. However, we
cannot explain the differences in the categories “critically
ill” and “complications after surgery.” It might be
speculated that the prophylaxis with urate oxidase led to
a clinical stabilization of the patients so that fewer
patients were reported to be critically ill. Another
possibility would be that the high surgical complication
rate reported before April 1996 resulted in more patients
being critically ill. A third explanation could be that urate
oxidase given before surgery led to the outcome that
fewer patients suffered surgical complications and were
critically ill. The questions regarding these differences
cannot be answered by our data.
Finally, the data of the patients treated between April
1996 and November 1997 need to be left without
interpretation regarding the effects of the use of urate
oxidase. They can neither be used to make a point for the
therapeutic use of urate oxidase nor against. There are no
data available detailing which patients were treated with
urate oxidase at all. Only a few centers had urate oxidase
and the definitions to use it therapeutically were not clear
enough to analyze this patient group.
In conclusion, children with Burkitt’s lymphoma and
B-ALL with a high LDH are at greatest risk to develop a
TLS and anuria. The introduction of the protocol
amendment to use urate oxidase as prophylaxis for TLS
in patients with B-cell NHL and B-ALL with a LDH
‡500 U/l resulted in a nonsignificant decrease in the
incidence of TLS and anuria. Only for patients with a BALL who had the highest risk to develop renal failure
from TLS was a significant reduction in anuria reported
after introduction of urate oxidase. No treatment-related
deaths after the first course of chemotherapy occurred
after the introduction of urate oxidase prophylaxis. Our
results suggest that patients with a high risk to develop a
TLS might benefit from the prophylactic use of urate
oxidase.
