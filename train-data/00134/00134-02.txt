Abstract Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), including
hyperuricemia, is a frequent serious complication in
patients with hematologic malignancies. This study in
Japanese patients evaluated the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetic profile of rasburicase in pediatric patients with
hematologic malignancies. Patients aged\18 years at high
risk for TLS, with newly diagnosed hematologic malignancies, were randomized to intravenous rasburicase
0.15 mg/kg/day (n = 15) or 0.20 mg/kg/day (n = 15) for
5 days. Chemotherapy was started 4–24 h after the first
rasburicase dose. Response was defined as a reduction in
plasma uric acid to B6.5 mg/dL (patients\13 years) or
B7.5 mg/dL (patients C13 years) by 48 h after the first
administration, lasting until 24 h after the final administration. Response rates were 93.3 and 100% with rasburicase 0.15 and 0.20 mg/kg/day, respectively. Uric acid
levels declined rapidly within 4 h of starting rasburicase
administration in both groups. Most adverse events were
related to the underlying chemotherapy regimens. Two
hypersensitivity reactions, including grade 1/2 pruritus,
were considered to be related to rasburicase. Rasburicase is
effective and well tolerated for the management of
hyperuricemia in Japanese pediatric patients at high risk of
developing TLS.

1 Introduction
Patients with hematologic malignancies are usually treated
with aggressive chemotherapy regimens that result in the
rapid destruction of tumor cells and the release of purine
metabolites into the circulation [1]. This may lead to the
development of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), which is
characterized by severe hyperuricemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperkalemia, and hypocalcemia [2, 3]. Moreover, as
a consequence of hyperuricemia, crystals of uric acid may
form in the renal tubules and distal collecting system,
leading to renal insufficiency and acute renal failure [4].
Patients with malignancies that have a high proliferation
rate or a large tumor burden, such as acute lymphoblastic
leukemia or Burkitt’s lymphoma, have a particularly high
risk of developing TLS. The metabolic disturbances
resulting from TLS may lead to acute renal failure and
rapidly become life threatening in pediatric patients.
Appropriate management for metabolic abnormalities in
these patients is therefore essential in order to reduce the
risk of developing acute renal failure [5–7].
The current treatment of hyperuricemia in Japan
includes urinary alkalinization, hydration, and allopurinol.
Allopurinol inhibits xanthine oxidase and thus prevents the
formation of uric acid and controls plasma uric acid levels
during purine catabolism [4]. Allopurinol, however, cannot
reduce the level of pre-existing uric acid and causes
increases in serum levels of xanthine and hypoxanthine,
which may lead to xanthine nephropathy [8, 9]. In addition,
urinary alkalinization can cause renal precipitation of calcium phosphate [4].
Rasburicase is a recombinant form of the endogenous
enzyme urate oxidase. It is produced following the proteolytic hydrolysis of Aspergillus flavus urate oxidase, which
permits the formation of oligodeoxynucleotide probes that
are used to obtain DNA fragments from Aspergillus flavus
cDNA and genomic libraries [10]. Rasburicase is approved
for the prevention and treatment of hyperuricemia in
children with leukemia or lymphoma in the USA and the
EU. This agent oxidizes uric acid, converting it to allantoin, a substance that is approximately 5–10 times more
soluble than uric acid and is easily excreted in the urine [8].
Rasburicase is administered intravenously, making it more
convenient to administer to patients with chemotherapyassociated gastrointestinal toxicities than the oral drug
allopurinol. Moreover, rasburicase can reduce pre-existing
uric acid levels [11].
In a US open-label, randomized study in 52 children
with leukemia or lymphoma at high risk for TLS,
administration of rasburicase (0.20 mg/kg/day) for
5–7 days during induction chemotherapy achieved significantly more rapid control of uric acid and lower levels of
plasma uric acid than allopurinol (300 mg/m2
/day) for
5–7 days [12]. This led the investigators to conclude
that rasburicase is a safe and an effective alternative to
allopurinol during initial chemotherapy in pediatric
patients.
The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy,
safety, and pharmacokinetic profile of rasburicase as a
single agent in Japanese pediatric patients with hematologic malignancies at high risk for TLS. In particular, the
safety of rasburicase administered before chemotherapy
was evaluated in this patient population.
2 Materials and methods
2.1 Study design and patients
This was a multicenter, open-label, randomized, parallelgroup study of repeated doses of rasburicase in Japanese
pediatric patients with newly diagnosed hematologic
malignancies at high risk of developing TLS.
The study protocol was approved by the institutional
review boards of all participating centers. Written informed
consent was obtained from the legally authorized representative of each patient before randomization to one of
two doses of rasburicase (0.15 or 0.20 mg/kg).
Japanese pediatric patients (aged\18 years) were eligible for study entry if they had newly diagnosed hematologic
malignancies with hyperuricemia (uric acid [7.5 mg/dL for
patients aged C13 years; uric acid [6.5 mg/dL for patients
aged \13 years) or newly diagnosed hematologic malignancies presenting with a high tumor burden, regardless of
uric acid level [defined as non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL)
stage IV; NHL stage III with at least one lymph node or mass
[5 cm in diameter or lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) three or
more times the upper limit of normal (ULN)]; or acute leukemia with a white blood cell (WBC) count C50,000/mm3
and LDH three or more times ULN. Patients were required to
have a performance status of 3 or less on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scale (or 30 or more on the
Lansky score) and a minimum life expectancy of 45 days.
Patients received induction chemotherapy between 4 and
24 h after the first administration of rasburicase.
Exclusion criteria included the administration of allopurinol within 72 h before the start of rasburicase administration; known history of severe allergy and/or severe
asthma; low birth weight (\2,500 g) or gestational age
(\37 weeks); previous therapy with urate oxidase; known
positive tests for hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C
virus antibodies, or HIV-1 or HIV-2 antibodies; severe

disorders of the liver or kidney [alanine aminotransferase
(ALT) levels more than five times ULN, total bilirubin
more than three times ULN, creatinine more than three
times ULN]; or uncontrollable infection (including viral
infection). The enzymatic conversion of uric acid to
allantoin by rasburicase produces hydrogen peroxide [13].
This can lead to methemoglobinemia and hemolysis in
certain ‘‘at-risk’’ populations such as those with glucose-6-
phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, and hence
G6PD deficiency contraindicates the use of rasburicase.
Therefore, patients with a known family history of G6PD
deficiency, and known history of methemoglobinemia and
hemolysis, were also excluded.
Randomization was performed centrally, and patients
were stratified by baseline weight (\10 or C10 kg) until 15
patients had been enrolled in each dose group. To ensure
the exact evaluation of pharmacokinetics, at least 10
patients weighing C10 kg were included in each dose
group. The protocol did not require that a minimum
number of patients weighing \10 kg should be enrolled.
2.2 Treatment
Rasburicase (SR29142) was supplied by sanofi-aventis
(Tokyo, Japan). Patients were randomized to one of two
dose groups of rasburicase (0.15 or 0.20 mg/kg). Rasburicase 0.20 mg/kg has been approved in 50 countries
worldwide, but in the USA, the doses of rasburicase 0.15
and 0.20 mg/kg have been approved. Given that the efficacy of rasburicase 0.15 and 0.20 mg/kg was recently
demonstrated in a previous study in adult Japanese patients
[14], both these doses were selected for use in this pediatric
trial. Rasburicase was administered intravenously for
30 min once daily for 5 consecutive days.
Chemotherapy, including cytoreductive corticosteroids,
was started 4–24 h after the first dose of rasburicase.
Separate lines were used for administration of chemotherapy and infusion of rasburicase to prevent drug–drug
interactions. When this was not possible, the line was
flushed with isotonic saline (C15 mL) before and after
infusion of rasburicase. Other anti-hyperuricemic agents
(e.g. allopurinol) or treatment with sodium bicarbonate
for urine alkalization were not permitted until the final
blood sampling for plasma uric acid was completed on
day 6.
2.3 Efficacy assessments
The primary efficacy endpoint was response rate (RR), as
determined by assays of plasma uric acid concentration.
Treatment was considered to be successful and the patient
considered to be a responder if the plasma uric acid level
decreased to B7.5 mg/dL in patients aged C13 years or
B6.5 mg/dL in patients aged \13 years by 48 h after the
start of the first rasburicase administration, and lasting until
24 h after the start of the final rasburicase administration
(day 5).
Secondary endpoints included plasma uric acid concentration and change in concentration from baseline. The
rate of plasma uric acid inhibition over time versus baseline
was also evaluated at 4 and 48 h after the first rasburicase
administration and at 24 h after the last rasburicase
administration. The rate of uric acid inhibition (%) was
calculated as the concentration of plasma uric acid at
baseline minus the concentration of plasma uric acid at
each timepoint divided by the concentration at baseline
multiplied by 100. Blood samples were collected for the
plasma uric acid levels B10 min before and 4 h (±10 min)
after the first rasburicase administration on day 1; samples
were also collected before rasburicase administration
(±10 min) on days 2–5, and 24 h (±10 min) after the last
rasburicase administration on day 6.
2.4 Safety assessments
Safety was assessed by clinical observations (including
vital signs), standard laboratory tests, and the occurrence of
adverse events (AEs). AEs were summarized by type of
event and toxicity grade according to the National Cancer
Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
Events version 3.0 (translated into Japanese by the Japan
Clinical Oncology Group/Japan Society of Clinical
Oncology). These events were classified by each investigator as either rasburicase-related or other (related to
underlying hematologic malignancies or chemotherapy).
Rasburicase-related AEs were defined as all events
excluding events due to the underlying disease or chemotherapy. Renal function (creatinine, potassium, phosphorus,
and calcium levels) was also assessed at baseline (7 days
before starting the first administration of rasburicase), and
on day 3, 5, 8, 15, 22, 29, and 36.
2.5 Evaluation of anti-rasburicase antibodies
To evaluate the relationship between hypersensitivity
reactions and the appearance of anti-rasburicase antibodies,
the antibodies were assessed by qualitative enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) at baseline and on day 29.
The results were expressed qualitatively due to the lack of
immunopurified reference human antibody directed against
rasburicase, with the conventional properties of antibodies
utilized to detect antibodies directed against rasuburicase.
The range of anti-human immunoglobulin calibration was
between 0 and 1,000 ng/mL and plasma samples from
healthy volunteers were used as reference controls. Plasma
collected from healthy volunteers was assayed by ELISA
494 A. Kikuchi et al.
123
to determine background interference in the detection of
anti-rasburicase immunoglobulin. If the samples were
positive for anti-rasburicase antibodies on day 29, then
further blood samples were collected from the patient at
6 months (±2 weeks) and every 6 months (±2 weeks)
thereafter until the sample was negative. Samples that were
antibody positive were analyzed for inhibition of rasburicase uricolytic activity. Anti-S. cerevisiae protein (SCP)
antibodies were also assessed by ELISA at baseline.
2.6 Pharmacokinetics
The pharmacokinetic assay was performed in 10 patients
(weight C10 kg) in each dose group at the following 10
timepoints: Day 1, before rasburicase administration
(within 10 min of the start of administration), at the end
of the first administration (within 10 min following
completion of administration), 4 and 8 h (±10 min) after
the start of administration; day 2, before rasburicase
administration (within 10 min of the start of administration); and day 5, before rasburicase administration (within
10 min of the start of administration), at the end of
administration, 4, 8, and 24 h (±10 min) after the last
administration. A total sample of 10 mL from each
patient was immediately centrifuged at \4C and then
frozen until assay. Frozen samples were sent to the laboratories (SBI-BIO, Paris, France), where they were
assayed concomitantly.
The following pharmacokinetic parameters were determined: area under the rasburicase plasma concentration–
time curve from 0 to 24 h (AUC0–24) on days 1 and 5;
minimum rasburicase plasma concentration observed
before treatment administration during repeated dosing
(Cmin) on days 1 and 5; plasma concentration of rasburicase at the end of infusion (Ceoi) on days 1 and 5; terminal
half-life (t1/2z) on day 5; and accumulation ratio for
AUC0–24 and Ceoi (defined as the ratio of day 5 to day 1 for
AUC0–24 and Ceoi). Rasburicase plasma concentrations
were determined by ELISA.
2.7 Statistical analysis
All patients who received at least one dose of rasburicase
were evaluated for efficacy and safety. The RR, with 95%
exact binomial confidence intervals (CIs), was calculated
as the number of responding patients divided by the
number of evaluable patients multiplied by 100. Patients
who failed to complete days 1–5 of treatment, for reasons
other than hyperuricemia, were considered as nonevaluable for RR. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize uric acid concentrations, and change from baseline
and the rate of plasma uric acid concentration decline
over time.
For the purposes of the statistical analysis, the study had
a planned sample size of 30 patients, i.e. 15 in each dose
group (0.15 and 0.20 mg/kg). Assuming that the true RR
would be 95% in each dose group, the probability of at
least one failure among 15 patients treated with each dose
of rasburicase would be 79%, with an expected lower 95%
CI of 71%. Based on a sample size of 15 patients per dose
group, it could therefore be concluded with 95% confidence that the true RR would be at least 71%.
Pharmacokinetic parameters for rasburicase were
determined using WinNonlin Professional Edition software
(version 3.3 Pharsight Corp, Mountain View, CA, USA)
using a noncompartmental method. To assess drug accumulation from day 1 to day 5, the parameters AUC0–24 and
Ceoi were analyzed using the linear mixed-effects model:
Log parameter ð Þ¼ dose þ day þ dose  day
þ patient dose ð Þþ error
Fixed-effect terms included dose (0.15 and 0.20 mg/kg),
day (1 and 5), and the interaction term dose by day. The
random-effect term was patient within dose. The model
was estimated using generalized least squares (GLS) with
restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimates of
random effects, using SAS PROC MIXED.
The 95% CIs for the variance estimates were computed
using the simple chi-squared method for within-patient
variance, the Modified Large Sample procedure for
between-patient variance, and the Graybill–Wang procedure for the total-patient variance [15].
3 Results
3.1 Patients
Between June 2005 and April 2006, 31 patients were
enrolled and 30 patients were subsequently randomized
and treated (rasburicase 0.15 mg/kg, n = 15; rasburicase
0.20 mg/kg, n = 15). One enrolled patient was not randomized to treatment because of an ineligible ALT level.
This patient was excluded from the efficacy and safety
analyses.
Patient baseline characteristics were similar between the
rasburicase dose groups (Table 1). The median age was
8.8 years, and over half of the patients (53.3%) were aged
between 6 and 12 years. Overall median weight was
30.8 kg, and one patient weighed \10 kg. Most patients
had an ECOG performance status of 0 (40%) or 1 (40%). A
total of 43.3% of patients were hyperuricemic, and 73.3%
of patients had acute leukemia. All patients were classified
as high risk for TLS in accordance with the inclusion criteria (i.e. had a newly diagnosed hematologic malignancy
with hyperuricemia or a high tumor burden).

3.2 Administration of rasburicase
Twenty-nine of 30 patients completed days 1–5 of treatment; one patient in the rasburicase 0.20 mg/kg group
withdrew from the study on day 1 after the first administration of rasburicase due to the lack of WBC count at
baseline. Another patient (0.15 mg/kg group) completed
5 days of treatment but withdrew from the study on day 8
to avoid life-threatening complications due to three concomitant grade 4 AEs (cerebral hemorrhage, brain edema,
and brain herniation). Fifteen patients in the 0.15 mg/kg
group and 14 patients in the 0.20 mg/kg group were
therefore evaluable for response.
3.3 Efficacy
The overall RR for all patients was 96.6% (95% CI 82.2–
99.9%) (Table 2). The RR was slightly higher in the rasburicase 0.20 mg/kg group than in the 0.15 mg/kg group
(100% [95% CI 76.8–100.0%] vs. 93.3% [95% CI 68.1–
99.8%]).
RRs for patients with hyperuricemia at baseline were
87.5 and 100.0% in the rasburicase 0.15 and 0.20 mg/kg
groups, respectively (Table 2).
Mean plasma uric acid concentrations by dose of rasburicase over time are presented in Fig. 1. Rasburicase
produced a rapid decrease in plasma uric acid concentrations in both dose groups. Uric acid levels remained low
throughout treatment in all patients except one nonresponder in the 0.15 mg/kg group. Uric acid levels
declined rapidly within 4 h of the first rasburicase dose in
both dose groups and remained low up to 120 h after the
first administration of rasburicase (Fig. 1). Mean plasma
uric acid concentrations were reduced by 84.8% (95% CI
76.7–92.9%) and 92.9% (95% CI 88.7–97.0%) compared
with baseline at 4 h after the first rasburicase administration for the 0.15 and 0.20 mg/kg groups, respectively.
Reductions in the level of plasma uric acid were similar
between the two groups at 24 h after the last administration
of rasburicase on day 6 (approximately 88%).
3.4 Safety
Owing to the severity of the underlying disease, all patients
experienced at least one grade 3/4 AE, regardless of rasburicase treatment. The most common grade 3/4 AEs were
leukopenia (86.7% of patients), neutropenia (83.3%),
lymphocytopenia (80.0%), and increased ALT levels

(70.0%). All of these AEs occurred with a similar frequency in both dose groups, with the exception of neutropenia (rasburicase 0.15 mg/kg, 93.3%; rasburicase
0.20 mg/kg, 73.3%). The majority of AEs reported during
the study period were judged by the investigators to be
related to the underlying malignancies and/or chemotherapy. There was no difference in the safety profiles of rasburicase 0.15 mg/kg/day for 5 days and rasburicase 0.20
mg/kg/day for 5 days.
The three grade 4 AEs (cerebral hemorrhage, brain
edema, and brain herniation) experienced by one patient in
the rasburicase 0.15 mg/kg group who withdrew from the
study on day 8, were judged by the investigators to be
unrelated to rasburicase treatment. The patient died after
withdrawal from the study. No other deaths were reported
during the study.
Drug-related AEs occurred in six patients (n = 4 in the
rasburicase 0.15 mg/kg group; n = 2 in the 0.20 mg/kg
group). One patient in the rasburicase 0.20 mg/kg group
experienced grade 3/4 hemolysis; the patient did not have
G6PD deficiency. The risk of rasburicase-induced hemolysis, possibly leading to hemolytic anemia and methemoglobinemia, is greater in patients with G6PD deficiency
because of the accumulation of hydrogen peroxide [13].
However, rare cases of rasburicase-induced methemoglobinemia have been reported in patients without G6PD
deficiency [12, 16]. Two rasburicase-related AEs occurred
after the administration of rasburicase but before the start
of chemotherapy (grade 1/2 hypersensitivity in the rasburicase 0.15 mg/kg group and grade 3/4 anemia in the
rasburicase 0.15 mg/kg group).
Hypersensitivity reactions (all grades) were reported in
8 patients (53.3%) in the 0.15 mg/kg group and 12 patients
(80.0%) in the 0.20 mg/kg group. Grade 3/4 events were
only reported in two patients in the 0.15 mg/kg group: one
patient completely recovered from the hypersensitivity
reaction by day 6, although the other patient experienced
persistent drug hypersensitivity until day 32. However,
these grade 3/4 hypersensitivity reactions were judged to
be unrelated to rasburicase. Only two AEs (hypersensitivity
[grade 1/2] and hemoglobin decreased [grade 1/2]),
observed before chemotherapy, were considered to be
related to rasburicase. Anti-rasburicase antibodies or antiSCP antibodies were not observed in any patients with
hypersensitivity reactions.
A slight decrease in serum creatinine levels from baseline was observed. The mean values (±standard deviation)
of serum creatinine were 52.3 lmol (±22.6) at baseline,
43.6 lmol (±16.3) on day 3, and 33.5 lmol (±11.5) on

Patients aged \18 years with newly diagnosed hematologic malignancies with hyperuricemia, or newly diagnosed hematologic malignancies presenting with a high tumor burden regardless of uric acid
level, were randomly allocated (based on stratification by weight [\10
or C10 kg]) to receive rasburicase (SR29142) administered at either
0.15 or 0.20 mg/kg/day for 5 days, followed by chemotherapy
starting from 4 to 24 h after the first infusion of rasburicase

44.4 lmol (±19.1) at baseline, 36.7 lmol (±11.8) on day
3, and 27.1 lmol (±7.1) on day 36 for the 0.20 mg/kg
group. No clinically significant changes were observed for
the other renal function parameters (potassium, phosphorous, and calcium) during the study period.
3.5 Antibodies
Anti-SCP antibodies were detected in one patient before
administration of rasburicase 0.20 mg/kg. Anti-rasburicase antibodies were detected in another patient in this
group on day 29 and the patient tested negative for
antibodies 6 months after the first administration. Neither
patient experienced a hypersensitivity reaction during the
study.
3.6 Pharmacokinetics
Blood samples to determine plasma concentrations of rasburicase were collected from 20 patients, 10 in each dose
group. One patient in the 0.20 mg/kg dose group was
excluded due to only two samples having been collected on
day 1 of the study. Therefore, 19 patients were evaluable
for AUC0–24 on day 1 and Cmin, Ceoi, AUC0–24, and t1/2z on
day 5.
The pharmacokinetic profile of rasburicase is summarized in Table 3. Increase in exposure to rasburicase over
days 1–5, as measured by AUC0–24 and Ceoi, was dose
proportional. For the 1.33-fold increase in dose from 0.15
to 0.20 mg/kg, AUC0–24 increased 1.13-fold and 1.30-fold
on days 1 and 5, respectively, while Ceoi increased 1.21-
fold and 1.23-fold on days 1 and 5, respectively.
Rasburicase accumulated slightly on day 5, as assessed
by AUC0–24 and Ceoi. The accumulation ratios of AUC0–24
and Ceoi (defined as the ratio of day 5 to day 1 for AUC0–24
and Ceoi) were 1.13 (95% CI 1.02–1.25) and 1.17 (95% CI
1.09–1.27), respectively, indicating slight accumulation.
Mean t1/2z was comparable for both dose groups.
4 Discussion
The data from this study show that administration of rasburicase 0.15 or 0.20 mg/kg before the start of chemotherapy is well tolerated in Japanese pediatric patients with
acute leukemia or non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. A rapid
reduction in plasma uric acid levels to B7.5 mg/dL in
patients C13 years or B6.5 mg/dL in patients \13 years
within 48 h after the start of the first rasburicase administration occurred and lasted until 24 h after the last rasburicase administration on day 5 in 28 of 29 patients
(96.6%). Moreover, 12 of 13 patients with hyperuricemia
at baseline responded to treatment. A high overall RR of
96.6% was observed, indicating the efficacy of rasburicase
for both the prophylaxis and treatment of hyperuricemia in
pediatric patients receiving chemotherapy.
Notably, all evaluable patients in the rasburicase
0.20 mg/kg group achieved a response and only one
evaluable patient in the 0.15 mg/kg group did not respond.
In addition, there was a greater reduction in plasma uric
acid concentrations from baseline at 4 h with the higher
dose of rasburicase (92.9 vs. 84.8%), further demonstrating
the greater efficacy of the rasburicase 0.20 mg/kg dose.
These findings add further credence to the results of the
randomized US study conducted by Goldman et al. [12],

which demonstrated more rapid control of uric acid and a
lower plasma uric acid concentration during the first 96 h of
therapy with rasburicase 0.20 mg/kg/day compared with
5–7 days of treatment with allopurinol in pediatric patients
with high risk for TLS. In addition, several single-arm
studies conducted in Europe, North America, Australia, and
Asia have evaluated the 0.20 mg/kg dose of rasburicase for
up to 7 days in pediatric and adult patients with high risk for
TLS [17–21]. In line with our findings and those of
Goldman et al. [12], these studies also reported numerically
greater response rates (based on normalization of uric acid
concentration) of 97–100% with rasburicase 0.20 mg/kg.
This is the first report to comprehensively assess rasburicase-related AEs occurring before the start of chemotherapy in pediatric patients. The majority of AEs reported
during the treatment period were judged to be related to the
underlying malignancies or chemotherapy by the investigators, with a low incidence of rasburicase-related AEs.
Only two rasburicase-related AEs, including one hypersensitivity reaction, were observed before the start of
chemotherapy in the rasburicase 0.15 mg/kg group. Most
rasburicase-related AEs observed after the start of chemotherapy had a similar profile to those related to the
underlying malignancies or chemotherapy. Patients who
receive chemotherapy for hematologic malignancies are
often exposed to risk of renal dysfunction. In the present
study, renal parameters such as serum creatinine were not
aggravated until completion of chemotherapy, suggesting
that rasburicase might preserve renal function during
induction chemotherapy.
Interestingly, new guidelines regarding the management
of patients at risk of developing TLS and its prevention
have recently been published [22]. Prevention strategies,
including hydration and prophylactic rasburicase in highrisk patients, hydration plus allopurinol or rasburicase for
intermediate-risk patients, and close monitoring for lowrisk patients, are advised [22]. In addition, the guidelines
advise aggressive hydration and diuresis plus allopurinol or
rasburicase for hyperuricemia as primary management of
established TLS.
An observational study has shown that treatment with
rasburicase according to this new guideline is effective in
preventing and controlling hyperuricemia and TLS in
children with hematologic malignancies [23]. The study
reported that the duration of rasburicase treatment should
be tailored to the duration and intensity of tumor cell lysis
in the patient by closely monitoring clinical chemistry. The
superiority of rasburicase in comparison with allopurinol
for the prophylaxis and treatment of hyperuricemia in
children with leukemia and lymphoma has been demonstrated [24]. Rasburicase, administered at a dose of 0.20
mg/kg for 5 consecutive days, resulted in a rapid and significant decrease in uric acid levels after 4 h [24], in line
with the findings reported in the current study. Rasburicase
was also a more potent and more rapid uricolytic agent than
allopurinol.
As rasburicase is a recombinant protein, antibodies can
be produced against this agent. However, the clinical
implication of such anti-rasburicase antibodies is unknown.
In this trial, anti-rasburicase antibody production was
reported in one patient on day 29, however, this patient did
not experience a hypersensitivity reaction during the study.
None of the patients had any anti-rasburicase antibodies on
day 8. In previous studies in which rasburicase was
administered to patients with cancer, although a small
number of patients were shown to have anti-rasburicase
antibodies, production of the antibody was not associated
with the clinical status of the patients or the occurrence of
AEs, including hypersensitivity reactions [25]. Goldman
et al. [12] reported no cases of rasburicase antibody production in the US pediatric study using rasburicase
0.20 mg/kg, whereas Pui et al. [26] reported antibody
production in 17 of 121 children and young adults treated
with rasburicase 0.15 or 0.20 mg/kg. Other studies evaluating rasburicase did not assess rasburicase antibody production [18–21]. The production of anti-SCP antibody was
also reported in one patient before the first administration
of rasburicase. In this patient, a hypersensitivity reaction
was not experienced during this study. This suggests that
there was no correlation between the presence of anti-rasburicase or anti-SCP antibodies and the occurrence of
hypersensitivity reactions in this study. However, because
of the limited number of patients with antibody production
in the current study, further studies are required in order to
confirm this finding.
The pharmacokinetic data obtained in this study support
the premise of dose proportionality of rasburicase, with only
slight drug accumulation during 5 days of treatment. These
data are consistent with the known pharmacokinetic profile
of rasburicase in Western populations [26], suggesting that
there is no ethnic variation in terms of the pharmacokinetic
profile of rasburicase. Based on the results presented here, a
daily rasburicase dose of 0.20 mg/kg might be recommended, particularly for patients who are more seriously ill
and at high risk of developing TLS. However, as only a
small sample size was studied in the present study and no
comparator or placebo arm was included for comparison,
further studies are needed to confirm the optimal dose of
rasburicase for patients in different risk categories.
In conclusion, this study provides further evidence that
rasburicase is highly effective in the control of hyperuricemia, a component of TLS, in pediatric patients undergoing chemotherapy for non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma or acute
leukemia. The study also demonstrates that rasburicase is
safe and well tolerated when administered before the start
of chemotherapy in this group of patients.
