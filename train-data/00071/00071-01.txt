Study Design. A prospective, randomized, single
(investigator) blind, comparative efficacy trial was
conducted.
Objective. To compare the efficacy of continuous lowlevel heat wrap therapy (40 C, 8 hours/day) with that of
ibuprofen (1200 mg/day) and acetaminophen (4000 mg/
day) in subjects with acute nonspecific low back pain.
Summary of Background Data. The efficacy of topical
heat methods, as compared with oral analgesic treatment
of low back pain, has not been established.
Methods. Subjects (n  371) were randomly assigned
to heat wrap (n  113), acetaminophen (n  113), or
ibuprofen (n  106) for efficacy evaluation, or to oral
placebo (n  20) or unheated back wrap (n  19) for
blinding. Outcome measures included pain relief, muscle
stiffness, lateral trunk flexibility, and disability. Efficacy
was measured over two treatment days and two follow-up days.
Results. Day 1 pain relief for the heat wrap (mean, 2)
was higher than for ibuprofen (mean, 1.51; P  0.0007) or
acetaminophen (mean, 1.32; P  0.0001). Extended mean
pain relief (Days 3 to 4) for the heat wrap (mean, 2.61) also
was higher than for ibuprofen (mean, 1.68; P  0.0001) or
acetaminophen (mean, 1.95; P  0.0009). Lateral trunk
flexibility was improved with the heat wrap (mean
change, 4.28 cm) during treatment (P  0.009 vs acetaminophen [mean change, 2.93 cm], P  0.001 vs ibuprofen [mean change, 2.51 cm]). The results were similar on
Day 4. Day 1 reduction in muscle stiffness with the heat
wrap (mean, 16.3) was greater than with acetaminophen
(mean, 10.5; P  0.001). Disability was reduced with the
heat wrap (mean, 4.9), as compared with ibuprofen
(mean, 2.7; P  0.01) and acetaminophen (mean, 2.9; P 
0.0007), on Day 4. None of the adverse events were serious. The highest rate (10.4%) was reported in the ibuprofen group.
Conclusion. Continuous low-level heat wrap therapy
was superior to both acetaminophen and ibuprofen for
treating low back pain. [Key words: acetaminophen, analgesia, heatwrap, ibuprofen, low back pain, musculoskeletal, thermotherapy] Spine 2002;27:1012–1017
Low back pain (LBP) commonly occurs in the general
population, with an annual incidence of 5% and a lifetime prevalence of 60% to 90%.2,11,25 Approximately
one half of the patients seen in the primary care setting
self-treat for a given episode of low back pain before
their first visit.7,27 Acetaminophen and ibuprofen are the
two most commonly used nonprescription drugs in the
United States.15 Both of these analgesics have been advocated as a first-line treatment for acute episodes of
LBP,3,6,13 but their efficacy is questioned.16,19,23 A systematic review concluded that these drugs are effective
for short-term symptomatic improvement of patients
with acute LBP, but efficacy of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs as compared with other therapies remains
unclear.26 Concerns persist about the potential risks of
these analgesics in terms of renal, hepatic and gastrointestinal complications.4,5,21,22,24,31
Clinical practice guidelines in the United States and
the United Kingdom have recommended the use of selfadministered topical heat therapy in the treatment of
acute LBP.3,28 A recent confirmatory study demonstrated the efficacy of a continuous, low-level heat wrap
therapy for the treatment of acute muscular low back
pain (Nadler et al, submitted separately). This study was
undertaken to compare the efficacy of this heat wrap to
the maximum recommended nonprescription dosages of
ibuprofen and acetaminophen for self-treatment of acute
nonspecific LBP.
Methods
This study was a randomized, actively controlled, multicenter,
single (investigator) blind study involving 2 days of treatment
and 2 days of additional follow-up evaluation. The study was
conducted at 11 sites and approved by an Investigational Review Board. All clinical assessments were standardized. As
shown in Figure 1, 371 subjects with acute nonspecific LBP of
at least moderate pain intensity were enrolled and randomized.
Pain of moderate or greater intensity (2 or more on a 6-point
scale) was required for inclusion. Additional inclusion criteria

required an age of 18 to 55 years (inclusive), ambulatory status,
no low back trauma within the preceding 48 hours, and an
answer of “yes” to the question “Do the muscles in your low
back hurt?” Women of childbearing potential were required to
undergo negative urine pregnancy tests, and if heterosexually
active, to adopt the use an acceptable method of birth control.
Subjects were asked not to use other treatments.
Subjects were excluded from the study if they had any evidence or history of radiculopathy or other neurologic deficits
(e.g., abnormal straight-leg-raise test results, patellar reflexes,
or bowel or bladder function), or a history of back surgery,
fibromyalgia, diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, osteoporosis, gastrointestinal ulcers, gastrointestinal bleeding or
perforation, renal disease, pulmonary edema, cardiomyopathy,
liver disease, intrinsic coagulation defects, bleeding diseases or
anticoagulant therapy (e.g., warfarin), daily back pain for more
than three consecutive months, or hypersensitivity to acetaminophen, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, or heat.
Before randomization, qualified subjects were stratified according to baseline pain intensity, gender, and study site.
Within each stratum, the subjects were randomized to treatment by a ratio of 6:6:6:1:1. Of the five treatment groups, three
were considered the primary efficacy treatment groups: heat
wrap (ThermaCare Heat Wrap; Procter and Gamble, Cincinnati, OH), which wraps around the lumbar region of the torso
and uses a velco-like closure, heats to 104 F (40 C) within 30
minutes of exposure to air, and maintains this temperature
continuously for 8-hours of wear; oral ibuprofen (two tablets
three times daily for a total dose of 1200 mg, with oral placebo
one time daily for blinding from the acetaminophen group); or
oral acetaminophen (two tablets four times daily for a total of
4000 mg dose total). Two small sample-size groups were included for blinding and reduction of bias on assignment of
treatment: oral placebo (two tablets four times daily) or unheated back wrap. Subjects assigned a back wrap were required
to wear the device for approximately 8 hours per day, with all
treatments administered on two consecutive days. Four visits to
the study site were required, with prescreening initiated by
telephone before the first study visit. Baseline measures for
efficacy evaluation included tests for muscle stiffness, disability
(Roland–Morris Disability Questionnaire20), and lateral trunk
flexibility.
The primary efficacy variable was pain relief, as measured
by a 6-point verbal rating scale.1 Muscle stiffness was quantified with a 101-point numerical rating scale. Disability was
calculated by subject as the percentage of “yes” responses to
the 24 questions comprising the questionnaire; back transformed to a maximum score of 24. Lateral trunk flexibility was
a derived score, calculated as the within-subject mean measure
of trunk flexion for the left and right sides. To measure the
extent of right trunk flexion, the subject was instructed to stand
erect with scapulae against a wall, arms hanging straight down,
and palms on the lateral surface of the thighs. With the subject
in this neutral position, a piece of masking tape was placed on
the skin of each side of the thighs to mark the fingertip ends of
the third digits (middle fingers). The subject then was instructed
to bend first to the right from the waist as far as possible,
keeping both legs straight and extending a straightened right
arm and hand down along the lateral surface of the right leg as
far as possible. A second piece of masking tape was used to
mark the location of the middle finger tip on the lateral side of
the right leg at the maximum extent of right trunk flexion. With
the subject standing in the neutral position, right trunk flexion
was measured by tape measure as the distance in centimeters
between the tops of the two pieces of masking tape on the
Figure 1. Intent to treat, primary efficacy variables, and disposition of the 371 enrolled patients.

lateral side of the right leg. This procedure was subsequently
repeated on the left side.
At the first visit, informed consent documents were signed,
medical histories taken, and physical examinations performed,
including neurologic assessments and skin assessments at the
area of back wrap application. The study participants were
given treatment instructions as well as diaries and questionnaires to complete. On Day 4, the participants returned to the
site, where lateral trunk flexibility and disability were assessed.
The skin quality of all the participants was assessed at visits 1
and 4 using a 4-point scale with the following range of choices:
0 (normal color), 1 (faint pink to definite pink), 2 (definite
redness), 3 (very intense redness).
As designated by the protocol, the primary comparison was
between the Day 1 pain relief scores of the heat wrap group and
the groups actively treated with ibuprofen and acetaminophen.
Secondary study end points compared the heat wrap and oral
analgesic treatment groups for Days 3 to 4 mean “extended”
pain relief, Day 1 mean muscle stiffness reduction, Day 1 mean
increase in lateral trunk flexibility and disability reduction. Primary and secondary analyses were conducted on both the intent-to-treat population and a per-protocol (“evaluable”) data
set, which was determined before the database was unblinded.
Evaluability criteria were outlined in the study protocol. Reasons for exclusion from the evaluable data set analyses included
failure to meet study protocol criteria, voluntary study withdrawal, and protocol violations such as treatment noncompliance, multiple missing or off-schedule diary evaluations, and
missing or off-schedule site visits.
Statistical Analysis. It was determined that given a standard
deviation estimate of 1.01 for a 0- to 5-point scale, a sample
size of approximately 105 evaluable subjects per efficacy group
would provide 90% power to detect meaningful differences
versus heat wrap in the day 1 mean pain relief scores of 0.5,
with a significance level of 0.025.
Day 1 baseline measurements were used to calculate change
from baseline scores. Day 1 mean pain relief (primary) and
mean muscle stiffness scores were calculated for each subject by
taking a mean of the individual hourly evaluations recorded at
hours 1 through 8 on Day 1. Days 3 to 4 mean “extended” pain
relief scores and mean “extended” muscle stiffness reduction
were calculated from evaluations taken approximately 24 and
48 hours after visit 3 on Day 2. Pain relief was analyzed using
analysis of variance (ANOVA), including effects for study site,
baseline pain intensity, gender, and treatment. Muscle stiffness
reduction, disability reduction, and lateral flexibility data were
analyzed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA).
For all primary and secondary variables, two-tailed Student
t tests of the null hypothesis of no treatment difference were
conducted between the heat wrap group and both of the oral
analgesic groups. To hold the Type 1 experiment error rate to
5%, Hochberg’s procedure was used to adjust and test the two
primary variable treatment comparisons before any secondary
variable was tested.14
Results
This study enrolled 371 participants (155 men and 216
women) (Table 1). The baseline characteristics of the
intent-to-treat population are provided in Table 2, and
the disposition of the subjects is provided in Figure 1.
The results of statistical analyses for the intent-to-treat
population matched the results of the analyses of protocol-defined evaluable subjects for all primary and additional variables. Therefore, the results of the evaluable
subject population are reported.
Primary Efficacy Variable: Day 1 Pain Relief
The Day 1 mean pain relief score for the heat wrap
(mean, 2) was significantly higher than for either acetaminophen (mean, 1.32; P  0.0001) and or ibuprofen
(mean, 1.51; P  0.0007) (Figure 2). This observed treatment difference for the heat wrap was 51.5% higher than
for acetaminophen and 32.5% higher than for ibuprofen. Significant differences (P  0.05) were observed at
individual hourly time points comprising the primary
end point. The heat wrap exhibited significantly greater
pain relief than either acetaminophen (at hours 2
through 8) or ibuprofen (hours 3 through 8).
Other Efficacy Variables
Pain Relief Evaluations: Other Time Points. The Day 2 mean
pain relief results corroborated those observed on Day 1.
The heat wrap scores (mean, 2.78) were significantly
greater than those for either acetaminophen (mean, 2;

P  0.0001) or ibuprofen (mean, 2.06; P  0.0001). The
mean “extended” pain relief score for Days 3 to 4 was
significantly higher for the heat wrap (mean, 2.61) than
for either acetaminophen (mean, 1.95; P  0.0009) or
ibuprofen (mean, 1.68; P  0.0001). This was an observed treatment difference of 33.8% between the heat
wrap and acetaminophen, and a 55.4% difference between the heat wrap and ibuprofen. The treatment differences were significant (P  0.05) between these
groups for both time points comprising this end point.
Muscle Stiffness. All three primary treatment groups
provided significant reductions in the muscle stiffness, as
compared with the mean baseline score at each of the
hourly time points evaluated throughout the study (P 
0.001 for all). The reduction in the Day 1 mean muscle
stiffness score was significantly greater with the heat
wrap (mean, 16.3) than with the acetaminophen (mean,
10.5; P  0.001), and directionally greater than with
ibuprofen (mean, 13.3; P  0.10) (Figure 3). This represented a 55.2% greater mean reduction for the heat wrap
than for acetaminophen, as compared with a 22.6%
greater reduction for the heat wrap than for ibuprofen.
Despite the mixed outcome overall on Day 1, the heat
wrap was associated with a significantly greater reduction in the muscle stiffness scores (P  0.05) than either
acetaminophen or ibuprofen at individual time points
from hours 4 through 8 on Day 1.
On Day 2, the muscle stiffness findings were added to
those observed on Day 1, with significantly greater reductions in the mean muscle stiffness scores for the heat
wrap (mean, 26.6) than for either acetaminophen (mean,
19.7; P  0.006) or ibuprofen (mean, 17.6; P  0.009).
Similarly, over the entire treatment period, the heat wrap
(mean, 21.3) showed significantly greater reductions in
mean muscle stiffness scores on Days 1 to 2 than either
acetaminophen (mean, 15.2; P  0.002) or ibuprofen
(mean, 16.4; P  0.01).
In addition, the mean “extended” muscle stiffness reduction score on Days 3 to 4 for the heat wrap (mean,
26.6) was significantly greater than for either acetaminophen (mean, 17.1; P  0.001) or ibuprofen (mean,
14.8; P  0.0001). On Day 4, the muscle relaxation
score peaked for the heat wrap (mean, 27.3), marked by
a 44.5% decrease from the baseline score.

Assessment of Lateral Trunk Flexibility: Range
of Motion
All three primary treatment groups were associated with
significant increases (P  0.0001 for all) in lateral trunk
flexibility on Days 2 and 4, as compared with baseline
values. However, after 2 days of treatment, the change in
lateral flexibility was significantly greater for the heat
wrap (mean, 4.28 cm) than for either acetaminophen
(mean, 2.93 cm; P  0.009) or ibuprofen (mean, 2.51
cm; P  0.001) (Figure 4). This was an observed treatment difference of 48.1% between the heat wrap and
acetaminophen, and of 70.5% between the heat wrap
and ibuprofen. Findings were similar on Day 4.
Roland–Morris Disability Assessment
Significant reductions in disability scores were observed
for all three main groups on both Days 2 and 4, as compared with baseline scores (P  0.0001 for all) (Figure 5).
On Day 2, the reduction in the disability score for the
heat wrap (mean, 3.9) was directionally greater than for
acetaminophen (mean, 3; P  0.08), and significantly
greater than for ibuprofen (mean, 2.6; P  0.009). By
Day 4, the reduction in the disability score for the heat
wrap (mean, 4.9) was significant as compared with either
acetaminophen (mean, 2.9; P  0.0007) or ibuprofen
(mean, 2.7; P  0.0001).
Safety
No serious adverse events occurred during this study.
Systemic adverse events were more common in the ibuprofen group (10.4%) than in the other primary treatment groups (6.2% for the heat wrap and 4.4% for acetaminophen). Nausea was the most frequently reported
adverse event in all the groups. Only one participant
dropped out of the study because of an adverse event, an
upper respiratory infection in the ibuprofen group. The
heat wrap was well tolerated over the study period. One
participant in the heat wrap group experienced minor
redness in the area of wrap application on Day 2. However, this resolved spontaneously 1 hour after wrap
removal.
Discussion
Self-medication using nonprescription acetaminophen
or ibuprofen is now a standard strategy for acute LBP
management.3,9,12,26,29 Topical heat is less commonly
used, possibly because of the need for assistance with the
placement of heat packs or immobility imposed by use.
This conflicts with recommendations for activity in the
weeks after an acute episode, with neither bed rest nor
exercise recommended in the acute phase.3,10,30 Workers
with LBP instructed to maintain a tolerable level of normal activity had a more rapid recovery than control subjects who received either 2 days of bed rest or back mobilizing exercises.18 Minimizing the impact of LBP on the
maintenance of activities of daily living is key to successful treatment.8,17
In this study, the heat wrap group demonstrated significant improvements in pain relief, lateral trunk flexibility, and disability reduction, as compared with the
ibuprofen group. Comparison of the heat wrap with
acetaminophen showed similar improvements in pain relief, lateral trunk flexibility, and muscle stiffness with the
heat wrap. These findings were sustained in the heat
wrap group more than 48 hours after the heat wrap was
removed, which is consistent with a separate report of
heat wrap efficacy, supporting the long-lasting effects of
topical heat treatment (Nadler et al, submitted separately). The therapeutic benefit of the low-intensity, longduration wearable heat wrap results partly from the continuous use of heat combined with the ability to maintain
normal activity levels. No serious adverse events were
noted over the course of this 4-day study.
Conclusion
According to the findings, continuous low-level topical
heat wrap therapy is superior to both acetaminophen
and ibuprofen, supporting its recommendation as a firstFigure 4. Assessment of lateral trunk flexibility.
