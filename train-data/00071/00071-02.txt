Summary
Background Regular paracetamol is the recommended fi rst-line analgesic for acute low-back pain; however, no
high-quality evidence supports this recommendation. We aimed to assess the effi cacy of paracetamol taken regularly
or as-needed to improve time to recovery from pain, compared with placebo, in patients with low-back pain.
Methods We did a multicentre, double-dummy, randomised, placebo controlled trial across 235 primary care centres
in Sydney, Australia, from Nov 11, 2009, to March 5, 2013. We randomly allocated patients with acute low-back pain in
a 1:1:1 ratio to receive up to 4 weeks of regular doses of paracetamol (three times per day; equivalent to 3990 mg
paracetamol per day), as-needed doses of paracetamol (taken when needed for pain relief; maximum 4000 mg
paracetamol per day), or placebo. Randomisation was done according to a centralised randomisation schedule
prepared by a researcher who was not involved in patient recruitment or data collection. Patients and staff at all sites
were masked to treatment allocation. All participants received best-evidence advice and were followed up for 3 months.
The primary outcome was time until recovery from low-back pain, with recovery defi ned as a pain score of 0 or 1
(on a 0–10 pain scale) sustained for 7 consecutive days. All data were analysed by intention to treat. This study is
registered with the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry, number ACTN 12609000966291.
Findings 550 participants were assigned to the regular group (550 analysed), 549 were assigned to the as-needed
group (546 analysed), and 553 were assigned to the placebo group (547 analysed). Median time to recovery was
17 days (95% CI 14–19) in the regular group, 17 days (15–20) in the as-needed group, and 16 days (14–20) in the
placebo group (regular vs placebo hazard ratio 0·99, 95% CI 0·87–1·14; as-needed vs placebo 1·05, 0·92–1·19;
regular vs as-needed 1·05, 0·92–1·20). We recorded no diff erence between treatment groups for time to recovery
(adjusted p=0·79). Adherence to regular tablets (median tablets consumed per participant per day of maximum 6;
4·0  [IQR 1·6–5·7] in the regular group, 3·9 [1·5–5·6] in the as-needed group, and 4·0 [1·5–5·7] in the placebo
group), and number of participants reporting adverse events (99 [18·5%] in the regular group, 99 [18·7%] in the asneeded group, and 98 [18·5%] in the placebo group) were similar between groups.
Interpretation Our fi ndings suggest that regular or as-needed dosing with paracetamol does not aff ect recovery time
compared with placebo in low-back pain, and question the universal endorsement of paracetamol in this patient group.

Introduction
Low-back pain is the leading cause of disability worldwide.1
Guidelines for acute low-back pain universally recommend
paracetamol as the fi rst-line analgesic.2,3 Although the
eff ect of paracetamol for low-back pain is similar to that of
other analgesics used for low-back pain,4,5 no direct
evidence supports this universal recommendation. In a
systematic review6
 we noted no evidence to support the
use of paracetamol for low-back pain. All seven of the
included trials had substantial methodological fl aws, and
only one trial included more than 25 participants per
group. No trial has compared paracetamol with placebo or
compared as-needed dosing with the regular
recommended dosing. In view of these uncertainties, the
Paracetamol for Low-Back Pain Study (PACE) aimed to
investigate the effi cacy of paracetamol taken regularly or
as-needed to improve time to recovery from pain,
compared with placebo for patients with acute low-back
pain. PACE also aimed to establish whether regular or
as-needed paracetamol improved short-term pain
(1–12 weeks), disability, function, global rating of symptom
change, sleep, or quality of life compared with placebo.
Methods
Trial design and participants
PACE was a multicentre, double-dummy, randomised,
placebo controlled trial. The study protocol7
 and analysis
plan8
 have been published. In brief, 235 primary care
clinicians (181 general practitioners, 50 pharmacists, and
four physiotherapists) across Sydney, Australia, screened
consecutive patients who sought care for low-back pain
directly or in response to a community advertisement.
Inclusion criteria were a new episode of acute low-back
pain (defi ned as pain between the 12th rib and buttock
crease that was shorter than 6 weeks’ duration and
preceded by 1 month of no pain) with or without leg pain,
and at least moderate-intensity pain (measured by an
adaptation of item 7 of the Short Form [36] Health
Survey). Exclusion criteria were suspected serious spinal
pathology (eg, spinal cancer, infection, fracture); current

use of full, regular recommended doses of an analgesic;

to paracetamol; use of psychotropic drugs for a disorder
judged to prevent reliable recording of study information;
or pregnant or planning pregnancy.
Ethics approval was granted by the University of
Sydney Human Research Ethics Committee. All
participants provided written informed consent.
Randomisation and masking
Concealed random allocation to one of the three treatment
groups (regular paracetamol, as-needed paracetamol, or
placebo) was done in a 1:1:1 ratio. The treating clinician
provided eligible patients with guideline recommended
advice3
 to remain active and avoid bed rest, and reassurance
of the favourable prognosis of acute low-back pain. The
patient was then supplied with a sealed box of study
medicines and referred to the study. These medicines were
prepared independently with a computer-generated
randomisation schedule; a researcher not taking part in
patient recruitment or data collection created a centralised
randomisation schedule using the random number
function in EXCEL, and a company that was independent
of the study prepared the treatment packs using this
schedule. Study medicine boxes were identifi able only by a
unique identifi cation number. Research staff not involved
in preparation of medicine boxes collected baseline
information by telephone and instructed patients to open
the box and begin treatment. After confi rmation of
eligibility and opening of the box, patients were deemed to
have been randomised to the trial. Clinicians, participants,
and staff collecting outcome data, assessing outcomes, and
analysing data were masked to group allocation.
Procedures
With the double-dummy design, participants were
asked to take two types of tablets for up to 4 weeks:
two tablets from the regular box every 6–8 h (six tablets
per day), and one or two tablets from the as-needed box
when needed for pain relief (4–6 h apart, to a maximum
of eight tablets per day). Participants in the regular
group had 665 mg modifi ed-release paracetamol tablets
in the regular box and placebo tablets in the as-needed
box. Participants in the as-needed group received
placebo tablets in the regular box and 500 mg
paracetamol immediate-release tablets in the as-needed
box. Participants in the placebo group had placebo
tablets in both boxes. Placebo tablets were identical in
appearance to the active tablets but did not contain
paracetamol. Participants were asked to continue the
study medicine until they recovered or for 4 weeks,
whichever occurred fi rst.
Clinicians were asked to schedule a review at 1 week to
reinforce the study treatments (irrespective of recruitment
method [ie, direct or advertisement]). If needed, rescue
medications were available for participants with
continuing severe pain. Rescue medication was 2 days’
supply of naproxen 250 mg (two tablets initially, then
one tablet every 6–8 h as needed). We chose naproxen on
the basis of investigator consensus about eff ectiveness
and safety9
 and because of its longer half-life, needing less
frequent dosing than other analgesics.
Follow-up data, obtained at 1, 2, 4, and 12 weeks, were
recorded by participants into a booklet and transcribed to
a case report form during a telephone interview with
research staff , or transcribed directly by the participant to
an online database. Participants recorded pain scores
into a daily pain and drug diary until recovery or 4 weeks.
Participants who had recovered by week 4 were contacted
every 2 weeks until recovery or the end of week 12 to
obtain pain scores. Participants were asked to return
their diary after the intervention period or with booklets
containing secondary outcomes at the end of week 12.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was time until recovery from pain
(in days).8
 We chose this outcome on the basis of previous
fi ndings of fast recovery in a cohort receiving regular
paracetamol.4
 As such, we postulated that regular
paracetamol would improve recovery by decreasing pain
intensity and allowing people with acute low-back pain to
remain active and resume normal movement as soon as
possible.
Recovery was defi ned as the fi rst day of 0 or 1 pain
intensity, measured on a 0–10 pain scale, maintained for
7 consecutive days (sustained recovery). We selected this
defi nition on the basis of consensus among study
investigators that 7 days of being pain free would be
more meaningful to patients than just 1 day. To test the
robustness of our fi ndings we also defi ned recovery as
fi rst recovery (the fi rst day of 0 or 1 pain intensity on the
0–10 pain scale).
Secondary outcomes were pain intensity, disability,
function, global rating of symptom change, sleep quality,
and quality of life. Process measures consisted of
adherence to drug (daily and at 4 weeks); concomitant
treatment use and work absenteeism (at 4 and 12 weeks);
adverse events (at 1, 2, 4, and 12 weeks); and treatment
satisfaction and patient masking (at 12 weeks).
Socioeconomic characteristics, previous and current
history of low-back pain, psychosocial characteristics,
and expectancy and credibility of treatment were
obtained at baseline.
Pain intensity was recorded as average pain intensity
for the past 24 h on a numerical pain rating scale from
0 to 10, scored from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible
pain).10 Disability was assessed with the
Roland Morris 24 scale,10 scored from 0 (no disability) to
24 (high disability). Feelings of depression were scored
from 0 (not at all) to 10 (extremely). Function was
assessed with the Patient Specifi c Functional Scale,10
with the average of three items scored from 0 (unable to
perform) to 10 (able to perform at preinjury level).
Global rating of symptom change was scored

from −5 (vastly worse) to +5 (completely recovered).10
Sleep quality was based on item 6 of the Pittsburgh
Sleep Quality Index (scored as very good, fairly good,
fairly bad, or very bad),11 obtained at baseline and at
1, 2, 4, and 12 weeks, with poor sleep quality defi ned as
answering “fairly bad” or “very bad”. Quality of life was
assessed with the Physical and Mental components of
Short Form 12 (version 2),12 obtained at baseline and at
4 and 12 weeks, with population mean of 50 and
standard deviation of 10.
Self-reported adherence was the proportion of the
recommended number of tablets that the participant
reported they consumed, assessed at week 4 follow-up
point (28 days) and reported on a 0–100 visual analogue
scale; this measure was adapted from the Brief Adherence
Rating Scale. Risk of persistence was scored from 0 (no
risk) to 10 (very large risk). Credibility and expectation
were assessed with the Credibility Expectancy
Questionnaire,13 scored from 3 (low credibility or
expectancy) to 27 (high credibility or expectancy). We
defi ned serious adverse events as any event resulting in
death or hospital admission, including pregnancy.
We defi ned adverse events as the occurrence or diagnosis
of any new medical disorder or exacerbation of any old
medical disorder since most recent contact with
researchers, and assessed this measure by questioning
participants at weeks 1, 2, 4, and 12. Satisfaction with
treatment was assessed by direct questioning at week 12
(“overall, how satisfi ed were you with the study
treatment?”), with satisfaction defi ned as a rating greater
than 3 on a scale from 0 (not at all satisfi ed) to 6
(extremely satisfi ed). We assessed masking by direct
questioning at week 12 with the question “do you believe
the medication in box 1 (regular dosing) was real
paracetamol, box 2 (as-needed dosing) was real
paracetamol, or that neither were real paracetamol?”.
Use of other drugs or health services for low-back pain
was assessed by direct questioning at the week 4 and
week 12 follow-up points. Provision of rescue medication
(naproxen) was assessed by direct questioning at the
week 1, week 2, and week 4 follow-up points.
Statistical analyses
With the assumption of a median recovery time of 14 days
in the regular group4
 and 17 days in the comparison
groups, a sample of 1650 patients would provide 80%
power to detect a diff erence of 3 days in median time to
recovery, with a two-sided α of 0·05 and allowing for 10%
non-adherence.
All data were analysed by intention to treat. Eff ects of
treatment on the primary outcome were estimated by a
Cox proportional-hazard model, with adjustment made

for baseline pain intensity because it is an important
prognostic factor.14 To minimise multiple statistical
testing we used a global Wald test to assess the overall
null hypothesis. If a signifi cant diff erence was recorded
(p<0·05), pairwise comparisons were done.15 Hazard
ratios (HRs) and median survival times with 95% CIs were
calculated for each group.
Longitudinal mixed models were used to estimate
treatment eff ects on continuous secondary outcomes. A
log-binomial regression was used for the categorical
outcome (sleep quality), with robust Poisson regression
as backup in case of convergence issues.16 The main tests
compared the overall outcome score between groups
based on baseline and four follow-up assessments for
that outcome. Statistical signifi cance in these models
was defi ned as p values less than 0·01.
Sensitivity analyses for the primary outcome used Cox
regression models to assess the eff ects of recovery
defi nition, imputation of missing data, and additional
baseline characteristics (ie, pain intensity, number of
days since onset of pain, and number of previous
episodes). For secondary outcomes, the eff ects of these
characteristics were also explored. The frequency of
adverse events (classifi ed by International Classifi cation
of Diseases version 10 coding) was compared between
groups with the Fisher exact test.
All primary data were double entered and checked for
consistency. Secondary data were checked after data
entry. Two statisticians who were masked to allocation
independently did statistical analyses with SAS software
(version 9.3). Discrepancies were resolved before
unmasking. This study is registered with the Australian
and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, number ACTN

The primary outcome could be determined for 534 (97%)
of the regular group, 530 (97%) of the as-needed group,
and 532 (97%) of the placebo group. The completeness of
survival data, measured by the completeness index,17
was 94·4%.
Table 1 shows baseline characteristics. Participants had
a mean pain intensity of 6·3 (SD 1·9). Across all three
groups the mean number of days since onset of pain was
9·9 (SD 10). The credibility of the study treatment and
participants’ treatment expectations were high and
similar across groups (credibility 18·9 [SD 5·1] and
treatment expectation 21·3 [5·6] of 27). Participants
recruited directly by community advertisement had a
mean pain intensity of 5·3 (SD 1·6) and the mean
number of days since onset was 15·7 (10·7).
Treatment adherence was similar across groups
(table 2). The median number of regular tablets taken
daily (until sustained recovery, or 4 weeks) was 4·0
(IQR 1·5–5·7) of the recommended 6·0 (equivalent to a
median daily dose of 2660 mg paracetamol for
participants in the regular group). All groups reported
increased adherence in the fi rst 2 weeks of the
intervention, with median doses equivalent to
3500 mg/day in week 1 and 2800 mg/day in week 2 for
the regular group (table 2). The median number of
as-needed tablets across groups was 1·9 tablets (IQR
1·0–4·0) daily in week 1 (1000 mg/day paracetamol) and
1·0 tablets (0·4–2·7) daily overall (500 mg/day
paracetamol). Counts of returned medicines (appendix)
and results from the Brief Adherence Rating Scale
(table 2) lent support to these fi ndings. 230 patients in
the regular group, 196 patients in the as-needed group,
and 229 patients in the placebo group consumed 70% or
more of the recommended course of treatment (table 2).
By 12 weeks, 466 (85%) participants in the regular
group, 452 (83%) in the as-needed group, and 461 (84%)
in the placebo group reached sustained recovery
(fi gure 2). The global signifi cance test suggested no
diff erence in time to recovery between groups, controlling
for baseline pain intensity (adjusted p=0·79). Median
days to recovery were 17 (95% CI 14–19) in the regular
group, 17 (15–20) in the as-needed group, and 16 (14–20)
in the placebo group (regular vs placebo, HR 0·99, 95%
CI 0·87–1·14; as-needed vs placebo, 1·05, 0·92–1·19;
regular vs as-needed, 1·05, 0·92–1·20). Table 3 details the
change in secondary outcomes scores at each follow-up
point for all treatment groups. Longitudinal mixed
models of secondary outcomes showed no diff erence
between groups for any secondary outcome during
follow-up (appendix).
Most patients (1042 of 1408; 74%) were satisfi ed with
treatment (table 2). The use of rescue medication
(naproxen) was low and similar across groups. During
the intervention period there was small-to-moderate use
of other drugs (table 2), and other health services after
removal of GP visits (212/1528 [14%]). The number and
type of drugs and health services used were similar
across groups (tables 4, 5). 296 (19%) of 1594 participants
had an adverse event, with no diff erence across the three
groups (table 2). Five (1%) participants in the regular
group, four (1%) in the as-needed group, and fi ve (1%) in
the placebo group had serious adverse events unrelated
to the study treatment (table 2, appendix).
Time to recovery did not signifi cantly diff er between
groups (p=0·55) when the fi rst recovery defi nition was
used, lending support to the robustness of the primary
analysis (appendix). We noted no diff erence between
groups with imputation methods for best-case and worstcase recovery (missing daily pain scores imputed as a
recovered value, p=0·72; missing daily pain scores
imputed as a non-recovered value, p=0·79) or after
adjustment for baseline characteristics (pain, number of
days since onset of pain, and number of previous
episodes, p=0·90; data not shown). Adjustment of these
characteristics did not change the fi ndings for secondary
outcomes.
After consideration of the results we did a post-hoc
analysis to assess the eff ect of paracetamol in the early
phase of treatment. We constructed linear mixed models
that included the daily pain scores up to day 14 to estimate
eff ects of treatment overall and for each day. These
analyses showed no treatment eff ect (appendix).
Discussion
We have shown that neither regular nor as-needed
dosing of paracetamol improved recovery compared with
placebo. Consistent with the primary results, paracetamol
also had no eff ect on pain, disability, function, global

randomisation, allocation concealment, masking, and
very low attrition. The risk of bias was reduced further by
pre-publication of a statistical analysis plan.
A potential limitation of PACE is that participants
typically did not take the full recommended dose of
paracetamol. Previous trials of low-back pain have used
paracetamol doses ranging from 1000 mg/day to
4000 mg/day.6
 In PACE we adopted the Australian
recommended maximum dose of 4000 mg/day,20 but the
overall median intake was equivalent to 2660 mg/day.
The accumulated response from regular dosing,
equivalent to 4000 mg/day, might have been more
eff ective. However, in our post-hoc analysis we did not
note any signal of eff ect on pain intensity during the fi rst
weeks of the trial when the median dose (3500 mg/day)
was close to the recommended maximum.
Adherence in PACE was similar to paracetamol
adherence in other pain states for which paracetamol is
recommended as fi rst-line care. In studies of osteoarthritis,
Pahor and colleagues21 reported that only 26% of patients
took the recommended dose of 4000 mg/day, and Temple
and colleagues22 reported adherence at 1 month to be
about 3000 mg/day. PACE participants were very well
supported to adhere with the recommended dose,
receiving explicit advice about dosing from the clinician
and research staff , which was then reinforced at follow-up.
The fact that many participants were still not able to
comply might result from impractical dosing requirements
of paracetamol or suggest that more intensive strategies
are needed for improved adherence.23
Another potential limitation is that some participants
used other treatments during the intervention period, as
opposed to the recommended rescue medication, despite
advice to not take additional treatments. Although this
issue has not been extensively assessed, other trial
fi ndings have shown that these additional treatments do
not provide benefi ts above guideline recommended
advice and simple analgesics.4,5,24 Importantly, we noted
no diff erence in the use of other medicines or health
services between groups, and so these other treatments
are unlikely to have masked an eff ect of paracetamol.
Although guidelines endorse paracetamol for acute
low-back pain, this recommendation is based on scarce
evidence. In the only trial of low-back pain (n=46) that
compared paracetamol (3000 mg/day) with no treatment,
recovery rates did not diff er.25 More often, paracetamol
has been compared with non-steroidal anti-infl ammatory
drugs (NSAIDs). Investigators of a Cochrane review5
concluded that the eff ect of NSAIDs was equal to that of
paracetamol (three trials, total n=309) and only
marginally better than placebo (8 points on a 0–100 pain
scale; four trials, total n=745); however, paracetamol has a
better safety profi le than NSAIDs. Our fi ndings, based
on a much larger sample, suggest that simple analgesics
such as paracetamol might not be important in the
management of acute low-back pain (panel).
Although we showed no eff ect of paracetamol on
recovery time, participants recovered at a faster rate than
that typically reported in other cohorts with acute back
pain receiving miscellaneous or usual treatments.19
In PACE, median recovery was 16–17 days, and by
12 weeks nearly 85% of participants had recovered.
Similar recovery was also noted in a study4
 investigating
fi rst-line treatments for acute low-back pain. A possible
explanation of these more favourable outcomes is that in
both studies patients were provided with good-quality
advice and reassurance, a feature that is often absent
from usual care.26 While we cannot disregard the
possibility of a placebo eff ect in PACE leading to
improved recovery, the provision of advice and
reassurance of the favourable prognosis might be the
more important factor in management of acute low-back
pain than drug therapy. Research should focus on
whether the recommended components of advice and
reassurance are benefi cial.
Our fi ndings suggest that the effi cacy of paracetamol
should be carefully considered, with respect to the safe
and eff ective use of medicines for low-back pain.
Although our fi ndings call into question the use of
paracetamol to improve outcomes for acute low-back
pain, these results should be replicated before paracetamol
is completely dismissed in the management of low-back
pain. Importantly, the safety profi le of paracetamol is
favourable compared with other analgesics recommended
for low-back pain (eg, NSAIDs).20 Because these other
medicines have not been shown to provide additional
benefi t beyond that of paracetamol,20 and are only
Panel: Research in context
Systematic review
We previously did a systematic review of clinical trials of paracetamol for acute low-back
pain,4
 in which we could fi nd no randomised controlled trials that compared paracetamol
with placebo and none that compared as-needed paracetamol with regular paracetamol.
In Dec 20, 2013, we searched PubMed and PEDro for studies published since Aug 1, 2007.
For relevant trials we used the text search terms “acute low-back pain”, and “paracetamol”
or “acetaminophen” and a publication date fi lter. We did not identify any relevant trials.
Interpretation
Our fi ndings provide the fi rst evide nce for the eff ectiveness of paracetamol for acute
low-back pain. Neither regular nor as-needed paracetamol improved recovery time or
pain intensity, disability, function, global change in symptoms, sleep, or quality of life at
any stage during a 3-month follow up. In previous studies, paracetamol was usually
compared with non-steroidal anti-infl ammatory drugs. Investigators of a Cochrane
Review20 concluded these medicines to be equally eff ective (three trials, total n=309) and
that non-steroidal anti-infl ammatory drugs are only marginally better than placebo
(8 points on a 0–100 pain scale; 4 trials, total n=745). The results of our study, based on a
much larger sample, suggest that simple analgesics such as paracetamol might not be of
primary importance in the management of acute low-back pain, and the universal
recommendation in clinical practice guidelines to provide paracetamol as a fi rst-line
treatment should be reconsidered. In view of the quick timeframe in which participants in
our trial improved across all the outcomes measured, compared with other cohorts,
advice and reassurance (as provided in our trial) might be a more important aspect of
medical care than pharmacological strategies for acute episodes of low-back pain.

marginally better than is placebo,5
 it is not clear which
drug should be preferred for management of low-back
pain. Our results convey the need to reconsider the
universal endorsement of paracetamol in clinical practice
guidelines as fi rst-line care for low-back pain, and suggest
that advice and reassurance, rather than analgesics,
should be the focus of fi rst-line care.
At present, no management strategies for acute
low-back pain have shown eff ectiveness to improve
outcomes substantially beyond its natural prognosis.
Because low-back pain is the leading cause of disability
worldwide,1
 improved focus on development of new,
eff ective treatments is warranted. In PACE, even during
the fi rst 14 days, paracetamol had no eff ect on outcomes.
One pharmacological research direction would be to
understand why paracetamol is eff ective in some acute
pain states (eg, tooth extraction27 and postoperative pain28)
but not for low-back pain.
PACE provides high-quality evidence that, in addition
to advice and reassurance, neither regular nor as-needed
paracetamol signifi cantly speed recovery from acute
low-back pain. Although participants improved quickly
in PACE, paracetamol had no eff ect on pain, disability,
function, global symptom change, sleep quality, or
quality of life.
