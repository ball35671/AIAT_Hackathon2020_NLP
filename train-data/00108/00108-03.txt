Diabetes is a common medical comorbidity of pregnancy and
places both mother and baby at risk for a variety of antenatal,
intrapartum, and neonatal complications. Complications are
reduced in the setting of tight glycemic control; however, this
requires diligent compliance with diet, medication, and selfmonitoring of blood glucose values throughout pregnancy.1,2
Insulin remains the standard of care for achieving glycemic
control in pregnant women who have overt diabetes. Although glycemic control can be reliably achieved with insulin,
this modality has several potential drawbacks. Patient education is time- and resource-intensive, administration supplies are cumbersome, women must self-administer
injections at least twice daily and maintain a structured
eating plan, and maternal hypoglycemia can occur.
The oral hypoglycemic agent glyburide has gained increased acceptance in the treatment of gestational diabetes
since the study by Langer et al.3 Recently, a large randomized
controlled trial has compared metformin to insulin for the
treatment of gestational diabetes.4 Women with early diagnoses of gestational diabetes, who may have had undiagnosed
preexisting diabetes, have been included in prior studies of
oral hypoglycemic agents in pregnancy; however, no prior

Abstract Objective To compare the safety and tolerability of metformin to insulin for glycemic
control among women with preexisting type 2 and early A2 gestational diabetes.
Study Design Women with preexisting type 2 diabetes and those diagnosed with
gestational diabetes who required medical management prior to 20 weeks were
randomly assigned to metformin or insulin. Glycemic control, defined as >50% capillary
blood glucose within target range, was compared between groups. Other outcomes
included patient tolerance, neonatal and obstetric complications, maternal weight gain,
neonatal cord blood C-peptide, and patient satisfaction with therapy.
Results Twenty-eight women completed the study, with 14 in each group. Of the 15
women assigned to metformin, 100% continued to receive metformin until delivery,
although 43% required supplemental insulin to achieve glycemic control. Glucose
measures did not differ between the groups, and the proportion who met fasting
and postprandial glycemic target values did not differ between the groups. Women
treated with metformin had significantly fewer subjective episodes of hypoglycemia
compared with those using insulin (0% versus 36%; p ¼ 0.04) as well as reported glucose
values < 60 mg/dL (7.1% versus 50%; p ¼ 0.03).
Conclusion Metformin should be considered for treatment of overt diabetes and early
A2 gestational diabetes in pregnancy.

randomized controlled trial has specifically compared metformin to insulin in the treatment of overt diabetes.
Many women enter pregnancy with adequate glycemic
control using metformin, an oral biguanide medication that
decreases hepatic glucose production and increases tissue
sensitivity to insulin.5 Metformin is readily available, inexpensive, generally well tolerated, and due to the mechanism
of action, it is not associated with hypoglycemia. Metformin
readily crosses the placenta,6 and free diffusion has been
observed from the maternal to fetal circulation with increasing fetal concentrations seen with increased dose.7 This has
led to concern for potential teratogenicity, either directly or
via altered glucose metabolism, as well as prolonged neonatal
hypoglycemia and possible long-term metabolic derangements. However, carrier-mediated efflux has also recently
been demonstrated in the placenta, which may function to
actively decrease fetal exposure.8 A study of pregnant women
with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) showed that the
concentration ratio of metformin in the umbilical artery to
vein was 1; therefore, the amount actually metabolized by
the fetus may be minimal.9 A recent meta-analysis found no
increased risk of teratogenicity among pregnancies exposed
to metformin.10
Our objective was to compare the safety, efficacy, and
tolerability of metformin compared with insulin for the
treatment of pregestational type 2 and early A2 gestational
diabetes during pregnancy. We hypothesized that among
women with uncomplicated overt diabetes, metformin and
insulin would provide equivalent efficacy in glycemic control
without increasing maternal or neonatal adverse outcomes
and that women would prefer metformin over insulin.
Materials and Methods
A previous large, randomized controlled trial of glyburide
versus insulin for gestational diabetes noted a mean fasting
glucose level of 104 mg/dL with a standard deviation of 25 in
the 201 women who were ultimately treated with glyburide.3
That study population was demographically similar to our
clinic population, thus we calculated that to detect a clinically
significant difference of 10 points in fasting glucose levels
between the two groups would require a sample size of 99
subjects per arm to demonstrate equivalent efficacy between
metformin and insulin at 80% power. When accounting for a
dropout rate of 15%, we anticipated needing 230 subjects
overall to achieve statistical power. Three months into recruitment, it became apparent we would not reach our target
enrollment within the time period our funding allowed.
However, to assess the feasibility and patient acceptance of
this study in our clinic system, we planned to enroll as many
patients as possible over a fixed 2-year period at the University of North Carolina Women’s Hospital in Chapel Hill, North
Carolina (UNC). To further assess the feasibility of conducting
a multicenter trial, we also planned to recruit on a more
limited basis at a second hospital-based clinic site, WakeMed
Hospital in Raleigh, North Carolina. This study was conducted
at UNC from July 2008 through March 2010 and at WakeMed
from January 2009 through December 2009. This study was
approved by the Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) of the
University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina (IRB
08–0898) and WakeMed, Raleigh, North Carolina (IRB 788).
Additionally, this study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov
(NCT 00835861).
All pregnant women receiving care who had a diagnosis of
“diabetes” were screened for eligibility, and those who met
criteria were approached for study participation. Women were
considered eligible for participation if they presented for
prenatal care prior to 20 weeks gestation and had a diagnosis
of type 2 diabetes controlled on an oral hypoglycemic agent
prior to pregnancy. Additionally, women with risk factors for
undiagnosed preexisting diabetes are routinely screened at
presentation to our clinic system. Those with a diagnosis of A2
gestational diabetes prior to 20 weeks’ gestation, defined as
two or more abnormal values on a 100-g 3-hour glucose
tolerance test using National Diabetes Data Group criteria11
and failure to achieve adequate glycemic control with dietary
modification, were also approached for participation.
Women were excluded from participation if they were on
insulin prior to pregnancy, not at least 18 years of age at the
time of randomization, did not speak English or Spanish, were
carrying a triplet or higher-order multiple gestation or a
known fetal anomaly, had evidence of end organ damage
(proteinuria > 300 mg/24 h, creatinine > 1.0, proliferative
retinopathy, or cardiovascular disease) or a major medical
comorbidity in addition to their diabetes. Additionally, women were queried regarding potential contraindications to
metformin therapy including hepatic or renal compromise,
allergy, or prior adverse reaction to metformin, and any
history of diabetic ketoacidosis. Mild hypertension, thyroid
disease, depression, and asthma were not considered contraindications to study participation.
Women were approached during the first clinic visit after
eligibility was determined. After written informed consent
was obtained, women were immediately randomized to
metformin or a conventional weight-based insulin regimen
(twice-daily regular and NPH [neutral protamine Hagedorn]
insulin).
Randomization was achieved using blocks of 2 and 4, and,
due to the ethnic profile of our clinic population, randomization was substratified according to Hispanic and non-Hispanic using a 1:1 assignment ratio. Using the computergenerated randomization scheme, a nurse not involved in
the study prepared opaque, sequentially numbered envelopes containing group assignment. Given the nature of the
two treatments, neither patients nor providers were blinded
to group assignment.
All women received nutrition counseling regarding the
proper diabetic diet and attended a diabetic education class
where they were instructed on methods to identify, prevent,
and treat hypoglycemia. Each woman was provided with a
glucose meter, taught the proper method of capillary blood
glucose monitoring, and instructed to perform and document
fasting and 1-hour postprandial tests. All women in the study
received a glucagon kit for the treatment of hypoglycemia.
Women who were assigned to the insulin group were
taught insulin administration and demonstrated proficiency

at the completion of the class prior to discharge from clinic.
Patients in this arm who were on any oral agents prior to
pregnancy discontinued their oral agents. Insulin was prescribed as a combination of regular and NPH in a weightbased fashion. A total starting dose of 0.7 U/kg/d was then
divided with two-thirds given in the morning (two-thirds
NPH and one-third regular) and one-third given in the
evening (one-half NPH and one-half regular). Those who
were assigned to the metformin group received instructions
on the proper administration of metformin, with morning
dose taken with breakfast and evening dose taken with
dinner. Women were started on 500 mg once or twice per
day if they were medication-naïve depending on the level of
glycemic control exhibited at randomization. Those who were
taking metformin prior to pregnancy were continued on the
same dose. Those who were taking another oral hypoglycemic
agent were converted to metformin.
At enrollment patient and family medical history and
demographic data were obtained via direct patient interview
and laboratory data were collected from the prenatal record.
At the first prenatal visit, or at the time of diagnosis, women
had blood drawn for hemoglobin A1c, thyroid-stimulating
hormone, liver function tests, creatinine, and a clean catch
urine sample was sent for protein-to-creatinine ratio. Hemoglobin A1C was also assessed at 24 to 28 and 34 to 37 weeks’
gestation to assess trend and provide objective confirmation
of reported glycemic control.
Prenatal care was provided by the University of North
Carolina Diabetes in Pregnancy or High Risk clinic, with
providers including maternal–fetal medicine attending
physicians, maternal–fetal medicine fellows in training, obstetrics-gynecologic resident physicians, a diabetic educator,
and a dietician. At the WakeMed High Risk clinic, women are
seen by a dedicated diabetic nurse educator, nurse practitioners, and obstetrics-gynecologic residents with supervision by an attending obstetrician. Patients were also seen by
the principal investigator at scheduled prenatal visits, and
each recorded glucose value was logged into a database. In
addition to glycemic control, women were queried regarding
any side effects, and medication compliance was assessed by
patient self-report. Maternal hypoglycemia was defined objectively as a glucose value < 60 mg/dL and subjectively by
maternal symptoms. Women who had not achieved optimal
glycemic control, defined as more than 50% the fasting blood
glucose values above 95 mg/dL or 50% of the 1-hour postprandial values above 130 mg/dL, had titration of their insulin
or metformin dosage. Women in the metformin group who
failed to achieve adequate glycemic control on maximal daily
dosage (2500 mg) had regular or NPH insulin added as needed
to obtain optimal control while continuing metformin therapy at the maximum dose. Women who required the addition
of insulin therapy received instruction regarding proper
administration at that time.
All women delivered at either University of North Carolina
Women’s Hospital or WakeMed Hospital. Upon presentation
to labor and delivery, glucose was assessed serially and an
intravenous insulin drip was used as needed to maintain
intrapartum maternal glucose less than 140 mg/dL. After
delivery, umbilical cord blood was collected for measurement
of fetal C-peptide at the core laboratory of the University of
North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina. Women who
delivered at WakeMed Hospital had their umbilical cord
blood sample frozen with subsequent transport to the core
laboratory at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill,
North Carolina. Each neonate had a heel stick glucose check at
1 hour of life with hypoglycemia defined as a value  40 mg/
dL. Maternal and neonatal information was abstracted from
the medical record by the principal investigator (UNC) or a
trained study nurse (WakeMed). Those women who delivered

interviewed on the postpartum ward by the principal investigator and asked, “If given a choice in a future pregnancy,
would you choose the same medication to treat your
diabetes?”
All comparisons between groups were based on intention
to treat, and data were analyzed using SAS 9.1 (SAS Institute,
Cary, NC). Shapiro-Wilk test was used to determine normality
of the data. Wilcoxon rank sum was used to compare median
numerical data for continuous data, and Fisher exact test was
used to compare categorical data. A p value < 0.05 was
considered significant.
Results
A total of 31 patients were randomized in the study, 15 in the
metformin arm and 16 in the insulin arm. Three women never
received the allocated treatment and were not included in the
analysis including one woman from the metformin group and
two women from the insulin group. Therefore, 14 women in
each group were analyzed for a total of 28 (►Fig. 1). Characteristics of the two groups were similar at randomization;
however, women in the metformin group were older
(p < 0.01; ►Table 1).
Glycemic control is described in ►Table 2. No difference in
mean fasting glucose levels was noted between the groups.
Power analysis of the primary outcome showed a power of 6%
for the difference in mean fasting glucose level (α ¼ 0.05). In
addition to assessing control for each woman over the entire
course of study enrollment, we specified 2-week intervals
throughout gestation (180
/7 to 196
/7 weeks, 280
/7 to 296/7
weeks, and 360
/7 to 376
/7 weeks) that would be evaluated to
determine if adequacy of control varied between the groups
at different points in gestation. No significant difference was
apparent when evaluated over the entire course of study
enrollment or at any of the 2-week intervals chosen for
evaluation. In addition to assessing glycemic control as a
continuous variable, we also assessed the percentage of each
subject’s glucose values that were at or below the fasting goal
of <95 mg/dL and the postprandial goal of <130 mg/dL for
both the entire course of study enrollment and during the
same 2-week intervals. There was not a statistically significant difference in achievement of fasting or postprandial
goals between the two groups when evaluated over the entire
course of study enrollment or at any interval in gestation.
Hemoglobin A1c was also assessed each trimester in an effort
to validate the glycemic values provided in the logbook, and
these values were also not significantly different between the
groups.
Women randomized to metformin who ultimately required supplemental insulin were able to achieve adequate
control on single agent metformin for a median of 11.5
(interquartile range [IQR] 10 to 12) weeks and required
significantly lower total doses of insulin. Women in the
insulin group required a mean of 89 total units (IQR 60 to
124) at the time of their last prenatal visit prior to delivery,
and the six women in the metformin group who required
supplemental insulin to optimize glycemic control were on a
mean of 21 units (IQR 8 to 24; p < 0.01).
Additional maternal and neonatal outcomes of interest are
described in ►Table 3. The women in the metformin group
reported fewer episodes of subjective hypoglycemia
(p ¼ 0.04) and documented fewer glucose readings < 60
mg/dL (p ¼ 0.03), and they were more likely to prefer metformin in a future pregnancy if given the option (100% versus
10%; p < 0.001). Notably, the six women who required supplemental insulin would prefer to initiate treatment with
metformin in a future pregnancy.

There were no stillbirths or major malformations in the
study cohort, and there were no intrapartum complications
such as shoulder dystocia or postpartum hemorrhage requiring transfusion. In the metformin group, one woman experienced a 13-week intrauterine fetal demise attributed to a
large subchorionic hematoma noted on ultrasound at
12 weeks. Another woman delivered a large for gestational
age infant with meconium-stained fluid after only attending
four prenatal visits.
Discussion
In this randomized controlled trial comparing metformin and
insulin for the treatment of preexisting or early gestational
diabetes in pregnancy, we found no significant difference in
glycemic control and no significant difference in the proportion of women who were able to achieve their target glycemic
goal. We did find a significantly lower occurrence of hypoglycemic symptoms and glucose values <60 mg/dL in the women
taking metformin. Despite the high rate of failure to achieve
strict glycemic control as a single agent (43%), the women
who required supplemental insulin were on significantly
lower doses and all were able to continue taking their
metformin. The women taking metformin were also more
likely to state a preference for that therapy in a future
pregnancy even if they knew supplemental insulin was a
possibility.
Strengths of this study include the novel comparison of
metformin and insulin in pregnant women with overt diabetes via a randomized controlled design. Additionally, we
assessed both objective outcomes, such as glycemic control,
and patients’ subjective acceptance of the therapy. Recruitment proceeded slowly due to strict inclusion criteria as well
as some reluctance on the part of the private obstetric
providers to refer their patients. Therefore, small sample
size and limited racial and socioeconomic diversity limit
the generalization of our results. The study was well received
by patients who were approached for participation and easily
performed within the structure of the existing clinic system
at UNC and WakeMed. Once women were enrolled, we
maintained contact, such that no one was lost to follow-up.
Several groups have reported independently on the use of
metformin during pregnancy without an increase in fetal
malformation or adverse neonatal outcome whether women
were exposed in the periconception period, during organogenesis, or throughout pregnancy.4,12,13 Glueck et al further

evaluated 126 infants of mothers with PCOS who conceived
on metformin and continued throughout pregnancy. At
18-month follow-up, there were no height or weight differences in the metformin infants compared with community
controls, and no motor or social developmental delays were
seen.14 Our study further supports the safety and tolerability
of metformin use in pregnancy; no major fetal anomalies or
neonatal metabolic complications were noted even among a
population at higher background risk for malformations.
Since Coetzee and Jackson’s earliest reports15,16 showed a
reduction in the incidence of infants who were large for
gestational age and a reduction in blood glucose with metformin treatment compared with no treatment in women
with preexisting and gestational diabetes, others have followed. Several retrospective, case-control, prospective observational studies and a small randomized controlled trial have
shown benefit to metformin therapy.12,13,17,18 More recently,
a large randomized controlled trial has compared metformin
to insulin in the treatment of gestational diabetes.4 Although,
metformin use resulted in a higher rate of failure to adequately control blood glucose, it was well tolerated and not
associated with increased complications. Our results are
consistent with prior studies that have shown a metformin
failure rate of 46%4 and 35%19 in gestational diabetes without
a consistent increase in adverse outcome. Our failure rate of
43% is likely higher than that of Moore et al19 because our
glycemic goals were more stringent. Finally, our study specifically addresses the overt, type 2 diabetes and likely
undiagnosed overt diabetic population in a randomized
controlled trial, which is a new contribution to the literature.
As we were able to demonstrate patient tolerance among
the women using metformin, the next step is a larger study
that could adequately assess glycemic control—ideally, a
randomized controlled trial comparing insulin, metformin,
and glyburide with long-term follow-up of the neonate
through adolescence. Insulin remains the gold standard for
glucose control in pregnancy complicated by overt diabetes;
however, with the use of glyburide increasingly becoming the
standard of care for gestational diabetes, some practitioners
are already expanding the use of oral hypoglycemic agents
such as metformin and glyburide to the overt diabetic population. Although preliminary studies are reassuring, exuberance for adopting routine use should be tempered until
further large-scale randomized controlled trials provide insight into the efficacy of these medications in achieving
optimal glycemic control and elucidate neonatal and childhood effects of in utero exposure.
In conclusion, this study suggests that metformin is a safe,
well-tolerated treatment for the control of overt type 2 and
early gestational diabetes in pregnancy and that it is preferred
over conventional insulin therapy by the patient. The most
important factor in the care of a pregnant woman with
diabetes, regardless of chosen therapy, is patient compliance
with care and achievement of adequate glycemic control.

Clinicians who choose to utilize metformin in their pregnant
women with diabetes should counsel their patients on the
risk of failure to achieve optimal glycemic control when used
as a single agent and that, although no consistent adverse
effects have been seen, the long-term effects on offspring of
women with diabetes are still unknown.
