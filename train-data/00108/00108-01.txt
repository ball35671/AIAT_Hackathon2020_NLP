Aims. To assess the effect of metformin and to compare it with insulin treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes in pregnancy
in terms of perinatal outcome, maternal complications, additional insulin requirement, and treatment acceptability. Methods. In
this randomized, open label study, 206 patients with type 2 diabetes in pregnancy who met the eligibility criteria were selected
from the antenatal clinics. Insulin was added to metformin treatment when required, to maintain the target glycemic control. The
patients were followed up till delivery. Maternal, and perinatal outcomes and pharmacotherapeutic characteristics were recorded on
a proforma. Results. Maternal characteristics were comparable in metformin and insulin treated group. 84.9% patients in metformin
group required add-on insulin therapy at mean gestational age of 26.58 ± 3.85 weeks. Less maternal weight gain (𝑃 < 0.001) and
pregnancy induced hypertension (𝑃 = 0.029) were observed in metformin treated group. Small for date babies were more in
metformin group (𝑃 < 0.01). Neonatal hypoglycemia was significantly less and so was NICU stay of >24 hours in metformin group
(𝑃 < 0.01). Significant reduction in cost of treatment was found in metformin group. Conclusion. Metformin alone or with add-on
insulin is an effective and cheap treatment option for patients with type 2 diabetes in pregnancy. This trial is registered with clinical
trial registration number: Clinical trials.gov NCT01855763.
1. Introduction
Diabetes in pregnancy is becoming more common worldwide especially in South Asian countries like Pakistan. This
is attributed to an increase in incidence of obesity and
type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is a metabolic disorder
characterized by hyperglycemia resulting from progressive
deterioration in pancreatic insulin secretion, insulin resistance in tissues, and inadequate suppression of glucagon
production [1]. Treatment of diabetes in pregnancy reduces
serious perinatal morbidity, improves women’s health related
quality of life, and decreases maternal complications [2].
The increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes in pregnancy
brings with it specific challenges in terms of management.
One such challenge that needs to be answered is, should
metformin, an antihyperglycemic agent, be used in pregnancy with diabetes? Metformin is recommended as firstline treatment for patients with type 2 diabetes by American
Diabetes Association [3]. However, metformin is not yet
accepted as treatment for gestational diabetes and type 2
diabetes in pregnancy. Metformin offers a logical alternative
to insulin in gestational diabetes and type 2 diabetes in
pregnancy as it produces euglycemia by reducing insulin
resistance, improving insulin sensitivity, reducing hepatic

gluconeogenesis, and increasing peripheral glucose uptake
and utilization. It also increases markers of endothelial activation which are intimately associated with insulin resistance
[4–6]. Metformin, a category B drug, is not associated with
fetal anomalies. Recent trial evidences support its safety and
efficacy in pregnancy with gestational diabetes [7]. However
as metformin crosses the placental barrier, fetal effects need to
be considered [8]. Women with polycystic ovarian syndrome
who continued on metformin throughout pregnancy showed
decreased risk of miscarriages, preeclampsia, and gestational
diabetes with better pregnancy outcomes and no increase in
risk of congenital anomalies in newborns [9, 10]. There is
paucity of data in terms of clinical trials relating specifically to
metformin treatment in women with type 2 diabetes in pregnancy. We have a population that brings specific challenges
in terms of marked insulin resistance, poor compliance to
insulin treatment, and lack of financial resources. Metformin
instead of conventional insulin might be an alternative,
effective, and cheap treatment option for women with type
2 diabetes in pregnancy in our population. The present study
was aimed at evaluating the effects of metformin therapy in
type 2 diabetes in pregnancy and comparing it with standard
treatment insulin.
2. Patients and Methods
2.1. Study Design. This trial was a randomized open labeled
clinical phase III study (NCT01855763) with parallel assignment to patients comparing metformin with insulin treatment in type 2 diabetes in pregnancy. The study was conducted at hospitals affiliated with Dow University of Health
Sciences, Karachi, Pakistan, from January 2009 till January
2014. Institutional review board and ethics committee of
the university approved the study and all participants gave
informed written consent.
Patients with prepregnancy diagnosed type 2 diabetes
and cases of newly diagnosed overt diabetes in pregnancy
(IADPSG criteria: FBS: ≥ 7.0 mmol/lit (126 mg/dL), RBS: ≥
11.1 mmol/lit (200 mg/dL), and HbA1C ≥ 6.5%) were selected
from antenatal clinics after taking informed consent. They
belonged to all five major ethnic groups living in urban
and rural areas of four provinces in Pakistan but now
settled in urban Karachi. Women included in the study
were between 20 and 48 years of age, having a singleton
pregnancy continued beyond first trimester. The exclusion
criteria were women who have contraindications or intolerance to metformin intake like gastrointestinal side effects
and altered liver functions with or without jaundice or
had hypersensitivity with the drug and women who were
diagnosed as gestational diabetes or had type 1 or type 2
diabetes and were already on insulin treatment, ultrasound
showing a recognized fetal anomaly, ruptured membranes in
second trimester, presence of any other medical disorder, and
diabetes related complications.
Randomization was done as the eligible patients enter
the study with odd number assigned to metformin treatment
and even number for insulin treatment irrespective of body
weight and previous obstetrical history. Blinding was not
possible because of different routes of administration of
drugs.
2.2. Study Treatment. Patients were advised for dietary modifications and nutritional instructions of three meals and three
snacks daily with predesigned diets according to body weight.
Metformin, (Glucophage) (Merck, Pakistan) was started at
dose of 500 mg/day orally and increased up to 2500 mg
in three divided doses as tolerated by the patient and till
glycemic control was achieved. Target blood glucose levels for
glycemic control were taken as fasting blood glucose (FBS)
≤ 100 mg/dL (5.5 mmol/lit) and postprandial blood glucose
levels (1.5 hours after meals) of ≤126 mg/dL (7 mmor/lit)
(Diabetic Association of Pakistan). If desired, target blood
glucose levels were not maintained anytime during treatment
even after maximum dose of metformin; insulin was added
as supplementary treatment with metformin.
Insulin (Humulin R, Humulin N (Lilly)) was prescribed
as a combination of short acting and intermediate acting
human insulin as twice daily injections before meals in
morning (before breakfast) and in evening (before dinner) to
cover for the three meals and three snacks a day or as multiple
injections of short acting insulin before meals and intermediate acting insulin at bedtime depending on individual patient
requirement, in order to achieve the desired glycemic targets.
Dose of insulin was calculated according to body weight and
gestational age. A 24-hour total insulin dose was calculated
using 0.6 units/kg body weight in 1st trimester, 0.7 units/kg
body weight in 2nd trimester, 0.8 units/kg body weight from
28 to 32 weeks of gestation, 0.9 units/kg body weight from 32
to 36 weeks of gestation, and 1 unit/kg body weight from 36
weeks onwards.
Patients were followed up in antenatal clinics. Iron, calcium, vitamin B12, and folic acid supplements were given to
all patients. They were taught self, blood glucose monitoring
using home glucose monitors and were advised to maintain a
written or electronic record of blood glucose levels. Patients
who could not monitor and record their blood glucose
levels were tested using glucose monitors at each visit in
antenatal clinic or they were admitted in day care ward for
blood glucose monitoring when required. Fasting and three
postprandial blood glucose levels 1.5 hours after breakfast,
lunch, and dinner were recorded. Dose adjustments of drugs
were made at each antenatal visit weekly or fortnightly till 36
weeks and then weekly till term or delivery. Routine obstetric
care was provided at the antenatal clinics. HbAIC was done at
study entry and at 36/37 weeks of pregnancy. Ultrasound was
done at first visit (dating scan) then at 16–19 weeks (anomaly
scan) and then monthly after 28 weeks (fetal well-being scan).
Mode and time of delivery were decided at 37/38 weeks of
pregnancy. Maternal and neonatal outcomes were recorded
on a predesigned proforma.
3. Study Outcome Measures
The primary outcome measures were alive baby, neonatal
hypoglycemia requiring intravenous dextrose therapy (blood
glucose <25 mg/dL or <1.4 mmol/lit), and NICU admissions
>24 hours.
Journal of Diabetes Research 3
The secondary outcome measures included birth weight,
LGA/macrosomia (birth weight > 90 centile for gestational
age or birth weight > 4 kg), SGA (birth weight < 10th centile
for gestational age or birth weight < 2.5 kg), neonatal morbidity like transient tachypnea of newborn, respiratory distress
syndrome, prematurity, sepsis, jaundice, and birth trauma,
maternal glycemic control reported as mean fasting (FBS)
and postprandial blood glucose levels (RBS) and HbAIC
levels at 36/37 weeks of pregnancy, weight gain in pregnancy, maternal hypertensive complications including pregnancy induced hypertension (gestational hypertension) and
preeclampsia (defined as B.P ≥ 140/90 on two occasions with
significant proteinuria), and treatment compliance, dose, and
cost of metformin and insulin treatment.
4. Statistical Analysis
4.1. Sample Size. It was estimated using the method of
sample size estimation for comparing two means on
www.openepi.com with mean and standard deviation of
neonatal outcomes, hypoglycemia, and NICU admissions
with an expected difference of 30% reduction in NICU stay
and 5–10% reduction in neonatal hypoglycemia between
metformin and insulin treated groups from a study done in
South Asian country [11] with 5% margin of error and 95%
confidence interval. We worked on 206 samples. Using PASS
version 11 Chi-square for proportion with 95% CI, sample
size of 206, and effect size of 0.233 with 2 degrees of freedom
the power of study calculated is 0.86 from primary outcome
measure, neonatal hypoglycemia, and for NICU admissions,
the power of study calculated is 0.99 using effect size of 0.396.
5. Data Analysis
Data was analyzed using IBM SPSS version 22; the frequencies and percentages were reported for all categorical
variables. Mean with SD was reported for all continuous variables. The analysis was performed to compare the metformin
alone group with metformin plus insulin group and insulin
alone group using two-sample independent student 𝑡-test
and Mann-Whitney 𝑈 test for continuous data. Chi square,
Fisher Exact test, and Mann-Whitney 𝑈 test were used for
categorical data. Two-tailed tests were used for all analysis
and statistical significance was considered at 𝑃 ≤ 0.05.
6. Results
The overall design and subject flow through the study is illustrated in Figure 1. A total of 297 patients with type 2 diabetes
in pregnancy were enrolled for the study. Of these 250 met
the inclusion criteria and were randomized to treatment with
metformin or insulin. 205 patients were already known cases
of type 2 diabetes and were controlled on diet only or were on
oral hypoglycemic agents. 45 patients were newly diagnosed
cases and were classified as overt diabetes in pregnancy
according to IADPSG criteria. 206 participants completed the
study and their data was finally analyzed, with 106 patients in
metformin group and 100 patients in insulin group (Figure 1).
84.9% patients in metformin group needed supplementary
insulin treatment in varying doses to maintain glycemic
control. The base line characteristics between the groups
were not significantly different in metformin plus insulin and
insulin alone groups; however patients in metformin alone
group were younger and were of less parity (Table 1).
6.1. BMI and Weight Gain. BMI in early pregnancy was less
in metformin alone group as compared to metformin plus
insulin and insulin group (28.25 Kg/m2 versus 33.59 Kg/m2
versus 32.96 Kg/m2
), 𝑃 ≤ 0.01. Total weight gain in pregnancy was 10.38 ± 1.2 kg in metformin alone group, 10.52 ±
1.14 kg in metformin plus insulin group, and 11.80 ± 0.86 kg
in insulin alone group indicating significantly less weight gain
in metformin treated group, 𝑃 ≤ 0.01 (Table 1).
6.2. Glycemic Profiles. Fasting, postprandial blood glucose
levels and HbAIC levels were statistically comparable in
three groups. Glycemic targets were achieved in all three
groups within one week of starting treatment and maintained
throughout pregnancy in the target range with no statistical
difference in three groups (Table 1).
6.3. Maternal Outcomes. Pregnancy induced hypertension
was found significantly less in metformin alone and metformin plus insulin group as compared to insulin alone group
(6.2% versus 23.3% versus 36%), 𝑃 = 0.020. However the rates
of preeclampsia in three groups were 25% versus 10% versus
17%, 𝑃 = 0.184. All women who developed preeclampsia in
metformin alone group were primigravidae. Gestational age
at enrolment and at delivery was not significantly different in
three groups. More women delivered vaginally in metformin
plus insulin group. Vaginal delivery rates were 18.8% in
metformin alone, 47.8% in metformin plus insulin group,
and 18% in insulin group, 𝑃 ≤ 0.01. Cesarean section rate
was 81.2% in metformin group, 52.2% in metformin plus
insulin group, and 82% in insulin group showing significant
reduction in cesarean section rate in metformin plus insulin
group, 𝑃 ≤ 0.01 (Table 2).
6.4. Neonatal Outcomes. There were no perinatal deaths and
all babies were born alive in three groups. Mean birth weights
was statistically the same in all groups. Significantly more
small for gestational age babies were found in metformin
treated groups as compared to insulin alone group (31.2%
versus 14.4% versus 2%), 𝑃 ≤ 0.01. Incidence of macrosomia
was statistically the same in three groups (12.5% versus 33.3%
versus 27%), 𝑃 = 0.208. Transient tachypnea of newborn was
found in 12.5% versus 6.66% versus 18% in metformin alone,
metformin plus insulin, and insulin alone group, 𝑃 = 0.063.
Comparable rates of RDS were found in three groups with
no statistical difference but lower rates in metformin plus
insulin group (12.5% versus 5.6% versus 11%), 𝑃 = 0.355.
10% neonates in insulin alone group developed neonatal
sepsis as compared to 3.3% in metformin plus insulin group,
𝑃 = 0.094. Two newborns in metformin alone group and 2
in insulin group had birth trauma with clavicle fracture in
two neonates and cephalhematoma associated with vacuum
delivery in other 2 neonates; all of them had birth weight of >
4 kg. NICU stay was significantly less in metformin alone and

Significantly less neonatal jaundice was observed in metformin alone and metformin plus insulin group as compared
to insulin group, 𝑃 = 0.021. Apgar scores at 5 minutes of birth
were statistically comparable in 3 groups. Significantly less
neonatal hypoglycemia was found in metformin plus insulin
group, 𝑃 ≤ 0.01, and mean blood glucose levels at birth were
also better in metformin plus insulin group (Table 3).
6.5. Pharmacotherapeutic Characteristics. Treatment compliance was good with oral metformin treatment than with
insulin injections (see Supplementary Table in Supplementary Material available online at http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/
2015/325851). Mean dose of metformin throughout pregnancy was 2.21 ± 0.63 in metformin alone group and
2.291 ± 0.63 grams per day in metformin plus insulin group,
𝑃 = 0.665. 84.9% patients required additional insulin in
metformin group to maintain glycemic targets in mean dose
of 23.64±4.61 units per day. Mean dose of insulin required in
insulin alone group was 77.62±12.69 units per day which was
significantly higher than that required in metformin group
as add-on therapy, 𝑃 ≤ 0.01. Mean gestational age at which
insulin was add-on in metformin group was 26.58±3.8 weeks
of pregnancy while insulin was started at mean gestational

respectively (Table 5).
7. Discussion
This randomized clinical study reports the results of metformin versus insulin treatment in women with type 2 diabetes in pregnancy. The study was conducted in a population
setting with high prevalence of diabetes to meet the needs
in a background of low economic resources where health
facilities especially medicines are not always available free
of cost. Patients with type 2 diabetes in pregnancy were
selected with strict inclusion criteria; that is, they were not on
insulin treatment and did not have complications associated
with diabetes. Although duration of diabetes was not taken
into account, the study patients, either had newly diagnosed
overt diabetes detected in this pregnancy or were known

cases of type 2 diabetes, who were on diet control or on oral
antihyperglycemic agents, with duration of diabetes not more
than 5 years.
In mean age and BMI the difference was statistically
insignificant in metformin and insulin treated groups but
patients in metformin alone group were younger and most
had BMI < 30. Older age and multiparity with BMI > 30 were
also observed in previous studies as in our study [12–14]. Total
weight gain in pregnancy was significantly less in metformin
treated patients than in insulin treated patients. Similar
results were reported by Rowan et al. [7, 15–17]. This effect of
less weight gain was observed more in women with BMI > 30
in our study. Glycemic targets were achieved within one week
of starting treatment and maintained throughout pregnancy.
Similar findings were reported by Rowan et al., Hickman,
Tertti, and others [7, 11, 18–20] indicating metformin to be
effective in achieving diabetes control.
We found significantly less pregnancy induced hypertension in metformin group as compared to insulin group, these
findings being related to the effect of metformin on reducing
endothelial activation and maternal inflammatory response
to insulin resistance [21]. However more preeclampsia was
found in elderly obese primigravidae in metformin alone
group. No differences in rates of maternal hypertensive
complications were found in other studies [7, 14, 16, 22, 23].
However, higher incidence of preeclampsia was reported by
Hellmuth et al. in metformin treated patients [24]. Patients
with BMI > 30 were found to have more pregnancy induced
hypertension than patients with BMI < 30. Metformin treatment however is associated with significantly less occurrence
of pregnancy induced hypertension in women with BMI > 30
in our study.
Patients were enrolled for study at around 10 weeks of
gestation with a viable pregnancy. Mean gestational age at
delivery was nearly the same around 37 weeks. More women
delivered vaginally in metformin plus insulin group as compared to insulin alone group (47.77% versus 18%) and similarly cesarean section rate was statistically lower in metformin
treated group. No differences in cesarean section and vaginal
delivery rates were reported in other studies [7, 13, 15, 24].

However, 81.25% patients required cesarean section in metformin alone group mainly because of association with
preeclampsia and intrauterine growth retardation.
No perinatal deaths occurred partly because congenital
anomalies were excluded from the study and tight glycemic
control was maintained, besides keeping a low threshold
for cesarean section in cases of presumed fetal compromise.
There was no difference in neonatal outcomes like birth
weight, Apgar scores, large for gestational age infants, and
respiratory distress syndrome in three groups. However
significantly more small for gestational age infants were
found in metformin group as compared to insulin group;
association of preterm delivery before 37 weeks and birth
weight < 10th centile for gestational age were contributing
factors in metformin group. Rowan et al. reported more spontaneous preterm births in metformin group than in insulin
treated group but same number of small for date infants in
both groups in MIG trial [7]. Neonatal complications like
transient tachypnea of newborn, neonatal sepsis, neonatal
intensive care unit stay, and neonatal hypoglycemia were
found significantly less in metformin treated group when
compared with insulin group. Similar results were reported in
other studies [7, 12, 13, 15, 18, 19, 23]. Women with BMI > 30
had more neonatal complications in insulin treated group as
compared to metformin treated group indicating protective
effect of metformin in reducing neonatal hypoglycemia and
thus NICU admissions.
Patients achieved adequate glycemic control with mean
dose of 2.5 grams of metformin, and few required dose
limitation due to gastrointestinal side effects. These were
those who required early add-on insulin therapy. Mean
gestational age at which insulin started in metformin treated
group was 26 weeks in our study. 84.9% patients in metformin
group required add-on insulin therapy in our study. Patients
with BMI > 30 required add-on insulin earlier than those
with BMI < 30 in metformin treated group. BMI appeared
to be a predictor for need of add-on insulin in metformin
treated group, as patients who were controlled on metformin
alone had mean BMI of less than 30. Insulin was add-on
with metformin to maintain glycemic control when insulin
resistance increases in pregnancy that is around 26–28 weeks
of pregnancy. In metformin treated group, patients with early
pregnancy BMI of < 30 did not require add-on insulin or
required add-on insulin at a later gestational age in our study.
Ijas et al. reported similar results in their study [23]. Other
studies in gestational diabetes show varying figures in terms
of supplemental insulin requirement. Rowan et al. reported
46.3%, Viollet et al. 18%, and Moore et al. 34.7% [7, 21, 25].
Coetzee and Jackson reported that 28.6% patients with type
2 diabetes in pregnancy required supplemental insulin with
metformin [26]. Mohammed et al. in a retrospective analysis,
however, reported that 95% patients with type 2 diabetes in
pregnancy required additional insulin to maintain glycemic
control [14]. These disparities in need for add-on insulin with
metformin may be explained by differences in populations
studied because diabetes and its control vary widely in
different populations related to their genetic and phenotypic
makeup. WHO ranks Pakistan as a high prevalent area for

diabetes with patients exhibiting high insulin resistance and
obesity [27]. This explains the reason of failure of metformin
alone to achieve glycemic control in these patients. Mean dose
of add-on insulin was significantly less in metformin group
as compared to insulin group and so the financial benefit
achieved was significant in metformin group. This financial
benefit is also shown in gestational diabetes part of this study
[28].
8. Conclusion
Metformin is an effective treatment option for women with
type 2 diabetes in pregnancy with or without add-on insulin
who require pharmacological treatment for glycemic control
in our resource poor setting.
Metformin has advantages over insulin such as less maternal weight gain, no maternal hypoglycemia, being cheap,
being oral therapy, and requiring no vigorous monitoring
and frequent hospital admissions with good compliance
and acceptability. Metformin treatment when compared with
insulin treatment showed less maternal hypertensive complications and less risk of neonatal hypoglycemia with few
neonatal intensive care admissions. Metformin treatment is
suitable for nonobese type 2 diabetes patients in pregnancy
without complications. Metformin treatment in type 2 diabetes in pregnancy required lower dose of add-on insulin, at
a later gestational age for maintaining glycemic control when
compared with insulin treatment.
Study limitations included duration of diabetes that was
not taken into account in the present study; besides congenital anomalies were excluded from the study and longer infant
follow-up was not carried out.
The findings of the trial are important in recommending
metformin for treatment of type 2 diabetes in pregnancy in a
selected population.
