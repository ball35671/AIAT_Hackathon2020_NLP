Abstract
Purpose The aim of the present study is to assess the
impact of adding oral metformin to insulin therapy in
pregnant women with insulin-resistant diabetes mellitus.
Methods The current non-inferiority randomized controlled trial was conducted at Ain Shams University
Maternity Hospital. The study included pregnant women
with gestational or pre-existing diabetes mellitus at gestations between 20 and 34 weeks, who showed insulin
resistance (defined as poor glycemic control at a daily dose
of C1.12 units/kg). Recruited women were randomized
into one of two groups: group I, including women who
received oral metformin without increasing the insulin
dose; and group II, including women who had their insulin
dose increased. The primary outcome was maternal glycemic control. Secondary outcomes included maternal
bouts of hypoglycemia, need for another hospital admission for uncontrolled diabetes during pregnancy, gestational age at delivery, mode of delivery, birth weight, birth
trauma, congenital anomalies, 1- and 5-min Apgar score,
neonatal hypoglycemia, need for neonatal intensive care
unit (NICU) admission and adverse neonatal outcomes.
Results A total number of 154 women with diabetes
mellitus with pregnancy were approached; of them 90
women were eligible and were randomly allocated and
included in the final analysis. The recruited 90 women
were randomized into one of two groups: group I
(metformin group) (n = 46), including women who
received oral metformin in addition to the same initial
insulin dose; and group II (control group) (n = 44),
including women who had their insulin dose increased
according to the standard protocol. The mean age of
included women was 29.84 ± 5.37 years (range
20–42 years). The mean gestational age at recruitment was
28.7 ± 3.71 weeks (range 21–34 weeks). Among the 46
women of group I, 17 (36.9 %) women reached proper
glycemic control at a daily metformin dose of 1,500 mg, 18
(39.2 %) at a daily dose of 2,000 mg, while 11 (23.9 %)
received metformin at a daily dose of 2,000 mg without
reaching proper glycemic control and needed raising the
dose of insulin dose.
Conclusion Adding metformin to insulin therapy in
women with insulin-resistant diabetes mellitus with pregnancy seems to be effective in proper glycemic control in a
considerable proportion of women, along with benefits of
reduced hospital stay, reduced frequency of maternal
hypoglycemia as well as reduced frequency of neonatal
hypoglycemia, NICU admission and neonatal respiratory
distress syndrome.

Introduction
The proportion of pregnant women with gestational and
pregestational diabetes mellitus (DM) is increasing, mainly
from an increase in type 2 DM [1, 2]. Obesity, low level of
physical activity, and, possibly, the exposure to diabetes in
utero are major contributors to the increase in type 2 diabetes [3]. Insulin has been the drug of choice for treating
DM with pregnancy, because of its safety in pregnancy,
lack of significant transplacental passage and long history
of use [4]. Pregnant diabetic women do not uncommonly
show poor glycemic control that necessitates hospital
admission during their antenatal follow-ups. Of them a
significant proportion, particularly those who are obese
with long-standing pregestational DM, show some insulin
resistance, that requires further increase in insulin dose
over variable periods of hospital stay. Prolonged hospital
stay is known to be associated with several adverse events
including a higher risk of nosocomial chest and urinary
tract infections, venous thromboembolism, in addition to
the high cost. Prolonged hospitalization, on its own, may
even worsen glycemic control [5]. Moreover, insulin, in
high doses, is associated with weight gain and bouts of
hypoglycemia [6]. In the few decades, oral hypoglycemic
agents have been included in the armamentarium of treatment modalities for gestational DM (GDM). Earlier concerns with use of these agents in pregnancy were the
unknown risk of teratogenicity and neonatal hypoglycemia
caused by transplacental passage [4]. Several randomized
controlled trials have been conducted on the use of different oral hypoglycemic drugs as a substitute to insulin in
women with GDM; the results of all of which were
promising. Glycemic control and neonatal outcome in
women who received oral hypoglycemic agents, namely,
the sulfonylurea glyburide and the biguanide metformin,
were comparable to those who received insulin [6]. Metformin is a biguanide that improves insulin sensitivity,
probably by activating adenosine monophosphate (AMP)
kinase. In contrast to insulin, metformin is not associated
with weight gain or hypoglycemia. Reported outcomes of
its use during pregnancy have been favorable [7, 8]. The
safety of use of metformin during pregnancy was mainly
derived from reports of women with polycystic ovarian
syndrome (PCOS) who got pregnant while using metformin [4]. Metformin is now categorized by the food and
drug administration (FDA) regarding its safety for use in
pregnancy as category B [4]. Metformin was tried in
women with GDM as an alternative to insulin and showed
remarkably promising results [6, 9]. The current recommendation is to switch women with type 2 DM who have
been maintained on metformin and get pregnant, to insulin
even if unexpected pregnancy occurs [4]. The promising
results of the few randomized trials on the use of metformin as an alternative to insulin in women with GDM,
encourages us to try it, not as an alternative to insulin, but
as an ‘adjuvant’ in women with DM with pregnancy who
show insulin resistance. The aim of the present study was
to assess the impact of adding oral metformin to insulin
therapy in pregnant women with resistant DM.
Patients and methods
The current non-inferiority randomized controlled trial was
conducted at Ain Shams University Maternity Hospital
during the period between August 2011 and April 2012. The
protocol of the study had been revised and approved by the
Ethical Research Committee of the Obstetrics and Gynecology Department, Ain Shams University, and registered
online to www.clinicaltrials.gov (ID: NCT01915550). Each
patient signed on the informed consent after thorough
explanation of the process and purpose of the study, before
participating in the study. Each patient had the right to
withdraw from the study at any phase, without any adverse
impact on her medical or ethical management. The study
included pregnant women with gestational or pre-existing
DM at gestations between 20 and 34 weeks who showed
insulin resistance (defined as poor glycemic control at a daily
dose of C1.12 units/kg). This threshold level was calculated
based on a retrospective survey of randomly selected 100
diabetic pregnant women who had been admitted to Ain
Shams University Maternity Hospital over the last 2 years.
The range of the total dose of insulin, at which proper glycemic control was reached, was 0.61–1.28 units/kg per day.
The threshold level was set at the 90th percentile, which was
1.12 units/kg per day. Poor glycemic control was defined as
fasting blood glucose [95 mg/dl and/or 2-h postprandial
blood glucose [120 mg/dl [4]. Women with type 1 DM,
those with secondary diabetes and those who had liver or
renal impairment were not included in the trial. For women
who were newly diagnosed to have DM with pregnancy, or
those who had not started insulin therapy by the time of
admission, insulin was started at a daily dose of 0.7 IU/kg [at
Arch Gynecol Obstet
123
the second trimester of pregnancy (14–27?6
weeks’ gestation)] or0.8 IU/kg [at the third trimester of pregnancy
(C28 weeks’ gestation)]. Insulin dose was increased in
women who were admitted for poor glycemic control.
Insulin dose was raised at a rate of 1 IU for every 10 mg/dl
higher than the target blood glucose concentration. The target blood glucose concentration was 60–95 mg/dl and
\120 mg/dl (for fasting and 2-h postprandial status,
respectively) [5]. The total dose of insulin was given in two
divided doses of a mixture of regular insulin and neutral
protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin at a ratio of 3:7, 100
IU/ml (Insulin Mixtard70/30, NovoNordisk, Bagsværd,
Denmark): two-thirds in the early morning (7–8 am) and onethird in the evening (5–7 pm). Only women who were
admitted to the hospital for poor glycemic control, after
reaching a daily dose equivalent to or exceeding the
threshold level (1.12 IU/kg), were recruited in the trial.
Recruited women were randomized into one of two groups:
group I, including women received oral metformin without
increasing the insulin dose; and group II, including women
who had their insulin dose increased. Randomization was
performed using a computer-generated randomization system. To minimize the risk of selection bias, the allocation
table was checked after applying eligibility criteria on
recruited women. Women who chose to switch from the
allocated group to the other one were canceled and not
included in the final statistical analysis. Per-protocol treatment analysis was performed. In women of group I, metformin (Cidophage500 mg, CID Pharmaceuticals, Egypt)
was given at a dose of 1,500 mg divided into three doses,
were taken with meals, in addition to insulin at the last
reached dose. Glycemic response to metformin treatment
was assessed by checking fasting and 2-h postprandial blood
glucose 5 days after the treatment was started. If the target
blood glucose concentrations were not attained yet, the dose
of metformin was to be raised to 2,000 mg per day for further
5 days. During these 10 days, daily capillary blood glucose,
urine for glycosuria or ketonuria were checked twice daily
and fasting and 2-h postprandial blood glucose every 48 h, to
detect seriously shooting blood glucose concentrations, and
treat it with regular insulin accordingly. Women who did not
reach the target blood glucose concentrations 10 days after
initiating metformin was switched to the conventional
insulin dose-raising regimen. In women of group II, women
were kept up with raising insulin dose at the mentioned rate,
until reaching the target glycemic control. Again, capillary
blood glucose and urine for glycosuria or ketonuria were
checked twice daily in addition to fasting and 2-h postprandial blood glucose every 48 h, until reaching the target
blood glucose concentrations. Women who showed proper
glycemic control in either group were discharged from the
hospital and were followed up until delivery. Glycemic
control was checked fortnightly until delivery. Women who
showed poor glycemic control at any time during pregnancy
were admitted and had their insulin dose increased in the
previously mentioned pattern until the target blood glucose
concentrations were achieved.
The primary outcome was maternal glycemic control.
Secondary outcomes included maternal bouts of hypoglycemia (\60 mg/dl), need for another hospital admission(s) for uncontrolled diabetes during pregnancy,
gestational age at delivery, mode of delivery, birth weight,
birth trauma, congenital anomalies, 1- and 5-min Apgar
score, neonatal hypoglycemia, need for neonatal intensive
care unit (NICU) admission and adverse neonatal
outcomes.
Sample size justification
Sample size was calculated using EpiInfo version 7.0,
setting the power (b) at 80 % and two-sided confidence
level at 95 %. The current study was set as non-inferiority
randomized controlled trial. All women who have their
insulin dose raised would eventually reach a proper glycemic control. A success rate of C80 % for metformin to
achieve proper glycemic control was assumed to be satisfactory. Calculation according to these values produced a
minimal sample size of 43 cases in each group. Assuming a
dropout rate of 5 %, a minimal sample size of 45 cases was
needed in each group.
Statistical methods
Statistical analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel
version 2010 and Statistical Package for Social Sciences
(SPSS) for Windows version 15.0. Data were described as
range, mean and standard deviation (for numeric parametric variables); range, median and interquartile range
(IQR) (for numeric non-parametric variables), or number
and percentage (for categorical variables). Difference
between two independent groups was estimated using
independent student’s t test (for numeric parametric variables), Mann–Whitney’s U test (for numeric non-parametric variables), or v2 (for categorical variables). Yates’
continuity correction was applied to v2 test if one or more
of the expected values were less than 5. Significance level
was set at 0.05.
Results
A total number of 154 women with DM with pregnancy
were approached; of them 90 women were eligible and
were randomly allocated and included in the final analysis
(Fig. 1). The mean age of included women was
29.84 ± 5.37 years (range 20–42 years). The median
Arch Gynecol Obstet
123
parity was 2 (range 0–6; IQR 2–3). The median number of
previous miscarriages was 0 (range 0–6; IQR 0–1). The
mean gestational age at recruitment was
28.7 ± 3.71 weeks (range 21–34 weeks). The mean body
mass index (BMI) was 31.83 ± 3.23 kg/m2 (range
25.71–43.37 kg/m2
). Of the included 90 women, 64
(71.1 %) were obese (BMI C30 kg/m2
), while 26 (28.9 %)
were non-obese; 39 (43.3 %) had GDM, while 51 (56.7 %)
had pre-existing DM (PDM). The median disease duration
in women with PDM was 4 years (range 1–15 years; IQR
3–5.5 years). The median initial total insulin dose was
1.14 IU/kg per day (range 1.12–1.3 IU/kg per day; IQR
1.13–1.17 IU/kg per day). The recruited 90 women were
randomized into one of two groups: group I (metformin
group) (n = 46): including women who received oral
metformin in addition to the same initial insulin dose; and
group II (control group) (n = 44): including women who
had their insulin dose increased according to the standard
protocol. There were no significant differences between
women of both groups regarding age, parity, no. of previous miscarriages, gestational age at recruitment and BMI.
There were no significant differences between women of
both groups regarding the type and duration of DM.
Difference between groups regarding glycemic control
is shown in Table 1. Of the included 90 women, 8 (3 in
group I and 5 in group II) were inaccessible for follow-up
at delivery (due to loss of contact), comprising a dropout
rate of 8.9 %. Table 2 shows difference between both
groups regarding delivery outcomes. There was a significant association between obesity and failed glycemic
control among women of group I (Table 3).
Discussion
The current trial showed that adding metformin, as an
‘outpatient adjuvant’ treatment to insulin in women with
DM with pregnancy (whether gestational or pre-existing)
who showed insulin resistance, was associated with proper
glycemic control in 76.1 % of treated women (NNH = 4;
i.e., in every 4 women who showed insulin resistance and
received metformin, 3 reached glycemic control and 1
needed to raise the insulin dose). Although this reduction in
the rates of proper glycemic control was statistically significant; it was not, from the clinical point of view. Adding
metformin, rather than increasing the insulin dose, was
associated with a significant reduction in the rates of hospitalization, a significant reduction in the treatment cost
(the average overall added cost was 60–80 EGP with
metformin, in contrast to 450–950 EGP with raising the
insulin dose), as well as a significant reduction in the frequency of maternal hypoglycemia (NNT = 7). Moreover,
adding metformin, rather than raising the insulin dose, was
associated with a significant reduction in the rates of neonatal hypoglycemia (NNT = 3) and NICU admission
(NNT = 4) and a modest reduction in the rates of neonatal

RDS (NNT = 7). The presence of obesity was significantly
associated with reduced rates of proper glycemic control
with metformin.
There has been emerging evidence regarding the safety
of the use of metformin in pregnancy; most of it was
derived from studies related to the use of metformin in
women complaining of infertility secondary to PCOS [10–
12]. PCOS is known to be closely related to insulin resistance, even if overt DM is not formally diagnosed. It has
been shown that metformin does reduce insulin resistance
and, therefore, improves outcomes in women with PCOS
[13]. Meanwhile, over the past decade, there has been
strong evidence regarding the efficacy and the safety of use
of metformin in women with GDM, as an alternative to the
standard insulin therapy [6, 9, 14–19].
Ijas et al. [20] in their open-label prospective randomized controlled study reported that metformin seems to be a
relevant drug for the prevention of fetal macrosomia,
mainly in lean or moderately overweight women developing GDM in late pregnancy. Women with ample obesity,
high fasting blood glucose and an early demand for pharmacological therapy may be more suitable for insulin
treatment.
The results from our study are consistent with those
obtained by Niromanesh et al. [21], who were assigned
randomly 180 women to receive either metformin (n = 80)
or insulin (n = 80). They assessed the effect of metformin
and insulin in glycemic control and compared the pregnancy outcome in women with GDM and they authenticated that, metformin is an effective and safe alternative

treatment to insulin for women with GDM. Their study
does not display significant risk of maternal or neonatal
adverse outcome with the use of metformin.
Similar to our findings, a more recent study was conducted on 28 women with pre-existing type 2 diabetes and
those diagnosed with GDM who required medical treatment prior to 20 weeks. Those women who were randomly
assigned to metformin (n = 14) and insulin (n = 14), their
glucose measures did not differ between the groups; and
the percentage of women who met fasting and postprandial
glycemic target figures did not differ between the groups.
Women treated with metformin had significantly fewer
subjective attacks of hypoglycemia compared with those
using insulin (0 versus 36 %; p = 0.04), as well as documented glucose values \60 mg/dL (7.1 versus 50 %;
p = 0.03). From the previously mentioned results, Hickman et al. [22] concluded that metformin should be considered for the treatment of overt diabetes and early A2
GDM in pregnancy.
A beneficial role of adding metformin in women who
show insulin resistance was suggested by Simmons et al.
[23]. The strength of the current study included that it is the
first conducted randomized controlled trial that investigated the efficacy of adding metformin to insulin therapy in
women with DM with pregnancy that shows insulin
resistance.
The definition of insulin resistance remains controversial. Several indices based on serum insulin and glucose
levels were proposed, including glucose–insulin ratio
(GIR), homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance
(HOMA-IR) and quantitative insulin sensitivity check
index (QUICKI) [24]. In the current trial, none of these
indices were used to define insulin resistance, however. No
reference ranges for such indices were previously published for pregnant women. Moreover, we preferred to
select a clinical marker of insulin resistance that we face in
the everyday clinical work in our institute, namely, a highinsulin-dose requirement. To be quite objective, retrospective analysis was performed over a randomly selected
100 cases of uncontrolled DM with pregnancy that had
been admitted to the hospital in the preceding 6 months.
Levels above the 90th percentile of the daily insulin doses
at which glycemic control was achieved were considered as
‘high insulin doses’ that probably reflect insulin resistance
(the first limitation of the current study). Another limitation
of the current study was the estimation of the sample size
based on a non-inferiority assumption. To conclude a more
valid generalizable result, further studies with larger sample size (that should be estimated on a superiority
assumption, instead) are probably needed. A third limitation was probably the ‘heterogeneity’ in the BMI of the
included women (range 25.71–43.37 kg/m2
). Both insulin
resistance and efficacy of metformin are known to be
affected by obesity, a fact that was even confirmed by the
results of the current trial. Future trials should consider this
limitation and should clearly include a more homogeneous
group of women regarding their BMI.
Conclusion
Adding metformin to insulin therapy in women with insulinresistant DM with pregnancy seems to be effective in proper
glycemic control in a considerable proportion of women,
with reduced hospital stay, reduced frequency of maternal
hypoglycemia as well as reduced frequency of neonatal
hypoglycemia, NICU admission and neonatal RDS.
