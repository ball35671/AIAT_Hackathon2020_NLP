Obesity is a national health crisis.1 With this rise in obesity,
the rate of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has also increased.
Metformin is an effective agent and first-line medication in
nonpregnant obese adults with T2DM.2–5 Metformin improves insulin sensitivity by reducing fasting plasma glucose
and insulin concentrations. It functions by decreasing hepatic
glucose output by inhibition of gluconeogenesis and enhanced peripheral glucose uptake.6 It has been shown to be

Abstract Objective Few studies support oral diabetic treatment in pregnant women with type 2
diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The objective of this study was to compare the effects of
metformin versus insulin on achieving glycemic control and improving maternal and
neonatal outcomes in pregnant women with T2DM.
Study Design A pilot randomized, controlled trial was conducted of metformin versus
insulin for the treatment of T2DM during pregnancy. The primary outcome was
glycemic control measured with hemoglobin A1c < 7% at delivery. Maternal and
neonatal outcomes were compared between groups.
Results In this study, 8 women received metformin and 11 received insulin. All women
in both groups achieved glycemic control by delivery (HgbA1c: metformin 5.96  5.88
vs. insulin 6.34  0.92%). There were similar rates of cesarean delivery, birth weights,
neonatal intensive care unit admissions, respiratory distress syndrome, and neonatal
dextrose treatment between groups. There was one case of fetal macrosomia in the
insulin group, one case of shoulder dystocia in the metformin group and no cases of
failed metformin therapy.
Conclusion In this pilot study, glycemic control was achieved in women who received
metformin and insulin. Larger studies are needed to determine whether metformin can
be considered a reasonable alternative to insulin in pregnant women with T2DM.

beneficial in reducing weight, improving lipid profiles, decreasing cardiovascular risk, and reducing fibrinolytic activity.3,5,7 An important advantage is that it is not associated with
hypoglycemia.3,4 The successful treatment of diabetes with
metformin has led to improvements in the overall health
status of women with diabetes. As a result, many of these
women are actively choosing to become pregnant leading to
the growing number of pregnant women with T2DM.
Adverse pregnancy outcomes in diabetic pregnancies are
related to fetal hyperinsulinemia which rises in response to
increased levels of maternal glucose crossing the placenta.6
Fetal hyperinsulinemia is associated with increased fetal
growth, fat deposition, and demand for oxygen. Pregnant
women with T2DM are at significantly increased risk of
spontaneous abortions, congenital birth defects, preeclampsia, and intrauterine fetal death.8,9 Poor pregnancy outcomes
are also due to macrosomia increasing the rate of shoulder
dystocia leading to neonatal birth injury and potential need
for cesarean delivery. Offspring born to women with T2DM
have a higher rate of developing obesity and insulin resistance
later in life.10–12 These pregnancy complications and the
process of fetal programming in utero are directly related
to the level of glycemic control during pregnancy. Pregnancy
management aims to reduce pregnancy complications by
returning maternal glucose levels to normal.6,9,13
Historically, insulin has been the therapeutic agent of
choice for controlling hyperglycemia in pregnant women
with T2DM. However, difficulty in medication administration
with multiple daily injections, potential for hypoglycemia,
and increase in appetite and weight makes this therapeutic
option cumbersome for the pregnant patient.6 Offering an
insulin sensitizing agent, such as metformin, that can be
administered orally and simply just a few times a day with
very few adverse effects may be appealing to these women,
thereby increasing compliance and overall perinatal outcome.
Although there is some evidence to suggest that metformin is
safe in pregnancy and that it potentially improves both
maternal and neonatal outcomes, its efficacy in pregnant
women with T2DM compared with insulin is largely
unknown.8,14–18
Because pregnancy is a state of hyperinsulinemia and
blood sugars tend to increase with gestation, clinical concerns
remain regarding whether metformin will be able to control
hyperglycemia related to pregnancy. In women with T2DM on
hypoglycemic agents who become pregnant, there is limited
data to support either the use or withdrawal of metformin.6
From a clinical perspective, practicing health care providers
are challenged with the question of whether it is reasonable
to resume metformin during pregnancy in those women
receiving such treatment before pregnancy. Although many
studies exist examining the effects of metformin versus
insulin in women gestational diabetes, there are only a few
studies published focusing on metformin in women with
pregestational diabetes before the onset of pregnancy.19,20
On the basis that metformin is an effective insulin sensitizer
in the treatment of T2DM, we hypothesized that metformin
might be an alternative to insulin in women with T2DM
during pregnancy. The objective of this study was to conduct
a pilot study to determine whether metformin could be
continued to control hyperglycemia and improve maternal
and neonatal outcomes in a focused, subgroup of pregnant
women with T2DM that were either on oral hypoglycemic
agents or diet controlled before pregnancy.
Methods
To answer the clinical question of whether metformin can be
resumed in pregnancy complicated with T2DM, an openlabel, pilot, randomized, controlled trial was conducted investigating the use of metformin versus insulin in the treatment of T2DM in pregnancy at the University of Texas Health
Science Center at Houston (UT Health) and at the University of
Texas Health Science Center at Brownsville. The Institutional
Review Board (IRB) at both institutions approved the pilot
study. Strict inclusion criteria were set by the IRB at the UT
Health thereby narrowing our enrollment population to a
small, focused subgroup of pregnant women with pregnancies less than 20 weeks’ gestational age who had a selfreported history of T2DM with treatment of either diet
control or oral hypoglycemic agents before pregnancy, and
who had T2DM for less than 10 years. Women were excluded
if they were on insulin before pregnancy, had multiple
gestations, type 1 diabetes, known fetal chromosomal or
structural defects, or contraindications to the use of metformin including renal disease, liver disease, recent myocardial
infarction or sepsis, or had an HgbA1c > 9%.
All participants received prenatal care through the high-risk
diabetic clinic. At their initial prenatal visit, an ADA diet was
recommended based on maternal weight, and instructions on
self-blood glucose monitoring (SBGM) four times a day (fasting
and 2 hours postprandial) were provided. Glucose levels
greater than 95 mg/dL fasting and 120 mg/dL postprandial
were considered abnormal. Instruction for exercise was also
provided. Routine prenatal assessments were also provided as
directed by the health care provider at the appropriate gestational ages including: 24 hours urine collection for total
protein and creatinine clearance, ophthalmology exam to
rule out diabetic retinopathy, maternal serum screening, first
trimester ultrasound, anatomy ultrasound, fetal echocardiogram, growth ultrasounds every 4 weeks, and antenatal fetal
surveillance beginning at 32 to 34 weeks. A maternal HgbA1c
level was drawn every trimester and at the time of delivery to
assess glycemic control. The HgbA1c at enrollment/randomization was considered the baseline HgbA1c.
Women were randomly assigned to either metformin or
insulin by the central investigational drug pharmacy at UT
Health in Houston, TX. A permuted block randomization with
a random fashion was used to prevent imbalances between
groups. This randomization was conducted independent of
the medication the participant was receiving before the onset
of pregnancy. The randomization was stratified by site,
Houston and Brownsville.
For those gravida randomized to metformin, medication
was initiated as in the nonpregnant population: Metformin
500 mg daily was initiated and women returned for routine
clinical prenatal visits weekly. If greater than 50% of the

glucose values were abnormal, metformin was increased to
500 mg twice a day. The metformin regimen was increased by
500 mg as needed for a maximum dose of 2,500 mg a day.
Once glycemic control was achieved, the participant followed
up every 2 weeks. If the participant required greater than
2,500 mg of metformin a day without achieving glycemic
control, she was considered “failed metformin therapy” and
was started on insulin, but still resumed and continued
metformin. Women receiving metformin before pregnancy
resumed the dose at which they were on at the start of
pregnancy and increased according to the above protocol.
For those women randomized to insulin, regimens were
based on maternal weight and gestational age. Regimens
were calculated as follows: first trimester—0.7 units/kg/day,
second trimester—0.8 units/kg/day, and third trimester—0.9
to 1.0 units/kg/day. The total insulin dose was divided into: AM
dose into two-thirds NPH and one-third regular insulin, PM
dose into half NPH and half regular insulin. Insulin doses were
increased or decreased 10 to 20% according to SBGM. Women
receiving insulin before pregnancy resumed or switched to an
equivalent insulin regimen as above.
The primary outcome was the rate of women with an
HgbA1c < 7% at the time of delivery. This primary outcome
was chosen as surrogate to assess overall glycemic control due
to limitation of a pilot study and logistical errors in reporting
SBGM with glucose logs. Secondary outcomes included
change in HgbA1c, maternal, and neonatal complications
including preeclampsia, failed metformin therapy, cesarean
delivery rate, macrosomia with a birth weight greater than
4,000 g, shoulder dystocia, respiratory distress syndrome
(RDS) as reported by the caring neonatologist, or need for
neonatal dextrose therapy. Maternal demographics and pregnancy characteristics were also collected.
Because this was a pilot study, we initially anticipated
enrolling 50 women in each group, for a total of 100 women.
To determine a power calculation, we had reviewed recent
deliveries at our institutions of women with T2DM and noted a
60% rate of women achieving an HgbA1c less than 7% at the
time of delivery. If there were 50 women in each group with an
effect size of 50%, a p-value < 0.05, the power would be 0.87.
Statistical analysis including both traditional frequentist
comparisons and Bayesian analysis was conducted. The primary outcome (rate of women with an HgbA1c < 7%) was
compared between groups with chi-square test. The differences in HgbA1c levels were compared with Student t-test.
Differences in gestational age at each HgbA1c laboratory draw
were compared with Mann–Whitney U test. Other continuous
variables were compared using Student t-test and categorical
variables were compared using chi-square test. Statistical
analysis was conducted using STATA 21st Edition. A p-values
< 0.05 was considered significant and relative risk and 95%
confidence interval (CI) were reported. Due to strict inclusion
and exclusion criteria, we had limitations in our enrollment,
and we were unable to achieve our sample size. Thus we
decided to conduct a Bayesian analysis. Bayesian analyses are
typically used to determine the effects of treatment in comparison studies with small sample sizes.21–23 After completing
the study, we performed a Bayesian analysis to assess the
treatment effect of metformin to insulin on the HgbA1c at
delivery or in the third trimester between groups and to
calculate the probability of a difference in values. A neutral
prior probability was used in estimating the posterior probability that the metformin had similar effects as insulin.23
Results
Due to the strict inclusion criteria, a total of 38 pregnant
women were approached to participate in this study from
September 2009 to August 2011, as illustrated in ►Fig. 1.

ineligible (8). A total of 25 pregnant women with T2DM were
enrolled, 11 to the metformin group and 14 to the insulin
group. Three women in the metformin group and one in the
insulin group were withdrawn due to the subject changing
her mind after enrollment and chose not to take any insulin.
Thus, 8 women in the metformin group and 13 in the insulin
group completed the study and were included in the study
analysis. The groups were similar in maternal age, gravidity,
parity, race, and gestational age at enrollment as described
in ►Table 1. There were similar rates of maternal hypertension, obesity, and morbid obesity between groups. More than
80% of these women were obese with a mean body mass index
(BMI) 35.9  5.2 kg/m2 in the metformin group and a mean
BMI of 40.1  8.4 kg/m2 in the insulin group.
The primary outcome of an HgbA1c < 7% at delivery was
achieved in 100% of women in the metformin group and 87.5%
in the insulin group (relative risk 0.79 [95% CI, 0.64–1.10]). All
women randomized to metformin achieved an HgbA1c < 7%
by the mid-trimester. The women randomized to the insulin
group had an HgbA1c drawn at an earlier gestational age
compared with metformin group (insulin 6 weeks [4–10
weeks] vs. metformin 9 weeks [8–13 weeks]). There was no
statistical difference between the HgbA1c at delivery between groups (metformin 5.96  5.88% vs. insulin
6.34  0.92%). There was also no statistical difference between the two groups at the time of enrollment/first

trimester, mid-trimester, and third trimester. A delivery
HgbA1c was obtained in only 13 women (5 in the metformin
group and 8 in the insulin group). However, either a third
trimester and/or a delivery HgbA1c were obtained on all
women. Thus, we determined the change in HgbA1c from
enrollment to delivery or third trimester was similar between
groups (metformin 0.13  0.50 vs. insulin 0.61  0.83,
p ¼ 0.223) as described in ►Table 2.
There were no women randomized to metformin who
“failed metformin therapy” and needed insulin to treat
hyperglycemia. There was no statistical difference between
gestational age at delivery, or rates of preterm birth less than
37 weeks of gestation, induction of labor, preeclampsia, or
cesarean delivery between groups as described in ►Table 3. In
addition, there were similar birth weights and rates of male
gender, neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admissions, RDS,
and the need for neonatal dextrose treatment. There was only
one case of fetal macrosomia in the insulin group and one case
of shoulder dystocia in the metformin group.
For the Bayesian analysis, the prior distributions on values
of HgbA1c were previously reported for women with gestational diabetes who were randomized to either insulin or
metformin.23 There was limited data on randomized controlled trials of insulin versus metformin in pregnant women
with T2DM. For the metformin group, we assumed a normal
prior distribution centered at 5.6% with standard deviation
(SD) of 0.5, and for the insulin group, the prior normal
distribution was centered at 5.7% with SD of 0.6. For the SD
parameter, we assumed a uniform prior distribution from 0 to
100.23 These prior distributions assume a prior probability of
55% of metformin group having lower values of HgbA1c
compared with the insulin group (about a 50–50 chance of
one treatment having lower values than the other). The
posterior distribution for the insulin group had a posterior
mean of 5.97% (SD ¼ 0.22) and 95% posterior interval of 5.52
to 6.4%. For the metformin group, the posterior mean was
5.88% (SD ¼ 0.33) with 95% posterior interval of 5.23 to
6.53%. The posterior probability of the metformin having
lower values of HgbA1c is 60% which indicates almost no
difference between the two groups.
Conclusion
In this pilot study, all pregnant women in both groups
achieved euglycemia by the third trimester and delivery.
Women who received metformin achieved an HgbA1c < 7%
by the second trimester compared with the third trimester in
those women who received insulin. Metformin treatment
resulted in similar maternal and fetal outcomes compared
with insulin. Although insulin has traditionally been the
treatment of choice for hyperglycemia in pregnant women
with T2DM, this small trial supports continuing metformin as
the primary treatment option in pregnant women with T2DM
who were treated with an oral diabetic agent before
pregnancy.
The greatest limitation of this study was the inability to
achieve our targeted sample size. This study was conducted
over 2 years and only enrolled a total of 38 women primarily
due to poor recruitments of participants. A significant factor
that impacted recruitment was the strict exclusion criterion,

in particular, the exclusion of women with T2DM who were
on insulin before pregnancy. Prior studies have reported that
83.5% of women with T2DM and Type 1 DM have used insulin
alone before pregnancy.17 Thus, this single exclusion criterion
reduced the number of women who were eligible for this
study. Another exclusion criteria was the HgbA1c > 9%. This
criterion influenced the enrollment of fairly controlled diabetic women, and thus could represent the underlying cause
for the lack of difference in change in HgbA1c seen between
groups. It could also be the reason why none of the pregnant
women in the metformin group failed metformin therapy.
Another factor affecting recruitment was the reluctance of
managing physicians to allow their patients to participate in
the study due to their own personal clinical practice patterns
and beliefs on how pregnant women with T2DM should be
managed. Despite this much needed randomized controlled
trial to answer the questions regarding important clinical
management of a high-risk obstetrical population, a small
sample size (N ¼ 38) was attained with a 23.7% attrition rate.
Recent trends demonstrate that the use of oral diabetic
medications preconception has increased from 0.7% in 2001
to 1.7% in 2007, primarily due to the use of metformin.17
During this time period, the use of metformin during pregnancy rose from 0.01 to 0.19% overall. The majority of women
(79%) used metformin for the diagnosis of infertility related to
polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). Only 13.6% used metformin for T2DM. Of the women on metformin before pregnancy, 8.8% of women continued metformin during
pregnancy, whereas 16.8% switched to insulin, 3% switched
to a different oral diabetic agent, and 68.0% did not use any
treatment at all. Of the women who continued metformin
during pregnancy, approximately two-thirds switched to
insulin or other oral agents by the second trimester.
We chose to use metformin instead of glyburide (sulfonylurea) due to its high efficacy in obese women, beneficial
effects on the cardiovascular status, and limited adverse
effects. Although glyburide is widely used for the treatment
of gestational diabetes, it carries the maternal risk of hypoglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and weight gain.4,5,16,24 In addition, metformin is a pregnancy category B drug, whereas
glyburide is a category C drug.4,14
Metformin has been used by women throughout pregnancy. The first studies were performed by Coetzee and Jackson
during the 1970s.18 Women with insulin independent diabetes were prospectively followed throughout gestation, 22
women received metformin compared with 42 women who
received insulin. The perinatal mortality rate was 50/1,000 for
those on metformin versus 51/1,000 on insulin. Neonatal
birth weight greater than 4,000 g occurred in only 10% of
women on metformin. There were no cases of maternal
hypoglycemia or lactic acidosis. In addition, metformin use
in the first trimester was not associated with congenital
anomalies.25 In a follow-up study, Coetzee and Jackson
were able to achieve glycemic control in women on metformin within 24 hours compared with 2 to 3 weeks for insulin.26
The most recent randomized controlled trial of metformin
versus insulin during pregnancy was in 751 women with
gestational diabetes conducted in Australia.27 There was no
difference in maternal or neonatal outcomes and fasting
glucose levels and HgbA1c results were similar between
both groups. Side effects in 7.4% of women led to cessation
of metformin treatment and 46.3% required insulin due to
failed metformin therapy. Women in the metformin group
gained less weight and had more weight loss compared with
insulin. Importantly, women who received metformin reported that they were more likely to choose metformin
even after delivery and that the ease of medication administration improved their treatment plan. This suggests that
mode of medication administration could impact compliance
with treatment and improve overall pregnancy outcomes.
Others metformin studies have been conducted primarily
in women with PCOS treated for infertility. A randomized,
double-blinded controlled pilot study was performed on 18
women with PCOS who conceived on metformin compared
with 22 women with PCOS who received a placebo.28 Women
who received the metformin had a lower rate of pregnancy
complications (0% metformin vs. 32% placebo) including
preterm birth, sepsis, deep venous thrombosis, or adult
RDS. There were no differences in neonatal outcomes such
as birth weight. Another study involving women with PCOS
who conceived on metformin showed a lower rate of developing gestational diabetes later in pregnancy (3% metformin
vs. 31% no metformin).29
Despite the numerous studies examining the effects of
metformin versus insulin in women gestational diabetes and
PCOS, there is only two studies published focusing on metformin in women with pregestational diabetes before the
onset of pregnancy. Ibrahim et al conducted a randomized
controlled trial of 90 women with either gestational diabetes
or insulin resistant pregestational diabetes. Although we
initiated enrollment and randomization before 20 weeks,
their subjects began treatment after 20 weeks.19 One group
received metformin with a fixed dose of insulin, and the other
group received metformin and increasing doses of insulin.
They concluded that adding metformin to insulin therapy in
insulin-resistant diabetes was effective in proper glycemic
control and resulted in reduced hospital stay, maternal and
neonatal hypoglycemia, NICU admissions, and neonatal RDS.
Similar to our study, Hickman et al conducted a randomized
controlled trial of metformin versus insulin of women with
both gestational diabetes (N ¼ 18) and type 2 diabetes
(N ¼ 15).20 They reported a 43% failure rate of metformin
alone resulting in the addition of insulin to achieve glycemic
control. Women who received metformin experienced fewer
episodes of hypoglycemia. An ongoing randomized controlled
trial involving pregnant with T2DM metformin in addition to
insulin versus insulin alone is currently being conducted in
Canada (NCT 01353391).
In summary, we found that in this small pilot, randomized
controlled trial, metformin was able to achieve glycemic control
in pregnant women with T2DM. There were no differences in
maternal and neonatal outcomes compared with insulin. It is
unclear whether the results of this study are due to its small
sample size, enrollment of fairly controlled diabetic women or
due to metformin’s relative ease of self-administration, thereby
improving medication compliance and pregnancy outcomes.

Because the pregnant women in this study had good glycemic
control based on enrollment HgbA1c, this small subset of
women may represent those who may benefit the most from
continuing metformin rather than switching to insulin. Metformin is prescribed commonly before pregnancy, and over the last
decade, more women are continuing its use during pregnancy.
Thus, future studies are needed to determine whether metformin can continue to be used as an alternative to insulin in
pregnant women with T2DM.
