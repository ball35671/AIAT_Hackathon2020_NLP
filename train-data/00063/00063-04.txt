● Background: Both residual renal function and blood pressure (BP) control contribute to patient survival in
patients receiving continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). It is unknown whether antihypertensive drugs
affect residual renal function in addition to BP reduction. Methods: We examined the effects of an angiotensin II
receptor blocker, valsartan, on residual renal function and total clearance (renal and peritoneal) in 34 Japanese
CAPD patients from 3 months to 2 years after the start of dialysis therapy. Patients were randomly assigned to
valsartan (n  18; age, 63.5  3.7 years; 11 men, 7 women) or a control group (n  16; age, 63.5  3.3 years; 10 men,
6 women). Conventional antihypertensive treatment was continued in all patients to achieve the target BP in both
groups of 130/80 mm Hg or less, measured at home. Results: BP reduction was similar in the valsartan and control
groups. Valsartan significantly slowed the progressive decline in both residual renal function (3.2  0.3 to 4.3  0.7
mL/min/1.73 m2) and total clearance (42.1  3.2 to 48.3  4.8 L/wk/1.73 m2) by dialysis in CAPD patients compared
with controls (5.9  0.5 to 2.8  0.4 mL/min/1.73 m2; 47.1  4.8 to 31.4  5.2 L/wk/1.73 m2). Conclusion: This study
shows that in patients with hypertension starting CAPD therapy, valsartan slows the decline in residual renal
function and contributes to maintenance of weekly creatinine clearance and Kt/V (fraction per dialysis), which are
the major factors contributing to the mortality and morbidity of CAPD patients. This effect appears to be mostly a
result of maintaining residual renal function. Am J Kidney Dis 43:1056-1064.

SEVERAL STUDIES have been published
showing no difference in patient survival
between continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and hemodialysis (HD).1,2 Other
studies, including our recent data,3,4 have suggested that CAPD is equivalent to HD or may
even be superior for certain subgroups. It therefore is appealing to advocate peritoneal dialysis
(PD) as an initial therapy.5Among several advantages of PD as an initial therapy, the preservation
of better residual renal function, which has been
attributed to an effect of residual function on
both total solute clearance and fluid status,6 may
be an important factor for choosing PD. Despite
the importance of preserving residual renal function, few studies have addressed therapeutic approaches for preserving residual renal function
after the initiation of dialysis therapy. Moist et
al7 showed that greater serum calcium level, use
of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, and use of a calcium channel blocker
were independently associated with decreased
risk for residual renal function loss.
To date, there have been many reports of
hypertensive patients undergoing HD, and this
has been studied intensely8,9; however, by comparison, few reports have addressed hypertension in patients on CAPD therapy.10-12 Gunal et
al11 reported that in most patients on CAPD
therapy, normal blood pressure (BP) can be
achieved by strict volume control combined with
increased ultrafiltration. However, this was accompanied by a decrease in residual renal function and Kt/V (fraction per dialysis) index.11 This
might conflict with the advantages of CAPD,
which are to preserve residual renal function and
contribute to better quality of life and reduced
mortality. Moreover, there have been very few
investigations into effects of antihypertensive
medications on residual renal function in hypertensive patients on CAPD therapy. Recent evidence suggests that angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs)13 are effective in the prevention of
progressive chronic renal disease and reduction
in proteinuria and are as effective as ACE inhibitors.14 We hypothesized that use of ARBs by

patients undergoing CAPD would preserve residual renal function. Therefore, during a period
of 2 years, we prospectively studied the effects
of valsartan on residual renal function in patients
starting dialysis therapy on CAPD.
METHODS
Study Design
A prospective, randomized, open-label study was approved by the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of the
Saitama Medical School (Saitama, Japan). Because it was
anticipated that the patient group would require frequent
hospital admissions, it was decided to adopt an open-label
study design to ensure that study medication could be
administered conveniently during in-patient stays.
Patients
Thirty-four patients new to CAPD therapy were enrolled
after obtaining written consent. During the 3 months after
the start of CAPD therapy, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or a
combination of both were withheld if the patients were
administered these medications. During these months, home
BP measurements were encouraged and checked by trained
nurses. Daytime home BP less than 130/80 mm Hg was the
target BP according to current definitions and criteria, defined by Burt et al.15
Exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) underlying medical
conditions, such as congestive heart failure, or therapy with an
ACE inhibitor or ARB; (2) myocardial infarction within the
preceding 6 months; (3) clinically significant valvular disease;
(4) malignant hypertension; (5) history of hypertensive encephalopathy or cerebrovascular accident within the preceding 6
months; (6) any condition that may have precluded a patient
from remaining in the study, such as alcohol or drug abuse,
chronic liver disease, malignant disease, or psychiatric disorder; and (7) history of allergy or intolerance to an ARB.
Method
Randomization was performed by using a computer-generated list maintained by a third party not involved in the conduct
of the study. The principles of salt and protein restriction were
explained to patients and their families. We recommended that
all patients limit their sodium intake to less than 7 g/d and eat
0.7 g of protein/kg of body weight daily.
CAPD patients used 1.5 to 2.5 L of dialysate per exchange
for 3 to 5 exchanges daily. The number of 2.5% dextrose
exchanges was individually adapted, usually 1 to 2 bags
daily, and continued until the desired goal was reached.
After randomization, patients were followed up monthly.
At each clinic visit, serum creatinine, electrolytes, complete
blood count, and other serum chemistries (uric acid, glucose,
and liver enzymes) were measured. Residual renal function
was assessed at 0, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months by means of
measurement of creatinine clearance (CrCl) with 24-hour
urine collection. Indices of dialysis adequacy, including
Kt/V and weekly CrCl, were calculated using the PD Adequest 2.0 computer program for Windows (Baxter Healthcare Corp, Deerfield, IL). Chest radiographs were obtained
regularly, and cardiothoracic index was calculated according
to established methods.
Eighteen patients were administered 40 to 80 mg of valsartan
daily, the dosage commonly used for patients with chronic renal
insufficiency.13,16 Sixteen patients were assigned to the control
group. Patients in the control group were administered antihypertensive agents, except ACE inhibitors and/or ARBs. When
BP control was not satisfactory, therapy with a calcium antagonist, amlodipine, 5 mg, was started. Subsequently, the dosage of
amlodipine was increased up to 20 mg/d and an 1-blocker,
doxazocin, 2 to 4 mg/d, was added until the target BP was
achieved in both groups. The BP target level was systolic BP
less than 140 mm Hg. In the case of symptomatic hypotension
or excessive BP reduction, the dose of antihypertensive agents
was reduced, except for valsartan.
Statistical Analysis
Prospective construction of sample size (  0.05, two
sided;   0.1) with a clinically significant difference in
CrCl of 1.5 mL/min (0.03 mL/s) required 18 patients in each
arm of the study. Continuous data are expressed as mean
SEM. Analyses of the effects of valsartan on longitudinal
changes in BP, residual renal function, urine volume, serum
creatinine level, Kt/V, and weekly CrCl were performed by
repeated-measures analysis of covariance, followed by Neuman-Keul’s test for evaluation of significance.
Baseline characteristics were compared between the 2
randomized groups by using chi-square tests and Wilcoxon’s
signed tests, as appropriate. P less than 0.05 is considered
significant.

patients enrolled in this study completed the
study, and no patient in either group experienced
a cardiovascular event. Three patients in the
ARB group and 4 patients in a control group had
bacterial peritonitis and were treated with 1 g/d
of cefmetazole without tobramycin. In our center, according to the guidelines, antibiotic therapy
usually is started with the use of a first-generation cephalosporin plus an aminoglycoside. However, to avoid a reduction in residual renal function, during this study, we treated all patients
with cefmetazole only. No recurrence of peritonitis was observed in participating patients.

There was no significant difference between the
2 groups.
Retrospective Analysis of Antihypertensive
Regimen
The frequencies of use of calcium antagonists
are as follows: in patients treated with valsartan,
90%; and in those with conventional therapy,
81%. Dosages of amlodipine were 8.6  3.2
mg/d for the valsartan group and 13.2  4.5
mg/d for the conventional-therapy group. Interestingly, 36% of patients in each group were
administered an 1 antagonist, and these doses
averaged approximately 3.2 mg/d.
Effects of Valsartan on Urine Volume
In the ARB group, urine volume transiently
increased from the start of valsartan therapy and
then gradually decreased toward the end of the
study (Fig 2); however, the changes were not
statistically significant. Conversely, urine volume of patients in the control group gradually
decreased toward the end of the study, and at 6,
9, 12, 18, and 24 months, there were significant
differences from basal values (P  0.01). There
also were significant differences at 6, 9, 12, 18,
and 24 months after the start of treatment with an
ARB between the 2 groups (P  0.01).
Changes in Serum Creatinine Levels After the
Start of Treatment With Valsartan
In patients treated with ARBs, serum creatinine levels significantly decreased from basal
values at 6 months (8.80  0.48 to 7.85  0.50
mg/dL [778  42 to 694  44 mol/L]) after the
start of treatment (P  0.05) and then gradually
increased toward the end of the study (8.64
0.50 mg/dL [764  44 mol/L]). Conversely, a
gradual increase in serum creatinine levels was
seen in patients in the control group, but this was
not statistically significant.
Effects of Valsartan on Weekly CrCl
CrCl increased significantly 6 months after the
start of valsartan administration (P  0.05; Fig
3), and the increased CrCl was maintained
throughout the study. However, in the control
group, CrCl did not change significantly during
the study period. At 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months
after the start of valsartan therapy, there were
significant differences between the 2 groups (P
0.05).
Effects of Valsartan on Kt/V
Changes in Kt/V during the study period mirrored changes in CrCl; however, degrees of
change were more pronounced in patients treated
with valsartan (Fig 4). Levels of significance
were higher than those observed for CrCl at each
corresponding time (P  0.01).

treatment with or without an ARB, valsartan (40 to 80 mg/d), in patients undergoing CAPD. In the ARB group, urine
volume transiently increased from the start of valsartan therapy, then gradually decreased toward the end of the
study, but these transient changes were not statistically significant. Conversely, urine volume in the control group
gradually decreased toward the end of the study, and at 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months, there were significant
differences from basal values (**P < 0.01). Also, there were significant differences at 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months after
the start of ARB treatment between the 2 groups (P < 0.01).

Serial Changes in Residual Renal Function
There was a significant, but transient, increase
in CrCl from basal values at 6 months after the
start of CAPD (P  0.05; Fig 5), after which it
gradually decreased toward the end of the study.
Conversely, in the control group, residual renal
function decreased significantly at 6 months after
the start of the study (P  0.05) and remained so
until the end of the study. There were significant
differences between the 2 groups at 6 (P  0.01),
9 (P  0.01), 12 (P  0.01), 18 (P  0.05), and
24 months (P  0.01).
Effects of Valsartan on Daily Peritoneal
Clearance
In the ARB group, peritoneal CrCl increased
suddenly and significantly at year 1 and was
maintained toward the end of the study (P
0.01; Fig 6) comparison. In the control group,
there were no significant changes in daily peritoneal clearance. There were significant differences between patients in the ARB and control
groups from year 1 to year 2 (P  0.01).
Changes in Proteinuria During the Study
There were no significant changes in urinary
excretion of protein in either group after the start
of dialysis therapy. Additionally, no significant
effects of valsartan on urinary excretion of protein
were observed. Levels of urinary protein excretion
at the start of the study were 1.02  0.13 g/d
(varsartan group) and 1.00  0.12 g/d (control
group). At the end of the study, values were
1.11  0.12 and 1.12  0.10 g/d, respectively.
DISCUSSION
The major clear finding of this study is that
treatment with valsartan preserves residual renal

patients receiving CAPD who are compromised
with hypertension. In addition, our study extends
the recent findings of Li et al,17 who were the first
to show the beneficial effects of an ACE inhibitor
on rate of residual renal function decline in
patients receiving CAPD.
Although the effect of ARBs has been studied
less extensively in hypertensive patients undergoing dialysis, recently, renoprotective and cardioprotective effects similar to those of ACE inhibitors17,18 have been observed with this class of
drug in subjects with hypertensive renal injury or
diabetes.19 It now is clearly established that ARBs

months. Residual renal CrCl transiently, but significantly, increased from basal values at 6 months after the start of
valsartan treatment (P < 0.05) and then gradually decreased toward the end of the study. Conversely, residual renal
CrCl in the control group decreased significantly at 6 months after the start of the study (P < 0.05) and remained low
until the end of the study. There were significant differences between the 2 groups at 6 (P < 0.01), 9 (P < 0.01), 12

maintained that toward the end of the study. There were significant differences between patients treated with
valsartan and those in the control group (P < 0.01) from year 1 to year 2.

afford renoprotection and cardioprotection in various cardiovascular and renal diseases.19 The
present study shows that valsartan preserves renal function in patients receiving CAPD, in agreement with previous results from the large-scale
clinical trials of reduction of time to dialysis and
transplantation.20Also, as found in previous studies, these effects of valsartan seem to be independent of BP reduction.
Reduction of BP with valsartan was equivalent to that of the control group in these patients.
However, unlike previous studies of patients
with diabetic nephropathy,20 we were unable to
show a reduction in proteinuria with valsartan in
patients receiving CAPD compared with the control group. There are several possibilities for this:
(1) with a very low glomerular filtration rate, a
different mechanism may be involved in protein
excretion; and (2) protein excretion reflects the
damage of the glomerulus, instead of hemodynamic action of the glomerulus. Similar findings
recently were reported by Li et al,17 who showed
that ramipril, an ACE inhibitor, was ineffective
in reducing proteinuria in patients receiving PD.
In our study, valsartan produced an initial
increase in residual renal function and urine
volume. This might contradict the previous findings in which initiation of the renin-angiotensin
system blockade with ACE inhibitors produced a
decline in residual GFR.21 This could relate to
differences in diet. Many patients in this study
who started dialysis therapy were instructed to
reduce salt intake. Reduction of salt intake is
known to enhance the effects of ACE inhibitors,
as well as ARBs, on renal and systemic hemodynamics.22 In the present study, one mechanism
by which residual renal CrCl was increased is
caused by a combined effect of inhibition of
angiotensin II by varsartan, reduction in salt
intake, and reduction in BP. It is not clear which
factor might contribute to be a major one. Probably, a combination is important to improve
residual renal function because no improvement
in residual CrCl was found in the control group
despite reductions in both BP and salt intake.
Recently, similar findings that ramipril reduced the rate of residual renal function decline
in patients with end-stage renal failure treated
with PD were reported by Li et al.17 Differences
between their study and ours were the drug used;
namely, an ACE inhibitor in their study and an
ARB in our study. Also, treatment duration was
for 1 year in their study and 2 years in our study.
Although our data and theirs are essentially the
same, 2 different findings should be mentioned.
They reported that the probability of anuria was
20% irrespective of treatment with an ACE inhibitor and that at the end of the study, 40% of
patients were completely anuric. In our study,
only 5% of patients treated with an ARB and 7%
without an ARB were anuric at 1 year, and 8% of
patients treated with an ARB and 10% without an
ARB became anuric at the end of the study (data
not shown). This difference might be caused by
the patients enrolled. In their study, the patients
enrolled were not patients just starting on CAPD
therapy, but they had residual renal function. In
our kidney disease center, patients were encouraged to ingest a low-protein diet (0.6 to 7 g/kg/
d), even after the start of dialysis therapy with
CAPD. This might have contributed to the maintenance of residual renal function in patients of
both groups. However, because the effects of
protein restriction on progression of chronic kidney disease remain controversial,23 it cannot be
concluded that a low-protein diet might be effective for maintaining residual renal function at
present.
Kt/V and weekly CrCl of patients in the control group were marginally less than 1.7 and
more than 50 L/wk/1.73 m2, considered to be the
absolute minimal targets, respectively.24 Kt/V
and weekly CrCl of patients treated with the
ARB showed greater values at more than 2.0 and
60 L/wk/1.7 m2, which are the targets defined by
the National Kidney Foundation–Dialysis Outcomes Quality Initiative guidelines, respectively.25 This difference might be caused by the
more frequent use of 2.5% glucose peritoneal
solution for draining water from the peritoneum
in patients in the control group compared with
those treated with valsartan. It remains uncertain
whether more frequent use of 2.5% glucose peritoneal solutions in the control group produced a
decrease in peritoneal transport variables.26 During the study, some patients in the control group
restricted water intake instead of more frequent
use of 2.5% glucose solution. From these findings, we propose that treatment with an ARB
combined with a relatively low-protein diet might
be beneficial for new patients receiving CAPD.
In addition to preservation of residual renal
1062 SUZUKI ET AL
function for a longer time, it is important to
conserve the integrity of the peritoneal membrane, which likely will result in better treatment
of patients undergoing CAPD, with improved
outcomes and longevity.24 Several factors, such
as episodes of infection, inflammation, and use
of a high concentration of glucose solution, contribute to changes in the mesothelial layer, resulting in fibrosis.27 Recently, several lines of evidence suggested that angiotensin II has an
important role in the development of fibrosis in
the kidneys and heart,28 although it is uncertain
whether angiotensin II is involved directly or
indirectly in the process of fibrosis of the peritoneum in patients on CAPD therapy. ARBs appear
to ameliorate the development of fibrosis and
increase peritoneal transport in these patients.
Moreover, it is likely that the work of Duman et
al29 on the effect of angiotensin II inhibition on
peritoneal transforming growth factor- production and peritoneal fibrosis support the results of
this study. It therefore is suggested that blockade
of the renin-angiotensin system produces an increase in peritoneal transport of solutes in CAPD
patients.
Studies that compared ARBs and ACE inhibitors in patients with renal diseases have been
limited, as have reports on effects of reduction of
proteinuria30 and prevention of progression of
chronic kidney diseases, although a differential
action between ACE inhibitors and ARBs relative to the formation of kinin have been proposed.14 However, because ARBs are reported to
increase serum potassium levels less and be
better tolerated than ACE inhibitors,16 ARBs are
likely to be a better choice for first-line treatment
for new patients receiving CAPD.
Several shortcomings of the present study
should be considered. First, the study was small
and neither placebo controlled nor double blinded.
Second, transport characteristics, the most widely
used criteria to assess important outcome measures in CAPD patients, were not assessed before
the start of the study. Last, a longer period might
be needed to evaluate the effects of residual renal
function on mortality and morbidity of new patients receiving CAPD. Therefore, results presented here should be regarded as preliminary;
longer and larger clinical trials are desirable to
confirm the findings.
In conclusion, this study shows that in patients
starting CAPD with hypertension, an ARB, valsartan, slows the decline in residual renal function and contributes to the maintenance of weekly
CrCl and Kt/V, which are the major factors
contributing to the mortality and morbidity of
CAPD patients.
