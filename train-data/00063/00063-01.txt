ACUTE OTITIS MEDIA (AOM) IS
the most common childhood infection for which antibiotics are prescribed in the
United States.1-3 A study using 2006
Medical Expenditure Panel Survey data
demonstrated an average expenditure
of $350 per child with AOM, totaling
$2.8 billion.4 Timely and accurate diagnosis and appropriate management
of AOM may have significant consequences for ambulatory health care utilization and expenditures.
Multiple systematic reviews on AOM
diagnosis and management have been
conducted,5-10 including our 2001
study,11 which was the basis for the
2004 American Academy of Pediatrics
and American Academy of Family Physicians joint practice guidelines.12 Since
then, new trials have been published,
the heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) has become widely
used, and clinician practice has changed
regarding antibiotic choice for AOM.13
Context Acute otitis media (AOM) is the most common condition for which antibiotics are prescribed for US children; however, wide variation exists in diagnosis and
treatment.
Objectives To perform a systematic review on AOM diagnosis, treatment, and the
association of heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) use with AOM
microbiology.
Data Sources PubMed, Cochrane Databases, and Web of Science, searched to identify articles published from January 1999 through July 2010.
Study Selection Diagnostic studies with a criterion standard, observational studies
and randomized controlled trials comparing AOM microbiology with and without PCV7,
and randomized controlled trials assessing antibiotic treatment.
Data Extraction Independent article review and study quality assessment by 2 investigators with consensus resolution of discrepancies.
Results Of 8945 citations screened, 135 were included. Meta-analysis was performed
for comparisons with 3 or more trials. Few studies examined diagnosis; otoscopic findings
oftympanicmembranebulging(positivelikelihoodratio,51[95%confidenceinterval{CI},
36-73]) and redness (positive likelihood ratio, 8.4 [95% CI, 7-11]) were associated with
accurate diagnosis. In the few available studies, prevalence of Streptococcus pneumoniae
decreased (eg, 33%-48% vs 23%-31% of AOM isolates), while that of Haemophilus
influenzae increased (41%-43% vs 56%-57%) pre- vs post-PCV7. Short-term clinical
success was higher for immediate use of ampicillin or amoxicillin vs placebo (73% vs 60%;
pooled rate difference, 12% [95% CI, 5%-18%]; number needed to treat, 9 [95% CI,
6-20]),whileincreasingtherateofrashordiarrheaby3%to5%.Twoof4studiesshowed
greater clinical success for immediate vs delayed antibiotics (95% vs 80%; rate difference,
15% [95% CI, 6%-24%] and 86% vs 70%; rate difference, 16% [95% CI, 6%-26%]).
Data are absent on long-term effects on antimicrobial resistance. Meta-analyses in general showed no significant differences in antibiotic comparative effectiveness.
Conclusions Otoscopic findings are critical to accurate AOM diagnosis. AOM microbiology has changed with use of PCV7. Antibiotics are modestly more effective than
no treatment but cause adverse effects in 4% to 10% of children. Most antibiotics
have comparable clinical success.

In light of these additional studies
and practice changes, we conducted a
systematic review to support the new
AOM practice guidelines (currently in
preparation) from the American Academy of Pediatrics. We report on the evidence for (1) the precision and accuracy of AOM diagnosis, (2) the
association of PCV7 use with changes
in AOM microbial epidemiology, (3)
the decision about whether to treat with
antibiotics, and (4) the comparative effectiveness of different antibiotics for
uncomplicated AOM in average-risk
children and associated antibioticrelated adverse events.
METHODS
Literature Search and Study
Selection
We searched PubMed, the Cochrane
Controlled Clinical Trials Register Database, the Cochrane Database of Reviews of Effectiveness, and the Web of
Science for articles published January
1999 through July 2010 on AOM diagnosis, treatment outcomes, and association of PCV7 use with changes in
AOM microbiology using Medical Subject Headings terms (eg, otitis media,
vaccines), key words (eg, diagnostic, microbiology, therapy), and individual antibiotic terms. This search supplemented a previous January 1966
through March 1999 search with additional key words for PCV7 and newer
antibiotics.11 We performed reference
mining of relevant systematic reviews.
We included articles in any language that studied children aged 4
weeks to 18 years. We excluded studies on children with immunodeficiencies and craniofacial anomalies. Systematic reviews, randomized controlled
trials (RCTs), controlled clinical trials,
and observational studies were included in the initial search; case reports, clinical overviews, editorials, and
practice guidelines were excluded.
Observational studies were considered for the PCV7 and diagnostic questions but excluded for the treatment
question. For the PCV7 question, only
articles that assessed AOM microbiology (using middle ear fluid) both before and after PCV7 implementation
were included. For the diagnostic question, we considered studies of children that performed independent comparisons of signs or symptoms with a
clear criterion standard; studies using
clinicians in training were excluded. For
the antibiotic comparative effectiveness question, only studies that examined clinical improvement as an outcome (not just microbiologic findings)
were included. The search strategy and
inclusion/exclusion criteria are detailed elsewhere.14
Data Abstraction
Two investigators (T.R.C., M.A.L.)
independently reviewed titles and
abstracts for potentially relevant
articles. They then independently
abstracted data from the full-text
articles using structured review forms
that included inclusion/exclusion criteria, outcome measures, and study
quality. Disagreements were resolved
by consensus; the principal investigators (P.G.S., G.S.T.) resolved remaining disagreements. The study biostatistician abstracted data (verified by a
clinician investigator) for pooled
analyses. One investigator independently abstracted treatment-related
adverse event data.
Quality Assessment
We used the Jadad criteria to assess RCT
quality,15 AMSTAR16 to assess systematic review quality, and QUADAS17 to
assess diagnostic study quality.
Data Synthesis
For diagnostic studies, we report summary data, including sensitivities and
specificities, when available. The number of studies was insufficient to allow
pooling of data across studies. Furthermore, the criterion standards for the diagnostic studies varied widely.
For studies examining the association between PCV7 use and changes in
AOM microbial epidemiology, we report summary data; the studies were too
few in number and lacked enough consistency across study design and population for pooled analysis.
For treatment studies, an adequate
number of articles was identified for
pooled analyses of some comparisons.
Comparisons were grouped by individual antibiotics rather than by antibiotic class to maximize the clinical relevance of our findings. The only a priori
exception was to group ampicillin with
amoxicillin because of similarity. When
3 or more articles examined the same
comparison, we used the DerSimonian and Laird random-effects model
to pool rate differences across studies.18 Sensitivity analysis was performed for pooled significant findings.
For pooled estimates, we report the
I
2 statistic and P value for the 2 test of
heterogeneity, which tests the null hypothesis that individual study results are
homogeneous.19,20 I
2 values near 100%
represent high degrees of heterogeneity. For assessment of publication bias
in our pooled analyses, we report the
Egger asymmetry test.
We used Stata version 10.0 to perform the meta-analyses.21 The study received a waiver of institutional review
board review from the RAND Human
Subjects Protection Committee.
RESULTS
The literature searches and reference
mining yielded 8945 titles. After removal of duplicates and clearly irrelevant titles, 738 went for further review. After 2 rounds of screening, 55
articles were accepted and combined
with 80 articles identified from the 2001
systematic review.11 These included 4
articles (3 research articles plus 1 systematic review) on diagnosis, 6 on
PCV7-microbiology, and 125 on antibiotic treatment (FIGURE 1).
AOM Diagnosis
In clinical practice, 3 criteria are used
to diagnose AOM: (1) acute symptoms of infection, (2) evidence of
middle ear inflammation, and (3) presence of middle ear effusion (MEE).12
Published research focuses on what
constitutes acute symptoms of infection and what physical findings are associated with middle ear inflammation or effusion. A challenge with

interpreting this research is the lack of
a consistent gold standard, which varied from otolaryngologist-made diagnosis to tympanocentesis.
We identified 1 systematic review5
and 3 additional studies22-24 that addressed the question of diagnostic accuracy and precision in identifying any
or all of the 3 criteria. Detailed data on
these studies are available in our evidence report14; findings suggest that certain otoscopic signs are strongly associated with AOM, while data on the
importance of symptoms as a predictor of AOM are less convincing.
Symptoms. A 2003 review by Rothman et al5 found that ear pain (sensitivities: 54%, 60%, 100%; specificities:
82% and 92%; positive likelihood ratio
[LR], 3.0 [95% confidence interval {CI},
2.1 to 4.3]; positive LR, 7.3 [95% CI,
4.4 to 12.1]) and ear rubbing (sensitivity:42%;specificity:87%;positiveLR,
3.3 [95% CI, 2.1 to 5.1]) were modestly associated with AOM diagnosis.
The review by Rothman et al included
4 studies examining specific symptoms among 965 total participants.25-28
In 2 of the studies, participants were
recruited from otolaryngology practices and may not be representative of
the general population of children with
AOM. A more recent single study found
that among 469 children aged 6 to 36
months presenting to primary care
offices with parent-suspected AOM,
AOM diagnosis was not associated with
occurrence, duration, or severity of parent-reported symptoms (eg, ear rubbing, ear pain, fever).24
Otoscopic Signs. One study29 examined in the review by Rothman et al assessed the association of otoscopic findings of middle ear inflammation
(redness: positive LR, 8.4 [95% CI, 7
to 11]) and effusion (cloudy: positive
LR, 34 [95% CI, 28 to 42]; bulging:
positive LR, 51 [95% CI, 36 to 73]; immobile: positive LR, 31 [95% CI, 26 to
37]) with AOM (determined by clinical symptoms and the presence of MEE
on tympanocentesis).5
A study published subsequently to the
review by Rothman et al examined the
accuracy of tympanometric (evaluation of middle ear function by measurement of acoustic impedence) and otoscopic findings compared with
tympanocentesis as the criterion standard to determine the presence of MEE.
Among children with MEE on tympanocentesis, 97% had type B (abnormal) tympanometry results, and 100%
had otoscopic examination findings
consistent with AOM. These results
may overestimate the accuracy of tympanometry, because the investigators performing otoscopy were not blinded to
the tympanometry results, and the criterion standard of tympanocentesis was
performed only when otoscopic or tympanometric findings suggested MEE.22
In another study subsequent to the
review by Rothman et al, 22% of
AOM cases diagnosed by a general
practitioner were concurrently diagnosed by an otolaryngologist as otitis
media with effusion, viral otitis, or a
normal tympanic membrane.23
PCV7 and AOM Microbial
Epidemiology
Six studies examined the association
between PCV7 use and changes in
AOM microbial epidemiology
(TABLE). These studies fit into 2 categories: observational studies of AOM
isolates both before and after the 2000
licensure of PCV7 and PCV7 efficacy

RCTs examining AOM-related
organisms.
Most studies found that Haemophilus influenzae became more prevalent
as an AOM isolate and that Streptococcus pneumoniae became less prevalent
although it remained important.30,31,33
In an observational study of children
with persistent AOM or AOM with
treatment failure, the proportion of
S pneumoniae MEE isolates decreased
(from 44% in 1998-2000 to 31% in
2001-2003, P=.02), while the proportion of H influenzae isolates increased

2001-2003, P=.01).30 Another study
found an increase (as a proportion of
all S pneumoniae isolates) in nonvaccine serotype S pneumoniae and a decrease in vaccine serotype S pneumoniae (non-PCV7 S pneumoniae: from
12% in 1999 to 32% in 2002, P.01).32
In a vaccine-efficacy RCT, investigators found a greater proportion of
S pneumoniae isolates in the control
group (33%) than in the PCV7 group
(23%) (P.001).34 It is important to
note that study findings did not always reach statistical significance, and
most studies focused on patients with
severe or persistent AOM.
Antibiotics for Uncomplicated AOM
One hundred twenty-five articles compared the effectiveness of antibiotic
treatment options in uncomplicated
AOM. Older articles that examined antibiotics no longer typically used for
AOM are not discussed here but are included in the evidence reports.14,36
Benefits of Antibiotic Treatment
Evidence about the benefits of treating with antibiotics comes from 2 types
of studies: placebo-controlled studies
of immediate use of antibiotics and
studies comparing immediate use of antibiotics with a strategy of observation
with possible delayed treatment (“waitand-see” or “prescription-to-hold”).
Ampicillin or Amoxicillin vs Placebo
We identified 8 studies that compared
ampicillin or amoxicillin with placebo. One did not report clinical success (only pain resolution) and was not
included in the pooled analysis.37
In pooled analysis of the remaining
7 RCTs, the random-effects pooled rate
difference for success by day 14 was estimated at 12% (95% CI, 5% to 18%),
with a 73% success rate for ampicillin/
amoxicillin and a 60% success rate for
placebo. The number needed to treat
(NNT) for clinical success was 9 (95%
CI, 6 to 20) (eTable 1 [available at http:
//www.jama.com] and FIGURE 2). The
more recent, higher-quality studies reported smaller benefits. The I
2 statistic was 69% (P=.04 by 2 test of heterogeneity), indicating the presence of
unexplained heterogeneity, which
could be attributable to differences in
the populations studied, research methods used, or both. The Egger test did
not suggest publication bias (P=.77).
In sensitivity analyses, we excluded
an outlier38 because its 95% CI favored
placebo far more strongly than any other
individual study. The pooled analysis
with the remaining 6 articles yielded
rates of 70% vs 54% (pooled rate difference, 13% [95% CI, 8% to 19%]), with
7 children (95% CI, 5 to 12) needing
treatment with ampicillin/amoxicillin to
gain a case of clinical success (I
2=62%,
P=.09; P=.18 by Egger test).39-44 When
we pooled the 4 studies with a quality
score of 3 or more (of 5), excluding the
outlier, the rates were 76% vs 67%
(pooled rate difference, 10% [95% CI,
6% to 14%]), and the NNT was 10 (95%
CI, 7 to 18), without evidence of heterogeneity (I
2=0.0%, P=.48) or publication bias (P=.26).41,43,44
Other Antibiotics vs Placebo
We identified 5 studies that compared
other antibiotics with placebo (eTable
1), but they are not included in pooled
analysis because we examined the overall benefit of antibiotics more commonly prescribed for AOM (ie, amoxicillin) over placebo.
Immediate vs Delayed Antibiotics
We identified 4 studies of delayed treatment approaches; 2 reported higher
rates of clinical success with immediate compared with delayed use of antibiotics,45,46 and 2 found no difference.47,48 One article reported rates of
95% vs 80% (rate difference, 15% [95%
CI, 6% to 24%]; NNT, 7 [95% CI, 4 to
17]) favoring amoxicillin over the
wait-and-see approach for parentperceived success at day 12,49 whereas
the other reported rates of 86% vs 70%
(rate difference, 16% [95% CI, 6% to
26%]; NNT, 6 [95% CI, 4 to 17]), also
favoring amoxicillin over the prescription-to-hold approach for parentperceived clinical success at day 3.45
Thirty-four percent46 and 24%46 of participants in the delayed antibiotic
groups in these studies received delayed antibiotics, respectively.

while 2 individual studies had a rate difference of 4% (4% vs 0%) and 3% (8%
vs 5%) for rash39,41; these differences did
not reach statistical significance. These
point estimates are compatible with
published estimates of the rate of rash
(3%-10%) and diarrhea (5%-10%).50-53
In the studies by Little et al45 and Spiro
et al,47 the rate of diarrhea was higher
for the antibiotic group than for the prescription-to-hold group (19% vs 9%;
rate difference, 10% [95% CI, 2% to
18%] and 23% vs 8%; rate difference,
14% [95% CI, 6% to 22%] for the 2
studies, respectively), with a number
needed to harm (NNH) of 10 (95% CI,
6 to 50) and 7 (95% CI, 5 to 17),
respectively.45,47
McCormick et al49 reported no difference in the rate of antibioticrelated adverse events, and Neumark et
al48 did not examine adverse events. In
RCTs comparing amoxicillin with other
antibiotics, the proportion of amoxicillin-treated children reporting rash
ranged from 2% to 11% and the proportion reporting diarrhea ranged from
3% to 16%.54-60
Long-term Harms
of Antibiotic Treatment
None of the studies evaluated the rates
of longer-term adverse effects of immediate antibiotic treatment, including antibiotic resistance.
Antibiotic Comparative
Effectiveness
eTable 2 describes selected antibiotic
comparative effectiveness studies and
pooled analyses for comparisons examining 3 or more studies. The Egger
test was not suggestive of publication
bias for any of the pooled analyses.
The success rate differences were statistically nonsignificant in the pooled
analyses comparing ampicillin/
amoxicillin vs ceftriaxone (4 trials,
I
2=50.7%), ampicillin/amoxicillin vs cefixime (4 trials, I
2=22.9%), ampicillin/
amoxicillin vs cefaclor (4 trials,
I
2=13.0%), amoxicillin-clavulanate vs
ceftriaxone (5 trials, I
2=22.9%), cefaclor vs azithromycin (3 trials, I
2=0%),
and amoxicillin-clavulanate vs 5 days
of azithromycin (5 trials,I
2=62.2%) and
vs 3 or fewer days of azithromycin (7
trials, I
2=84.1%).
Statistically significant differences between treatment regimens were found in
a few individual studies. Amoxicillinclavulanate was superior to cefaclor (97%
vs 84%; rate difference, 13% [95% CI, 5%
to 21%])61; 10 days of amoxicillinclavulanate was superior to 5 days of
azithromycin (86% vs 70%; rate difference, 16% [95% CI, 2% to 30%])62; 5 days
of amoxicillin-clavulanate was not as effective as 7 to 10 days (77% vs 88%; rate
difference, −11% [95% CI, −20% to −3%]
in the study by Cohen et al63 and 71%
vs 87%; rate difference, −16% [95% CI,
−24% to −8%] in the study by Hoberman et al64); and 5 days of ceftibuten was
not as effective as 10 days of ceftibuten
(78% vs 98%; rate difference, −20% [95%
CI, −28% to −12%]).65
Antibiotic-Related Adverse Events
In the pooled comparisons, use of ampicillin/amoxicillin resulted in a lower
rate of diarrhea than cefixime (14% vs
21%; rate difference, −8% [95% CI,
−13% to −4%]; NNH, 12 [95% CI, 8 to
25]; I
2=0%), and use of amoxicillinclavulanate resulted in a higher rate of
diarrhea than 1 dose of ceftriaxone
(20% vs 9%; rate difference, 11% [95%
CI, 7% to 16%]; NNH, 9 [95% CI, 6 to
15]; I
2=10.8%) and higher rates of any
adverse event compared with 5 days of
azithromycin (26% vs 9%; rate difference, 16% [95% CI, 7% to 25%]; NNH,
6 [95% CI, 4 to 14]; I
2=81.9%).
COMMENT
We identified several important findings for AOM diagnosis, microbiology, and antibiotic management.
Acute otitis media is a clinical diagnosis with 3 components: acute signs
of infection, evidence of middle ear
inflammation, and effusion.12 Evidence suggests that certain otoscopic
findings (ie, a red and immobile or
bulging tympanic membrane) predict
AOM, but the accuracy or precision of
a clinical diagnosis has not been
determined. A major limitation to the
evidence regarding diagnosis is the
lack of a gold standard. The diagnostic tools studied (eg, otoscopy) are
often part of the only available gold
standard—a clinical diagnosis. Perhaps the most important way to
improve diagnosis is to increase clinicians’ ability to recognize and rely on
key otoscopic findings.
Since the introduction of PCV7,
there have been significant shifts in
AOM microbiology, with S pneumoniae becoming less prevalent and H
influenzae becoming more prevalent.
A recent study of a single pediatric
practice found evidence suggesting
that this balance may be shifting
again because of an increase in the
proportion of AOM with nonvaccine
S pneumoniae serotypes.66 These data
and the introduction of PCV13 support the need for ongoing surveillance of AOM isolates.
Immediate ampicillin/amoxicillin
treatment has a modest benefit compared with placebo or delayed antibiotics but also may be associated with
more diarrhea and rash. Of 100 averagerisk children with AOM, approximately 80 would likely get better within
about 3 days without antibiotics.67 If all
were treated with immediate ampicillin/
amoxicillin, an additional 12 would
likely improve, but 3 to 10 children
would develop rash and 5 to 10 would
develop diarrhea. Clinicians need to
weigh these risks (including possible
long-term effects on antibiotic resistance) and benefits before prescribing
immediate antibiotics for uncomplicated AOM.
Most antibiotics used to treat uncomplicated AOM in children at normal risk have similar rates of clinical
success; we found no evidence of the

superiority of any other antibiotic over
amoxicillin.
In most cases of uncomplicated AOM
when amoxicillin is appropriate (eg, excluding children with penicillin allergy and those who previously did not
improve after a course of amoxicillin),
there is no evidence for first-line use of
higher-cost antibiotics (eg, cefdinir, cefixime). For a 20-kg child with AOM,
a 7-day course of cefdinir costs approximately $96, compared with $34 for an
equivalent course of amoxicillin (pricing information available at http://www
.drugstore.com). In an analysis of data
from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, among visits for AOM
(visits for a new problem without additional diagnoses requiring antibiotic therapy), amoxicillin was prescribed in 49%, amoxicillin-clavulanate
in 16%, cefdinir in 14%, and other
cephalosporins in 6%.13 If just half of
the 14% of the estimated 8 million children who visit a physician for AOM annually4 were to receive amoxicillin instead of cefdinir (assuming the other
half were appropriately prescribed cefdinir because of a non–type-1 penicillin allergy), the estimated annual savings would exceed $34 million. This
estimate does not account for potential additional savings from adopting a
less aggressive approach to antibiotic
prescribing that might avoid a certain
number of prescriptions altogether.
This review has several limitations
that must be considered. First, article
screening and data abstraction were not
blinded, which may potentially introduce bias. However, there is evidence
that blinding does not alter the results
of meta-analyses.68 Second, we may not
have identified some relevant evidence. For example, we did not search
EMBASE or seek unpublished data. We
used statistical tools to detect publication bias but found no evidence of it in
our pooled analyses. Additionally, our
findings on diagnosis and microbiology are greatly limited by the small
number of studies; thus, caution should
be used in interpreting our findings for
these topics. To account for variation
in study quality, we performed sensitivity analyses that pooled only highquality studies. Third, the studies varied widely in their definitions of clinical
success and in AOM diagnostic criteria. Some studies that did not use all 3
AOM diagnostic criteria may have included participants without AOM but
with otitis media with effusion or no
middle-ear abnormality at all.69,70 Lastly,
our pooled analyses included studies
completed before and after the licensing of PCV7. It is not clear how the
changing microbiology of AOM may
have influenced study findings; the
heterogeneity of AOM over the past 20
years might favor an analysis that does
not include pooling data from studies
before and after 2000.69
One remaining question is what new
evidence about antibiotic comparative
effectiveness is needed. It is not enough
to show statistical significance or lack
thereof; the clinical importance of any
difference must also be considered. This
requires knowing the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for
treatment of AOM. Although there currently is no agreed-on value for the
MCID, assuming an MCID of 5% (representing a “small” effect size, according to Cohen’s classification71) means
that when existing evidence falls entirely within or outside of this MCID,
equivalence or significance can be concluded; when it does not, it can be concluded that more information is needed.
Using this definition, we can conclude equivalence for 2 of the 8 pooled
analyses in eTable 2 and that effects are
inconclusive for the remaining 6. The
MCID has important implications for
our conclusions; for example, in contrast to a previous systematic review,7
we are unable to make definitive conclusions regarding the equivalency of
short- vs long-term regimens analyzed by antibiotic when considering an
MCID of 5%, except for 7 to 10 days
of cefaclor vs 3 days of azithromycin.
To account for both statistical and
clinical significance, sample sizes for
AOM comparative effectiveness studies need to be large. Because approximately 80% of AOM cases resolve spontaneously,67 most RCTs will be able to
test superiority of different antibiotics
with only the remaining 20%. If the success rate is 88% for the treatment group
and 80% for the control group, a sample
size of 1150 per group would provide
a 95% CI of the difference of 5% to 11%,
which is outside the ±5% MCID; this
sample size is much larger than that of
any published AOM comparative effectiveness study.
CONCLUSIONS
We found evidence to guide the diagnosis and management of AOM in children; however, further research is
needed that (1) examines clinicians’ diagnostic accuracy and precision using
the 3 AOM diagnostic criteria; (2) continues surveillance of AOM microbiology, especially in view of the newly approved PCV13; and (3) produces more
high-quality studies on AOM management that include clear diagnostic criteria, a better-defined menu of clinical
success measures that are universally
applied, and more investigation into the
comparative antibiotic-related adverse event rates that assesses whether
any antibiotic regimen is superior to
amoxicillin.

The educator is like a good gardener, whose function is to make available healthy, fertile soil in which
a young plant can grow strong roots; through these it
will extract the nutrients it requires. The young plant
will develop in accordance with its own laws of being,
which are far more subtle than any human can fathom,
and will develop best when it has the greatest possible freedom to choose exactly the nutrients it needs.
