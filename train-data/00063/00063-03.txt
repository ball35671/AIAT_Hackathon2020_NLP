ABSTRACT
Background. Residual renal function (RRF) is an important
determinant of mortality and morbidity in patients receiving
peritoneal dialysis (PD). Recent studies have shown a positive
effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and
angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) on RRF in PD patients. Objective. To compare enalapril and losartan for RRF
preservation in automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) patients.
Material and methods. An open label randomized controlled trial (RCT) with a 12 month follow-up period was conducted to compare the effect of enalapril vs. losartan on RRF
preservation in 60 APD patients. Measurements were done at
the start of the study (baseline), 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. A historical control group (HCG) without treatment was included
to assess the natural history of RRF loss. Results. RRF in the
enalapril group dropped from 3.65 ± 1.6 (baseline) to 2.36 ±
0.38 mL/min/l.73 m2 (12 months). In the losartan group RRF
was reduced from 4.1± 2.01 (baseline) to 2.54 ± 0.47 mL/min/
l.73m2 (12 months). There were not significant differences
between the two groups regarding RRF at 12 months. In the
HCG, RRF declined from 3.68 ± 0.48 to 1.4± 0.29 mL/min/
1.73m2 (12 months). RRF in the HCG was significantly lower
than RRF in the two treated groups at 12 months (P < 0.05).
Conclusions. There was not significant difference on RRF
preservation between enalapril and losartan groups. Comparing these results to those of the HCG suggests that the treatment with any of the drugs is useful in preserving RRF.

RESUMEN
Antecedentes. La función renal residual (FRR) es una determinante importante de mortalidad y morbilidad en pacientes
tratados con diálisis peritoneal (DP). En estudios recientes se
mostró un efecto positivo de los inhibidores de la enzima conversora de angiotensina (IECA) y de los antagonistas de los receptores de angiotensina II (ARA II) en la FRR en pacientes en
DP. Objetivo. Comparar enalapril y losartán en la preservación de la FRR en pacientes en diálisis peritoneal automatizada
(DPA). Material y métodos. Se hizo un estudio clínico aleatorizado (ECA) con periodo de seguimiento de 12 meses para
comparar el efecto de enalapril vs. losartán en 60 pacientes en
DPA. Las mediciones se hicieron al inicio del estudio, a los
tres, seis, nueve y 12 meses. Se incluyó un grupo control histórico (GCH) sin tratamiento para valorar la evolución natural de
la pérdida de la FRR. Resultados. En el grupo de enalapril la
FRR se redujo de 3.65 ± 1.6 (basal) a 2.36 ± 0.38 mL/min/1.73
m2 (12 meses). En el grupo de losartán la FRR disminuyó de
4.1 ± 2.01 (basal) a 2.54 ± 0.47 mL/min/1.73m2 (12 meses). No
hubo diferencias significativas entre los dos grupos en la FRR
basal ni a los 12 meses. En el GCH la FRR disminuyó de 3.68 ±
0.48 (basal) a 1.4 ± 0.29 mL/min por 1.73 m2 (12 meses). La
FRR en el GCH a los 12 meses es significativamente menor que
la FRR en los dos grupos tratados (p < 0.05). Conclusiones.
No hubo diferencia significativa en la preservación de la FRR
entre los grupos de enalapril y losartán. La comparación de estos resultados con los del GCH sugiere que el tratamiento con
cualquiera de los dos fármacos es útil para preservar la FRR en
pacientes en DPA.

INTRODUCTION
Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi)
and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are recommended in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients for
hypertension or heart failure control.1-3 Angiotensin
II (AII) is an important factor in the development of
renal fibrosis due to its hemodynamic effects on glomeruli and stimulation of extracellular matrix proteins synthesis, mediated by transforming growth
factor-beta (TGFβ).4-7 This may explain why treatment with ACEi and ARBs is renoprotective in
patients with diabetic and non diabetic nephropathy.8-12
Treatment with ACEi and ARBs has been shown
to be associated with decreased risk of residual renal
function (RRF) decline in PD patients. The use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) blockade
was independently associated with a 32% decrease in
the development of anuria in patients with chronic
kidney disease (CKD) irrespective of the dialysis modality.13 A 70% decrease in mortality of PD patients
treated with either ACEi or ARBs therapy has been
shown.14 It is tempting to speculate that the improved survival may have been related, at least in part,
to preservation of RRF by the use of these agents.
It was shown that ramipril reduced the rate of
RRF decline and delayed the development of complete anuria in prevalent continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients after 12 months.
Average RRF declined 2.07 mL/min per 1.73 m2. The
difference between the average changes in RRF in
the groups from baseline to 12 months was 0.93 mL/
min per 1.73 m2 (95% CI 0.09 to 1.78 mL/min per
1.73 m2).15 Another approach to inhibiting the
RAAS is ARBs administration. It was demonstrated
that RRF and daily urine volume were significantly
better preserved in CAPD patients on valsartan (4.3
± 0.7 to 3.4 ± 0.3 mL/min/1.73m2) as compared to
controls (5.9 ± 0.5 to 2.8 ± 0.4 mL/min/1.73m2).16
Although these two studies were small, they showed
that drugs with renoprotective effects continue to
exert benefits in patients with stage 1-4 CKD and
slow the progression to anuria in stage 5 CKD patients on dialysis and thus should be continued in
all patients in DP with RRF.17
Recently the time course of decline of RRF in 452
incident non anuric PD patients was followed-up for
3 years after the start of dialysis; one group of patients received ACEi/ARBs and the other was the
control group. In contrast with previously published
information, the time course of decline of RRF was
not different between the 2 groups over the 3 years
of PD treatment.18
In order to compare enalapril and losartan efficacy for RRF preservation in automated peritoneal
dialysis (APD) patients, we conducted a randomized
clinical trial (RCT) with a 1-year follow-up period.
Unlike previously reported studies, our objective
was to compare two good pharmacological options
for RRF preservation in APD patients. We included
a historical control group (HCG) of 30 patients in
APD, in order to assess the natural history of RRF
loss in 12 months without treatment.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
A prospective, open label, RCT was conducted. Sixty patients with APD as the initial renal replacement
therapy for at least 1 year and RRF of at least 2 mL/
min/1.73 m2 were selected. Patients with infectious
systemic disease, recurrent peritonitis, severe malnutrition, intolerance to ACEi or ARBs, and underlying
medical conditions such as congestive heart failure,
myocardial infarction, malignant hypertension and
stroke within the preceding 6 months, were excluded.
Patients were randomly assigned to one of the
two arms of the study. Assignment was in a 1:1
ratio by a computer generated list. After randomization, patients in one arm received ACEi (enalapril 10
mg/day), and those in the other arm ARBs (losartan
50 mg/day). RRF was measured as the mean of creatinine and urea clearances using 24 h urine collection and expressed as mL/min per 1.73 m2. RRF was
measured 5 times, at baseline, 3, 6, 9 and 12
months. At the time of enrollment all the patients
had hematic count, glucose, blood urea nitrogen,
creatinine, serum electrolytes (Na, K, Ca and P),
peritoneal Kt/V and peritoneal creatinine clearance.
Sample size was calculated to test the hypothesis
of a 2 mL/min/1.73 m2 difference in RRF between the
two arms favoring the enalapril arm,15 a total standard deviation of 2.5, two sided α = 0.05 and power
(1-β) = 0.80. The calculated sample size was 30 patients per group (Power & sample size calculations.
v 2.1.31 NJ, USA).
All the studied patients signed an informed written consent. The participating patients were recruited from the Hospital General ISSEMYM, in
Naucalpan, Mexico. The Hospital’s Clinical Research
and Ethical Committee approved the study. On the
basis of the sample size estimate, 60 stable patients
receiving APD were included. Antihypertensive
agents other than ACEi and ARBs were allowed.
Doses were adjusted appropriately to achieve and
maintain a 130/85 mm Hg target blood pressure.
After randomization, patients were followed at 0, 3,
Reyes-Marín FA, et al. Enalapril vs. losartan on residual renal function preservation. Rev Invest Clin Inv t 2012; 64 (4): 315-321 317
6, 9 and 12 months and RRF was measured at these
times. A HCG of 30 patients in APD, was included
in order to assess the natural history of RRF loss in
12 months without treatment.
The primary outcome measures were the longitudinal change in RRF and the time to anuria. Anuria
was defined as total absence of urine output. Secondary outcome measures included peritonitis, duration of hospitalization for any cause, drug
effects, cardiovascular events, nonfatal myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular events with permanent neurologic deficit and peripheral vascular
disease requiring lower limb amputation above the
ankle. Patients were asked open-ended questions
about adverse events at each clinic visit.
Statistics
Data are presented as mean and standard deviation for continuous variables and as proportions
for categorical variables. The analysis of the effect
of enalapril and losartan on longitudinal changes in
RRF and differences between the two groups were
done by repeated measures of analysis of variance
(ANOVA). The differences of RRF among the three
groups were done by one way ANOVA. KaplanMeier estimator was used to analyze the probability
of developing anuria in both groups. Chi-square test
was used to analyze differences in hospitalizations
and peritonitis. Statistical analyzes were done with
SPSS v14 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). A p value
of 0.05 or less was considered to be statistically significant.
RESULTS
Thirty patients were enrolled in each group; their
baseline clinical characteristics are shown in table
1. There were not statistically significant differences
in male: female ratio, age, weight, and height

between the groups. Blood pressure at baseline and
the cause of CKD were not different between the
groups. There were similar numbers of diabetic
patients in the two groups. The baseline laboratory
tests results were similar in both groups (Table 1).
The 30 patients in HCG had 48 ± 7.2 years, gender:
12 women/18 men and the time in dialysis was 1.7 ±
0.5 years, similar clinical characteristics with the
other two groups (p > 0.05).
Baseline renal function and dialysis adequacy indexes are shown in table 1. The two groups showed
similar result of PD adequacy, including Kt/V, ultrafiltration rate and weekly creatinine clearance.
RRF gradually declined during the study period in
both groups (Figure 1). RRF was similar at baseline
in both groups, 3.65 ± 1.6 in the enalapril group
and 4.1 ± 2.01 mL/min/1.73 m2 in the losartan
group (ns). At 6 months, RRF was 3.0 ± 0.5 in the
enalapril group and 3.14 ± 1.6 mL/min/1.73 m2 in
the losartan group (ns) and at 12 months RRF was
2.36 ± 0.38 in the enalapril group and 2.54 ± 0.47
mL/min/1.73 m2 in the losartan group (ns). RRF declined by 1.29 ± 1.21 in the enalapril group compaFigure 1. Residual glomerular filtration rate at baseline and during follow-up in the two groups. Error bars = 95% confidence interval.

There were not differences in number of hospitalizations between the groups. The frequency of infections and peritonitis was low and similar in the two
groups. There was good drug tolerance in both
groups, the frequency of cough was minimal, and
there were not hyperkalemia episodes (Table 3).
DISCUSSION
There are two RCT’s showing the benefit of ACEi/
ARBs on RRF preservation in PD patients.15,16 The
time course of RRF declination was similar in both
studies. In one of them, ramipril use over 12 months
was associated to a significant average RRF declination of 2.07 ml/min per 1.73 m2 vs. 3.0 mL/min
per 1.73 m2 in the control group. The difference
between the average changes in RRF from baseline
to 12 months was 0.93 mL/min per 1.73 m2 (95% CI,
0.09 to 1.78 mL/min per 1.73 m2) between ramipril
and control group.15 The other study showed that
valsartan significantly slowed the progressive decline of RRF (4.3 ± 0.7 to 3.2 ± 0.3 mL/min/1.73 m2)
in 34 Japanese CAPD patients, as compared to controls (5.9 ± 0.5 to 2.8 ± 0.4 mL/min/1.73 m2).16
However, other recently published observational cohort study, could not confirm the results of the two
aforementioned studies showing no differences between the cohort receiving ACEi or ARBs treatment
and the control group in the decline of RRF at two
and three years of follow-up.18 Some limitations of
this work are that it is an observational study, the
information about treatment with ACEi/ARBs before
the start of dialysis was not available, and it is unknown why the patients were prescribed ACEi or
ARBs.
The aim of the present study was to compare the
effect of two good pharmacologic alternatives for RRF
preservation in APD patients: an ACEi (enalapril)
and an ARBs (losartan). We decided to compare these
two very effective treatments because enalapril is the
first choice for this purpose in Mexico and losartan
represents another treatment option.
The mean of age of the patients included in the
present study is 45 years, they are younger than
the average patients on PD in developed countries,
but of similar age than patients from other published
Mexican cohorts.19,20 In 43% of the patients the
cause of CKD was diabetic nephropathy.
There is not a control group without treatment,
because by the time the study was approved and initiated it was widely accepted in the medical literature that ACEi and ARBs are effective for RRF
preservation,15,16,28 and that preserving RRF in PD
patients is very important,17 so it was considered
unethical to leave a group of patients without the
benefits of the treatment. However, we included a
HCG to assess the natural history of RRF decline
without treatment in a group with features similar
to those of the enalapril and losartan groups.
Baseline RRF in the HCG was similar to baseline
RRF in both treated groups, but RRF at 12 months
in the HCG was significantly lower than RRF at 12
months in both treated groups. This result suggests
that treatment with enalapril or losartan is useful
to preserve RRF in patients in APD.
Using a HCG is a limitation of the study. The patients in the HCG had similar age, gender, and time
in APD, and they were treated at the same healthcare facility than the enalapril and losartan groups.
However, the group was non-randomized, non-concurrent, non-parallel and non-synchronic, so this
conclusion should be taken with caution.
Proteinuria was similar in the two groups at the beginning and at the end of the study. The urine output

declined progressively during the study in both groups
and there were similar proportions of patients with
anuria in both groups at the end of the study.
The possible benefits of enalapril and losartan in
RRF preservation, seem to be related to inhibition of
the actions of AII and TGFβ on the remaining functional glomeruli, maybe avoiding progressive
glomerulosclerosis, and extracellular matrix accumulation, independently of blood pressure control.21,22 At the beginning of the study blood
pressure was normal, and during the follow-up
period it was maintained within the pre-specified
target values in both groups.
The study includes only patients on APD. There
are no reported differences between CAPD and APD
patients regarding RRF declination rate.23-27
APD has become more popular over the last years,
the global trend is to use APD more frequently than
CAPD, and maybe in a few years APD will be the
predominant PD modality used all over the world.
The main weaknesses of the study are the small
population, the lack of blindness and the use of a
HCG. Its strength is that it is a parallel randomized
controlled trial. Its originality lies in the comparison of an ACE inhibitor and an ARB that has not
been previously done, and that it was carried out in
a population of patients receiving APD.
We did not demonstrate differences between enalapril and losartan in slowing RRF decline in patients on APD. Any of them may be a suitable
alternative for RRF preservation in young APD patients. The demonstration of equivalence of enalapril and losartan for RRF preservation may be
important because the cost of the two alternatives is
different. This may be especially relevant when there
are economic constrictions. On the other hand, disregarding costs considerations, the knowledge that
any of the two alternatives may be useful for RRF
preservation is important in cases of intolerance to
one of the drugs.
