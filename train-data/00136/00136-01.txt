Abstract
Objective: Assess the effects of videoconferencing-based counseling on the psychosocial functioning of rural teenagers with epilepsy. Setting: University and rural communities. Participants: Twenty-two teenagers with epilepsy and their parents. Interventions: Six sessions of home-based video counseling, home-based speakerphone counseling, or office-based counseling. Main Outcome Measures: Problem severity and frequency, Social Skills Rating System, modified Working Alliance Inventory, and treatment adherence. Results: Teenagers and parents reported significant reductions in both problem severity and frequency across all 3 conditions from pre- to post-6th session to the 6-month follow-up. Parents reported significant increases in prosocial behaviors from pre- to post-6th session to follow-up. In contrast, both parents and teachers reported no change in problem behaviors over time. No differences in adherence were found across the 3 modalities. Overall therapeutic alliance was high but varied as a function of family member and treatment. Conclusions: Mode of delivery did not influence initial treatment outcomes or adherence. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)
