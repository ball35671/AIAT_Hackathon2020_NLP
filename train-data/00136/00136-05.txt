SUMMARY
The primary aim was to examine the preliminary efficacy of a family tailored problemsolving intervention to improve antiepileptic drug (AED) adherence in families of
children with new-onset epilepsy. Secondary aims were to assess changes in targeted
mechanisms and treatment feasibility and acceptability. Fifty families
(Mage = 7.6  3.0; 80% Caucasian; 42% idiopathic localization related) completed baseline questionnaires and were given an electronic monitor to observe daily AED adherence. If adherence was ≤ 95% in the first 7 months of the study, families were
randomized (Supporting Treatment Adherence Regimens (STAR): n = 11; Treatment
as Usual (TAU): n = 12). Twenty-one families were not randomized due to adherence
being ≥95%. The STAR intervention included four face-to-face and two telephone problem-solving sessions over 8 weeks. Significant group differences in adherence were
found during active intervention (weeks 4–6; TAU = 12.0 vs. STAR = 18.1, p < 0.01;
and weeks session 6–8: TAU = 9.7 vs. STAR = 15.3, p < 0.05). Children who received
the STAR intervention exhibited improved adherence compared to children in the
TAU group during active treatment. Significant changes in epilepsy knowledge and
management were noted for the STAR group. Families expressed benefitting from the
STAR intervention. Future studies should include a larger sample size and booster
intervention sessions to maintain treatment effects over time.

Nonadherence to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) is a significant problem for children with epilepsy and their families,
with approximately 60% demonstrating nonadherence to
treatment.1,2 The impact of AED nonadherence is significant for children with epilepsy, including increased seizures,2,3 inaccurate clinical decision making,4 and poor
health-related quality of life.5 Despite the known impact of
nonadherence on health outcomes for children with epilepsy, few adherence interventions have been developed.
A Cochrane review indicated that we lack well-designed
randomized controlled trials (RCT) with long follow-up
periods to improve adherence in epilepsy.6 Since the
Cochrane review, our group conducted a small pilot study
of 30 children with epilepsy to improve adherence to AED
therapy.7 Results from the pilot intervention were promising, as families had a mean adherence improvement of 32%
from baseline to postintervention, and they perceived the
intervention as feasible and acceptable. Limitations of the
pilot study included a small sample size, only targeting families that demonstrated nonadherence soon after diagnosis
(90% or less), lack of follow-up, and inability to examine
mechanisms of change. An important next step in the intervention process was to use an enrichment design (e.g.,
randomization occurs at different time points when adherAccepted November 23, 2015; Early View publication December 23,

BRIEF COMMUNICATION
ence declines) to capture families most in need of intervention and follow families past the postintervention period.
The aim of the current study was to examine changes in
adherence rates from baseline to postintervention and
3-month follow-up, between children and families randomized to the Supporting Treatment Adherence Regimen
(STAR) intervention versus Treatment As Usual (TAU).
Adherence data over 2-week periods were used to examine
group differences. It was hypothesized that children and
families in the STAR intervention group would demonstrate
significant improvements in adherence compared to the
TAU group and maintain these effects during the 3-month
follow-up period. Secondary aims were to assess mechanisms of change targeted during the intervention and treatment feasibility and acceptability. The STAR intervention
group was hypothesized to have greater changes in caregiver-reported epilepsy treatment knowledge, adherence
barriers, problem-solving skills, and epilepsy management
compared to the TAU group. The families in the STAR
intervention were hypothesized to find the treatment feasible and acceptable, reflected by ratings in the ideal range.
Methods
Participants
Children and their caregivers were recruited from a newonset seizure clinic in a Midwestern children’s hospital shortly
after epilepsy diagnosis from January 2011 to October 2012.
Inclusion/exclusion criteria were the following: (1) recent
diagnosis of epilepsy (within 7 months), (2) aged 2–12 years,
(3) no comorbid chronic illnesses requiring routine medications (e.g., diabetes), (4) AED medication in pill or sprinkle
form, (5) family residing within 75 miles of the hospital, (6)
no significant parent-reported developmental disorders (e.g.,
autism), and (7) no prior AED treatment. We chose not to
include children with major developmental disorders because
these children typically cannot participate well in problemsolving sessions and there may be additional barriers to adherence for these families that our intervention does not address.
A total of 50 families provided written informed consent and
assent (when applicable). The study was approved by the hospital’s institutional review board.
Procedure
At study entry, participants completed questionnaires and
received an electronic monitor to assess AED adherence, a
MEMS TrackCap. After a 30-day monitoring period, the
research coordinator conducted a home visit to download
the adherence data. We used 30 days of data to determine
eligibility for randomization to wash out any reactivity that
may have occurred with the electronic monitoring.8,9 Based
on these data, participants were either followed due to good
adherence (≥95%; High Adherence group) or randomized
into one of two groups (<95%; TAU or STAR intervention).
In addition to the 30-day monitoring period, participants
with good adherence had two additional opportunities to be
randomized over the next 6 months. Similar to their 1-
month run-in period, if adherence fell below 95% at the 3-
or 6-month assessment period, the family was randomized
to TAU or STAR. We chose to monitor adherence for
7 months because our prior data suggests that adherence patterns are relatively stable if they are high during this period
of time.1,2 If patients were randomized during the 3- or 6-
month assessment, their baseline data only included adherence in the 1 month preceding the randomization.
Randomization procedures
Participants were assigned randomly to either STAR
intervention or TAU using permuted block randomization
with block size 2. Stratification occurred based on the
1-month adherence data preceding study visits 2, 3, or 4
(e.g., adherence for 1 month >80% (e.g., 48 out of 60 doses)
or <80%) to ensure equality across groups. The randomization list was generated by the first author and held by a
research assistant independent of the study to reduce bias.
Treatment as usual group/high adherence families
Participation in the TAU and High groups involved five
study visits.
Adherence groups involved five study visits. The majority of study visits coincided with clinic appointments and
occurred approximately every 3 months with the exception
of the 1-month home visit to download the MEMS TrackCap for the run-in period.
STAR intervention group
Participation in the STAR intervention involved one to
three assessment visits, four face-to-face (sessions 1, 2, 4,
and 6) and two telephone intervention sessions (sessions 3
and 5), and one to three follow-up visits (Table S1) depending on when the family was randomized. Intervention sessions were led by a trained interventionist (e.g., psychology
doctoral student, postdoctoral fellow), and caregivers and
children participated in sessions.
Description of the STAR intervention
STAR intervention session 1 (weeks 1–2)
The first session of the intervention focused on addressing deficits in epilepsy knowledge and providing education
about the importance of AED adherence. We reviewed an
adapted version of the Epilepsy Knowledge Questionnaire10
completed by each family and corrected errors with explanations. We also reviewed the participant’s prescribed treatment regimen and provided them with feedback on their
own AED adherence over the past 2 weeks.
STAR intervention sessions 2–4 (weeks 3–8)
The goals of the problem-solving approach were as follows: (1) The interventionist helped the caregiver/child

identify an adherence barrier (Problem Definition); (2) The
caregiver and child were taught to generate several creative
solutions (Generating Alternative Solutions); (3) The potential solutions were written down and systematically evaluated by caregiver and child (Family Decision Making); (4)
The family selected one solution for implementation
(Implementation of New Solution); (5) A detailed solution
was written out with specifics regarding when, where, and
how the new solution will be attempted, and a behavioral
contract was signed by all participants of the problem-solving session; and (6) Phone follow-ups were conducted
1 week after the problem-solving session to assist the family in either fine-tuning the solution or renegotiating a new
solution (Evaluation and Renegotiation). Of note, even
young children participated in problem-solving sessions
with variable engagement depending on age. For example,
toddlers and preschool children could provide examples of
rewards/reinforcers they liked and whether they liked possible solutions. In contrast, older children were more likely to
provide viable solutions that families could choose and
would often be involved in helping write these down and
choose the solution.
Three-month follow-up visit
MEMS TrackCap data were downloaded and all caregivers completed questionnaires at this 3-month follow-up
visit. A medical chart review also occurred at this visit. Due
to patients who were in the STAR intervention having different levels of follow-up (e.g., those randomized early had
more follow-up than those randomized later in the study),
we used 3-month follow-up data to ensure consistency
across all participants.
Measures
Background information form
Parents completed a form regarding information about
the child’s age, gender, race/ethnicity, and caregiver occupational history.
Medical chart review
Chart reviews were conducted to collect information
regarding the treatment regimen, seizure activity (absence/
presence), seizure type, AED prescription, and changes to
the regimen over time. Baseline side effects was also collected, and assessed in routine care via the Pediatric Epilepsy Side Effects Questionnaire.11 Total side effect scores
can range from 0 to 100, with higher scores reflecting higher
side effects.
MEMS 6 TrackCap
The Medication Event Monitoring Systems (MEMS;
Aardex Corporation) TrackCap was used to measure daily
AED adherence. Adherence rates were calculated using
daily data over 2-week intervals. For example, if the patient
missed 10 of 28 doses in 2-weeks, the child’s adherence rate
would be [(2810)/28 9 100% = 64.3%].
Epilepsy Knowledge Questionnaire (EKQ10)
The adapted Epilepsy Knowledge Questionnaire (EKQ)
is a 55-item questionnaire regarding knowledge about medical and social aspects of epilepsy. This measure has adequate reliability and validity, with Cronbach’s alphas
ranging from 0.49 to 0.63. Scores range from 0 to 100% correctness, with higher scores representing greater knowledge.
Social Problem-Solving Iventory-Revised (SPSI-R: Short
Form12)
The SPSI-R: Short Form is a 25-item self-report measure
of an individual’s ability to resolve problems in everyday
life. The SPSI-R: Short Form generates five subscales: Positive Problem Orientation, Negative Problem Orientation,
Rational Problem Solving, Impulsivity/Carelessness Style,
and Avoidance Style. Raw scores are converted to standardized scores, using 100 as the mean and 15 as the standard
deviation. Scores between 86 and 114 represent the normative group average. Measurement properties of the SPSI-R:
Short Form are strong, with reliability ranging from 0.74 to
0.89.12
Pediatric Epilepsy Medication Self-Management
Questionnaire (PEMSQ13)
The PEMSQ assesses critical aspects of medication management by caregivers of children with epilepsy. The
PEMSQ is 27 items with four scales (Epilepsy and Treatment Knowledge and Expectations, Adherence to Medications and Clinic Appointments, Barriers to Medication
Adherence, and Beliefs about Medication Efficacy). Cronbach’s alphas ranged from 0.68 to 0.85 for the scales. For
this study, we examined the Epilepsy and Treatment Knowledge, Barriers to Medication Adherence (scores range from
8 to 40), and Total Self-Management (scores range from
27–135) scores. Higher scores represent better medication
self-management.
Parent response to child illness (PRCI14)
The PRCI is a 35-item questionnaire and assesses parents’ responses and perceptions related to seizures. It comprises five subscales: Child Support, Family Life/Leisure,
Condition Management (i.e., Epilepsy management), Child
Autonomy, and Child Discipline. Items for Child Support
include cheering up the child when sad, while those for
Family Life/Leisure discuss disruptions in activities as a
result of seizures. The Epilepsy Management scale encompasses items regarding confidence to manage seizures and
side effects and Child Autonomy includes items related to
dependence/independence on parents. Finally the Child Discipline scale has items related to how parents feel about
child discipline and their responses to various child

Pediatric Epilepsy Adherence Intervention
behaviors. Internal consistencies ranged from 0.67 to 0.85
and strong test–retest reliability was demonstrated (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.47–0.72). Higher scores
reflect better functioning.
Treatment acceptability and feasibility questionnaire
Caregivers participating in the STAR intervention completed a study-specific questionnaire assessing feasibility
and acceptability of the STAR intervention, which has been
used in prior studies.7
Statistical analyses
Our primary outcome was AED adherence rates across
2-week intervals (i.e., 2–4 weeks, 4–6 weeks, 6–8 weeks,
8–10 weeks, and 10–12 weeks). We chose to examine
2-week time periods instead of daily data because our intervention sessions occurred every 2 weeks, with the first session focused on education but subsequent sessions being
more problem solving focused. Thus, we were able to better
identify the timing of adherence changes during intervention and follow-up. We examined group differences in
change from baseline to each of these 2-week intervals
across the 8 weeks of intervention and 3-month follow-up.
Notably, baseline data included 30 days of monitoring preceding the randomization, regardless of when the patient
was randomized (e.g., assessment 1, 2, or 3). These analyses
were carried out using a repeated-measures model based on
maximum likelihood estimation15 with the MIXED procedure in SAS (version 9.3; SAS Institute, Cary, NC, U.S.A.).
Secondary outcomes included potential mechanisms of
change, such as epilepsy knowledge, adherence barriers,
and social problem-solving skills. These were examined
from baseline to postintervention only. We employed the
same statistical model to examine group differences in
changes in treatment mechanisms (e.g., knowledge, barriers) from baseline to posttreatment. Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05. Notably, because this
was a pilot study with goals of evaluating preliminary
effect size, power considerations were not considered in
the design.

RCT (Figure S1). The recruitment rate for this intervention
study was 66%.
Aim 1: Preliminary efficacy of the STAR intervention
Overall, data indicated significant differences between
groups following intervention session 2. Specifically, a
trend for group differences was noted after the first problem-solving session (weeks 2–4; STAR: Mchange = 15.8 and
TAU: Mchange = 0.5; p = 0.053), and statistically significant differences were noted between groups following intervention session 3 (weeks 4–6; STAR: Mchange = 18.1 and
TAU: Mchange = 12.0; p = 0.002) and 4 (weeks 6–8;
STAR: Mchange = 15.3and TAU: Mchange = 9.7;
p = 0.021) (Fig. 1). During the 3-month follow-up period,
no significant group differences were found on AED adherence.
Aim 2: Mechanisms of change
Group differences were examined on changes in the proposed mechanism of action to improve AED adherence
(Table S2). Significant group differences were found on
changes in epilepsy knowledge: PEMSQ-Epilepsy Disease
and Treatment Knowledge (p < 0.05) and the EKQ
(p < 0.01). Specifically, the STAR intervention group
increased their score by 2.1 points and 6.6 point, respectively. Significant group differences were also noted on
self-management—PEMSQ: Total Score (p < 0.01) and
PRCI: Epilepsy management (p > 0.01). The STAR intervention group increased their epilepsy management score
by 3.7 and 0.33, respectively. No significant group differences were found on change scores for social problem solving skills or adherence barriers.
Aim 3: Feasibility and acceptability of the STAR
intervention
Eleven families were randomized to the STAR intervention. Of those, two withdrew prior to treatment initiation
and one family completed the intervention sessions but was
lost to follow-up. Of the nine families who completed
STAR, a majority of families found the intervention to be
feasible and acceptable (Table S3).
Discussion
The current study expands findings from a previous pilot
study demonstrating promising benefits of the STAR intervention. Families receiving the STAR intervention (i.e.,
education and problem-solving skills) had higher rates of
AED adherence during active intervention. Improved epilepsy knowledge and self-management skills postintervention appear to be mechanisms that increase daily AED
adherence. In addition, families in the STAR intervention
felt it was feasible and acceptable. However, adherence
improvements were not sustained at the 3-month follow-up,
indicating the need for booster sessions to sustain results
detected during active treatment.
The short-term efficacy of the STAR intervention was
supported by this study and validates that family based
problem solving can improve AED adherence for children
2–12 years of age and their families who are newly managing epilepsy and establishing a daily AED regimen. The
STAR intervention provides families with the opportunity
to receive feedback on their AED adherence data and
engage in active problem-solving discussions. Use of the
patient’s own electronic monitoring of adherence behaviors
for intervention was meaningful to children and their caregivers and is increasingly being used in clinical settings with
other pediatric populations (e.g., blood glucose monitors16).
This type of data can potentially increase dialogue in clinical practice around common adherence issues.
Adherence declined when active intervention ended, with
comparable rates at the end of the 3-month follow-up for
STAR and TAU groups. During active intervention, families developed a formal behavioral plan to address their
adherence barrier and were then held accountable for implementing the plan via telephone contacts and subsequent

sessions. Unfortunately, without these continued contacts
and reinforcement, adherence declined for families. Booster
sessions could extend the benefits of the STAR intervention
by increasing accountability and provision of support.
Families who received the STAR intervention demonstrated greater epilepsy knowledge and epilepsy management skills from pre- to postintervention compared to the
TAU cohort. The first session of the STAR intervention provides educational content that extends beyond education
provided during standard medical care (e.g., epilepsy
restrictions, introduction of AED adherence), which normalizes discussion around AED adherence. Although
knowledge is recognized as necessary to improve adherence, the adherence literature suggests it is not sufficient to
change adherence behaviors. The STAR cohort also demonstrated greater epilepsy self-management skills, including
greater ability to recognize AED side effects, manage new
symptoms (i.e., seizures), and when to solicit medical
advice (i.e., call physician, visit the emergency department)
compared to the TAU cohort.
The study is not without limitations. First, our small sample size may have limited detection of significant effects.
Second, some families felt the location of the intervention
was inconvenient. In addition, the problem-solving measure
used may not reliability assess the problem-solving skills
delivered in the STAR intervention. Finally, only caregiverreported questionnaires were used in the study and there
were no child-reported outcomes. Child perspectives of perceived key mechanisms of change should be considered
(i.e., epilepsy knowledge), particularly for older children.
Future investigations may also consider a more heterogeneous (e.g., older, chronic epilepsy) and larger sample
size and use of problem-solving measures that better
reflect the skills targeted in the STAR intervention.
Clinic-based delivery or telehealth (e.g., Skype, mobile
apps) would also address the issue of convenience for
families, as well as the provision of booster sessions so
AED adherence improvements are maintained over time.
Furthermore, a large-scale RCT with an attention-control
group would help disentangle the effects of attention on
improvement in adherence.
Clinical implications gleaned from the current pilot
study suggest the need to engage families with children
with epilepsy in active adherence promotion efforts early
in the disease course. Problem solving and education
strategies appear to be helpful initially and could be
implemented in clinical settings by health care providers.
However, the need for continued monitoring and engagement around adherence behaviors is critical to maintaining improvements in adherence and self-management.
This is especially salient in pediatric epilepsy because
variable adherence and early nonadherence are associated
with worse seizure outcomes.2,3 The fact that families
deemed the intervention as feasible and beneficial and
liked the treatment is promising.
