1. Introduction
Epilepsy is a common chronic childhood condition. A prospective
and representative study estimates its incidence in children (0–15
years old) in Germany at 60/100,000 cases per annum.
1 Children and
adolescents with epilepsy are at greater than average risk of having
emotional and behavioural problems, increased dependence on
parents and reduced quality of life.2–6 Stigmatising prejudices can
often restrict everyday life more than the disease itself.7
Epilepsy patients’ level of information about their disease proved
low. According to Dawkins8 their knowledge of epilepsy is not
significantly greater than that of children and adolescents without
the condition. They have been reported as being less well informed
about their condition; they feel excludedmore often from discussion
with doctors than children with diabetes and asthma.9
These findings indicate unmet informational and psychosocial
needs in the health care provision of young patients with epilepsy.
Health education-programmes have been established to cater for
these needs in chronic conditions. Structured programmes are part

ABSTRACT
Objective: The objective of this article is to present the development, contents and efficacy of the
FLIP&FLAP programme for children and adolescents with epilepsy, and their parents.
Intervention: The programme is mainly directed at age-appropriately developed children and
adolescents between 6 and 16 who take antiepileptic drugs. It is conducted as a 2.5-day group training
programme; children and parents are grouped separately. The main focuses are:
 conveying epilepsy knowledge in an age-appropriate manner
 teaching individual coping strategies
 encouraging child autonomy.
Evaluation study: We performed a multi-centre non-randomised two-group pre-/post-trial using a
waiting-list control group design. 10 German epilepsy centres participated. The intervention group, IG
(21 children 8–11 years, 44 adolescents 12–16 years, 72 parents) completed standardised questionnaires
immediately before the FLIP&FLAP course and 6 months later; the waiting control group, WCG (31
children, 39 adolescents, 72 parents) 6 months before and immediately before the course. Compared to
the WCG, the children and parents of the IG showed significantly improved knowledge of epilepsy, with
medium to large effect sizes (univariate analysis of variance with repeated measurements, d = 0.6–1.4).
Parents of the IG reported improved self-management skills (d = 0.7) and communication skills (d = 0.8)
of their child and fewer epilepsy-related worries (d = 0.5). Children and adolescents of the IG reported
improved HRQOL in the Social Exclusion dimension (d = 0.3).
Conclusion: FLIP&FLAP is an effective child- and family-centred programme. It is currently being
established in Northern Germany to test its usefulness in routine care.

of standard paediatric care in asthma and diabetes10,11 and are
receiving growing recognition in other chronic conditions.12,13
However, few such programmes are available for children and
adolescents with epilepsy and their parents,14–19 and fewer still
have been evaluated.20 Although no standardised German programme for children and adolescents with epilepsy existed at the
time of conception of FLIP&FLAP, another psycho-educative epilepsy
programme has since been produced in Germany: Famoses.21
The neuropaediatric team of the University Hospital Luebeck and
the co-authors developed the FLIP&FLAP epilepsy programme
between 2000 and 2003 using a formative evaluation methodology.
Subsequently a research team of the University of Luebeck evaluated
the efficacy of the FLIP&FLAP programme using a summative
evaluation methodology. The objectives of this article are
(1) to outline the development and describe the content and
structure of the FLIP&FLAP epilepsy programme and
(2) to present main results of the (summative) evaluation study.
2. THE FLIP&FLAP epilepsy programme
2.1. Development of the programme
An evaluation of available international programmes for
children with epilepsy with a view to a possible adaptation found
that either the cultural differences were too great or that the focus
of the programmes was medical or psychosocial, contradicting the
working group’s preference for a comprehensive bio-psychosocial
approach. Because of this, the working group decided on the
systematic development of a new educational programme.
Fig. 1 displays the development of the FLIP&FLAP programme.
Phase 1: qualitative interviews were conducted with seven
epilepsy patients (ages 8–18) and their mothers to capture their
personal experience of the condition, their everyday interactions
and health care needs.
Paediatric epilepsy specialists from the University of Luebeck
provided the project with information about the most frequent
questions and worries of parents and children. This was via guided
interviews.
Phase 2: a first training guideline was produced. It was tested in
a pilot consisting of:
 1 children’s course
 1 adolescents’ course
 2 adults’ courses
Following this pilot, the curriculum of the programme was
systematically developed using a formative evaluation: three
consecutive courses, including 37 children/adolescents and 54
parents were conducted in several north German clinics. These
were each evaluated using qualitative research techniques (interviews, focus groups, video feedback). The results of each evaluation
were used to tailor the programme more closely to the needs of the
participants and trainers.
2.2. Main results of the formative evaluation
2.2.1. Children’s and adolescents’ worries and understanding
of the condition
The questioning demonstrated that many of the children had
only a poor understanding of their condition. A few younger
children did not even know that they had a chronic condition,
believing for example that their tablets were to make them grow
faster.
To cope with their lack of knowledge, some children developed,
in part, frightening fantasies about their condition. Most young
children, however, showed little emotional reaction to their
condition. Adolescents more frequently suffered emotionally
and socially from their epilepsy. They reported frustration about
restrictions in their everyday life, feelings of embarrassment, low
self-esteem and feelings of being an outsider in their peer group.
Many showed a fear of seizures. Some complained of a lack of
ability to represent their condition to others. Their most frequently
reported concern was that fellow pupils would witness a seizure
and that they would subsequently suffer social exclusion. Some
adolescents therefore preferred to keep their disease an absolute
secret.
2.2.2. Parental burden
The main parental stress factors seemed to be increased
anxiety, worries about the child’s development and prospects and
to a lesser extent managing everyday life with the disease. These
stress factors existed for the most part regardless of the seizure
frequency. Parents felt that doctors often underestimate the
psychological stress brought on by caring for a child with epilepsy.
Most parents referred to the experience of their child’s first
seizure as traumatic. Quite a few displayed seemingly irrational
anxieties concerning the condition. As a consequence, some
parents relieved their fears by becoming overprotective.
About the half of all parents reported fears of stigmatisation of
their children. However, only a small number had actually
experienced rejection. Many families adopted a defensive attitude
when dealing with the disease in public.
Many parents demonstrated uncertainty as to whether certain
behaviours or minor weaknesses in the performance of their
children were disease-related. Their resulting anxious observation
of the child led in some families to a permanent nervous tension
and uncertainty on the part of the parents as to the appropriate

2.2.3. The condition in familial interactions
Many parents found it difficult to pass on information to their
children because of their own lack of medical understanding. They
were also unused to explaining medical facts to children. A
considerable number of parents were keen to protect the child
from having to deal with the disease.
Many parents underestimated their child’s ability to take
responsibility for the disease. Some even suppressed the child’s
attempts to do this. For example, some parents controlled the taking
of antiepileptic drugs long past the age in which children show
sufficiently developed independence in other areas of their lives.
These parents had decided to bear the burden of responsibility for
the disease by themselves; at the same time they found this stressful.
2.3. Description of the FLIP&FLAP programme
2.3.1. Structure
The FLIP&FLAP course can be held as a 2-day (14 h per course) or
a two and a half-day (16 h per course) continuous session.
Parents and children are taught separately from one another in
groups (5–8 families). In the parents’ course, necessary medical
knowledge is conveyed and treatment options listed and discussed
under the guidance of a doctor. The second part of the course is
conducted by a psychologist and deals with the subjective
experience of the disease as well as with its management. The
children’s and adolescents’ courses can be conducted by health
care professionals such as nurses, social workers, doctors or
psychologists; two trainers are required per course.
The training package contains detailed manuals for the trainers
as well as a diverse range of teaching material including, among
other things, a film about seizures, two rag dolls called ‘‘FLIP&-
FLAP’’ and a game about epilepsy facts. Children also receive a
comic booklet and a workbook which highlights important course
results. The package also contains an information booklet for
parents, which summarizes the contents of the course.
2.3.2. Contents
Derived from the focus groups and the interviews, the following
domains were included:
 Disease knowledge: The training promotes the participants’
understanding of the disease through information on the
pathophysiology of the condition and treatment appropriate to
their age and needs.
 Disease-related emotions: Members of the group share diseaseaccompanying emotions such as anxiety, guilt or embarrassment; coping strategies and their own emotional resources are
discussed.
 Communication: The FLIP&FLAP programme encourages the
dialogue among children and adolescents, their parents and
professionals.
 Self-responsibility: The programme promotes Children’s independent approach in coping with the disease. Parents and
children are encouraged to share responsibility for managing the
disease and to counteract the parents’ tendency to overprotection.
 Self-management: The children/adolescents are encouraged to
adopt a self-reliant attitude in managing their disease, particularly with respect to taking medication and choice of leisure
activities.
 Participation: The programme guides the families to question
their expectations of stigmatisation and promotes an open and
confident way of dealing with the disease. Children and
adolescents are encouraged to participate socially.
 Educational insecurity: Parents who are insecure about perceived
developmental and behavioural problems of their child receive
educational counselling and further information on diagnostic
possibilities.
One of the main aims of the children’s and adolescents’ course is
on helping them conceptualise their seizures, which they often do
not consciously experience. By watching the film and receiving
age-appropriate information, the participants are enabled to
understand their seizures and to develop a more adequate selfconcept.
Both the parents’ and children’s/adolescents’ courses deal with
the disease mechanism by means of the FLIP&FLAP story which
uses children’s expressions and speech patterns. It tells the story of
the teamwork that happens between the ‘‘clumsy’’ nerve cells, the
‘‘Flaps’’, and their colleagues, the strong, fit ‘‘Flips’’ (see Fig. 2).
Now and then the Flaps make mistakes that can turn into a
seizure. The model aims to serve as a picture: in the same way as
the Flips accept the Flaps, the children/adolescents are meant to
accept their disease. Thus the disease is not shown as a threatening
Fig. 2. Age-appropriate explanation of information transfer between nerve cells.

‘‘enemy’’ but a ‘‘weakness’’ that should be encountered with
consideration and encouragement.
The FLIP&FLAP model can be useful in other ways, e.g., it can be
used to illustrate different types of seizure and how they happen,
the effect of triggering factors and EEG-investigations. In the
adolescents’ programme, connections are made between the
FLIP&FLAP model and more scientific explanations of epilepsy,
in order to enable the model to ‘‘grow’’ with the participants
without leading to discontinuities in their understanding of the
disease.
2.3.3. Didactic methods
Methodologically the programme is based on an inventory
used in family and behaviour therapy including: imagination
techniques, elaborating resources, role play, and teaching
problem-solving strategies, using an experience-based learning
approach. The programme tries to suit the varied expectations
and differing requirements of the participants. It does this by
offering a broad spectrum of themes and a variety of didactic
approaches. An interactive course atmosphere is maintained
throughout the course to satisfy the participants’ needs for
exchanging experiences within the group. Illustrated exemplary
case studies serve as stimulants for discussion and also as
devices for checking the participants’ comprehension (especially
during parents’ courses).
The children’s course deals with all contents through play and
totally avoids ‘‘chalk and talk’’ teaching. Adolescents need to be
approached in a more non-directive way by course leaders; there
also needs to be more emphasis on proactive emotional coping
strategies.
3. The summative evaluation
The summative evaluation of the FLIP&FLAP programme was
conducted between autumn 2003 and spring 2005. The primary
outcome parameters were
 knowledge of epilepsy,
 parents’ epilepsy-related worries,
 children’s and adolescents’ self-management skills (taking
medication), independence, communication skills (explaining
epilepsy), and
 health-related quality of life (HRQOL).
Secondary outcome parameters were utilisation of services and
seizure frequency. Process quality was assessed by patients’ and
parents’ satisfaction with the FLIP&FLAP course.
3.1. Methods
3.1.1. Subjects and setting
The subjects of the evaluation study were children with epilepsy
(8–16 years) and their parents. We performed a multi-centre nonrandomised two-group pre-/post-trial using a waiting-list control
group design. 10 specialised German epilepsy centres invited all
eligible patients and their parents to participate in the epilepsy
education-programme. Families who applied were informed about
the evaluation study and asked to participate. The criteria for
inclusion were a diagnosis of epilepsy, taking antiepileptic drugs,
sufficient German literacy and the willingness of the child and at
least one carer to participate in the education-programme. Children
younger than 8 years were interviewed, using open-ended
questions, about their knowledge and understanding of their
condition but were not included in the summative evaluation
study. We excluded children with moderate to severe learning
disabilities or mental retardation (parent’s assessment) because of
their anticipated inability to benefit from the programme. Data were
collected via telephone interviews and mailed questionnaires.
Written consent was obtained from parents and adolescents;
children gave oral consent to participate in the study. The ethics
committee of the University of Luebeck, Germany (study centre)
approved the study. All centres offered two educational courses
within 9 months of patient recruitment, the second course taking
place 6 months after the first one. Applicants for the first course
were assigned to the intervention group; applicants for the second
course to the waiting-list control group.
The sample size required to detect a moderate intervention
effect (difference of improvement 5 points on a 0–100 quality of
life scale) with a power of 0.80 was calculated to be N = 92 for each
group for one-tailed testing on a 0.5 probability level.
A baseline and a follow-up assessment (after 6 months) were
performed for both the intervention group (IG) and waiting control
group (WCG). Patients and the main carer in the IG were
interviewed immediately before (baseline) and 6 months after
they attended the FLIP&FLAP programme (follow-up); patients and
the main carer in the WCG were interviewed 6 months before
(baseline) and immediately before they attended the FLIP&FLAP
programme (follow-up). A follow-up assessment was performed 6
weeks after completion of the course in both groups (IG and WCG)
to evaluate process quality (satisfaction with the intervention).
Additionally, we assessed knowledge of epilepsy in both groups at
the same time. The enlarged sample size enabled us to examine
how families with different educational levels benefited from the
intervention with regard to epilepsy knowledge.
3.1.2. Questionnaires
Descriptive medical data (diagnosis, disease duration, seizure
characteristics, co-morbidity, medication) and demographic data
(child age, gender, academic performance, parents’ employment
status) were collected at baseline. Seizure frequency and health
care utilisation data (secondary outcomes) were collected at both
baseline and follow-up. During the formative evaluation of the
programme, parents had displayed a considerable uncertainty
about their child’s seizure frequency. We therefore decided to
collect information from the parents on ‘‘seizure-free episodes’’
rather than ‘‘seizure frequency’’. Health care utilisation was
assessed by the number of contacts with the treating physicians
during the previous 6 months.
3.1.2.1. Epilepsy knowledge. Parents’ knowledge of epilepsy was
assessed using the Epilepsy Knowledge Profile (EKP-G).22,23 The
EKP-G consists of 55 true/false items (34 Medical Knowledge items,
21 Social Knowledge items) and is reported to have satisfactory
psychometric properties (Medical Knowledge scale: a = 0.63, Social
Knowledge scale: a = 0.49).22 We performed two independent
forward translations by German native speakers. A harmonised
version was back-translated by an English native speaker and
compared with the original questionnaire. As the questionnaire
had been developed for adult patients with epilepsy, both the
Medical Knowledge Scale and the Social Knowledge scale were
slightly modified to cover the problems of parents caring for a child
with epilepsy. The adapted version for parents comprised 57 true/
false items: 35 on the Medical Knowledge Scale and 22 on the Social
Knowledge scale. 9 items on seizure triggers were also included in
the questionnaire. For use with the adolescent age group, we
adapted the parent version of the EKP-G, omitting certain items
and phrasing others in a simpler, non-academic way where
possible. The adapted version for adolescents comprised 50 true/
false items: 33 on the Medical Knowledge Scale and 17 on the Social
Knowledge scale as well as 9 items on seizure triggers.
To measure children’s epilepsy knowledge, we developed a
short questionnaire comprising 27 items, covering both medical
S. Jantzen et al. / Seizure 18 (2009) 478–486 481
and social aspects of epilepsy. Answer categories were ‘true’ and
‘false’ as in the EKP-G. The internal consistency coefficient of the
scale was a = 0.58 in the study sample (IG at baseline).
3.1.2.2. Child’s self-management skills and independence. Parents
reported on their child’s self-management skills (taking medication) on a 4-item scale, which was developed for the purpose of the
study. Responses ranged from 0 to 4, higher scores indicating less
rigid parental control and more self-responsibility of the child in
taking medication. The internal consistency coefficient of the scale
was a = 0.69 in the study sample (IG at baseline).
Parents also reported on their child’s independence in everyday
activities on a 13-item scale, which also has been developed for the
purpose of the study. The scale addressed social activities such as
staying at a friend’s house and school trips, using a dichotomous
response format. The internal consistency coefficient of the scale
was a = 0.68 in study sample (IG at baseline).
3.1.2.3. Health-related quality of life (HRQOL). We used a recently
developed instrument, the DISABKIDS modular HRQOL questionnaire, which has been developed simultaneously across several
European countries.24,25 The instrument comprises a chronic
generic core measure (DCGM-37) with 37 items on 6 six scales
(Independence, Physical state, Emotional state, Social exclusion, Social
inclusion, Medication) and several disease-specific modules, among
these an epilepsy module. The epilepsy module is to be used as a
supplement to the chronic generic measure and comprises 10
items on two scales (Impact and Social). Internal consistency values
(Cronbach’s Alpha) varied between 0.70 (Social Inclusion) and 0.90
(Impact) for the self-report versions; items are scored on a 5-point
frequency scale and transformed into 0–100 scores.26
3.1.2.4. Parent’s epilepsy-related worries. We developed a short
questionnaire for parents to access the effect of the FLIP&FLAP
intervention on disease-related worries of carers. The questionnaire covered the main concerns of parental carers of children with
epilepsy, which were derived from the formative evaluation study
of the FLIP&FLAP project and focus groups of the DISABKIDS
project. The items pertained to worries related to seizures, the
child’s development and peer acceptance. The instrument comprised 13 items: responses were scored on a 5-point scale. The
questionnaire showed good internal consistency (Cronbach’s
alpha = 0.82) in the study sample (IG at baseline).
3.1.2.5. Disclosure of epilepsy. We asked children as well as the
main carer to report the ability of the child to explain epilepsy to
others (can you/can your child explain well what epilepsy is), using
a 5-point response scale (‘‘never’’, ‘‘seldom’’, ‘‘sometimes’’, ‘‘often’’,
‘‘very often’’).
3.1.2.6. Satisfaction with the intervention. Parents’ satisfaction with
the intervention was assessed by the ZUF-8 questionnaire,27 the
German version of the CSQ-8 Client Satisfaction Questionnaire.28
The instrument comprises 8 items; responses scored on a 4-point
scale. The instrument shows good psychometric properties and has
been widely used.
Children reported their satisfaction with the FLIP&FLAP
programme using a ‘smiling faces’ rating-scale with five response
choices (‘‘very good’’, ‘‘good’’, ‘‘okay’’, ‘‘fair’’, ‘‘not good’’).
3.1.3. Statistical analysis
Descriptive statistics are presented as frequencies or
means  standard deviation (SD). Effects of the intervention on the
main outcome parameters (dependent variables) were assessed using
univariate analysis of variance with repeated measurements, with
group status (IG or WCG) and time being defined as independent
variables. Changes in seizure frequencies (seizure-free episodes) were
tested for the IG compared to the WCG using chi2
-test. Group
differences at baseline were tested using the chi2
-test,Mann–Whitneytest and t-test. To examine the impact of educational status on epilepsy
knowledge, a univariate analysis of variance with repeated measurements was performed with epilepsy knowledge as dependent variable
and time and educational status as independent variables. To assess
effect sizes, we used Cohen’s effect size d, with d  0.2 being classified
as small, d  0.5 as medium, and d  0.8 as large effect.29
3.2. Results
3.2.1. Response and sample characteristics
Of the 448 eligible patients/families, 141 participated in the
FLIP&FLAP education-programme (31.5%). For 75% of the contacted
families, we were able to analyse differences among the families
who applied and those who did not apply with regard to some
socio-demographic and clinical parameters. Participants and nonparticipants showed no significant differences with regard to age
and gender of their child, type of school the child attended and
diagnosis (chi2
-test).
105 families applied for the first course (IG) and 87 for the
second one (WCG). Of the applicants for the first course, 27 families
did not attend. 6 of these families were nevertheless willing to fill
in the questionnaires and were reassigned to the WCG. At least one
member (parent or child) of each family completing the course
(N = 78) participated in the evaluation study. Of the applicants of

the WCG, 24 families withdrew from the course, but 13 were
nevertheless willing to participate in the evaluation study. The
WCG finally included 82 families.
At baseline, the final sample included 22 children, 45 adolescents
and 77 parents in the IG and 32 children, 42 adolescents and 79
parents in the WCG. At follow-up after 6 months: 21 children, 44
adolescents and 72 parents in the IG and 31 children, 39 adolescents
and 72 parents in the WCG participated. The loss to follow-up was
less than 10% in all subgroups of the sample.
Table 1 displays socio-demographic and clinical characteristics
of the IG and the waiting-list WCG at baseline.
The groups were not significantly different in demographic and
most clinical aspects, the exceptions being parent-reported
seizure-free episode duration (chi2 = 12.89, p < 0.05) and comorbid conditions (chi2 = 4.34, p < 0.05). The IG and WCG also
displayed a few initial differences regarding outcome parameters.
Initially, parents in the IG showed better knowledge of social
aspects of epilepsy (t-test, t = 3.68, p < 0.0001), and reported more
contacts with health care providers in the previous 6 months
(Mann–Whitney-test, p < 0.05). Children and adolescents of the IG
reported poorer HRQOL in the Social Exclusion scale of the DGCM37 (t-test, t = 2.15, p < 0.05) than the WCG.

3.2.2.1. Epilepsy knowledge. At baseline, children displayed a
moderate level of epilepsy knowledge (IG 67%, WCG 71% correct
responses). Adolescents displayed a moderate level of epilepsy
knowledge in both scales of the adapted EKP (EKP Medical Aspects:
IG 58%, WCG 64%, EKP Social Aspects: IG 48%, WCG 49% correct
responses). Parents in both the IG and WCG displayed a high (EKP

(EKP Social Aspects: IG 56%, WCG 62% correct responses) level of
epilepsy knowledge.
6 months after the intervention, children of the IG (N = 21)
showed increased epilepsy knowledge compared to the WCG
(N = 31) (significant time-by-group effect). Adolescents of the IG
(N = 44) showed increased knowledge on medical aspects of
epilepsy and increased knowledge on seizure triggers compared
to the WCG (N = 39) (time-by-group effect). IG and WCG both
displayed increased knowledge of social aspects of epilepsy
(significant time-effect); differences between the groups were not
significant.
Parents (N = 69) in the IG showed increased epilepsy knowledge
in all scales (Medical Aspects, Social Aspects, Seizure Triggers) of the
questionnaires compared to parents (N = 72) in the WCG
(significant time-by-group effect). Effect sizes on all knowledge
scales were medium (d = 0.6) to large (d = 1.4) in the IG.
A large proportion of parents in both IG and WCG showed a high
educational level (more than 10 years of education). Table 3
displays the relation between educational and epilepsy knowledge
at baseline and at the additional follow-up time-point, 6 weeks
after completion of the FLIP&FLAP course.
Parents with a lower educational level reported less epilepsy
knowledge—in particular less medical knowledge (ANOVA,
p < 0.05, two-tailed testing). However, an analysis of variance
with repeated measurement, including educational level as
independent variable, showed that all parents improved their
epilepsy-related knowledge in all areas and benefited equally from
the FLIP&FLAP course independently of initial educational level
(significant time-effects, no time-by-group effects).
In the German educational systems, few children of age 10+ years
attend non-selective comprehensive schools. Most others attend
schools from the tripartite system of the Gymnasium (=Grammar
school, 13 years of education), Hauptschule (9 years of education)
and Realschule (10 years of education), which have differentiated
educational goals. The data from these children (N = 64) show that
knowledge of epilepsy is related to the type of school attended, with
lower educational level (9 years of education) and attendance at
special needs school being associated with lower medical and social
knowledge at baseline (ANOVA, p < 0.01 and p = 0.05, two-tailed
testing). As with the parents, all children improved their epilepsyrelated medical and social knowledge independently of the school
type they attended (Analysis of variance with repeated measurement, with school type as independent variable: significant timeeffects, no time-by-group effects).
3.2.2.2. Children’s and adolescents’ psychosocial outcomes. Parents
(N = 67) of the IG reported decreased direct carer control and
increased self-management skills of their child compared to the
WCG (N = 67) (significant time-by-group effect), with medium to
large effect size (d = 0.7). Parents of the IG (N = 70) also reported
increased independence in their child’s social activities compared
to the WCG (N = 71) (significant time-by-group effect, one-tailed
testing), with large effect size (d = 0.8). Parents (proxy-) reported
that communications skills (disclosure of epilepsy) increased
significantly in the IG (N = 66) compared to the WCG (N = 68)
(significant time-by-group effect). Children’s and adolescents’ selfreported ability to explain epilepsy also increased (significant
time-effect), but there was no difference between IG (N = 58) and
WCG (N = 59).
Children and adolescents of the IG reported improved HRQOL at
follow-up (significant time-effect in the scales Physical Limitations,
Emotion, Social Exclusion, Social Inclusion and Total Score): However,
the effect sizes were small (d = 0.2) and the difference between IG
and WCG was not significant in most scales. The exception was the
Social Exclusion scale, where children and adolescents of the IG
(N = 54) showed a significant increase in quality of life compared to
the WCG (N = 61) (significant time-by-group effect, one-tailed
testing, d = 0.3).
3.2.2.3. Parent’s psychosocial outcomes. Parents of the IG (N = 72)
reported fewer epilepsy-related worries after the intervention
compared to the WCG (N = 71) (significant time-by-group effect,
one-tailed testing), with medium effect size (d = 0.5).
3.2.2.4. Medical outcomes. 23 parents of the IG (N = 70) and 18
parents of the WCG (N = 73) reported an increasing and 7 parents
of both groups a decreasing length of seizure-free episodes; the
difference between groups was not statistically significant (chi2
-
test). The intervention had no impact on health care utilisation
(contacts with physicians). However, none of the centres had
developed a routine to decrease scheduled follow-up visits
according to severity prior to the study to respond to decreased
needs.
3.2.2.5. Satisfaction with the FLIP&FLAP programme. Children and
adolescents (N = 98) and parents (N = 123) of both IG and WCG
reported their satisfaction with the programme 6 weeks after the
intervention.
76% of the children and adolescents rated the intervention as
very good or good. The mean satisfaction score of the parents was
3.60 (range of response choices 1–4), 96% scored 3 or 4.

of the FLIP&FLAP programme, a structured psycho-educational
intervention for children and adolescents with epilepsy and their
parents.
The formative evaluation led to a very intensive dynamic
developmental work phase, which produced great experience and
knowledge of patients’ and families’ needs. Lack of disease
knowledge and understanding, fear of stigmatisation and social
isolation were the main issues for children and adolescents. Many
patients lose consciousness during seizures, so that they can have
no direct experience of their disease. For these patients, the disease
may remain a ‘‘phantom’’ that, while influencing their lives, has no
concrete reality. This may lead to both an inappropriate concept of
the disease and subsequently poor compliance.
Adolescents reported more disease burden and anxieties than
children. They were highly concerned about the social effects of
their disease despite few real experiences of stigmatisation.30 For
many parents, their child’s epilepsy was a traumatic experience,31
much more than was expected by physicians. The experience of
sharing their own problems with other parents in the course was
described by most parents as very helpful. We recommend a
trained psychologist to be present to deal with potential
retraumatisation issues. Parents also were often insecure whether
their child’s behaviour was ‘normal’ and age-appropriate or
problematic; a special course unit dealing with developmental
issues is jointly conducted by a physician and a psychologist.
The summative evaluation demonstrated significant benefits
from the FLIP&FLAP programme for children, adolescents and
parents. The evaluation showed medium to large effects on both
medical and social aspects of epilepsy knowledge compared to
controls. It might be taken as read that an educational course
would produce improvement in disease knowledge; however, it is
significant that children and adolescents were able to transfer
what they had learned into general disease knowledge as
measured by an acknowledged standardised questionnaire. The
evaluation study confirmed the appropriateness of our childfriendly FLIP&FLAP model for all age groups.
Compared to adult German patients with epilepsy, the parents
of our sample displayed a high initial level of knowledge about
epilepsy, particularly medical aspects of the condition.32 Lower
educational status in parents and in adolescents was associated
with a lower initial level of epilepsy knowledge. However, all
families benefited from the course equally regardless of their initial
educational level.
After completing the programme, parents of the intervention
group exercised less direct control and reported increased selfmanaging skills of their child in taking medication. There was also
a small but significant improvement regarding children’s and
adolescents’ independence in everyday activities, such as staying
at a friend’s house or taking part in class activities. This may be
seen as an important improvement towards age-appropriate
autonomy. Children with epilepsy tend to be less independent
than healthy peers of the same age because of parent’s overprotective behaviour.4,33
The programme was successful in decreasing parental anxiety
concerning the epilepsy of their child. After attending the
FLIP&FLAP course, parents of the IG reported fewer epilepsyrelated worries compared to the WCG.
We found no general impact of the FLIP&FLAP programme on
children’s health-related quality of life. However, after attending
the course, children and adolescents of the IG reported better
HRQOL in the area of Social Exclusion compared to the WCG. This
finding may be particularly important as stigmatisation and
exclusion are still one of the main concerns of young people with
epilepsy.34,35
The children and adolescents rated the course as satisfactory;
parents very high. It should be emphasised that group homogeneity is an important factor for satisfaction with the course.
Parents, who had had previous experience with open groups in
which parents of children with severe cognitive disabilities
participated, reported that these groups had not jelled. In more
divergent groups parents with less affected children may be
embarrassed to talk about their troubles, feeling that these are
comparatively marginal. These parents’ own worries may therefore remain unexpressed.
Some limitations of the study should be taken into consideration. In its present conception, only children with age-appropriate
cognitive abilities can take part in the training programme, we are
therefore unable to generalize our findings to children with more
severe developmental disabilities.
Parents with a higher educational level were over-represented
in our study compared to the general German population. Wellinformed and educated families are more likely to access health
education-programmes. Professionals ought to be aware of this
problem and take care to encourage and support families in need to
participate.
During the formative evaluation, some parents gave reasons for
not participating in FLIP&FLAP courses. Some feared that their child
might experience another child’s seizure. Others stated they had so
far kept the disease a secret from the child. That shows that, for
many families, the condition is still a taboo which may limit the
access to comprehensive health care for the child with epilepsy.
The number of families able to be included in the study did not
meet the previously planned sample size. This may have reduced
the statistical ability to detect group differences.
5. Conclusion
FLIP&FLAP is an effective child- and family-centred programme,
which provides knowledge on medical and social aspects of
epilepsy and its treatment in an age-appropriate way. The special
strength of the programme is its great breadth: the practice-tested,
child-friendly, family therapeutic approach; a broad spectrum of
issues (medical, psychological, neuropsychological, legal); the
innovative explanation of medical facts in a language suited to
parents and children alike; last but not least in the carefully
composed training materials and manuals. The programme seems
well suited to fulfilling the needs of children and adolescents with
epilepsy as well as of parents.
