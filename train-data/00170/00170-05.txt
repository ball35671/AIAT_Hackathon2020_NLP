Introduction: The arterial blood gas measurement process is a painful and invasive procedure, often
uncomfortable for both the patient and the physician. Because the patient-related factors that determine the
difficulty of the process cannot be controlled, the physician-related factors and blood gas measurement
techniques are a modifiable area of improvement that ought to be considered. Many hospitals use insulin
syringes or syringes washed with heparin for the purpose of blood gas measurement because they do not have
blood gas–specific syringes. In this prospective cross-sectional study, we aimed to compare safety-engineered
blood gas syringes and conventional heparinized syringes used during the arterial blood gas extraction process in
terms of ease of operation, the physician-patient satisfaction, laboratory appropriateness, and complications.
Methods: Our study included patients whose arterial blood gas needed to be measured in the emergency
department and who agreed to participate in the study. Patients were randomly divided into 2 groups. The arterial
blood gas of the patients from the first group was measured by using conventional heparinized syringes, whereas
safety-engineered blood gas syringes were used to measure the arterial blood gas of the patients from the second
group. The groups were compared in terms of demographic data, the number of attempts, the physician and
patient satisfaction, early and late-term complications, and laboratory appropriateness of the taken sample.
Results: A total of 550 patients were included in our study in a 2-month study period. There were no significant
differences between patients in terms of sex, age, weight, height, body mass index, and wrist circumference. In
addition, the number of attempts (P = .489), patients' pain level during the procedure (P = .145), and the
degree of difficulty of the procedure according to the patient (P = .109) and physician (P = .554) were not
significantly different between the groups. After arterial blood gas extraction procedure, 115 patients (20.9%)
developed complications. In the conventional heparinized syringe group, the complication rate (n = 69; 25.1%)
was significantly higher compared with the group that used safety-engineered blood gas syringes (n = 46; 16%;
P = .0211). Localized pain, which is one of the most common early complications, was more frequent in the
conventional heparinized syringe group (19.3%). Complications in women (P = .003) and local pain (P = .01)
developed lesser in the second group that used safety-engineered blood gas syringes, and the patient-physician
satisfaction was higher in that group, as well. In the evaluation 48 hours after the procedure, the ratios of infection
and local hematoma were higher in the conventional heparinized syringe group (P = .0213 and P b .0001).
Conclusion: In this study, we did not find any significant differences between the conventional heparinized
syringes and safety-engineered blood gas syringes in terms of ease of operation, physician and patient
satisfaction, and appropriateness of the taken sample. However, patients whose arterial blood gas was extracted
by using safety-engineered blood gas syringes felt less pain and experienced fewer infections and hematomas at
their puncture site.

1. Introduction
Arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis is an important tool in assessing a
patient's acid-base status and to have an idea about respiratory
physiology. A widely used invasive method to measure the ABG is to
take an arterial blood sample from the radial, brachial, and femoral
arteries and analyze it in a blood gas analyzer [1]. The radial artery is
often preferred because of ease of access, presence of collateral

circulation, and being superficial at proximal of the wrist and because
it is easy to apply compression after the puncture [2].
Blood gas extraction is a painful and invasive process and is often
uncomfortable for both the patient and the physician [3]. Because
patient-related factors that determine the difficulty of the process are
not able to be controlled, one aim of focus ought to be to improve the
ABG measurement techniques and physician-related factors. In the last
10 years, the latest products of developing technology are branules and
safety-engineered blood gas syringes. The manufacturers claim that
these products are easy to use and are more useful in terms of patientphysician safety. There are very few studies regarding their use, and
most of them primarily focus on the blood test result reliability [4,6].
Every year, more than 35 million health care workers around the
world are faced with the risk of percutaneous injuries with
contaminated sharp objects [7]. Safety-engineered branules and
injectors may be advantageous in protection of the patient and the
physician from secondary injuries and infectious diseases in places
such as emergency departments (EDs), where the infectious state of
patients is unknown.
The number of injuries during injections with ABG syringes was
found to be higher than injuries during intramuscular/subcutaneous
injections [8]. Nelsing et al [9] reported that there was a 5.6% injury
rate while capping the needle and 4.2% injury rate during arterial
blood sampling. Carelessness was found to be the most common cause
of percutaneous injuries.
Another study showed that the most common work-related
accidents in the hospital were needlestick injuries (66%). Thirteen
percent of these cases occur during the blood collection process, 6%
during laboratory processing, and 6% while recapping the syringe [10].
In this study, we aimed to compare 2 types of syringes used for
ABG measurement: safety-engineered blood gas syringes and currently used conventional heparinized syringes in terms of ease of
operation, the physician and patient satisfaction, and complications.
2. Materials and methods
This cross-sectional, randomized, controlled prospective study
was conducted upon an approval of Clinical Trials Ethics Committee of
Dokuz Eylul University at Adult Emergency Care Department of Dokuz
Eylul University Hospital. A 1-hour training about the use of safetyengineered blood gas syringes was given to all ED doctors to minimize
the differences between the doctors' experience with the syringes.
Then, doctors performed all ABG measurements with safety-engineered blood gas syringes for 1 week.
The study included patients who visited the ED during the period of
May 1, 2012, to June 30, 2012. We included patients who had an ABG
sample obtained from the radial artery and who consented to
participate in the study. Patients were excluded from the study for the
following reasons: lack of consent from either the patient or a close
relative to be enrolled in the study; ABG measurement not from the
radial artery, whose radial artery could not be used (ie, lack of ulnar
circulation; conditions that cause hand circulatory disorders such as
Raynaud and Buerger disease, trauma, or hematoma at the area where
the ABG was planned to be measured; presence of an arteriovenous
fistula for dialysis); and those who had an abnormal Allen test result.
The patients were divided into 2 groups by using a simple randomization method (sealed envelope method). The patients' ABG was
measured by using either conventional heparinized syringe or safetyengineered blood gas syringe.
2.1. First conventional heparinized syringe group
The 1-cc insulin syringe (Hayat Tıbbi Aletler ve Oluklu Mukavva
San. Tic. AŞ, İstanbul, Turkey; 1 mL, 100 IU insulin super syringe)
with 26-gauge (G) needle tip (Fig. 1) was washed with 0.25 mL
(1000 IU/mL) heparin (Mustafa Nevzat Ilaç Sanayii AS, İstanbul,
Turkey; Nevparin Injectable 25 000 IU/5 mL, 1 vial). After flushing
out the heparin, the blood gas was measured.
2.2. Second safety-engineered blood gas syringes group
BD Eclipse injector 3-mL BD Preset syringe with BD Luer-Lok tip
25G ×1 (Becton, Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ; product
code 364393; Fig. 2) was used. Once in the artery, the syringe filled
automatically as a result of the arterial pulse pressure. After the
procedure, the protective cap was closed and the syringe was sent to
the laboratory.
Allen test was performed in the supine position with his/her hand
placed parallel to the body and, while adducted, the forearm was placed
in supination and the wrist was brought about 40° to dorsiflexion. The
puncture site was cleaned with an antiseptic solution (povidoneiodine). The arterial pulse was felt by placing the nondominant hand
index finger to the distal and the middle finger to the proximal. Then the
needle was advanced in the direction of the artery at an angle of 45° and
entered to the lumen of the radial artery. After receiving enough blood
into the syringe, the needle was removed and the puncture area was
cushioned with a gauze pad for about 5 minutes. The blood gas sample
was sent to the laboratory on ice at 0°.
The emergency medicine resident measuring the patient's ABGfilled
in the form and noted the ABG measuring physicians name; patient's
weight, height, and wrist circumference; the number of attempts; the
patient's pain scale during the procedure; whether there were
complications after the procedure (local pain, vascular injury, contact
with blood, the physicians or patients needlestick injury, vasovagal
response, thrombosis in artery, infection at the puncture site, air-blood
embolism, nerve injury, local hematoma); and acceptance and rejection
of samples by the laboratory (improper specimen transfer, hemolysis,
insufficient amount of blood, clotted sample).
The patient was asked to evaluate his/her pain experienced during
the procedure based on the visual analog scale (VAS) from 1 (no pain)
to 10 (worst possible pain).
The body mass index (BMI) was calculated based on patients' height
(in meters) and weight (in kilograms) by using the formula “weight/
height2
” Patients weighing less than 18.5 kg/m2 were considered
“underweight”; between 18.5 and 24.9 kg/m2
, “normal”; between 25
and 29.9 kg/m2
, “overweight”; and above 30 kg/m2
, “obese.”
Forty-eight hours after the procedure, the physician who
performed the procedure called the patients and asked them to
come back to the ED or if the patient was admitted to the hospital
visited the patient in his/her room. The physician examined whether
there was any infection at the puncture site, local hematoma, arterial
thrombosis, air-blood embolism, or nerve injury. Patients with whom
the physician talked on the telephone were asked questions regarding
their hand from which the ABG was measured. They were asked to
report whether they noticed any bruising, swelling, warmth, redness,
numbness, more stress in the hand compared with in the past, and
less feeling in the skin between the thumb and index finger compared
with other parts of the hand or any other symptoms.
2.3. Statistical analysis
Study data were analyzed by using MedCalc software (Ostend,
Belgium) statistical program, Version 12.3.0. The χ2 test was used to

analyze categorical variables, whereas t test was used for the analysis
of means. P b .05 was considered significant.
3. Results
During the period of May 1, 2012, to June 30, 2012, a total of 14 585
patients were admitted to the ED. Among 1316 patients whose ABG
was measured, 550 were included in our study (Fig. 3).
Among the patients included into our study, 232 (42.2%) were
female and 318 (57.8%) were male; the mean age was 68.9 ± 16.73
years (range, 17-99 years). There was no significant difference
between the groups in terms of age, weight, sex, height, wrist
circumference, and BMI (Table 1).
3.1. Number of attempts
The mean number of attempts to obtain the ABG sample with
conventional heparinized syringe group was 1.36 ± 0.73 (range, 1-8),
whereas that of safety-engineered blood gas syringe group was
1.28 ± 0.70 (range, 1-8). There was no significant difference between
the groups in terms of number of attempts (P = .489).
3.2. Pain scale during the procedure
The mean VAS score during the ABG measurement in conventional
heparinized syringe group was 3.47 ± 2.18 (range, 0-10), whereas
that of the safety-engineered blood gas syringe group was 3.03 ± 2.40
(range, 0-10). There was no statistically significant difference
between the groups in terms of VAS scale (P = .145).
3.3. The degree of difficulty of the ABG sampling procedure according to
the patients
Among the patients included in the study, the degree of
difficulty of the procedure was not asked from 75 patients because
of their level of consciousness. Their consent form was filled out by
a close relative. The ABG extraction process was “very easy”
according to 142 (29.9%) patients, “easy” for 179 (37.7%) patients,
“medium difficulty” for 105 (22.1%) patients, “difficult” for 42
(8.8%) patients, and “very difficult” according to 7 (1.5%) patients.
There was no significant difference between the 2 different types of
syringes in terms of the degree of difficulty according to the patients
(χ2 = 2.56, P = .1091; Fig. 4).
3.4. The degree of difficulty of ABG extraction procedure according to
the physicians
During the study, a total of 27 different physicians performed 550
ABG extraction procedures. Among those procedures, 225 (40.9%) were
“very easy,” 200 (36.4%) were “easy,” 90 (16.4%) were of “medium
difficulty,” 32 (5.8%) were “difficult,” and 3 (0.5%) were described to be

“very difficult.” According to the physicians, there was no significant
difference between the 2 syringes in terms of difficulty of ABG
extraction procedure (χ2 = 0.34, P = .5548; Fig. 5).
3.5. Laboratory evaluation
Among the received 550 ABG samples, 5 (0.9%) were rejected by
the laboratory. Two of them (0.4%) were improperly transferred, 1
(0.2%) had an insufficient amount of blood and 2 (0.4%) were rejected
due to clotting of the sample. In terms of sample rejection by the
laboratory there was no statistically significant difference between
the 2 syringe groups (χ2 = 0.672, P = .4124).
3.6. Complications after the procedure
In 435 patients (79.1%), no complications developed after the
procedure. Among 115 (20.9%) patients with complications, 69
belonged to the conventional heparinized syringe group and 46
were from the safety-engineered blood gas syringe group. The number
of early complications was significantly higher in the heparinized
syringe group compared with the group that used safety-engineered
blood gas syringes (χ2 = 5.321, P = .0211; Table 2).
The most common complication was local pain. Among 88 (16%)
patients who felt local pain during the procedure, 53 belonged to the
conventional heparinized syringe group (χ2 = 3.91, P = .0480). In
both groups, there was no significant difference between the sexes in
terms of local pain felt (χ2 = 0.314, P = .57). When women were
examined separately, local pain sensation was higher in the
conventional heparinized syringe group than the safety-engineered
blood gas syringe group (χ2 = 6.488, P = .01). However, in men,
there was no significant difference between the syringes in terms of
local pain (χ2 = 0.042, P = .83).
In this study, none of the patients in either group developed
complications (vasovagal response, nerve injury, air blood embolism,
patient needlestick injury, arterial thrombosis, or infection) during
the procedure.
3.7. The results of the evaluation 48 hours after the procedure
(late complications)
Forty-eight hours after the procedure, physicians were able to
reach 418 of 550 patients. Among those 418 patients, 123 (29.4%) had
developed local complications. Arterial thrombosis and nerve injury
were not significantly different between the groups. However, in
terms of infection and local hematoma, the conventional heparinized
syringe group had significantly more complications compared with
the safety-engineered blood gas syringe group (Table 3).
4. Discussion
This study is the first systematic study to compare the use of
safety-engineered blood gas syringes and heparinized insulin syringes
used during the ABG sampling procedure in terms of possible
complications, patient-physician satisfaction, and the degree of
difficulty of the procedure.
The ABG extraction process is painful and invasive, comfortable
neither for the patient nor the physician; ideally, it should be
performed in a single attempt. It is known that physician's experience
and patient's anatomical characteristics near the arterial puncture
site are instrumental to the success of the procedure [1]. We were not
able to find any literature regarding the average number of attempts
for successful ABG sampling. In our study, emergency medicine
residents performed the ABG sampling process. In the conventional
heparinized syringe group, the mean number of attempts was
1.36 ± 0.73, whereas in the group that used safety-engineered
blood gas syringes, the mean number of trials was 1.28 ± 0.70. There
was no statistically significant difference between the 2 groups in the
number of attempts.

Some complications such as hematoma, arteriospasm, air or clot
embolism, anaphylaxis secondary to local anesthetic, hemorrhage,
vascular damage, arterial occlusion, vasovagal response, and pain are
known to develop because of the ABG extraction procedure [11]. In
addition, late-term complications such as pseudoaneurysms have also
been reported [12]. However, clinical studies evaluating arterial
puncture-related complications are rare. Mortensen [13] has reported
the rate of those complications to be 11.3%. However, this study did
not evaluate subgroups of arterial puncture sites and minor
complications, as we did in our study. In our study, we found that
the rate of complications that developed after the ABG sampling
procedure was 20.9%. This rate may seem to be higher than the ones
reported in the literature; however, our patients did not develop
major complications and minor complications that occurred were
only temporary and did not require intervention. The most frequent
complication was local pain. Furthermore, the number of complications was higher in the conventional heparinized syringe group
compared with the group that used safety-engineered blood gas
syringes (25.1% and 16%, respectively). Although the conventional
heparinized syringe needle (26G) was relatively thinner compared
with safety-engineered blood gas syringes (25G), there was a
significant difference in favor of safety-engineered blood gas syringes
in terms of complication reduction.
In 1996, Giner et al [14] conducted a study with 270 patients and
reported that the local pain ratio was 33% during arterial puncture
without local anesthetic, whereas it was only 8% with the use of local
anesthetic. In our study, 16% of all patients experienced local pain.
Technological advances of recent years and the increase in educational and practical applications may be the reasons for our patients
experiencing less local pain compared with the study by Giner et al. In
the same study, the mean VAS score of placebo-treated patients was
3.01 ± 1.94. In another randomized controlled study by Hajiseyedjavady et al [15], the mean VAS score was 4.19 ± 1.43 in patients who
were not given any anesthesia. In our study, the mean VAS score in
conventional heparinized syringe group was 3.47 ± 2.18, whereas
the mean VAS score of the group that used safety-engineered blood
gas syringes was 3.03 ± 2.40, both of which were similar to the
aforementioned studies.
In 1966, Cole and Lumley [16] compared 21G and 23G syringes
used for ABG extraction. They evaluated puncture sites based on the
presence of a wound, bruising, or hematoma and absence of arterial
pulsation on first, third, and seventh days of the procedure. The most
commonly preferred artery was the radial artery, and the most
common complications were bruising and hematomas. In the same
study, the rate of bruising was determined to be 31.4% for 21G syringe
and 35.5% for 23G syringe. In our study, the most common
complication that developed after 48 hours was local hematoma
(57.2%); this rate was higher than the rate determined by Cole and
Lumley. In addition, the rate of local hematoma development was
higher in the conventional heparinized syringe group (41.5%)
compared with the group that used safety-engineered blood gas
syringes (15.7%), which is also lower than that reported by Cole and
Lumley [16].
All precautions should be taken in terms of occupational health
and safety in workplaces. On November 6, 2000, Occupational
Safety and Health Administration revised and signed into law the
“National Needlestick Safety and Prevention Act,” which focused on
the importance of the use of safer products [17]. All health care
professionals including doctors and nurses provide services on
behalf of the hospital. Contact with blood and body fluids
contaminated with infectious agents is known to be a common
occupational hazard for all health care workers. Health care
professionals working in ED s are at a higher risk for contact with
blood and body fluids [18]. Kakizaki et al [7] reported that the risk of
needlestick injury increased 2.5-fold in health care professionals
working more than 35 hours a week. In one study on nurses using
safe sharp products, conducted by Lamontagne et al [4], it was
determined that there was a 74% decrease in the risk of needlestick
injuries with the use of safer sharps products. In the same study,
authors mentioned that patients whose ABG needs to be measured
comprise 1% of the total patient population and the risk of
needlestick injury remains unchanged in these patients. On the
other hand, a study by Sohn et al [6] reported that the use of safer
syringes resulted in a greater than 50% decrease in percutaneous
injuries; a 57.3% decrease was seen in the low-risk percutaneous
injuries and 52.6% reduction in the high-risk percutaneous injuries
such as arterial puncture.
In places such as emergency services, where the infectious status
of patients is unknown, the use of safer products is known to reduce
the risk of needlestick injuries for health care professionals . In our
study, we did not detect any significant difference between
conventional heparinized insulin syringes and safety-engineered
blood gas syringes in terms of physicians' contact with the blood
and needlestick injuries. It is important to be cognoscente of the fact

that the transmission risk per HIV-infected needle contact is 0.3%; for
hepatitis B virüs, 26%; and for hepatitis C virüs, 1.8% [18]. Two
incidents of needlestick injury and 7 incidents of blood contact in
heparinized syringe group are important safety issues. On the other
hand, the major disadvantage of safety-engineered blood gas syringes
is the cost [6]. However, cost analysis focused on occupational
exposure to blood and body fluids showed that the expenditure for
each injury was ranged from $848 [19] to $4000 [20]. Therefore, the
use of safer syringes is even more important in terms of employee
safety. We did not calculate the cost in our study.
Evaluation of the quality of laboratory services by using quality
indicators and performance measures and collection and analysis of
data requires a systematic, transparent, and consistent approach [21].
Supplying the appropriate specimens for the laboratory is one of the
quality standards objectives. It decreases specimen rejection rates and
improves patient care. The international standard of this rate ranges
from 0.3% to 0.8% [21,22]. In a study conducted by Stark et al [22], the
total laboratory specimen rejection rate was 0.74%, whereas the
rejection rate of the specimens brought in from the ED was a
remarkable (1.97%). In another study by Jones et al [23], the specimen
rejection rate was 0.35%. In our study, the laboratory rejected 0.9% of
the 550 ABG samples. Two of those were due to improper specimen
transfer, 1 due to insufficient blood amount, and 2 due to clotting of
the sample. In terms of laboratory rejection, there was no significant
difference between the 2 syringe groups. The laboratory rejection rate
in our study was higher than the quality standards [21]. However, our
study was predominantly conducted in the emergency services
department, and we found a rejection rate that is lower than that
reported by Stark et al [22].
4.1. Limitations
In our study, only patients and physicians were surveyed about the
blood contact and needle stick injuries, whereas technicians that
measure blood gas in the laboratories were not surveyed. Second, a
prospective study focusing on infectious disease screening was not
done for people who had contact with the blood or had needlestick
injuries. After the procedure, only the Allen test was performed to test
for the presence of arterial thrombosis. The Doppler ultrasound was
not done. In addition, 132 patients could not be reached for the post–
48-hour assessment. The number of patients that could not be
reached for post–48-hour evaluation was higher in the conventional
heparinized syringe group; therefore, it may have affected the results
of the evaluation.
5. Conclusion
In our study, we did not detect any significant difference between
conventional heparinized insulin syringe and safety-engineered blood
gas syringe used for ABG extractions in terms of ease of operation, the
physician and patient satisfaction, and obtaining appropriate sample.
However, patients whose ABG extraction was done by using safetyengineered blood gas syringes felt less pain and developed fewer
infections and hematomas at the puncture site. The use of branules
and safety-engineered blood gas syringes may be advantageous in
protecting patients and physicians from secondary injuries and
infectious diseases in environments such as emergency services,
where the infection status of patients is often unknown. Although the
cost of these safer products may restrict their dissemination, longterm benefits should be carefully considered.
