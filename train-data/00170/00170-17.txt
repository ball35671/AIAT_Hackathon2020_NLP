 ABSTRACT
 OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect on staff- and patient-
 related complications of a needleless intermittent intravenous
 access system with a reflux valve for peripheral infusions.
 DESIGN: A 6-month cross-over clinical trial (phase I, 13
 weeks; phase II, 12 weeks) of a needleless intermittent intravenous
 access system (NL; study device) compared to a conventional
 heparin-lock system (CHL, control device) was performed during
 1991 on 16 medical and surgical units. A random selection of
 patients was assessed for local intravenous-site complications; all
 patients were assessed for the development of nosocomial bac-
 teremia and device-related complications. Staff were assessed for
 percutaneous injuries and participated in completion of product
 evaluations. A cost analysis of the study compared to the control
 device was performed.
 SEITING: A 1,100-bed, teaching, referral medical center.
 PATIENTS AND STAFF PARTICIPANTS: 594 patients
 during 602 patient admissions, comprising a random sample of all
 patients with a study or control device inserted within a previous
 24-hour period on study and control units, were assessed for local
 complications. The 16 units included adult inpatient general medi-
 cine, surgical, and subspecialty units. Pediatrics, obstetrics-
 gynecology, and intensive-care units were excluded. All patients on
 study and control units were assessed for development of nosoco-
 mial bacteremia and device-related complications. All staff who uti-
 lized, manipulated, or may have been exposed to sharps on study
 and control units were assessed for percutaneous injuries. Nursing
 staff completed product evaluations.
 INTERVENTION: The study device, a needleless inter-
 mittent intravenous access system with a reflux valve, was com-
 pared to the control device, a conventional heparin lock, for periph-
 eral infusions.
 RESULTS: During the study, 35 percutaneous injuries
 were reported. Eight injuries were CHL-related; no NL-related
 injuries were reported (P---.007). An evaluation of 602 patient
 admissions, 1,134 intermittent access devices, and 2,268 observed
 indwelling device days demonstrated more pain at the insertion
 site for CHL than NL; however, no differences in objective signs of
 phlebitis were noted. Of 773 episodes of positive blood cultures on
 study and control units, 6 (0.8%) were device-related (assessed by
 blinded investigator), with no difference between NL and CHL.
 Complications, including difficulty with infusion (P<.001) and dis-
 connection of intravenous tubing from device (P<.001), were
 reported more frequently with CHL than with NL. Of nursing staff
 responding to a product evaluation survey, 95.2% preferred the
 study over control device. The projected annual incremental cost
 to our institution for hospitalwide implementation of NL for inter-
 mittent access for peripheral infusions was estimated at $82,845, or
 $230 per 1,000 patient days.
 CONCLUSIONS: A needleless intermittent intravenous
 access system with a reflux valve for peripheral infusions is effec-
 tive in reducing percutaneous injuries to staff and is not associated
 with an increase in either insertion-site complications or nosoco-
 mial bacteremia. Institutions should consider these data, available
 institutional resources, and institution-specific data regarding the
 frequency and risk of intermittent access-device-related injuries
 and other types of sharps injuries in their staff when selecting the
 above or other safety devices (Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol
 1998;19:401-406) .
 Since the December 1991 publication of the Occupa-
 tional Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Blood-
 borne Pathogens Standard, healthcare facilities have been
 required to evaluate and implement measures to reduce
 percutaneous injuries.1 Nonetheless, despite the OSHA
 mandate and a Food and Drug Administration alert (urging
 the use of needleless or recessed needle systems),2 as well
 as the development of a variety of devices designed to
 reduce needlestick injuries, few studies have examined
 these safety devices comprehensively.

 402 INFECTION CONTROL AND HOSPITAL EPIDEMIOLOGY June 1998
 In 1991, the New York State Department of Health
 sponsored a prospective multicenter pilot study of such
 devices in 10 hospitals. As part of this study, we evaluated
 a needleless intermittent intravenous (IV) access system
 (not compatible with needle access) for peripheral infu-
 sions. This choice was based on a review of 1990 to 1991
 surveillance data from the Mount Sinai Medical Center
 showing that 12.5% of percutaneous injuries (39/313) were
 related to intermittent IV access devices (heparin locks) for
 peripheral IV infusion manipulations.3 In addition, there
 has been at least one documented occupational serocon-
 version to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) following
 a heparin-lock-related injury from a hollow-bore needle
 that had been used for infusion.4 This report presents our
 findings related to percutaneous injury rates, patient care,
 user satisfaction, and cost, following the introduction of a
 needleless IV infusion system.
 METHODS
 From July to December 1991, a crossover clinical trial
 (phase I, 13 weeks; phase II, 12 weeks) of a needleless inter-
 mittent IV access system (NL) compared to a conventional
 heparin-lock system (CHL) for peripheral infusions was con-
 ducted on 16 medical and surgical units of the Mount Sinai
 Medical Center, a 1,100-bed, acute-care, teaching hospital in
 New York City. During each phase, eight nursing units each
 used CHL or NL; at the crossover point, the devices were
 switched. The units were similar in staff-to-patient ratio and
 in type and degree of illness of the patients. During phase I,
 the units utilizing the NL were three general medical, two
 general surgical, otolaryngological, orthopedics, and trans-
 plantation (solid organ, including liver and renal) wards; dur-
 ing phase II, they were three medical, hematological, onco-
 logical, cardiothoracic surgical, general surgical, neurologi-
 cal, and neurosurgical wards.
 The Safsite needleless access system (NL; Braun
 Medical, Inc, Bethlehem, PA) consists of a one-way reflux
 valve connected to extension tubing that fits directly into the
 hub of an intravenous catheter. Unlike the rubber port of the
 CHL, the valve of the NL is incompatible with a needle.
 At the start of each study phase, education was pro-
 vided to nursing personnel on the study and control units.
 Information on Universal Precautions and infection control
 procedures, with particular reference to N catheters and
 handling of sharp objects, was included. In addition, study-
 unit personnel received direct hands-on training with NL.
 Infection control procedures included the following: inter-
 mittent N devices were to be removed or changed after 48
 to 72 hours,5 caps were to cover the NL valve at all times, a
 new cap was to be used following completion of every
 access procedure, and caps were not to be reused after
 being removed from the valve. Using a standardized form,
 we collected details concerning reported percutaneous
 injuries and associated devices and procedures.6 The hos-
 pital (OSHA) injury log was used to verify that all reported
 percutaneous injuries were included. As mucous mem-
 brane or nonintact skin exposures were not noted as a com-
 plication during staff manipulation of these devices, such
 exposures were not collected for analysis.
 A sample of study and control units was selected ran-
 domly each day (Monday-Friday) to enroll patients with a
 CHL or NL inserted within the previous 24 hours. For each
 patient, sites where a CHL or NL had been removed and cur-
 rent sites were assessed each day. Observations were per-
 formed by the study nurse (MR, 85% of observations) and
 other investigators (QS, JL, MD, 15%). Because the device
 was exposed to allow for access, observations were not
 blinded. Scores for current sites were recorded daily, and
 the past sites with the highest score were recorded. Obser-
 vations included palpation of the site, followed by dressing
 removal if the site was tender or redness was observed
 above the dressing. An assessment of erythema and puru-
 lence then was made. A score was assigned as follows: 0 (no
 pain, no redness above dressing); 1 (pain, no redness or
 cord); 2 (redness >2-3 cm above IV site, no pain or cord;) 3
 (pain and redness <2-3 cm above IV site, no cord); 4 (pain
 and redness >2-3 cm above the site, no cord); 5 (pain and
 redness >2-3 cm above N site with cord); 6 (purulent
 drainage plus findings #2 or #3 above); 7 (purulent drainage
 plus findings #4 or #5); 8 (not available for follow-up; modi-
 fied from Gaukroger PB7 and Mckee JM8). If the patient
 received a score of 4 to 7, the observer was to notify the staff
 to change the device. Patients were followed until discharge,
 death, or until 7 days after discontinuation of NL or CHL.
 All episodes of bacteremia on study and control units
 were categorized as device-related, with microbiological or
 clinical documentation, or non-device-related by an infec-
 tious disease specialist (BRM or MHM) blinded to device
 and nursing unit. "Device-related with microbiological and
 clinical documentation" included those bacteremias with
 evidence of infection at the N insertion site (ie, erythema
 or purulence) and culture of purulent material from the
 insertion site positive for the blood isolate. "Device-related
 episodes with clinical documentation" included those bac-
 teremias with clinical signs as noted above, without micro-
 biological documentation. If the blood isolate was a com-
 mon skin contaminant (eg, coagulase-negative staphylo-
 cocci, diphtheroids, Bacillus species, Proprionobacterium
 species, or micrococci), the patient had to have at least one
 of the following: fever >380C, chills, or hypotension, and
 either the organism was grown from =2 blood cultures
 drawn on separate occasions or the organism was grown
 from =1 blood culture and the physician instituted appro-
 priate antimicrobial therapy.9
 A survey concerning device-related complications
 and a product evaluation survey were distributed to nurs-
 ing staff during each study phase.
 Cost Analysis
 Use and costs for NL and CHL devices, as well as
 reported percutaneous injuries related to intermittent
 access devices for peripheral infusions, were collected and
 extrapolated to hospitalwide and annual use as detailed in
 the Appendix. The cost of treatment, counseling, and med-
 ical work-up following a percutaneous injury at our institu-
 tion has been estimated at $635.50 per case,10 including

 cost of the injured person's evaluation, counseling, and
 management (by practitioner time); serological testing;
 immunizations; antiviral treatment; source serological test-
 ing and counseling; and opportunity cost of lost work time
 of the injured person. The incremental expense for annual
 hospitalwide NL use then was converted to cost per 1,000
 patient days, based on 359,657 patient days (excluding well-
 baby nursery days) accrued in 1991.
 Data Analysis
 Data were analyzed using Epi Info software (version
 5, 1991, CDC, Atlanta, GA) and additional programs written
 in the C language. Our study design involved a crossover of
 matched nursing units with an interim examination of the
 data at the midpoint in time. The ideal unit of analysis,
 manipulation of the CHL or NL by a healthcare provider,
 was not observable. Therefore, rates of events per unit of
 time, assuming an underlying Poisson model, were com-
 pared using a sequential Wald likelihood-ratio test with a
 type 1 error rate of 0.05 and 80% power to detect a rate ratio
 of 0.10.
 RESULTS
 Percutaneous Injuries
 Thirty-five percutaneous injuries were reported dur-
 ing the study period, of which 27 were unrelated to inter-
 mittent access devices (14 on study and 13 on control
 units). All eight intermittent access-device-related injuries
 occurred on control units (0/25 study weeks for NL vs 8/25
 study weeks for CHL; P=.007).
 Local Complications at Insertion Site
 The insertion sites of 1,134 devices (including 516
 NL and 618 CHL) in 594 patients were assessed. The num-
 ber of observed indwelling device days was 2,268:1,070
 (47.2%) NL and 1,198 (52.8%) CHL. There were an addi-
 tional 1,201 observation-days following discontinuation of
 CHL or NL, yielding a total of 3,469 observation days.
 There were 190 (5.5%) days when devices could not be
 observed because of unavailability of the patient (ie, patient
 was off the floor or having a procedure done); however,
 observations continued on subsequent days.
 CHL devices were more likely to have a score >0 on
 the first observation day as compared to NL devices (odds
 ratio, 2.04; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-4.16; P<.05). How-
 ever, there was no statistically significant difference in
 scores for the two devices after the first day. Thus, for the
 first day of insertion, there were more local problems
 observed with CHL. However, these represented only pain
 at the site, without objective signs of phlebitis.
 Overall Outcome
 Every patient in the study was followed until dis-
 charge (76.9%), death (2.3%), or until 7 days after the dis-
 continuation of their last device (20.1%). The rate of death
 per 100 devices used did not differ significantly: 1.0 for NL
 and 1.5 for CHL (P>.05).

 * Note: on further analysis, backflow of blood through the valve of the NL valve actually was

 Bacteremia
 Of 773 episodes of bacteremia on study and control
 units, 6 were defined to be device-related, and 21 (2.7%) had
 an unidentified source. For device-related episodes, two were
 eliminated from the analysis, because both NL and CHL were
 present before the positive blood culture. Of the remaining
 four cases, three were associated with a CHL and one with an
 NL (P=.3). For unidentified-source cases, 7 had an NL during
 their hospitalization, and 14 had a CHL (P=.09).
 Device-Related Complications
 Of 702 device-complication surveys (Table 1), 350
 (50%) were completed (188 [54%] of 348 NL and 162 [46%]
 of 354 CHL; P<.05). Backflow of blood through the valve
 (NL) or heparin-lock adapter (CHL) was noted to have
 occurred at least one time for NL by a significantly higher
 percentage of respondents than for CHL (P=.01). However,
 several respondents who noted backflow with the NL com-
 mented that blood was seen in the extension tubing proxi-
 mal to the valve and did not backflow into or through the
 valve. Difficulty with infusion (P<.001) and disconnection of
 IV tubing (P<.001) were reported significantly more fre-
 quently with CHL than with NL. There was no difference in
 the frequency of heparin-lock access ports inadvertently
 disconnecting from angiocatheters for CHL and caps dis-
 connecting from the valve for NL (P=.15).
 Staff Satisfaction
 Response rates for the product evaluation survey
 were 57% for phase I (n=138) and 47% for phase II (n=93).
 Responses were as follows: 94% felt completely comfortable

 slight change in technique was required, 95% felt worker
 safety was increased, 84% felt patient safety was increased,
 and 95% preferred the study device over the standard
 device. According to 16%, the use of NL was affected by the

 urgency of the procedure. Reasons cited included that the
 NL system is not compatible with "code" medications
 (which often are prepackaged with long nonremovable nee-
 dles) and that the NL cannot be used with para-injectors for
 IV dye in radiological procedures, because the valve is not
 strong enough to sustain the required pressure of more
 than 75 psi.
 Cost Analysis
 As noted in Table 2, the projected incremental cost
 for annual hospitalwide implementation of NL for our insti-
 tution (in 1991) was $82,822, or $230 per 1,000 patient days.
 The cost per injury prevented (in 1991) was $1,593.
 DISCUSSION
 Due to limitations in the effectiveness of education
 regarding safe practices when handling sharps in reducing
 percutaneous injuries, the healthcare community needs to
 find acceptable safety devices that allow a reduction in the
 use of needles or provide safe covering of needles as soon
 as possible after use. Investigators have projected the
 potential for a reduction of up to 88% of sharp injuries either
 by the elimination of specific sharp devices or by substitu-
 tion with available safer products.11 An analysis of 1,095 per-
 cutaneous injuries at 10 New York City hospitals suggested
 that up to 66% of injuries could be prevented by currently
 available safer devices.12 Moreover, in the same study,
 reductions of up to 93% of IV-related injuries were demon-
 strated in the hospitals using needleless systems.6 It should
 be noted, however, that there may be a variation in the per-
 centage of reduction in needlestick injuries following imple-
 mentation of needleless systems according to the type of
 system. Systems that still allow needles to enter TV lines
 have reduced IV-line access-related injuries by 50% to
 90%13-16 whereas those that completely eliminate ports for
 needle access (as in this study) virtually have eliminated
 such injuries.17
 We projected a reduction of 52 injuries per year, all
 from needles inserted into intermittent IV access devices.
 This number is 33% greater than the number of CHL-
 related needlesticks reported at our institution during the
 previous year, likely due to a greater compliance with
 reporting during the study period. Even the projected
 reduction of 52 CHL-related injuries per year, based on
 study data, still may be an underestimate of the actual num-
 ber, due to the underreporting that is inherent in all needle-
 stick surveillance data that depends on reporting of injuries
 by healthcare workers.
 Although frequency of injury is an important consid-
 eration in targeting resources for prevention, selection of
 devices that are designed to prevent injuries likely to result
 in transmission of bloodborne pathogens should be con-
 sidered as well. Heparin-lock ports, in contrast to more dis-
 tal ports of IV tubing, have been demonstrated to contain a
 substantial amount of visible blood (20% in one series18).
 Furthermore, in the same study, occult blood was demon-
 strated on 11% of needles removed from these ports. In the
 one documented case of HIV transmission from a heparin-
 lock related injury, the needle, heparin-lock port, and intra-
 venous tubing all contained visible blood secondary to
 backflow. Although only one such case has been reported,
 the potential for HIV transmission with these types of
 injuries is clear.
 Since the introduction of devices designed to reduce
 needlestick injuries, few studies have carefully examined
 the results of implementation, including effects on patients
 and staff and the economic impact. Moreover, careful eval-
 uation of acceptance by users, effectiveness in prevention
 of injuries, assessment of potential new hazards, and evalu-
 ation of training required for implementation is necessary
 to determine applicability to the healthcare environment.19
 Our study demonstrated a 33% difference in total
 injuries between the study and control nursing units. While
 the number of observed device-related injuries in our study
 was small, and one ordinarily is cautious about drawing
 conclusions from small numbers, the magnitude of the dif-
 ference between the experimental and control devices was
 very large. Even with only eight injuries with CHL, an
 observed difference of this magnitude is not plausibly
 attributable to chance (P=.007). Neither can we identify any
 source of bias in our design that could account for an effect
 of this size. On the other hand, in that the difference in
 rates of device-related complications reported are relative-
 ly small, the difference needs to be interpreted cautiously.
 Although a 50% response rate to the survey is as good as
 one can hope for using this methodology, it is not large
 enough to preclude self-selection as an important factor
 accounting for the differences.
 Of respondents to the staff satisfaction survey, 95%
 preferred the needleless system. The response rate
 obtained for this survey is at the high end of the range of
 response rates generally obtained in studies of this nature.
 Nevertheless, it should be expected that self-selected parThis content downloaded from 130.113.111.210 on Tue, 12 Apr 2016 08:57:03 UTC

 ticipants will produce a biased picture of the results. The
 preferences for the new device over the standard
 expressed by our respondents were so strong, however,
 that, even allowing for appreciable self-selection bias, it is
 fair to conclude that the nursing population as a whole pre-
 ferred the device.
 Analysis of the effect of the NL on patients, including
 evaluation of the insertion site and episodes of nosocomial
 bacteremia related to intermittent N access devices, failed
 to demonstrate a significant difference between the NL and
 CHL. Although there have been previous studies evaluat-
 ing patient-related complications from needleless systems,
 the scope of these reports have not been comparable to
 ours.14'20
 Recently, several investigators have reported a possi-
 ble association of bloodstream infections with the use of
 needleless intravenous systems for the delivery of infu-
 sions through central venous catheters.21-25 Maki and col-
 leagues reported that Hickman catheters with valves were
 twice as likely to show lumenal contamination (8.3% versus
 3.8%). These valves also were associated with an increased
 incidence of bacteremia. However, the study had a small
 sample size, as only four bacteremias were reported.21
 Danzig and colleagues reported a higher incidence of
 bloodstream infections in home-healthcare patients receiv-
 ing total parenteral nutrition via central venous catheters
 using a needleless infusion system.22 An 80% increase in
 central venous catheter-related bloodstream infections was
 reported in pediatric hematology-oncology patients receiv-
 ing home health care.23 A fourth study reported an out-
 break of nosocomial bacteremia in patients with needleless
 central and peripheral N systems due to contamination of
 a multiuse saline solution bag and access pin used to fill
 syringes for N flushes.24 Most recently, an increased risk
 of bloodstream infections was reported in intensive-
 care-unit patients that was associated independently with
 duration of catheterization and a particular needleless sys-
 tem.25 In addition to associations with central lines, total
 parenteral nutrition, and particular needleless systems, it
 also should be noted that infection control practices may
 have been contributory in these occurrences. In our study,
 valves always were covered by a cap when not in use, valves
 were changed every 48 to 72 hours, and caps were changed
 after each manipulation of the system.
 There is very little published data on the cost impact
 of needleless-system implementation. The projected annu-
 al incremental cost of implementation for our hospital at the
 time of the study was calculated at $82,822, or $230 per
 1,000 patient days. The incremental cost per exposure pre-
 vented was estimated at $1,593. Although the number of
 injuries related to the standard device reported during the
 study period was higher than in the previous period, per-
 haps due to increased motivation by staff, it is likely that
 reporting still was not complete and that a greater number
 of injuries actually would have been prevented. Substantial
 underreporting has been noted during other studies, even
 during the implementation phases of safety devices.26 In
 the only other study presenting a cost analysis, Gartner
 analyzed the 6-month cost of a needleless system in a 500-
 bed facility, showing a cost savings of $1,291.13 However,
 the institution size, needleless system costs, incidence of
 needlestick injuries, and needlestick injury costs were dif-
 ferent than ours. Furthermore, the values included in a cost
 analysis likely will change over time in any institution, there-
 by effecting the incremental costs of implementation. Of
 particular note is the recent change in recommendations
 for HIV postexposure prophylaxis to include multidrug anti-
 retroviral therapy, thereby increasing the mean cost per
 needlestick injury. In addition, the actual cost to an institu-
 tion of a particular safety device may vary according to indi-
 vidual or buying-group contracts. Nonetheless, the sub-
 stantial cost of many safety devices now available remains
 an important concern to healthcare institutions. Price
 reductions by industry likely will be necessary to allow
 healthcare employers to provide proven effective engineer-
 ing controls to reduce sharps injuries. In addition, perhaps
 the distribution of dollars spent on healthcare-worker pro-
 tection from bloodborne pathogens needs to be reevaluat-
 ed as more effective safety devices become available.
 We hope this comprehensive analysis of various
 device-related outcomes may serve as a prototype for insti-
 tutions to use when selecting and evaluating devices
 designed to reduce percutaneous injuries.

 APPENDIX
 DETAILS OF COST ANALYSIS METHODS
 1. The incremental cost of implementing NL was estimated based on device use, cost of devices, and number and cost of preventable injuries. The
 following formula was used: (projected annual cost NL) - (projected annual cost of CHL) - (projected cost of preventable injuries). The annual
 cost of NL or CHL for hospitalwide use was estimated as follows: [projected annual number of NL valves (or CHL access ports) -unit cost] + [pro-
 jected annual number of caps-unit cost]. For NL, caps were used to cover both the valve and connecting end of IV tubing used for intermittent
 infusion(s); for CHL, caps were utilized to cover the IV tubing only. The cost of preventable injuries was estimated as follows: [ (number of
 injuries related to peripheral intermittent IV access de-vice) x (institutional cost of percutaneous injury, estimated at $635.50 per case in 199111)].
 2. Study period was 25 weeks, devices were used on only half of study units at any one time, and study units represented 71% of total hospital units.
 Therefore, the number of valves used during the study period was multiplied by (52/25) (2) (100/71) to calculate annual hospitalwide projec-
 tion.
 3. Projected number of caps annually (NL) was based on the following formula: (161) (365 d/y) (5.8 caps/device day), where 161 is the estimated
 number of intermittent Ws existing on any given day hospitalwide, based on actual audit counts during the study period, and 5.8 caps per device
 day represents a weighted average based on the following: 56% of intermittent peripheral IV access devices used for medication administration
 or flushes (mean, 4 accesses/d, 8 caps/d [4 access valve, 4 N tubing]); 44% of intermittent peripheral IV access devices placed only to be avail-
 able if access needed for flushes only, (3 accesses/d, 3 caps to cover valve only); mean (5.8) = .56 (8) +.44(3).
 4. Projected number of caps annually (CHL) based on above formula in (2) but (caps/device day) was 2.24, based on weighted average of (.56
 [4] + .44 [0]): 4 caps/d for medication administration, 0 caps for flushes only.
 5. Projected annual number of percutaneous injuries prevented by using NL was estimated as follows. The total estimated number of CHL-related
 injuries at the Mount Sinai Medical Center without NL during the 25-week study period included 8 that actually occurred on the control wards,
 8 that were estimated would have occurred on the study wards without NL (because study and control wards were matched), and 10 that
 occurred on wards not involved in the study. Thus, 26 injuries occurred in 25 weeks, or approximately 52 injuries would have occurred in 1 year.
 The cost of treatment, counseling, and medical work-up following a percutaneous injury at our institution has been estimated at $635.50 per
 case." Assuming NL had the potential to eliminate all 52 heparin-lock-related injuries, approximately $33,023 would have been saved.
 6. There are 359,657 (excluding well-baby nursery) patient days in 1991. Therefore, all costs were divided by 359,657 and then multiplied by 1,000
 to determine cost per 1,000 patient days.
 Abbreviations: CHL, conventional heparin-lock system; IV, intravenous; NL, needleless intermittent intravenous access system.
