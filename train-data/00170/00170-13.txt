Impact of a Recapping Device on
Venepuncture-Related Needlestick Injury

ABSTRACT
In a 33-month prospective analysis of needlestick
injuries, venepuncturists working under Centers for
Disease Control (CDC) guidelines for handling used
needles were shown to incur a needlestick injury for
every 3,175 to 4,006 needle-handling procedures. On
the other hand, users of a simple device designed to
reduce the risk of injury when recapping used needles
were shown to incur a needlestick only once in every
16,100 venepunctures performed (P<0.001). This represents a fourfold reduction in the rate of needlestick
injuries. We thus question the effectiveness of the CDC
nonrecapping policy. [Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol
1989; 10(1):21-25.]
INTRODUCTION
Used hypodermic needles are a major hazard to health
care workers. The risk of acquisition of blood-borne viruses such as hepatitis B by needlestick is high.1 The risk of
transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV), based on evidence of HIV seroconversion, is considerably less although still a cause for concern. It is
noteworthy that nine documented cases of needlestick
transmission of HIV have been reported.2-7
Because a large proportion of potentially preventable
needlestick injuries occur on resheathing or recapping
the needle after use, the Centers for Disease Control
(CDC) has issued warnings against replacing the sheath
over the needle and has recommended that the needle be
disposed of uncovered.8
We report a 33-month prospective analysis of needlestick injuries in a private pathology laboratory carrying
out 1,000 to 1,100 venepunctures daily (involving over
715,000 venepunctures total), which is an extension of a
study previously reported.`' We have demonstrated a fourFrom the Adelaide Children's Hospital, North Adelaide, South Australia

fold reduction in frequency of needlestick injuries
through the use of a recapping device.
This study, although observational, provides an indication that the official nonrecapping guidelines are likely to
be ineffective. In essence, the CDC guidelines exchange
one dangerous activity for another and probably have
little effect on reducing needlestick injury rates.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The "Needle Guard" (BioSafe Products Ltd, PO Box
9027, Auckland, New Zealand [world patents pending]) is
a plastic shield with a central hole into which the sheathed
needle is placed (Figure 1). The guard grips the needle
sheath so that it stays in place when the needle is withdrawn. On completion of the venepuncture or injection
the needle is replaced in its sheath-with the shield
providing protection against pricking-and discarded
into a container ("Needle Safe," BioSafe). This study is a
continuation of a previously published study.9
We examined records of all venepuncture-related needlestick injuries incurred by staff at the Medical Laboratory, a private pathology laboratory serving a population
of about 450,000 in Auckland. Over the course of the
study period the laboratory had employed between 59
and 70 full-time venepuncturists who carried out 1,000 to
1,100 venepunctures daily, five days a week, using evacuated blood tubes. For the period January 1984 to September 1984 (nine months) the study was retrospective

and covered 195,000 venepunctures. Prospective data collection began in October 1984 when the laboratory
adopted the CDC recommendation of not recapping used
needles, and staff began using forceps to remove needles
from blood-tube holders. In April 1985, after an active
education program, most staff abandoned this procedure
in favor of the Needle Guard recapping device. By the
end of May 1985 the device was in regular use by 40 of the
59 venepuncturists; of the remainder, 5 used the Needle
Guard only occasionally, 5 continued with the CDC
method, and 9 took no special precautions. The number
of venepuncturists increased to 70 in late 1985/early 1986;
47 used the device routinely and 23 were regarded as
nonusers. Staff turnover fluctuated throughout the study
period so that the groups of individuals studied did not
remain constant. Data collected on each injury included
the date and mode of injury and whether or not the
recapping device was in use at the time.
RESULTS
Figure 2 shows the monthly rate of needlestick injuries
per number of venepunctures performed. Injury rates
are shown for users of the recapping device and nonusers.
Table 1 shows rates of needlestick injury over the course of
the study period. The monthly number of staff and
monthly total number of venepunctures have been taken
into account. For the period when no special precautions
were in use (January to September 1984) one needlestick
injury occurred in every 3,421 venepunctures out of a total
of 195,000 venepunctures performed. While the CDC
nonrecapping recommendations were in use (October
1984-March 1985) one needlestick injury occurred for
every 3,175 needle procedures out of a total of 127,000
venepunctures performed. For the total period (January
1984-March 1985 [322,000 venepunctures]) the injury
rate was 1 in 3,265 venepunctures performed. During the
33-month study period (715,348 venepunctures), 1 injury
for every 16,100 venepunctures was recorded for users of
the recapping device, however, the rate for nonusers was 1
in every 4,006 venepunctures. No recapping injuries were
recorded in staff using the device. The circumstances of
the injuries (not recorded in the retrospective phase of the
study) are shown in Table 2. Of the 88 total needlestick
injuries recorded since the introduction of the device (33
months), 58 affected nonusers and 30 affected users of
the device, corresponding to 232,348 and 483,000 venepunctures respectively. Recapping injuries accounted for
14 of 88 (15.9%) of the total injuries and were confined to
nonusers of the device and accounted for approximately
one quarter (14/58) of the injuries in this group. Injuries
during needle disposal accounted for 22/88 (25%) of
needlesticks and only six of these occurred in users of the
device. Removal of the needle from the patient was the
most hazardous aspect of venepuncture, accounting for
half the total number of injuries (43/88). Movement of the
patient during needle removal accounted for many of
these injuries.

DISCUSSION
At the International Conference on the Acquired
Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) in Atlanta,
Georgia in April 1985'" and subsequently" it has been
shown that the majority of needlestick injuries occurred
during needle recapping. Because of this high rate of
injury from recapping needles, the Centers for Disease
Control (CDC) has recommended that needles not be
recapped.8 This recommendation was set up in an
atmosphere of growing fear of HIV in an attempt to
prevent inoculation injuries and was supported by little
scientific data. The CDC policy of nonrecapping was
designed to reduce the risk of needlestick injuries. It is
unfortunate that the policy has resulted in a potentially
more dangerous situation where "downstream" injuries,
away from the bedside, occur as a result of hazardous,
naked needles. Although hospital data are still expected,
our study showed that 25% of all injuries occurred during
disposal of uncovered needles. Elsewhere it is increasingly
recognized12 that an important number of needle injuries, particularly those occurring during disposal, are
inflicted by uncapped needles. These and recapping injuries are potentially preventable.
Persons injuring themselves at the bedside have an
advantage in knowing the source of the exposures and
seeking prophylaxis where appropriate, whereas with

"downstream" injuries the victim often has no possibility
of determining whose blood was on the offending needle.
We have shown that safely returning the needle to its
sheath using a recapping device greatly reduces the risk of
"downstream" exposure so that recapping of used needles
can be made almost completely risk-free in the controlled
environment of an outpatient laboratory. We recognize
that our study has certain limitations in that it was observational in nature, was not a controlled trial, and did not
address all aspects of needle use as only venepuncturerelated injuries using a vacuum tube collection system
were studied. Nevertheless, the information relating to
this aspect of needle handling was very accurate and
detailed. Information relating to over a million venepunctures was recorded and true rates of needle injury
were obtained. Based on observed needlestick injury
rates, nonusers of the recapping device could be expected
to incur a needlestick injury for every 3,175 to 4,006
procedures, whereas users of the device were at considerably less risk from needlestick injury with only 1 injury
occurring in every 16,100 venepunctures (P<0.001).
The cost of needlestick injury can be measured in both
human and monetary terms. In the United States the
mean cost for needlestick incidents in 1984 was calculated
to be $64.50.'3 Currently the estimated cost to a hospital
per needlestick is $110.14 These costs take into account
laboratory testing, treatment (excluding hepatitis B
immunoglobulin [HBIG], and hepatitis B vaccine), lost
work time, and care charges. The cost of HBIG now
exceeds $300.15-17 If all exposed employees are treated
prophylactically, the cost per case averted is $15,318 in a
high-risk population (prevalence of HBsAg = 5%) and
$56,571 in a general hospital population (prevalence of
HBsAg = 1%).'5 In human terms there is no accounting
for stress associated with the risk of blood-borne virus
infection, especially HIV.
In attempting to protect health professionals the CDC
has produced guidelines designed to reduce the risk of
needlestick injuries. However, opting for a nonrecapping
policy without evidence of efficacy may be counter-productive. In addition, the CDC nonrecapping policy has
several theoretical disadvantages including a negative psychology in which failure to involve the needle user in any
active way tends to distance the user from the "point" of
the exercise. Large, expensive, puncture-resistant needle
receptacles must be close at hand for all situations. It
would clearly be expensive to have these receptacles at
each bedside and work site. Small, inexpensive, portable
receptacles were close at hand in work situations during
our study. Needle injuries may occur from the time the
needle is removed from the patient until it reaches its
receptacle which, if large and affixed to walls, may be
some distance from the site of needle use.
Injuries continue to occur at a high rate as has been
shown in this study and by the number of participants in
the cited studies.2,10,11,18 In a study examining the
impact of a rigid, puncture-resistant container system on
needlestick injuries,'" it was shown that although disposal-related injuries decreased following implementation of the system, needlesticks associated with procedures and those resulting from loose needles
("downstream" injuries) significantly increased. A similar
study showed that changing to rigid, puncture-resistant
needle receptacles changed the type but not the overall
number of injuries." It is noteworthy that despite the
implementation of the CDC nonrecapping guidelines,
the recapping injury rate remained unaltered. Further,
there are nine cases of HIV transmission by unintentional
needle inoculation and documented by seroconversion2-7
and four others without documented seroconversion.7 It
is not possible to say whether or not the nonrecapping
guidelines played a part in promoting these unfortunate
needlestick injuries, yet, they occurred despite the guidelines. This clearly emphasizes the need for more effective
preventive measures.
The reasons for noncompliance of safety guidelines are
ill-understood but it is probable that a broad spectrum of
compliance/noncompliance is present among health personnel. It is apparent that some persons will respond
better than others to education and new systems. We
found that 84% of the venepuncturists took up the system
of safe recapping for routine use after active education. It
is also noteworthy that staff having multiple injuries were
noted to be inconsistent in their approach to needle handling. This possibly could relate to a particular personality
type for whom education programs are likely to fail. Perhaps one reason for the high acceptance rate of the safe
recapping system is that it uses positive psychology by
involving the needle user in his or her own protection and
reinforces the "point" of the exercise with every needle he
or she recaps. Used needles are resheathed after use and
are no longer a hazard. Resheathed needles cannot penetrate the disposal container, which can occur with naked
needles. However, impervious receptacles should prevent
this. Nevertheless, resheathed needles reduce the hazards
of an overfull container. The recapping device can be
easily carried by the user at all times and is disposable or
reusable. There is no immediate necessity to dispose of
the covered used needle; it can be carried safely to a
receptacle. Alternatively, a small receptacle, as used in our
study, can be conveniently carried without encumbering
the needle user.
Clearly, recapping devices are in direct conflict with the
official guidelines. It is becoming increasingly recognized'2 that the official guidelines are not very effective
and alternative solutions should be sought. Numerous
devices are now being marketed but so far there have been
no controlled trials to demonstrate their efficacy. Our
study, although uncontrolled for reasons of ethics (personal liberty) and staff turnover, is still valid as it compared injury rates in staff who used or did not use a
recapping device. Early in the study it became quite
apparent that marked differences in injury rates existed
between users of the device and nonusers. From an ethical
standpoint it was thus difficult to justify a controlled trial
by enforcing the use or nonuse of the device in two groups
of staff. The voluntary nature of our study overcame any
ethical problem. Trials of the recapping device used in
this study are underway in different hospital settings
using syringe needles.
It should be apparent that the uncapped needle will
always be a hazard. Provision for the use of resheathing

devices in future policy guidelines should contribute to
lower rates of needlestick injury in the laboratory setting
and probably also in the hospital setting. It is encouraging to see that the UK Advisory Committee on Dangerous
Pathogens (ACDP) now recognizes that there is a safe
means by which needles can be recapped. Although they
recommend nonrecapping generally, they allow it if it can
be done safely. In their revised guidelines (June 1986), the
ACDP state in their "Precautions for Invasive Procedures
Including Specimen Taking" that . . . "as approximately
40 percent of self-inoculation accidents occur while
resheathing needles, this must not be done unless there is a
safe means available. "20 Our data show that the recapping
device used in this study is a practical, nonhazardous
means by which needles can be resheathed and is an
effective needlestick prophylactic in the setting of an outpatient laboratory. It remains to be evaluated in the hospital setting.
In view of our findings we thus question the CDC's
nonrecapping policy. Proof of efficacy of such a policy
should be obtained so that medical workers can make an
informed decision as to how best they can protect themselves from the risks associated with used needles.
