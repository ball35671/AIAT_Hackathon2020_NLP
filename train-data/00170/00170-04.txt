Bloodborne pathogen exposures are a recognized occupational hazard for health care workers (HCWs).1-3 Percutaneous injury (PI) from contaminated needles and other sharp
instruments (hereafter, “sharps”) is the most efficient mode
of transmission for occupationally acquired bloodborne pathogen infection4 and has been associated with increased risk
of disease from more than 20 different infectious agents.5
Bloodborne pathogens of substantial concern include human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and
hepatitis C virus (HCV). It is estimated that the risk of developing HIV infection after experiencing a percutaneous injury with an HIV-contaminated needle is 0.3%.6 The risk of
being infected with HBV after a percutaneous injury with an
HBV-contaminated needle is 23%-37%7 and the risk of developing HCV infection is 1.8% after a percutaneous injury
with an HCV-contaminated needle.8-11 The risk from exposure
of nonintact skin to contaminated blood is unclear but is less
than the risk from mucous membrane exposure.12
The first cases of occupationally acquired HIV infection
were reported in the 1980s.13 As of December 2001, there
have been 57 documented cases attributed to occupational
exposure in the United States and 138 more considered possibly occupation-related.14,15 There is no cure or effective vaccine for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS); although postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) is available after HIV
exposure and can be effective in reducing seroconversion,16
there have been documented cases of seroconversion despite
receipt of PEP.17
National case surveillance data indicate that 14% of HCWs
exposed to HIV seroconverted despite receiving PEP.2 Furthermore, antiretroviral PEP may lead to side effects, as a
result of which HCWs may discontinue the medication prematurely or may be unable to work while taking these medications.17-19 Although a vaccine against HBV is available,20
not all HCWs avail themselves of the vaccine, and the HBV
immune globulin given to nonimmune HCWs as postexposure therapy is 75% effective and does not always prevent
HBV infection.21 There is neither vaccine nor PEP available

for HCV infection, although early interferon treatment is
associated with a higher rate of resolved infection.22
Formal efforts to prevent exposure to bloodborne pathogens started in 1985,23 when the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC) recommended the use of standard
precautions by HCWs. In 1987, this recommendation was
updated24 and in 1991, the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration (OSHA) promulgated the Bloodborne Pathogen Standard,25 of which standard precautions were a cornerstone.25,26 Even with the introduction of this regulation,
PI—including needlesticks—resulting in bloodborne pathogen exposure, which is one of the most common occupational
injuries in hospitals,4 continued to be a concern.27,28 Recent
estimates indicate that 384,325 PIs involving contaminated
sharps occur annually among hospital-based HCWs .29 Since
the publication of OSHA’s Bloodborne Pathogen Standard,
various devices have been developed to help reduce the risk
of needlesticks and other sharps injuries.30-34 OSHA revised
the Bloodborne Pathogen Standard in an effort to decrease
PIs that lead to bloodborne pathogen exposure. The revised
standard requires that employers select safer needle devices
as they become available. These revisions, mandated by the
Needlestick Safety and Prevention Act, were adopted in October 2001.4 This act placed safety devices, already in use,
under the umbrella of the Bloodborne Pathogen Standard
and provided regulatory oversight and stimulus for exploring
the more widespread introduction and use of safety devices.
Recent studies indicate that certain types of engineered
sharps injury prevention devices (ESIPDs) are associated with
significant reductions in PI rates, including devices such as
bluntable or resheathable vacuum tube blood collection devices for phlebotomy procedures,35 and resheathable winged
steel needles for intravascular access procedures.36 The 2001
EPINet report noted a sizeable decrease in the PI rate from
1999 to 2000, from 40 to 34 PIs per 100 occupied beds. This
decline was attributed, in part, to the mandated use of safer
needle devices.37 Although an assortment of safety devices has
been available for several years, data are sparse with respect
to the impact of specific devices on injury reduction.36 This
study was designed to evaluate the effect of introducing an
ESIPD, specifically an intravenous (IV) catheter stylet, on
the incidence of percutaneous bloodborne exposure among
HCWs.
methods
Study Design, Setting, and Participants
This controlled, retrospective, interventional, before-after study
was conducted over a period of 3 years (from January 1998
through December of 2000) at the affiliate clinics and hospitals of an urban medical center. It was designed to examine
the effect of introducing a safer needle device on the incidence
of percutaneous bloodborne pathogen exposure. Participants
were HCWs at risk for bloodborne pathogen exposure from
contaminated needles during the course of their daily work
(housestaff, attending physicians, medical students, nurses,
nursing assistants, emergency medical technicians, and environmental service workers). These HCWs undergo mandatory annual training on standard precautions for 1.5 hours
at a safety fair, including training on reporting procedures
for an exposure. HCWs who sustain a needlestick injury are
required to report the exposure to the Postexposure Management Program (PEMP), in accordance with hospital policy, and the employee is treated according to CDC guidelines.38 A confidential log of these injuries is maintained that
includes information on the date and time of the incident,
the type and brand of sharp involved, and whether an ESIPD
was used.
Intervention
The safer needle device chosen for this study was an IV catheter stylet with a safety-engineered feature (a retractable protection shield). It was placed in the clinics and on hospital
units in lieu of other IV catheter devices. All other IV catheter
devices were removed from the clinics and hospital wards
and were no longer available after the beginning of the intervention period (June 30, 1999). Other sharp devices (eg,
phlebotomy needles, insulin needles, and tuberculin needles)
were replaced by ESIPDs at different rates and did not undergo the rapid transition to safer needle devices that was
seen with the IV catheter ESIPDs. Training was provided on
the use of ESIPDs at various times during the study period
as the devices were introduced. Suture needles, used as the
comparison group, were not replaced and were the only sharp
device type that remained constant throughout the study
period.
Data Collection and Analysis
The data collected for this study were obtained from the
Center for Occupational and Environmental Medicine PEMP’s
2 computerized database systems, EPINet and a database created with Microsoft Access. These databases contain information pertaining to all sharps-related injuries that HCWs
have sustained since 1988. The EPINet database houses information pertaining to sharps-related injuries that occurred
after 2000, and the database created with Microsoft Access
houses information pertaining to sharps-related injuries that
occurred prior to 2000. The HCWs’ medical records were
used in the event that further clarification was needed.
The types of sharps involved in the incidents were identified
and recorded. Only PIs that resulted from suture needles, IV
catheters prior to the intervention, and IV catheter ESIPDs
after the intervention were used in this analysis. The devices
involved in the incidents were identified. The incidence rate
of PIs in the study population was evaluated for 18 months
before and 18 months after the intervention. Each 18-month
interval was further subdivided into three 6-month periods,
extending over a period of 3 years from January 1998 to
December 2001. The three 6-month periods before and after

the intervention were examined and compared for incidence
of percutaneous exposure resulting from suture needles and
IV catheters (with and without the safety device). The number
of HCWs employed during these 6-month periods was also
calculated. Data are presented as the number of PIs per 1,000
employees. To determine differences in the incidence rates
between the 2 study periods, we used the Fisher exact test.
All analyses were performed using SAS statistical software
(SAS Institute). P values less than .05 were considered statistically significant.
results
The Table presents the number of PIs and the PI rates for
reported incidents attributed to IV catheters and suture needles during the 18-month preintervention period. The injury
rate associated with IV needles remained relatively stable over
each 6-month period during the 18-month preintervention
period, varying from 2.5 to 2.3 PIs per 1,000 HCWs. The
injury rate associated with suture needles varied from 1.5 to
2 PIs per 1,000 HCWs. The Table also presents the number
of PIs and the PI rates for reported incidents attributed to
the IV catheter ESIPD and the numbers and rates for PIs
associated with suture needles during the 18-month postintervention period. The rate of PIs that resulted from the IV
catheter ESIPD decreased over each consecutive 6-month interval from 1.9 to 0.2 PIs per 1,000 HCWs, whereas the rate
of injuries sustained as a result of suture needles increased
over each consecutive 6-month interval from 1.9 to 6.1 PIs
per 1,000 HCWs.
The Figure illustrates the PI rate during the preintervention
and postintervention periods. The number of employees was
averaged over each of the 18-month periods to calculate the
injury rate. There were 3,720 employees during the preintervention period and 4,284 during the postintervention period. The number of PIs and the rate of PIs sustained from
suture needles doubled in aggregate from the preintervention
to the postintervention period; the number increased from
20 to 46, and the rate increased from 5.3 to 10.7 PIs per
1,000 HCWs. This increase was statistically significant (P !
.008). The number of PIs and the rate of PIs sustained from
IV catheters and IV catheter ESIPDs decreased from the preintervention to the postintervention period, from 27 to 13
injuries, and from 7.3 to 3 PIs per 1,000 HCWs. This decrease
was statistically significant ( ). P ! .01
discussion
This study was designed to evaluate the effect of introducing
an ESIPD on the PI rate in HCWs and adds to the literature
on the effectiveness of safety-engineered devices in reducing
PIs. We assessed the impact of one intervention, the introduction of an IV catheter ESIPD on the PI rate at one urban
medical center, by comparing the injury rates associated with
another device, suture needles, which were not changed. The
data show that the rate of IV catheter–related PIs decreased
significantly after the safety device was introduced, whereas
the rate of suture needle–related PIs actually increased significantly during the intervention period. The ESIPD used in
this study was an IV catheter stylet with a safety-engineered
feature (a retractable protection shield), which was placed in
the medical center’s clinics and hospital wards at the start of
the intervention period, as a replacement for all other IV
catheter devices. Our results indicate that the PI rate for
reported incidents attributed to IV catheter use decreased by
50% between the preintervention and postintervention periods, a statistically significant decrease. Indeed, this rate decreased in a linear fashion over each 6-month period during
the postintervention period, yet the rate remained relatively constant during the preintervention period. On the
other hand, the percutaneous injury rate attributed to suture needles increased significantly during the postintervention period.

This study indicates that the use of an IV catheter ESIPD
led to a significant reduction in the PI rate in this HCW
population, and consequently to a decreased risk of exposure
to bloodborne pathogens. As there was no reliable data on
the number of IV catheters or suture needles used or purchased during the study period, the incidence of PIs per 1,000
HCWs was used to calculate the rates. The incidence of PIs
sustained from suture needles might have been increased
because the introduction of ESIPDs led to increased HCW
awareness of the importance of PI reporting, resulting in an
increased trend in overall reporting. However, this presumptive behavior change in reporting status after the introduction
of ESIPDs has not been borne out in other studies.39
One might also surmise that the decreased incidence of PIs
attributed to the IV catheter ESIPD during the postintervention period was the result of increased compliance with standard precautions. However, the presence of a control group
showing the opposite finding makes this assumption unlikely.
Another explanation for the increase in the suture needle PI
rate in the postintervention period is that the University’s
PEMP staff may have increased tracking efforts after the introduction of the ESIPDs. This increased tracking, however,
should affect reporting of all injuries sustained from all devices, yet the number of reported injuries from the IV catheter
ESIPDs did not increase. As the number of employees increased gradually over the years, one might expect the absolute number of injuries to increase in both groups. This
did not occur in the intervention group. In addition, there
were no changes in the policies and procedures during the
intervention period that might account for these results.
The observed linear decrease in IV catheter–related injury
rates after the introduction of the ESIPD might also reflect
a learning curve. As HCWs became more familiar with the
device, they might have been more likely to use it with greater
ease and precision. This phenomenon has been observed in
other studies, which found that ESIPDs could be even more
efficacious in preventing PIs if consistently used correctly.34-36
Injuries that occur despite the use of an ESIPD may result
from mechanical failure of the safety feature, lack of motivation for the HCW to use the device for a variety of reasons
(including low perceived risk of injury, inadequate training,
and inherent risk in the activation process) or incomplete
activation.31,35,36,40 The likelihood of HCWs activating the
safety feature may vary, depending on perceived ease of use,
ease of activation, amount of training the HCW received, and
perceived risk of infection.34 Activation rates may, therefore,
increase with increased training of HCWs on their use.
One of the limitations of this study is that there is a lack
of detailed information available on events surrounding the
injuries. For example, it is unclear whether an injury occurred
because the device failed to work correctly, the safety device
was not activated, or some other reason. Another study limitation is that these data were obtained from only one medical
center, affecting the study’s generalizeability. The fact that
only one brand of IV catheter ESIPD was used also affects
generalizeability, as it does not allow comparison of injury
rates associated with other brands available for use. Reporting
bias is also a concern as, historically, a substantial number
of PIs are never reported. Underreporting behavior among
HCWs is well-documented in the literature. Recent estimates
place the overall rate of underreporting PIs at 43.4%.29 Underreporting of PIs is also seen in other occupations.41
Even in the face of these limitations, our findings are important because they show that the use of IV catheter ESIPDs
decreases the incidence of PIs, helping to confirm previous
findings29,36,42 and thus supporting the use of these devices.
The Needlestick Safety and Prevention Act4 gave impetus to
the widespread introduction of ESIPDs, which were already
available and being used in various settings. Although the
cost of safer devices had been a concern for hospitals,43
ESIPDs have financial benefits that may exceed their cost,
as they reduce the needlestick injury rate and the associated medical treatment costs.44 With increased volume of
production, prices have decreased, thus reducing the cost
differential.
Further studies are needed to better ascertain what types
of ESIPDs will result in the fewest exposures. This information would be useful to healthcare organizations in device
selection. Additional studies are also needed to further evaluate the reasons that exposures continue to occur despite the
use of ESIPDs. In addition to the factors mentioned earlier,
other reasons may include attention failures due to fatigue45;
organizational factors, such as time pressure due to heavy
workload46-48; and lack of organizational commitment to
safety.27 It is possible that the reduction in the incidence of
PIs as a result of the use of ESIPDs will plateau, because the
use of protective equipment alone, without attention to modulating factors, is unlikely to eliminate PIs. Designing targeted
interventions to address modulating factors with respect to
optimal ESIPD use, assessing the outcomes of these interventions, and instituting those that are proven to work will
help to further reduce the incidence of PIs among HCWs.
