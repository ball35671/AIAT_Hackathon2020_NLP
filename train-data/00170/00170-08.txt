Retractable needle IV catheters are designed to reduce
needle-stick injuries; their use is mandated by federal
regulations. We undertook a prospective data collection with the “traditional” IV catheters (JELCO) versus
the “new” (Angiocath™ Autoguard™). Assignment of
catheter type was randomized by week. Data collected
included assessment of the difficulty of IV access; number of catheters used; and splatters or spills of blood on
skin, linen, floor, clothing, and operating room table.
There were 473 attempted insertions in 330 patients
over 20 days. No needle-stick injuries occurred.
Seventy-seven blood spills or splatters occurred in 42
patients. The number of splatters or spills was four
times more with the new compared with the traditional
catheters. There were significantly more total splatters
or spills and patients who experienced splatters or
spills with new catheters when they were placed by attendings but not when placed by trainees. Our study
suggests that use of this technology by more experienced anesthesiologists may increase the risk of exposure of health care providers to blood-borne pathogens.
Practitioners should choose the IV system that allows
the most efficient venous access with the least potential
for blood contamination. Hospitals should allow the
choice to be made by the individuals using the devices.
(Anesth Analg 2003;96:387–91)
Government regulations have mandated the
availability of retractable needle systems for IV
catheters to reduce the incidence of accidental
needle-stick injuries (1,2). Although the goal is laudable, the introduction of new technology may increase
other risks, because blood-borne pathogens can be
spread by other means, such as mucocutaneous exposure (3,4). Our experience after 5 months with such
systems was that successful venipuncture was more
difficult to recognize and achieve. In part this seemed
to be a result of the increased weight and size of the
new compared with the traditional IV catheter system.
This seemed to result in additional attempts at catheter placement and more time to achieve successful
venous access. In addition, factors such as unintended
needle retraction, needle withdrawal to determine
whether the catheter is in the vein, and the apparent
need for additional attempts at venipuncture seemed
to result in increased exposure of operating room (OR)
personnel to spilled or splattered blood. Because in
our experience, needle-stick injuries are rare, our primary outcomes measures were ease of catheter insertion, number of catheters used per patient, spills and
splatters of blood, and time for catheter insertion.
Methods
We undertook a prospective study of “traditional”
versus “new” IV catheter technology. Because use of
the new IV catheters is mandated, the IRB indicated
that informed consent was not required. We assigned
catheter type—traditional (JELCO; Johnson & Johnson

Medical) or new (Angiocath™ Autoguard™, BD Medical Systems, Inc.)—by week in the OR and requested
that staff fill out a questionnaire after catheter placement regarding the following: number of catheters
used; patient age; patient weight; operative procedure;
splattering (forceful propulsion of blood out of the IV
catheter, e.g., with unintended or intended needle retraction or flipping of the catheter) or spilling (passive
loss of blood from a puncture site or IV catheter) of
blood on linen, OR table, floor, the skin or clothing of
the person inserting the catheter, or the skin or clothing of other OR personnel; accidental needle stick; and
insertion time (defined as the time from initial skin
puncture to successful running of IV fluid, timed with
a stopwatch by either the attending or the resident,
depending on who was inserting the catheter). Participation by attending anesthesiologists was voluntary.
We analyzed the data in three ways: 1) comparing
the traditional catheter versus the new catheter for all
patients, 2) comparing patients 3 yr versus patients
3 yr, and 3) comparing catheter insertions by trainees with insertions by attending anesthesiologists. Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS Version 11
(SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL). Incidence data were analyzed
with 2 or Fisher’s exact tests; Mann-Whitney U-tests
were used to determine the relationships between age
and the number of catheters used and between individuals and the number of catheters used; the Pearson
correlation was used to determine the relationship
between the assessed degree of difficulty in IV access
versus time for insertion and the number of catheters
used. The Mann-Whitney U-test was used to assess
time for successful insertion and catheter type.
Results
Four-hundred-seventy-three attempted catheter insertions in 330 patients were evaluated during 20 operative days. Three-hundred-twenty-eight catheter placement attempts were made by anesthesia trainees
(CA-1 to CA-4), and 145 attempts were made by anesthesia attendings. Two-hundred-nineteen patients’
catheters were successfully inserted by trainees, and
95 were successfully inserted by attending anesthesiologists. Attempts at catheter insertion were initially
made in 16 patients by a trainee; this was followed by
successful insertion by an attending. Fourteen attending anesthesiologists and a number of residents and
fellows participated in the study. All trainees had
prior experience with similar new IV catheter systems
at their parent institution. The distribution of cases
among surgical populations was equivalent between
the new versus the traditional catheter groups. There
were no accidental needle sticks.
Data on the traditional catheters were collected for
9 days (1 wk had a holiday); data on the new catheter
were collected for 11 days. The mean patient age was
6.5  5.1 yr (range, 25 days to 23 yr); 90 patients were
3 yr old, and 240 were 3 yr old. When comparing
trainees and attendings, there were no significant differences in the number of patients who required more
than one catheter attempt (both catheter types analyzed together; P  0.086 by 2 analysis). When stratified by age, a larger proportion of children 3 yr
required more than 1 catheter to establish venous
access (54 had 1 attempt, and 36 had 1 attempt)
compared with children 3 yr (190 had 1 attempt, and
50 had 1 attempt; P  0.001; 2
) (Table 1). This
finding was true when attending and trainee attempts
were combined or when these were compared with
each other (Table 2). More patients 3 yr required
more than one new catheter for successful IV placement than did those who received the traditional IV
catheter (P  0.017; 2
). This was not true for children
3 yr (P  0.537; 2
) (Table 2).
Seventy-seven spills or splatters of blood occurred
during attempted IV placement in 42 patients; 2 patients experienced this with both the attending and
trainee (Table 3). There was a larger absolute number
of blood spills or splatters with the new compared
with the old catheters (61 versus 16), and this occurred
more frequently for attendings than trainees (P
0.049; Fisher’s exact test). When analyzed by patients
who experienced a blood spill or splatter, there were

more patients with either spills or splatters with the
new catheter versus the traditional catheter when
catheters were placed by attending physicians compared with trainees (P  0.026; 2
) (Table 4).
Poor flashback was described as a problem in 18
new catheter insertions and in no traditional catheter
insertions (P  0.003; 2
). When poor flashback was
described compared with good flashback, there were
2.5 times more catheters used (P  0.001; 2
). There
was no difference in the distribution of catheter size
used between trainees and attendings. There was a
positive correlation between time for catheter insertion and assessed degree of difficulty, as well as between the number of catheters used and the assessed
degree of difficulty, by both attendings and residents
for all sizes of catheters and for either type of catheter
(P  0.01; Pearson correlation). There was no significant difference in time for insertion of one catheter
versus the other (Table 1) (P  0.559; Mann-Whitney
U-test). Two new catheters accidentally retracted, and
two sheared, whereas none of the old catheters
sheared. In one patient, the attending elected to
change from the new to the old catheter system.
Discussion
Recent modifications to federal legislation (1) mandate
the availability of new technology with retractable or
sheathed needles designed to reduce the potential for
needle-stick injury. Some institutions have interpreted
this to mean that only needleless systems, safety needles, and retractable IV catheter needle systems
should be used. Although the goal of reducing needlestick injury is important because this type of injury is
most often associated with accidental human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission (5,6), changing
IV catheter systems may not always be in the best
interest of the patient or the health care providers
because blood-borne pathogens may be transmitted
by non-needle-stick injuries such as cutaneous and
mucocutaneous exposure (3,4). Our institution planned
to replace all IVs with the new technology. However,
because the federal legislation states that the final decision as to which catheter or needle system is best lies
with the health care provider, on the basis of a review of
the patient circumstances and local experience, we decided to conduct our study.
Our initial experience was that these catheters were
more difficult to use in children, particularly those
with difficult IV access. We also felt that there was
actually an increased incidence of contamination of
linen, floors, and health care providers because of
more attempts at catheter insertion and unintended
needle retraction. We focused in part on the younger
patients because we believed that these presented the
most technical difficulty in establishing venous access.
Our study found that a larger proportion of children
3 yr required more than one catheter to successfully
gain IV access. This is no surprise given the technical
difficulty of establishing IV access in small and often
chubby infants and toddlers (7). We also found that
overall there was a positive correlation between number of catheters used, time for insertion, and degree of
assessed difficulty in establishing venous access for
both trainees and attendings; this was true regardless
of the catheter inserted. Our study was underpowered
to separate other differences between attendings and
trainees in the younger age group.
The most clinically relevant observation was that
use of this brand of retractable IV catheter compared

with traditional catheters was associated with a statistically significant increase (nearly fourfold) in the
splattering and spilling of blood. This was true when
examined as patient exposures (multiple sources of
contamination but only considered as one for statistical analysis) and as the total number of places where
blood was spilled or splattered. This difference in
contamination rates between new and traditional catheters was primarily related to attending physicians
and not trainees, despite five months of prior experience by the attendings with these devices. Although
the risk for accidental needle stick may be theoretically
reduced, there is an increase rather than a decrease in
exposure of OR personnel to spilled and splattered
blood products. Wearing gloves and goggles will reduce some of this exposure; however, not all individuals in the room are so protected. Thus, there may be
increased danger of disease transmission to more than
the individual inserting the catheter. Our study was
underpowered to assess differences in needle-stick
injury.
Our results should be viewed as having some limitations because of the inability to accurately quantitate the prior experience with the new catheters of the
individuals involved. The difference in contamination
rates may reflect a longer experience with these devices by trainees compared with attendings. There is
also the potential for reporting bias because the starting hypotheses were that the new catheters were not
as user friendly as the traditional catheters and that
the results reflect the consensus of the group before
the study began. However, because there were nearly
twice as many catheters inserted by trainees than by
attendings, this bias is less likely. A further possibility
is that younger physicians seem more willing to adapt
to and to adopt the use of newer technology and
protective safety devices, whereas older physicians
are experienced with the traditional technology and
may find it difficult to change to something that is
perceived to be less easy to use (8,9).
Another factor that is more difficult to quantitate is
the tendency for attendings to allow trainees the opportunity to start the IV when there is an obvious vein,
but not when relatively easy venous access is less
assured. Because the total number of IVs used and the
time of insertion were correlated with the assessed
degree of difficulty, it is hard to completely attribute
increased contamination by attendings to their selecting the more difficult IV insertions and allowing the
trainees to start the easier IVs. Conversely, it is difficult to determine whether a resident’s assessment of
difficult IV access is the same as an attending’s.
Poor flashback of visible blood in the needle was
described as a problem in 18 new but no traditional
catheter insertions; significantly more catheters were
used when poor flashback was described. This is of
particular relevance if flashback of blood is used by
the practitioner as an indicator of the catheter’s being
within a vein. This problem with flashback may indicate in part why attending physicians had more spills
and splatters of blood, because all have used this
indicator of intravascular catheter location for many
years. Of some importance is the observation that 16 of
the 17 splatters were attributable to the new catheters,
but this difference did not achieve statistical significance. On average, it took slightly longer to successfully establish IV access with the new catheter technology, but this difference also was not statistically
significant.
One review regarding needle-stick injury prevention states that the presence of a “safe” device does not
guarantee that it is “safer” and that satisfaction of the
user is paramount to the success of safer needle devices (10). The results of our study pose an interesting
dilemma: does reducing the potential of needle-stick
injury with this retractable needle system offset the
potential for transmission of blood-borne diseases
through increased cutaneous blood exposure? The estimate for HIV seroconversion after a needle puncture
is related to the size of the inoculum, the depth of the
puncture, and the viral load of the patient. No such
study has been performed for cutaneous blood exposure. Because HIV, hepatitis B, and other hepatitis
seroconversions have been reported with both routes
of transmission (3,4,11) and because it is more likely
with a puncture than with cutaneous exposure, our

study is greatly underpowered to resolve this question
(5,6).
The results of our study support our decision regarding this IV catheter system. We will continue to
have both the traditional and the new systems available in the OR so that the clinician and trainee can use
their best judgment in selecting the catheter system
that allows the most efficient venous access with the
least potential for blood contamination and the greatest clinician satisfaction. For some individuals, it will
be the new system, and for others, the traditional. It is
refreshing that the federal regulations state: “No one
medical device is appropriate in all circumstances of
use.” “An employer. . ..shall solicit input from nonmanagerial employees responsible for direct patient
care. . .in the identification, evaluation, and selection
of effective engineering and work practice controls. . .” (1). This language allows the ultimate decision of device selection to rest in the hands of the
practitioner.
