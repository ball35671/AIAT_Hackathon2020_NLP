conventional hollow-bore needles

Background: Needlestick injury (NSI) with hollow-bore needles remains a significant risk of bloodborne virus acquisition in health
care workers. The impact on NSI rates after substantial replacement of conventional hollow-bore needles with the simultaneous
introduction of safety-engineered devices (SEDs) including retractable syringes, needle-free intravenous (IV) systems, and safety
winged butterfly needles was examined in an 800-bed Australian university hospital.
Methods: NSIs were prospectively monitored for 2 years (2005-2006) after the introduction of SEDs and compared with prospectively collected preintervention NSI data (2000-2004).
Results: Preintervention hollow-bore NSI rates over 10 years persisted at a constant rate between 3.01 and 3.77 per 100 full-time
equivalent employees (FTE) (P 5 .31). Rates for 2005 (1.93; 95% CI: 1.48-2.47 per 100 FTE) and 2006 (1.50; 95% CI: 1.11-1.97 per
100 FTE) were significantly lower than the average rate for the preintervention years (3.39; 95% CI: 2.7-4.24 per 100 FTE, P 5
.00004). This represents a fall of 49% (43.1%-55.7%) in hollow-bore NSI, contributed to by the virtual elimination of NSI related
to accessing IV lines. More importantly, high-risk injuries were also reduced 57% by retractable syringe use with an overall budgetary increase of approximately US $90,000 per annum.
Conclusion: Introduction of SEDs results in an impressive fall in NSI with minimal cost outlay. (Am J Infect Control 2008;36:
180-6.)
Hollow-bore percutaneous needlestick injuries (NSI)
remain an important occupational hazard to health
care workers (HCW), despite widespread recognition
of their ability to transmit bloodborne viruses, in particular, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and HIV.1-3 Numerous
approaches to reduce NSI have been reported4-7 but often with limited success, particularly in relation to
high-risk hollow-bore injuries. In the United States,
this concern was recognized by a landmark passage
of federal legislation in the Needlestick Safety and Prevention Act (2000),8 which requires all health care facilities to provide safety-engineered devices (SEDs) to
reduce risk of bloodborne virus acquisition by staff.
In 2002, we published our experience of NSI9 over
the previous decade in the 800-bed university teaching
Princess Alexandra Hospital, Brisbane, Australia, which
provides approximately 28,000 bed-days of care per
annum. Despite an intensive education program commencing in the early 1980s, the introduction of safer
disposal methods as well as an efficient reporting and
follow-up strategy capturing over 80% of all NSI, the
overall NSI rate in the Hospital in 1999 did not differ
significantly from that of 1990. We concluded that engineering, not education, would provide a more effective solution and postulated that the introduction of
retractable safety syringes and that the elimination of
winged steel butterfly needles would significantly reduce high-risk hollow-bore NSI by 70% and the overall
NSI rate by 50%. This paper reports the results of an
intervention using engineered devices.
METHODS
Provision of safety syringes
Tenders were called for the provision over a 2-year
period of safety syringes for 1 (tuberculin and insulin)-, 3-, 5- and 10-mL syringes with an appropriate
range of needle gauges. The critical specification was
that normal injection technique must be maintained
when using the syringes in that ‘‘the needle must automatically retract when the plunger is depressed fully

into the base of the barrel of the syringe.’’ VanishPoint
(Retractable Technologies INC, Little Elm, TX) syringes
met all tender specifications and were used throughout
the trial. The manufacturer attached a variety of needle
gauges to the syringes. Conventional syringes and needles could not be replaced for all clinical procedures
and remained in use for injection of large volume local
anesthetic, blood collection where only a needle and
syringe could be used, procedures where a very small
gauge needle (eg, 30 gauge) was required and for injection of medication into IV fluid bags and burettes. A decision was also made at the commencement of the trial
in 2005 not to replace those needles and syringes that
were part of commercially prepacked procedural kits.
Ten-milliliter syringes were found pretrial to produce
an unacceptable ‘‘spray-back’’ with needle retraction
and were not used, and, where possible, VanishPoint
Blood Tube Holders (Retractable Technologies INC)
were used for blood specimen collection.
Education program and SED introduction
At the commencement of the intervention in 2005,
an extensive education program was undertaken
throughout the hospital to explain the potential benefits of retractable syringes. Thereafter, all conventional
syringes and needles that were no longer required were
physically removed. Similarly, all conventional winged
butterfly needles were physically removed, except in
the intensive care unit and pharmacy where safety
steel winged infusion sets (BD Safety-Lok; Becton Dickinson, Tokyo, Japan) replaced conventional devices in
those circumstances in which use of such devices remained necessary.
A survey conducted as part of the initial education
program revealed that staff perceived needle-free IV
systems to be of much greater importance in protecting
from NSI than retractable syringes.10 As a consequence
of these findings, the SmartSite needle-free system
(Alaris Clinico, Baesweiler, Germany) was introduced
in mid-May 2005 on all peripheral IV lines, while central and peripherally inserted central catheter lines
were thereafter accessed through SmartSite Plus (Alaris
Medical Systems, Dublin, OH). Safety intravenous cannulae were already used in the radiology and anesthetic departments and in the intensive care unit but
were not introduced more widely because intravenous
cannulae were not reported as a substantial cause of
NSI in the preintervention period.
Data collection and analysis
The same system of reporting of NSI to the Infectious Diseases Department, which has been in place
since 1996, was used throughout the study. All data
pertaining to this study were collected prospectively.
The simultaneous introduction of safety syringes
and safety winged butterfly needles commenced in October 2004. NSI data from October to December 2004
were considered a run-in period and were analyzed
within the preintervention data. Data as counts of NSI
for 2000 to 2006 were plotted continuously on Shewhart-EWMA Control Charts.11 Rates of NSI for the 5
years (2000-2004) prior to the study, the average of
the previous 5 years, and of the previous year alone
(2004) were then compared with each of the 2 years
for the SEDs intervention. Rates of NSI sustained by different staff groups were standardized for comparison
using an incidence density denominator of 100 fulltime equivalent employees (FTE). The number of fulltime equivalent employees in each occupational group
was calculated by multiplying the total number of staff
employed in that group by the total hours worked and
dividing this product by the total of number of hours in
the standard working week for that group. This calculation takes into account the reduced exposure time
of HCWs employed on a part-time basis. Rates were
determined for all occupational groups with clinical
exposure within the hospital including medical, nursing, hotel services (catering, cleaning, laundry,
orderly), and other (allied health, ie, physical, occupational, and speech therapists; radiographers; anesthesia/perfusion technicians). Staff groups whose FTE
were not available (eg, ambulance attendants) were
not included in analysis of rates per FTE by staff. During the intervention period 2005-2006, an examination
of the effect of needle-free IV systems was made to determine the relative contribution of this system and
that of retractable syringes to a reduction in NSI. Epi
Info version 6.04 (CDC, Atlanta, GA) software was
used to calculate rates (per 100 FTE of at-risk staff)
with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and x2 test for trend.
RESULTS
The project resulted in a significant reduction in all
NSI, inducing a fall of 49% (range, 43.1%-55.7%) in
hollow-bore NSI compared with the averaged 5-year
rate prior to the intervention (Table 1). In the main,
this fall was contributed to by the virtual elimination
of NSI related to accessing IV lines, from 26 such injuries in 2004 to 5 in 2006, representing an 81% reduction. More importantly, high-risk hollow-bore injuries
were also reduced by 57%, from 72 injuries in 2004
to 31 in 2006. Injuries with winged butterfly needles
fell by 35% over the 2-year study period.
During the 5 preintervention years, the rates of NSI
were similar (P 5 .31), ranging from 3.01 to 3.77 per
100 FTE (Table 2). The rates for 2005 (1.93; 95% CI:
1.48-2.47 per 100 FTE) and 2006 (1.50; 95% CI: 1.11-
1.97 per 100 FTE) were significantly (P 5 .00004) lower
Whitby, McLaws, and Slater April 2008 181
than the average rate of NSI for the 5 preintervention
years (3.39; 95% CI: 2.7-4.24 per 100 FTE). When
compared with the rate in year 2004, 3.01 (95%
CI: 2.44-3.68) prior to the intervention, the rates for
2005 and 2006 remained significantly lower (P 5
.00009).
However, during the study period no diminution in
NSI rates with solid suture needles was demonstrated,
with the mean rate of 0.95 (95% CI: 0.63-1.39) per
100 FTE for 2000-2004 being not significantly different
(P 5 .528) from that for 2005 (0.69 per 100 FTE) or
2006 (0.87 per 100 FTE). Similarly, NSI rates with IV
cannulae/stylets remained constant throughout the
study period, ranging from 0.19 to 0.31 per 100 FTE
with a mean rate for this period of 0.25 (95% CI:
0.10-0.52) per 100 FTE. There was no significant (P 5
.29) difference in the mean rate of NSI with cannulae/
stylets to that of 2005 (0.19 per 100 FTE) and 2006
(0.39 per 100 FTE).
The total percutaneous injuries, listed in Table 2, for
both the preintervention and the intervention periods
are illustrated using the exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) statistic (Fig 1). With EWMA controlling for the random variation in these injuries
(evident by the spiking nature of the thin injuries count
line), the thick EWMA line illustrates the decline in injuries commencing after January 2005.
A series of practical obstacles were encountered during the program:
1. Analysis of a random selection of sharps disposal
bins on 2 occasions during the study period indicated that virtually all retractable devices were activated prior to disposal; of those that were not
activated, the majority contained fluid thought to
be local anesthetic.
2. A series of NSI previously unreported in the hospital
and associated with diabetic insulin pens occurred, a
finding concurrently experienced and reported in
France.12 The bar chart (Fig 2), after controlling for
random variation using the EWMA line, illustrates
that this source of injury was substantially eliminated by instructing nursing staff to not use a patient’s pen but to use a retractable syringe.
3. Confusion in 2 instances between a 1-mL retractable
tuberculin syringe and a 1-mL retractable insulin
syringe resulted in 2 patients receiving a 10-fold overdose of insulin. Two ‘‘nearmisses’’ were also reported.
4. Commercially prepared prefilled nonsafety syringes, mostly with enoxaparin sodium, contributed
to 6 injuries during the study period.
The introduction of the Smartsite needle-free system
proved cost neutral, although the introduction of
SmartSite Plus devices cost US $40,000 per annum for
the trial period. No significant increase in bloodstream
infections was detected during the study period. Substitution of a safety engineered butterfly needle engendered an additional annual cost of $4800 per annum.
The major financial impact of the program resulted
from the introduction of retractable syringes, an overall
annual addition to the budget of $46,000.
DISCUSSION
Some reduction in NSI rates was initially achieved in
the 1980s with staff education programs,13-15 particularly targeting the implementation of universal precautions and the avoidance of recapping. However, the
introduction of SEDs appeared to offer a global solution,
and this approach was subsequently reflected in revisions of the initial OSHA Blood-borne Pathogen Standard15 and ultimately in the US Federal Needlestick
Safety and Prevention Act (2000).8 The benefits to
HCWs of these guidelines and this legislation have
been subsequently confirmed in a number of publications
demonstrating reductions in NSI using a variety of or

individual SEDs.16-19 Our study was initially designed to
assess the acceptability and effectiveness of retractable
safety syringes, but this aim was confounded by an unexpected response by staff, who strongly perceived that
our approach to their protection was misguided and that
the introduction of a needle-free IV system should be
our first priority. We have previously reported this finding in detail,10 suggesting that this belief is incorrect.
Needle-free IV systems are more likely to prevent incidents of lower risk of transmission because of the small
volumes of blood usually involved, whereas retractable
syringes used for parenteral injections will prevent
high-transmission risk injuries where considerable volumes of blood are often implicated. Nevertheless, we
did accept that our colleagues’ strongly expressed views
indicated not only the need for a promotional program
to accompany the introduction of any SED to ensure appropriate user technique but, equally importantly, a
program to encourage user acceptance. This conclusion
is reflected in the initial very gradual reduction in hollow-bore NSI seen during the first half of 2005, indicating slow uptake in acceptance of retractable syringes
(Fig 1).
Our study has demonstrated that the introduction of
effective SEDs into a major teaching hospital significantly reduces NSI. The constant and unchanging rate
of NSI with solid suture needles implies that the reduction in NSI relates neither to the education program associated with the new devices nor to increased reporting
rates but to the effect of SEDs themselves. As in other
studies,20-23 we have shown that needle-free IV systems
reduce NSI. However, it is the eventual widespread acceptance of retractable syringe technology to most clinical practices in our hospital that has provided a much
improved measure of protection to HCWs from higher
risk injuries. The type of retractable syringe that we intentionally chose automatically activates with normal
injection technique, thereby eliminating the need for
conscious involvement by the HCW. We believe this
may be an important design feature that assists in circumstances in which concentration of the HCW may
wane, such as prolonged hours24 of work, night
work,25 and in emergency situations,26 all of which
have been associated with a high rate of NSI.
We have, however, identified during our study a series of important limitations to the introduction and effectiveness of existing retractable technology because
current retractable syringe design does not allow its application to all potential uses. We had initially intended
to introduce a 10-mL retractable syringe on the basis of
a locally developed prototype; this invention substantially eliminates ‘‘dead space’’ and thus removes the
aerosol effect of residual contents—greatest in large
volume syringes—that occurs when the needle retracts

not available in sufficient quantities for use in our
study and current commercially available large volume
retractable syringes continue to manifest this constraint. Similarly, in certain clinical situations such as
percutaneous administration of local anesthesia, it is
not normal practice to inject the entire contents of
the syringe; therefore, unless there is a conscious action by the HCW to completely empty the syringe at
the end of the procedure, the needle will not retract.
We believe that this is the explanation for the small
number of ‘‘used but not activated’’ syringes that
were found during analysis of sharps disposal bins.
The appearance of the VanishPoint 1-mL retractable tuberculin syringe and the VanishPoint 1-mL retractable insulin syringe are similar. However, they
can be differentiated because the insulin syringe, in
accord with the International Standard, is fitted with
an orange needle cap. Nevertheless, confusion between these 2 syringes during our study resulted in
2 patients receiving overdoses of insulin. Until this
potential confusion is resolved by manufacturers ensuring that these syringes can be more easily distinguished, we will err on the side of caution and will
not recommend use of 1-mL retractable tuberculin syringes in our hospital while we continue to use retractable insulin syringes.
Unlike the United States, Australia has no federal or
state/territory legislation mandating the use of SEDs;
nevertheless, occupational health and safety legislation is in force and does provide an onus on hospital
administrators to provide adequate protection for staff
from the risk of NSI. Our study has demonstrated that
needle-free IV systems can be introduced without significant financial impediment; however, the major protective benefit against NSI comes from retractable
syringes. The overall increased cost in provision of retractable syringes to our 800-bed tertiary teaching hospital was $46,000 per annum, $14.00 for each at risk
HCW per year or $2.00 per occupied bed-day per annum. However, the financial impost on the hospital in
the future is anticipated to halve, assuming a further reduction in the price of retractable safety syringes with
needle attached in Australia in the near future to approximately twice the cost of a conventional syringe
and needle. Hospital administrators need to balance
this extra cost not only against the time taken to assess
staff who sustain NSI and to protect against the
fortunately rare acquisition of an occupationally acquired bloodborne virus but, more pragmatically,
against the significant anxiety that NSIs are known to
induce.27
