Background: Use of protective devices has become a common intervention to decrease sharps injuries in the hospitals; however
few studies have examined the results of implementation of the different protective devices available.
Objective: To determine the effectiveness of 2 protective devices in preventing needlestick injuries to health care workers.
Methods: Sharps injury data were collected over a 7-year period (1993-1999) in a 3600-bed tertiary care university hospital in
France. Pre- and postinterventional rates were compared after the implementation of 2 safety devices for preventing percutaneous
injuries (PIs) related to phlebotomy procedures.
Results: From 1993 to 1999, an overall decrease in the needlestick-related injuries was noted. Since 1996, the incidence of
phlebotomy-related PIs has significantly decreased. Phlebotomy procedures accounted for 19.4% of all percutaneous injuries in
the preintervention period and 12% in the postintervention period (RR, O.62; 95% CI, 0.51-0.72; P , .001). Needlestick-related
injuries incidence rate decreased significantly after the implementation of the 2 safety devices, representing a 48% decline in
incidence rate overall.
Conclusions: The implementation of these safety devices apparently contributed to a significant decrease in the percutaneous
injuries related to phlebotomy procedures, but they constitute only part of a strategy that includes education of health care workers
and collection of appropriate data that allow analysis of residuals percutaneous injuries. (Am J Infect Control 2004;32:441–4.)
Injuries from contaminated needles and other sharp
devices used in health care settings have been
associated with transmission of bloodborne pathogens
to health care workers (HCWs). Occupationally acquired hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and HIV infection are
well documented.1,2 The CDC reported that 94% of
HCW seroconversions for HIV were a result of needlestick injuries from hollow-bore needles used during
venous access procedures. This study identified venous
access devices and procedures as posing the greatest
threat to HCWs.3 In France, percutaneous venous
puncture (ie, phlebotomy) for blood drawing are
routinely performed by nurses, and these procedure
have been associated with 10 of the 13 documented
episodes of HIV seroconversion and with 11 of the 43
HCV seroconversion reported to hospital occupational
health services after percutaneous injury.4 Generally,
conventional phlebotomy devices used for blood
drawing are vacuum-tube blood collection with vacutainer needle or with winged steel needles; needles are
prepackaged with an adapter for vacutainer blood
draws. Winged steel needles are used particularly in
cases in which venous access may be difficult with
vacuum-tube phlebotomy needle. Winged steel needles have been associated with significant risk of
percutaneous injuries (PIs) to HCWs; vacuum-tube
phlebotomy needles had lower injury rates.5,6

Since the introduction of devices designed to reduce
needlestick injuries, few studies have examined the
results of implementation. The intent of this report is to
describe the effectiveness of protective devices in
preventing needlestick injuries to HCWs with winged
steel needles and vacuum-tube phlebotomy needles
used for phlebotomy procedures for blood drawing.
METHODS
A descriptive study of percutaneous injuries from
sharp devices was carried out at a 3600-bed university
hospital.
Intervention
Protective devices were introduced throughout the
hospital on June 1996. Products evaluated included
resheathable winged steel needles (SafetyLok, Becton
Dickinson) and Vacutainer blood-collecting tubes with
recapping sheaths (SafetyLok, Becton Dickinson). Each
product required the HCW to activate the safety feature
immediately after phlebotomy. The 2 safety mechanisms required 2-handed activation. The safety device
company instructed nurses, with sessions and a pamphlet in each ward, on how to activate the safety
mechanism following removal of the needle from the
patient. Conventional phlebotomy nonsafety devices
were removed from all departments, and the new
products were in place on implementation day. These
devices were used for blood drawing, not for peripheral
intravenous infusion.
Sharps injury review
Since 1993, sharps injuries information was prospectively collected at the time of injury on a standard
form and included the following details: the device
involved and the procedure contributing to exposure by
the worker. These injuries were reported by hospital
personnel to the occupational health service. We looked
at injuries occurring before the implementation of
protective devices (preintervention period: in 1993,
1994, and 1995) and compared these with injuries
occurring after 1996, which was after the implementation of the hospital-wide protective devices (postintervention period: in 1997, 1998, and 1999). The
efficacy of engineered sharps injury prevention devices
was assessed in the postintervention period. We
calculated the average numbers of annual percutaneous
injuries per 100,000 phlebotomies performed (estimated by vacuum-tube blood-collecting needles and
winged steel needle purchased per year by the hospital).
Data on seroconversion of hospital workers after
needlestick injuries also were recorded. We used x2 test
to compare preintervention and postintervention data.
RESULTS
Data were collected on a total of 4624 sharps injuries reported by an annual average of 8500 full-time
equivalent employees (2900 nurses). From 1993 to
1999, an overall decrease in the needlestick-related
injuries was noted. Phlebotomy procedures accounted
for 19.4% of all needle-related injuries in the preintervention period and 12% in the postintervention
period (RR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.51-0.72: P , .001).
The total number of phlebotomy-related PIs for the
3-year period prior to the intervention was 244; in
1996, the transitional year, there were 76 PIs and 127 in
the subsequent 3-year period (1997-1999). Of these
127 residual PIs, 10 involved winged steel needles and
117 involved vacuum-tube blood-collecting needles
(Table 1). Since 1996, the incidence of phlebotomyrelated PIs has significantly decreased (P , .001).
Reported phlebotomy-related PIs declined from
191 in preintervention period to 117 in postintervention period for vacuum-tube blood collection needles
(reduction of 38.7%) and from 53 to 10 for winged steel
needles (reduction of 81%). There was an overall
reduction of 48% in percutaneous injuries per 100,000
phlebotomies. Over the survey period, there were no
reported HIV or HBV or HCV conversions.
DISCUSSION
Use of protected devices has become a common
intervention to decrease sharps injuries in the hospitals.7-9 These devices are often more expensive than
existing products, and the institutions must consider
the impact of a device on injury prevention; however,
few studies have examined the results of implementation of the different protected devices available.10-15
Because injuries that occur during phlebotomy may
carry a higher risk of bloodborne virus transmission, we
have implemented safety devices for preventing PIs in
our institution. We found that the implementation of 2
protective devices resulted in a significant decline in the
rate of phlebotomy-related percutaneous injuries. Our
study had several limitations: the lack of data on
compliance with device activation; the effectiveness of
preventive measures was estimated using the rate of
reported needlestick injuries, which can be biased if
HCWs overreport or underreport injuries during the 2
periods. Another limitation is that the number of
phlebotomies performed are derived from the number
of devices purchased. The possibility that improved
compliance with universal precautions contributed to
the reduction in injuries was not considered, but the
decrease of the incidence of needle-related injuries not
related to phlebotomy was not significant. Evidence
that reductions of needlestick injury rates are directly
442 Vol. 32 No. 8 Rogues et al
attributable to a safety device alone is scarce. In different
studies, this reduction coincided with an increased
education campaign on universal precautions.16,17
Some studies provide evidence for the efficacy of
safety devices in reducing phlebotomy-related injuries,
but wide ranges in injury reduction existed among
these different studies, probably because surveillance
systems for monitoring occupational percutaneous
injuries and safety devices implementation varied
among the hospitals. A collaborative study by CDC
and 6 hospitals to evaluate safety devices for phlebotomy indicates that use of safety devices significantly
reduced phlebotomy-related PI rates. In this study, both
the bluntable phlebotomy needle and the phlebotomy
needle with recapping sheath achieved similar reductions in percutaneous rates (76% and 66%, respectively; P = .003). The resheathable winged steel
needle (WSN) showed a 23% reduction in percutaneous injury rates; this reduction was not significant
(P = .07), but this device did not completely replace
conventional products.13 In a recent prospective trial,
the injury rate associated with WSN declined from
13.41 to 5.5 per 100,000 WSNs following implementation of a safety resheathable WSN. The poststudy WSNs
injury rate was 59% lower than the baseline period
(P , .001).15 We observed a higher level of injury
reduction with the same device, probably because of
more complete implementation.
Injuries that occur despite implementation of a
safety device may be due to mechanical failure of the
safety feature, failure of activation by not attempting or
not completing activation, or an inherent risk in the
activation procedures. The residual phlebotomy-related sharps injuries despite the availability and usage
of safety devices will be investigated. Most of these
injuries occurred before activation of the safety feature
was appropriate or possible.14 The role of training and
education in the use of safety devices is of great
importance because these products require conscious
manipulation of a sheath over the needle at the end of
a procedure.18
Our report suggested that devices with safety
mechanisms requiring 2-handed activation could provide protection for HCWs. However, in view of the
residual risk of injury remaining with these safety
devices, we replaced the vacuum-tube blood-collecting
needle with another available safety device with 1-
handed activation.
Although engineered sharps injury prevention devices are an important tool in the prevention of
percutaneous injuries, they constitute only part of
a strategy that includes education of health care
workers and collection of appropriate surveillance
data that allow analysis of residuals percutaneous
injuries.
