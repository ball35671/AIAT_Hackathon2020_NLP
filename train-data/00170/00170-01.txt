Summary
One possible method of reducing the incidence of needle-stick injury is to use needles with
safeguard mechanisms. The needle of the Insyte AutoGuard intravenous cannula can be retracted
into the safety barrel. One hundred patients were randomly allocated to receive either an 18-gauge
conventional Insyte intravenous cannula (group C) or the AutoGuard cannula (group AG) to assess
the ease of use and efficacy of the AutoGuard device. It was possible to insert the cannula into the
vein within two attempts in all patients; there was no significant difference between two groups
with respect to ease of insertion. No problems, such as inadvertent withdrawal of the needle,
occurred during insertion in any patient. Handling the withdrawn needle was judged significantly
safer in group AG than in group C (p < 0.001). Blood contamination often occurred where a
withdrawn needle was placed in group C, whereas no blood stain was detected in any case in
group AG (p < 0.001). The AutoGuard cannula provides safer handling of a withdrawn needle
without reducing its ease of insertion.

Needle-stick injury can transmit infectious viruses, such as
hepatitis or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [1–3].
The incidence of needle-stick injury is surprisingly high
[4–6]. In one study, 16 of 86 junior doctors (19%) had
suffered injury from a needle which was contaminated
with the blood of HIV-positive patients [4].
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an
agency of the US Department of Health and Human
Services, has issued guidelines for prevention of transmission of these viruses to health-care personnel [7].
However, these guidelines are often not followed [8].
One possible method to reduce needle-stick injury is to
use a needleless device or needles with safeguard mechanisms. The Insyte AutoGuard (Becton Dickinson Infusion
Therapy Inc., UT) (Fig. 1) is an intravenous cannula, the
needle of which can be retracted into the safety barrel
before removal. We assessed the ease of the use of this
cannula and the efficacy of its safeguard mechanism.
Methods
Using a randomised design, we studied 100 patients (ASA
physical status 1 or 2, aged 18–70 years) who were
scheduled for elective surgery, in whom intravenous
infusion was indicated. Patients with a blood-borne infection or bleeding disorder or those with any pathology of
the hand or arm were not studied. Institutional ethics
committee approved the study and written informed
consent was obtained from all patients.
In the operating theatre, an electrocardiograph, a pulse
oximeter and a blood pressure cuff were attached to the
patient. A tourniquet was applied to the patient’s forearm,
and the cephalic vein was identified. If it was difficult
to identify the vein or it was judged that an 18-gauge
intravenous cannula was too large to insert into the vein,
the patient was excluded from the study. When a vein of an
adequate size was identified, the patient was allocated to

one of two groups by blocked randomisation (blocks of
10). In one group (group C), a conventional 18-gauge
intravenous cannula (Insyte, Becton Dickinson Infusion
Therapy Inc.) was inserted into the vein. In the other
group, the Insyte Auto Guard was used (group AG). Each
researcher was allowed to use these cannulae five to 10
times before the start of the formal study.
Before insertion of the intravenous cannula, a metal tray
(20 × 25 cm), containing absorbable paper, was placed on
the floor as close as possible to the site of intravenous
cannulation. One researcher inserted the intravenous
cannula. When it was judged that the cannula had been
inserted into the vein, the researcher and an assistant
connected a drip infusion tubing to the cannula and
secured them to the patient’s arm by the following
sequence. The tourniquet was released and the segment
of vein proximal to the insertion site compressed. In group
C, the needle was removed, a drip-infusion tubing
attached to the cannula and a sticky drape applied to the
insertion site. The researcher placed the needle on the tray
during this process. In group AG, the researcher pressed
the button of the cannula to retract the needle into the
safety barrel during removal of the needle from the cannula
(but before complete removal) (Fig. 2) and placed the shaft
containing the needle on the tray.
When it was judged that the cannula had not been
inserted successfully after removal of the needle, another
attempt at insertion was allowed on the other side of the

arm. A new cannula was used for the second attempt. If
both failed, the study was ended and an intravenous
cannula was inserted at any site according to the anaesthetist’s preference.
The number of attempts at insertion of the intravenous
cannula (one, two or failure) was recorded. The ease of
insertion at each attempt was assessed using a 10-cm visual
analogue scale (VAS) ranging from ‘easy’ to ‘difficult’.
Any problems which occurred during insertion (defined
as the period from opening the package of the cannula to
the start of removal of the needle), such as inadvertent
withdrawal of the needle into the shaft, were recorded.
The ease of handling the needle, in terms of safety, during
the period from the start of the removal of the needle to
the end of application of a drape over the cannulation site,
was assessed using another 10-cm VAS ranging from ‘safe’
to ‘dangerous’.
Any needle-stick injury and the presence or absence of
blood contamination from either the inserted cannula or
needle and the site of contamination (e.g. researcher,
assistant, patient) were recorded. The needle was collected
from the tray and disposed of in a ‘sharps’ container. The
presence or absence of blood on the tray was assessed by a
blinded researcher. If blood was visible, the number of
blood stains was counted, with a maximum score of 10 if
there were more than 10 stains.
Statistical analysis
The normal plot (plots of normal scores) and Shapiro–
Francia W0 test showed that the VAS for the ease of
insertion of the test cannula and the ease of handing the
needle were not normally distributed. Therefore, the
Mann–Whitney U-test was used to compare the ease of
insertion and the ease of handling of the needle between
two groups. Fisher’s exact test was used to compare the
incidence of blood contamination of the tray between the
two groups. A value of p < 0.05 was considered significant.
The 95% confidence limits (CL) for difference were
obtained for the proportion of successful insertions at the
first attempt between the two groups. The 95% CL for
medians for the VAS in each group was calculated using
the SINTERVAL commend (sign test) in Minitab, which
shows a confidence level close to 95%. CLs for the
median differences were also calculated for the difference
in the VAS between two groups.
From a preliminary study, the VAS score for the ease of
handling removed needles in the control group was , 4–5
[standard deviation (SD) of 3], whereas that in AG group
would be < 1. Forty patients would be required to detect
a difference of 3, with a power of 90% and p  0.05.
However, we felt that a greater number of patients would
be required to minimise the possibility of a type II error for
the difference in VAS for the ease of insertion of a needle.
The VAS for the ease of insertion in the control group was
expected to be about 2–3 (with SD of 3); we considered
that a 20% difference (i.e. difference of 2 in VAS) between
the two groups would be clinically important. Up to 100
patients would be required to show that the incidence of
type II error would be less than 10% (i.e. power of 90%),
with p  0.05.
Results
Patient characteristics were similar between the groups
(Table 1).
It was possible to insert the cannula into the vein within
two attempts in all patients. Cannulation was successful at
the first attempt in 35 patients (70%) in group C and in
36 patients (72%) in group AG. There was no marked
difference in the success rate between the groups (95% CL
for difference: ÿ15.8%, 19.8%).
There was no significant difference between two groups
in the ease of insertion of the cannula (Table 2). No
problems, such as inadvertent withdrawal of the needle,
occurred during insertion in any patient. Handling of the
withdrawn needle was judged significantly safer in group
AG than in group C (p < 0.001) (Table 2).
There was no incident of needle-stick injury. Blood
contamination occurred between removal of a needle and
connection of a drip-infusion tubing in seven patients in
group C and five patients in group AG. The site of blood
contamination was always the patient’s arm.

Discussion
After insertion of an intravenous cannula, the needle is
withdrawn and infusion tubing connected to the cannula.
During this procedure, the hands of staff often cross over
the withdrawn needle, causing a potential risk of needlestick injury. When the AutoGuard cannula is used, the
needle can be retracted into the safety barrel before
removal of the needle from the cannula. Therefore, there
should be little risk of needle-stick injury. In practice, in
our study, anaesthetists felt that the AutoGuard cannula
was considerably safer than the conventional one.
In addition to the risk of needle-stick injury, there is a
potential risk of blood contamination from the used
needle. When the needle is removed from the intravenous
cannula, blood fills the hollow core of the needle and often
covers its outer surface. Therefore, there is a potential risk
of contaminating the staff or equipment. Centers for
Disease Control guidelines instruct that a hard ‘sharps’ container should be placed as near as possible to the injection
site [7]. However, in practice, this may be difficult, and it
appears that needles which have been withdrawn from
cannulae are occasionally placed temporarily on the trolley
or on the floor before discarding into the sharps container.
In our study, when the conventional cannula was used,
blood was often detected on a tray on which the needle
was placed. In contrast, when the AutoGuard was used,
there was no blood contamination from the removed
needle in any case.
One of our concerns about the AutoGuard cannula was
premature retrieval of the needle during cannulation;
however, this never occurred. The needle is designed
not to be retracted into the safety barrel unless the cannula
is detached from the barrel (Fig. 2). Another concern was
that insertion of the AutoGuard cannula might be more
difficult than the conventional one. However, there was no
significant difference in the ease of insertion between these
cannulae (with more than 90% certainty). Disadvantages of
the AutoGuard cannula are that the blood chamber is
shorter than that of a conventional cannula and that it is
not possible to attach a syringe to the chamber. Therefore,
there may be some difficulties in performing intra-arterial
cannulation.
In conclusion, we have shown that, compared with a
conventional intravenous cannula, the AutoGuard cannula
is safer for handling of the used needle, and reduces the
incidence of blood contamination, without reducing the
ease of insertion. Therefore, the AutoGuard cannula is
potentially useful in minimising blood-bore infection.
