Aim: To evaluate the risk factors of needle stick injuries (NSIs) sustained by undergraduate dental students
and nurse students at the King’s College London (KCL) Dental Institute.
Materials and methods: A retrospective study evaluated the incident reports relating to NSIs reported over a
period of 2 years. Factors including the dental department, study year, and when the injury took place during
administration of local anaesthesia (LA) and recapping conventional syringe or clearing work surface or
during disposal.
Results: This report showed that students are at the highest risk of NSIs at the fourth year of their 5-year BDS
course. About one-third of injuries were reported among this group of students followed by year 5 students
(25%). Oral surgery clinics were the major source of incident reporting when compared with other specialised
dental clinics within the institute. The left hands of the students were the most frequently affected by such
injuries and then the right hands of student dental nurses. The attempt of needle recapping of conventional
syringes was the least reported mechanism of injuries and constituted only 15% of the total injuries and
mainly occurred in third year students. The most frequent injuries among student nurses were during disposal
of the needle.
Conclusion: Less NSIs occur when using safety syringes. A non-recapping policy with immediate disposal of
either the conventional or safety syringe systems after injection would prevent all clearance-related NSIs
sustained by nurses. To avoid NSIs, education plays a vital role particularly with effective implementation of
the change to safety syringes with appropriate training.

Numerous published reports (16) have examined occupational injuries in dental healthcare
settings across different provider populations.
These highlight that dental healthcare workers (DCHWs)
are at a high risk of injuries by sharps and, of these, the
most common are due to needle sticks. Needle stick
injuries (NSIs) may be sustained during injecting local
anaesthesia or recapping or disposal of the needle and
syringe. Thus commonly these hollow bores are already
contaminated causing dirty NSIs with the attendant
significant risks of work acquired infections (79). Dental
students are trained at various dental departments during
the third, fourth and fifth years of their 5-year course
with maximum clinical load during their fourth year as
they complete a significant number of their clinical cases
requirements, and thus they are generally considered at a
higher risk of such hazards as compared with their
medical counterparts who rarely undertake exposureprone techniques as undergraduates. On other hand, the
dental nurse students receive a foundation training course
which leads to registerable qualifications. The nurse
students prepare and maintain environments, instruments, and equipment for clinical dental procedures.
They also provide chair-side support during the various
aspects of dental care.
The risk of injuries by sharps are usually faced at
various fronts including student immunisation, adequate
safety-based clinical induction and training, dissemination of safety protocols and guidelines and finally
introduction of safer technologies that contribute to

elimination or at least significant reduction of such
incidents (1012).
DHCWs may have certain perceptions about occupational injury risks based on the likelihood of an untoward
outcome (seroconversion) from such an injury. While the
actual risk of an occupational exposure varies (24, 6, 7,
9, 11, 13, 14), the risk of HIV seroconversion remains
very small in dentistry (15, 16). With the advent of the
hepatitis B vaccine, the risk of HBV seroconversion is
effectively zero for those practitioners with appropriate
blood titres. Hepatitis C has no vaccine as yet, so it
remains a concern for those who receive an occupational
exposure (12). However, its seroconversion rate is much
lower than HBV (17).
Unfortunately, healthcare workers do not always follow infection control protocols and guidelines. SulzbachHoke found non-compliance for many reasons including
habit, forgetfulness, influence of managers and perceptions that impede precautions and hinder performance
(18). Sandman identified a number of additional reasons
for non-compliance (therefore increasing risk), including the notion that ‘it can’t happen to me’, ignorance
of precautions, being uncomfortable with change and
cultural differences (19).
In this report, we aimed to investigate the pattern of
NSIs related to the local anaesthetic injections and
devices in our student population at the Dental Institute
at King’s College London (KCL). This will enable us to
identify the associated risk factors thus providing a basis
for the development of a strategy to minimise and
hopefully prevent NSIs.
Materials and methods
The Dental Institute at KCL attracts about 185 new
Bachelor of Dental Surgery (BDS) students and around
50 nurse students every year. The institute is unique in a
sense of the clinical training is distributed over three
London National Health Service (NHS) hospitals: King’s
College (KCH) Hospital, Guy’s (GH) Hospital and St.
Thomas’ Hospital (TH). The three trusts adopt different
policies regarding clinical sharp management giving the
KCL dental students an excellent exposure to various
technologies and policies. For example; the dental
institute at KCH utilises the conventional metallic dental
syringe which normally requires the needle resheathing in
order for the syringe to be dismantled and the metallic
part is autoclaved. On the other hand, both GH and TH
strictly employ non-resheathing policies throughout the
hospitals including the dental clinics. They provide the
students with modern safety dental syringes that do not
require resheathing or removal of a needle from its
syringe. This diversity was the motivation behind this
report to analyse the pattern of needle stick injuries
among the students who use both systems of syringes.
The study was approved by the local ethical committees
and audit units at the dental institute and the hospitals.
In this retrospective study, we retrieved all incident
reports of NSIs sustained by dental students and nurse
students over the period between January 2007 and
December 2008. The hospital, syringe type and department where the injury took place were noted and
related to student’s course study year, the site of injury
(right or left hand) and during which procedure the
injury was sustained (administering LA, subsequent to
the administration of LA and resheathing; or during
clearance and disposal of the instruments at the end of
the procedure).
The outcome data was analysed using a Statistical Package for the Social Services SPSS† version 13.
Initially, the data were cross-tabulated and Chi-square
test was used to determine the statistical significance with
P value set at B0.05 for the significance.
Results
Department
When comparing NSI rates in the different dental
departments (Table 1) Oral Surgery clinics were the major
source of incident reporting (P0.143). The sources of
reports ranged from 10% from Periodontology clinics to
53.3% from the Oral Surgery clinics. Within Oral Surgery
clinics there was a trend for the highest incidence of NSIs
to occur in BDS year 4 students compared with nurse
students and other year BDS students.
Site of injury
Most hand injuries (Table 2) occurred in the left hands
of the dental students (P0.002). Typically, the left
thumb is used for retraction of the buccal tissues during
application of an infiltration or inferior dental nerve
block. However, most dental nurse students experienced
hand injuries to the right side (P0.03).
Mechanism of the injury
The examination of the incident in detail showed that
NSIs were more likely to take place during the injection
of LA into the patient’s oral tissues (P0.002), accounting for more than half of all injuries reported by dental
students (Table 3). Disposal of the LA equipment was the
second most common cause of NSIs in the dental
students. However, injuries to the nurse student group
solely occurred during the clearance of instruments
including the LA syringes and needles (P0.02). The
attempt of needle recapping was the least reported
mechanism of injuries and constituted only 15% of the
total injuries but was solely related to the conventional
syringe system.

Study course year
This report showed that dental students are at the highest
risk of sustaining needle stick injuries at the fourth year
of their 5-year BDS course with one-third of injuries
(33.3%) being reported among the fourth year group
followed by year 5 students (25%), but the difference
between injuries reported among both groups was not
statistically significant (P0.14). On the other hand,
injuries were more frequent especially among our nurse
students during disposal of the needle as compared with
the needle recapping (P0.01). Needle recapping was the
main issue for the year 3 students claiming 42.9% of
injuries of this student group. This mechanism of injury
was noted to drop as the course advanced to reach only
14.3% of all injuries reported by fifth year students.
Overall 11.7% of NSIs occurred during recapping and
were exclusively reported with use of the conventional
syringes. Similarly, the disposal of the needle was more
dangerous among the conventional syringe users (74.1%)
as compared with the safety syringe users (25.9%) in

both staff and students, and a similar trend was seen
with decline of these injuries in dental students as they
progressed through their course (Table 3).
Syringe system
Overall, 13 NSIs were reported with the use of the
safety system and 47 with the conventional system thus
significantly less NSIs were seen in the safety
syringe system (P0.006). No injuries occurred with
recapping for the safety system as it was not required.
When using the safety system all the injuries occurred
during the administration of LA or during clearance
of the instruments. While disposing sharps, NSIs were
relatively higher compared with conventional syringes
(P0.012). NSIs during the administration of LA
were again more likely to occur using the conventional syringe system. However, the majority of these
injuries occurred during the third year of dental training
when all students were based at KCH for oral surgery
(Table 4).
Discussion
The awareness of the issue of occupational hazards
has begun many decades ago, as it was estimated that
more than 14,000 accidental deaths occurred in the work
place in the United States in 1970 (15). This has led to the
establishment of many organisations that formulate and
enforce the guidelines of occupational safety such as the
Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that
estimates that up to 500,000 percutaneous occupational

injuries are taking place every year in the US, with
approximately 1% from patients who tested positive for
HIV (20). As a consequence to such a high prevalence
of injuries, it was reported that in the USA, more than
50 cases of occupational transmission of HIV and
threefolds of this number are the cases of possible
seroconversion in HCWs (12).
Current investigation showed that Oral Surgery clinics
are the most frequent source of reporting NSIs as
compared to other clinics. This may reflect the cautious
approach of the nursing and teaching staff towards this
subject which is taught to students by the same staff
members. This observation was in agreement with
Cleveland et al. (24) who found that more than onethird of percutaneous injuries are reported by Oral
Surgery units. On the other hand, Wicker and Rabenau
(21) recently reported the NSIs among German dental
professionals and students and showed that the most
frequent procedures involved with NSIs were the
operative dentistry (36.2%) followed by Oral Surgery
procedures which accounted for less than 20% of
incident reporting. In this regard, the literature’s NSI
figures should be approached cautiously as many
authors do not limit the definition of NSIs to the
needle puncture but include any parental contact to
non-intact skin, eye or mucous membrane. The course
study year has influenced the incidence of occupational
exposures due to the use of local anaesthetics but
without a general statistical significance. One-third of
NSIs was reported from year 4 teaching clinics with
around two-thirds of these students sustained their
injuries during their Oral Surgery training. This may
be related to the significant surgical experience undertaken during the fourth year by the students having
to complete 20 extractions over the year. The number
of reports declines as the course advances with year 5
student clinics producing only 25% of the total number
of reports. This observation supports the need for an
increased instruction and handling practice of local
anaesthetic syringes for the junior students to minimise
NSIs. This approach is now adopted at KCL as the Oral
Surgery department organises a comprehensive induction of the year 3 students to the use of various syringes,
the safe ways of injecting local anaesthetic and disposing sharps. The effects of such measures on the
incidence of NSIs is currently monitored and a topic
of an ongoing audit. The increased rate of NSIs reported in year 4 is noticeably higher than among year
3 (21.7%). This might be explained by the increased
workload at that stage of course, as most of the clinical
requirements are concentrated at year 4 as compared
with year 3 which is largely considered as an induction
year to the clinical dentistry. The later observation
was also reported by Stewardson et al. (22), but with
a questionnaire-based survey in a UK equivalent dental
institute with more frequent NSIs reported by the same
students during fourth year of the study course. This
investigation shows that two mechanisms of injury were
equally reported as the most frequent reason for NSIs
sustained by dental students. Nearly 90% of injuries
took place either during administration of the anaesthetic or during disposal of the used needles. On the
other hand, only 11.7% of injuries were sustained during
recapping of the syringe needles. This is similar to the
reported observation by Younai et al. (6). A 10-year
surveillance study of NSIs in the US dental institutes
showed that more than 70% of local anaesthetic-related
NSIs occur during needle insertion and/or needle withdrawal. The other one-third of injuries occurred owing
to sudden patient movement at the time of attempted
injection, similarly reported by Ramos-Gomez et al. (5).
In contrast, earlier reports (18) have shown that the
classical NSIs usually take place during recapping of
the used dental needles. The reported incidence of NSIs
caused by this mechanism is between 22 and 52% of
needle-stick injuries (are the injuries the result of such
practices?). The use of a portable recapping device has
been shown to decrease NSIs fourfold, from 1 in 4,000
to 1 in 16,000 injuries per blood drawing event (19), but
obviously introduction of such equipment is not widely
adopted owing to the added cost and administrative effort needed for implementation. Other approaches
have included a change in the recapping method without the need for any new equipment. Anderson et al.,
1991 (23) described the gravity-resheathing method
where the sheath is placed over the tip of needle and
dropped into place. Another suggestion described by the
same authors is the scooping-resheathing or the singlehand resheathing method. The introduction of such
techniques has shown a significant reduction in the
incidence of NSIs among the undergraduate medical
students (18).
The field of dentistry has responded to the challenge
of the frequent NSIs with more revolutionary engineering solutions, thus eliminating injuries taking place
either during resheathing or during disposal of the
used needle with the introduction of safety dental
syringes. Unlike the non-disposable metallic syringes
where needles must be resheathed in order for the
syringes to be dismantled and the appropriate parts
autoclaved, the safety syringe totally eliminates the need
for needle re-sheathing and both self-recapped needle
and attached local anaesthetic cartridge barrel are
disposed together without the needle to dismantle the
latter from the syringe.
This study highlights that the highest risk of NSIs to
dental students and student nurses occurs within surgical
departments, with the conventional syringe system,
when nurses clear the instruments, and to dental students
when performing LA. Our results also show that the

introduction of such syringes has resulted in elimination
of injuries caused by resheathing of needles and significantly reduced the injuries reported during disposal of
used needles. However, not ALL injuries are prevented by
using safety syringes and this highlights a possible
deficiency in training with this type of equipment.
Conflicting results have been published regarding the
effectiveness of the safety syringes in reducing NSIs.
Taking our results into consideration, we suggested
that*to minimise the incidence of NSIs*both adequate
training and introduction of effective engineering tools
have be to implemented.
