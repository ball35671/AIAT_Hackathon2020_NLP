Health care workers are continually exposed to a
number of potentially dangerous bloodborne
pathogens in the workplace. Needlesticks have long
been identified as being capable of transmitting more
than 20 different pathogens, including HIV and hepatitis B and C.1 In November 1999, the Occupational
Safety and Health Administration issued a revised
directive to ensure uniform inspection procedures to
better enforce the Bloodborne Pathogen Standard, an
update of the previous directive on inspection uniformity contained within it.2 This standard was signed
into law Nov 6, 2000, and became effective April 18,
2001.3 The Occupational Safety and Health
Administration has also created a Web site
(http://www.osha-slc.gov/needlesticks/index.html) with
the latest information on needlestick injuries, including
current research, legislation, and news releases.4
An 800-plus bed hospital serving a major metropolitan population in Texas implemented hospital-wide
safety syringes and needleless-intravenous systems in
all of its departments except in cases in which the use
of traditional needled devices are unavoidable. This
transition occurred in 1997 during a 6-month period.
Accident reports of sharps injuries from the hospital’s
Occupational Health Clinic were used to calculate the
incidence rate 3 years before and 3 years after implementation to compare the effectiveness of these safety
measures. The intent of the analysis was to evaluate
sharps injuries occurring to all health care and ancillary workers to determine whether the engineering
controls were effective in reducing needlestick injuries.
METHODS
The retrospective data were composed of injury
reports from employees who reported an occupational
injury to the hospital’s Occupational Health Clinic
between Jan 1, 1994, and Dec 31, 1999.
Confounders
Confounding variables that may have influenced
analysis included the effect of educational inservices
attended by some or all health care workers during any
time of the study period, knowledge of correct device
usage, and the variability of under-reporting among
occupations.5 One of the confounders present throughout the postintervention phase was the availability of
traditional needled devices.
Data Analysis
The injury reports were used to stratify injuries by
year and to calculate annual incidence rates before and
after implementation of the safety measures for comparison. The data were screened to include only health
care workers who had direct patient contact or ancillary workers who may have been in areas where medical procedures had taken place.6 However, according
to the insurance criteria for this particular hospital,
physicians were not included in the full-time equivalent

(FTE) database under analysis and were therefore
excluded from incidence rate calculations made on the
basis of the FTE.
Statistical significance was measured with the χ2
test, which compared the pooled annual injuries before
and after implementation of the safety measures.7 A χ2
test for trend was also performed to analyze change in
the annual injury incidence rate. Significance was measured at α = 0.05. Analysis was performed on a widely
available software package (SPSS release 10.0; SPSS
Inc, Chicago, Ill).
RESULTS
The database contained 550 entries related to sharp
injuries during the 6-year period. We excluded entries
such as injuries to physicians and those who did not
indicate occupation, leaving 533 injuries. Injuries
caused by devices were classified according to those
resulting from needles, glass, medical devices, and
unidentifiable sources. The χ2 analysis of pooled injury
rates before and after implementation of the safety
devices yielded a significant reduction of injury rates
between the 2 periods (χ2 = 40.5, df = 1, P < .0001). The
Table shows the injury incidence rates resulting from
needle-related devices. A χ2 test for trend to determine
whether a decreasing rate of injury during the 6 years
took place resulted in a score of 63.1 (df = 5, P < .0001).
An analysis of risk comparing occupations and departments could not be accomplished because of insufficient information of at-risk individuals within each of
those categories. The FTE data were only available as a
total number of employees each year in the hospital.
Nevertheless, the manner in which the departments are
separated allows for patient-care staff to be included in
nearly all departments, which allowed overall incidence rate calculations. A close examination of the
trend (Figure) reveals a decline in the years preceding
implementation of the safety devices. According to the
hospital, during 1995 an extensive inservice was begun
to educate all hospital employees on the importance of
needlestick safety and bloodborne pathogens. This type
of program has been previously demonstrated to

decrease such injuries.8 It was not apparent which device
(traditional or safety) was the cause of injury in every
report since that information was not specifically asked.
This was an important limitation that prevented accurate
comparison of the safety devices with traditional devices
and required the assumption that implementation of the
safety devices was responsible for fewer injuries.
DISCUSSION
Although the results showed a significant decrease in
the annual injury incidence in both the comparison of
preintervention and postintervention periods and in a
test for trend, one should be cautious in his or her
interpretation. For example, during the course of the
postimplementation period, traditional needle syringes
and traditional intravenous catheter systems still existed, effectively presenting workers with a choice.
Another important limitation of this study, as with
most retrospective analyses, was the quality and consistency of information available. First, there were no
specific questions on the injury report form regarding
the device used, procedure being performed, or parties
involved in the injury. Instead, an area was provided for
a brief description of what occurred. The mandatory
inclusion of these fields in the database would have
made analysis of injuries more accurate. This illustrates the need for more extensive recordkeeping since
it was not known what device was involved in more
than 58% of injuries, who was at fault in 23% of
injuries, or which procedure was performed in 23% of
injuries. Such information is now mandatory with the
passage of Texas and federal legislation on recording
injuries that occur to health care workers in a sharps
injury log, in addition to making safety needle devices
available to nearly all health care workers.9 To calculate
incidence rates, FTE data were only available as a total
count for each year of analysis rather than for each
occupation and/or department. This allowed an estimation of an average incidence for each year, but occupation- and department-specific rates would have been
more informative for customizing safety planning and
allocation of resources.
