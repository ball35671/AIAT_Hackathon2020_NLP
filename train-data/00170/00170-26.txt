methods. In October 2005, we implemented a program for the use of engineered devices to prevent percutaneous injury in the emergency
department and half of the hospital wards during the following procedures: intravascular catheterization, vacuum phlebotomy, blood-gas
sampling, finger-stick blood sampling, and intramuscular and subcutaneous injections. The nurses in the wards that participated in the
intervention received a 3-hour course on occupationally acquired bloodborne infections, and they had a 2-hour “hands-on” training session
with the devices. We studied the percutaneous injury rate and the direct cost during the preintervention period (October 2004 through
March 2005) and the intervention period (October 2005 through March 2006).
results. We observed a 93% reduction in the relative risk of percutaneous injuries in areas where safety devices were used (14 vs 1
percutaneous injury). Specifically, rates decreased from 18.3 injuries (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.9-43.2 injuries) to 0 injuries per
100,000 patients in the emergency department ( ) and from 44.0 injuries (95% CI, 20.1-83.6 injuries) to 5.2 injuries (95% CI, 0.1- P p .002
28.8 injuries) per 100,000 patient-days in hospital wards ( ). In the control wards of the hospital (ie, those where the intervention P p .007
was not implemented), rates remained stable. The direct cost increase was i0.558 (US$0.753) per patient in the emergency department
and i0.636 (US$0.858) per patient-day in the hospital wards.
conclusion. Proper use of engineered devices to prevent percutaneous injury is a highly effective measure to prevent these injuries
among healthcare workers. However, education and training are the keys to achieving the greatest preventative effect.

Percutaneous injuries are among the most common occupational accidents suffered by healthcare workers (HCWs),
who thereby may be exposed to hepatitis B virus (HBV),
hepatitis C virus (HCV), or human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV). Most percutaneous exposures are needlestick injuries
associated with the drawing of blood samples and the insertion of intravascular catheters.1-4 Accidents associated with
these procedures pose the highest risk of transmission of
bloodborne pathogens because they involve hollow-bore needles and a large quantity of blood.5 The inappropriate disposal
of sharp devices also produces a considerable number of injuries to personnel other than HCWs, such as housekeeping
staff and visitors.
To decrease the risk of exposure, it is necessary to ensure
adherence to standard precautions by means of changes in
work practices.6-8 In addition, vaccination against HBV and
HIV postexposure prophylaxis with antiretroviral drugs are
complementary measures that prevent occupational infections.9-11 However, despite postexposure prophylaxis, occupational HIV infections still occur,12,13 and there is no effective
postexposure prophylaxis to prevent HCV infection.14 In addition, occupational infection with emerging or less common
pathogens is also possible.15-17 Even if infection does not result
from a percutaneous injury, the injury can produce several
kinds of psychological harm (eg, anxiety, depression, and/or
stress)18,19 that considerably affect the HCW’s quality of life.
Designing and implementing the use of devices with safety
mechanisms intended to prevent percutaneous injuries is currently a key strategy for preventing percutaneous injuries,
their consequences, and their collateral effects. In addition to

vacuum phlebotomy systems developed long ago, there are
now needles, catheter introducers, and lancets that sheath or
retract after use. The US Occupational Safety and Health
Administration has strongly recommended that safety-engineered devices should replace conventional items if the safety
devices reduce occupational risks.20 However, there is still
controversy about the effectiveness of these “safer” and more
expensive devices. Therefore, we designed a quasi-experimental trial with preintervention and intervention evaluation
periods to study the effectiveness of properly used safetyengineered devices, compared with the use of conventional
devices, and secondarily, to estimate the financial investment
required to implement the use of these devices as a preliminary step before hospitalwide implementation.
methods
Setting
Our institution (Hospital Virgen de la Salud-Elda; Alicante,
Spain) is a 350-bed general hospital with 190 beds in surgical
wards, 140 beds in medical and pediatric wards, and 20 beds
in medical and surgical intensive care units. There are about
1,000 workers in the hospital. Since January 2002, there has
been an ongoing study of percutaneous injuries and an educational program for the prevention of percutaneous injuries. We prospectively evaluated and registered percutaneous
injuries and their related factors by completing a uniform
needlestick and sharp-object injury data sheet (Epi NetAC,
Spanish Epi Net adapted version; Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention).2 Vacuum phlebotomy systems without needle sheaths were the only safety-engineered device in use
before the study begun. Table 1 summarizes the baseline data
for percutaneous injuries at our institution, and Table 2 provides baseline injury rates.
Study Design
We conducted a quasi-experimental trial with preintervention
and intervention evaluation periods, each lasting for 6
months. We selected fall and winter months, to assure continuity among the employees involved in the study and to
reduce interperiod variability of patients’ comorbid diseases
and reasons for hospitalization. In addition, to maintain baseline rates according to standard working conditions, HCWs
in the areas where the intervention was not implemented
(hereafter, nonintervention wards) were not informed about
the ongoing study.
Intervention
On October 1, 2005, we implemented the use safety-engineered devices in the emergency department, in the medical
intensive care unit and, in half of the hospitalization wards.
During the intervention period, there was a nurse in charge
of the study in each study area.
Study areas. On the basis of the type of activity (medical
vs surgical assistance) and the baseline rate of percutaneous
injuries in each area, we selected 2 surgical wards (general
surgery and gynecology) and 2 medical wards (internal medicine and medical specialties) for the study. The medical intensive care unit was chosen instead of the surgical intensive
care unit because the medical unit was larger.
Educational activity. Nurses ( ) in the wards where N p 75
the intervention was implemented (hereafter, intervention
wards) received education about the devices to be tested and
about ways to improve compliance in both the use of the
devices and the reporting of injuries. The education consisted
of a 3-hour slide review of the risk factors for and the epidemiology, consequences, and prevention of bloodborne infections. Thereafter, nurses participated in a 2-hour “handson” training experience. An additional 15 minutes of on-site
training was carried out each time a new device was tested.
Posters showing how to use the devices were put up in all
nurse stations.
Safety devices. A committee consisting of nurses and physicians selected devices for further testing on the basis of the
device’s activation system, its potential simplicity of use, and
its disposal method. For obtaining blood samples, we provided vacuum phlebotomy systems for both conventional
blood-collection tubes and blood-culture collection tubes
with a needle sheath (Eclipse, Becton-Dickinson; Surshield,
Terumo). We provided vacuum phlebotomy systems with
winged, steel, hooded needles (Saf-T E-Z Set; Becton-Dickinson) and vacuum phlebotomy systems with intravascularline adapters (Surshield; Terumo), the latter for use only in
the emergency department. We also provided blood-gas syringes with a needle sheath (Provent Plus, Smiths; Preserts,
Becton-Dickinson) and lancets with retractable, single-use
puncture sticks (Genie, Becton-Dickinson; Surgilance One
Step, Terumo). For intravascular catheterization, we provided
catheters with safety-engineered introducer needles (Protective Plus, Smith; Versatus-S, Terumo; Insyte Autoguard, Becton-Dickinson). We also provided needles with sheaths for
intramuscular and subcutaneous administration of drugs
(Eclipse, Becton-Dickinson; Surshield, Terumo) and blunt
needles to transfer medication from commercial containers
to the syringes used to administer the medication (BectonDickinson). All devices were tested for the same amount of
time. Nurses in the intervention areas were required to participate in the final process of selecting safety devices by completing an anonymous questionnaire about the functionality
and simplicity of use of each device tested.
Outcome Measures
Our outcome measures were the number of percutaneous
injuries that occurred and the number of devices used. Injury
reporting was voluntary during the preintervention and intervention periods. However, the nurses in charge of the study
carried out active surveillance and reporting of injuries during
the intervention period.

To study the effectiveness of the intervention, we estimated

percutaneous injury rate as the number of injuries per

economic resources, we recorded the number of devices used.
To obtain data for the preintervention period, we reviewed
the orders for devices dispensed in the Economic Resources
Department database. To obtain data for the intervention
period, the nurses in charge of the study monitored and
recorded the number of devices used each week. In the areas
where safety-engineered devices were not in use, we reviewed
and recorded the orders for devices dispensed in the Economic Resources Department database. To make the charges
comparable, we used 2005 prices for both the preintervention
period and the intervention period.
Analysis
We calculated the rate difference and the rate ratio between
the preintervention period and the intervention period for
the emergency department, for the intervention areas, and
for the nonintervention areas. We used the test-based limits
formula to estimate 95% CIs for the rate differences and rate
ratios. We considered the observed differences to be statistically significant when the estimated mid-P exact test (1-
tailed) value was less than .05. In the areas of the hospital
where the program had significant effect, we calculated the
preventive fraction for the intervention period. We used
OpenEpi (open-source software) to compute epidemiologic
comparisons.
We calculated the direct cost of implementing the use safety
devices for the prevention of percutaneous injuries by computing the absolute and the relative cost increase per patientday in the hospitalization wards and per patient in the emergency department.

Effectiveness of Safety-Engineered Devices
During the intervention period, there was a remarkable decrease in the overall number of percutaneous injuries in the
hospital areas where safety devices were used (14 injuries
during the preintervention period, compared with 1 during
the intervention period) (Figure). The sole injury occurred
when a nurse working in a medical ward manipulated a gas
syringe with an attached needle sheath to obtain a venous
blood sample. The nurse had been vaccinated against HBV
before the injury occurred, and the source patient tested negative for hepatitis B surface antigen, HCV, and HIV.
Despite this accident, the average rate of percutaneous injury in the hospital wards that used safety devices dropped
from a baseline rate of 44.0 injuries per 100,000 patient-days
to a postintervention rate of 5.2 injuries per 100,000 patientdays ( ). The preventive fraction was estimated at P p .007
88.3% (Table 3). In the emergency department, the rate of
percutaneous injury dropped from 18.5 to 0.0 injuries per
100,000 patients ( ), and the preventive fraction was P p .002
estimated at 100%. On the other hand, the rate of percutaneous injuries in the nonintervention areas increased slightly
from 40.7 to 48.8 injuries per 100,000 patient-days (P p
.333) during the study.
During the preintervention period, accidents most commonly occurred when nurses manipulated intravascular catheters ( ) or unattached needles ( ). No such ac- n p 6 n p 5
cidents occurred after the introduction of safety-engineered
devices. Specifically, the rates dropped from 45.7 injuries
(95% confidence interval [CI], 16.7-99.5 injuries) to 0 injuries
(95% CI, 0-24.3 injuries) per 100,000 intravascular catheters
used ( ) and from 5.9 injuries (95% CI, 1.9-13.7 P p .005
injuries) to 0 injuries (95% CI, 0-5.8 injuries) per 100,000
unattached needles used ( ). P p .031
Cost of Safety-Engineered Devices
In the emergency department, the direct cost attributed to
the use of safety devices was i14,383 (US$19,417). This was
an increase of i0.558 (US$0.753) per patient, compared with
the preintervention period. In the hospital wards, the direct
cost was i12,101 (US$16,336), which was an increase of
i0.636 (US$0.858) per patient-day (Table 4).
Intravenous catheters with safety-engineered introducer
needles accounted for the highest replacement costs. In the
emergency department, the increase was i0.430 (US$0.580)
per patient, whereas in the hospital wards, it was i0.305
(US$0.412) per patient-day.

injuries, compared with the preintervention period when
HCWs were using conventional devices.
Initial reports that evaluated safety devices showed small
preventative effects and high costs.21,22 These results had unfavorable effects on research to develop better devices with
lower prices. However, since the publication of US Occupational Health and Safety Administration rules about bloodborne pathogen exposure,20 new devices have become available. In a recent report, Sohn et al.23 evaluated the effect of
implementing the use of safety-engineered devices for intravenous delivery and insertion, blood collection, and intramuscular and subcutaneous injection. The authors observed
a 61% overall relative risk reduction for formally reported
percutaneous injury rates and a 62% relative risk reduction
for self-reported percutaneous injury rates. Other authors
have obtained similar results, although the interventions they
have used are different.24-28 The higher efficacy observed in
our study, compared with previous reports, can be explained
by its broader objective. We not only provided safety-engineered devices but also provided education and training to
help assure their proper use. We replaced conventional sharp
medical devices with safety-engineered injury-prevention devices and provided blunt needles to transfer medication from
commercial containers to the syringes used to administer the
medication. Insulin injection systems (“insulin pens”) were
the only nonsafety needle devices that HCWs were allowed
to use. In addition, we specifically educated and trained our
HCWs to improve their compliance in using these devices.
Providing safety devices should not be considered an infallible solution, as most of these devices must be activated
to provide a protective or preventive effect. Lack of activation
is probably the most important cause of failure when a safetyengineered device is used. Lee et al.29 reported that most of
the injuries caused by ineffective safety devices occurred because the device was not fully activated. Mendelson et al.30
observed a 52% reduction in the relative risk for percutaneous
injuries associated with introduction of safety-winged steel
needles. In their study, injuries occurred when the user did
not activate the safety mechanism (32% of injuries) or during
improper activation of the mechanism (21%). Mendelson et
al.30 also found that the safety device was activated on only
83% of the sample devices examined during audits of disposal
containers. Alvarado-Ramy et al.31 evaluated 14,261 phlebotomy devices that were found in 504 sharp-device disposal
boxes audited at 10 US university-affiliated hospitals. Of
these, 89% were devices with safety mechanisms. The authors
observed that activation rates varied from 21% to 95%, according to device-specific features and the amount of HCW
training and involvement in the device-selection process.
Incorrect HCW behavior is a recognized risk factor for
percutaneous injuries31,32 that is related not only to lack of
knowledge but also to poor organizational climate and heavy

workloads at the HCW’s institution.33 Ganczak et al.34 detected fewer percutaneous injuries among nurses who received special training about HIV/AIDS. Specifically, the proportion of percutaneous injuries prevented increased from
56% to 72% when guideline adherence was improved in addition to implementing the use of safety devices.35 Similarly,
Rivers et al.36 observed that high quality training and a positive institutional safety climate might be predictors of good
compliance.36 Therefore, to promote the success of our program, we invested great effort in educational activities directed at improving working behavior and adherence to preventive measures.
Our study had some limitations. First, it was a before-andafter intervention with historical controls and no randomization. Randomization and concealment allocation allows for
a balanced distribution of known and unknown prognostic
variables. However, we tried to maintain control of possible
prognostic variables involved in the study by selecting the
same period of the year and by conducting the study in hospital areas with homogeneously distributed activities. To assure a proper sampling of percutaneous injuries, we designated a nurse to be in charge of detecting and reporting
accidents that occurred in the intervention areas; a greater
detection of injuries in intervention areas would have biased
the efficacy of safety devices toward the null. Reporting compliance is influenced by factors such as the perceived severity
of the potential transmitted disease, the perceived efficacy of
reporting injuries, and the conviction that the source patient
was not infected.34,37 Therefore, our educational activities also
focused on the importance and usefulness of reporting the
injuries. With respect to the analysis of data, we expressed
rates of percutaneous injuries in terms of patient-days or
patients attended, to control for possible imbalances in the
estimated consumption of devices during the preintervention
and postintervention periods. We observed that the number
of devices used during the preintervention period was greater
than that during the intervention period (147,440 vs 121,082
devices), indicating the possibility of a greater risk of injury
during the preintervention period. However, the reduction
in the number of devices used was mainly accounted for by
unattached hypodermic needles used for low-risk procedures.
Blunt needles were used in place of unattached hypodermic
needles in 75% of cases. In high-risk procedures, we observed
an increase in the number of devices used for intravascular
catheterization during the intervention period, compared
with the preintervention period (13,110 vs 15,104 devices).
Finally, our study was limited to a 6-month preintervention
period and a 6-month postintervention period. Therefore, we
could not assess the duration of the intervention’s efficacy.
It is possible that after the study ended, there would be a
slow return to standard routine care because of lack of surveillance (ie, the Hawthorne effect). We observed that after
the study ended there were 4 percutaneous injuries in the
intervention areas (3 in the emergency department and 1 in
the hospital wards). Two of the accidents occurred during the
recapping of insulin administration pens, devices that were
not safety engineered and that carried a high risk of injury.38
The other 2 accidents occurred prior to activation of the safety
mechanism. Three of the 4 accidents occurred during the
summer, a holiday period when our center hires HCWs with

use of safety devices and prevention of percutaneous injuries 1359
economic burden of hospitalwide implementation of the use
of safety devices. Taking into account only direct costs, the
replacement of conventional devices with safety-engineered
devices required a 3-fold increase in the budget allocated to
these materials. Safety-engineered devices are undoubtedly
expensive; however, whether the cost was evaluated in terms
of each patient attended or by patient-day, the investment
was small: i0.69 (US$0.93) per patient attended in the emergency department and 0.83i (US$1.12) per patient-day in the
hospital wards. In summary, our study shows that proper use
of safety-engineered devices to prevent percutaneous injuries
effectively prevents needlestick injuries. However, training
and education must accompany any intervention.
