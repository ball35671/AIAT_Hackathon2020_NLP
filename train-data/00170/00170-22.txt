Summary: Documentation of needlestick injuries was started in the Christian Medical College Hospital,
Vellore in 1993. In 1995 large sharps containers were introduced, accompanied by an intensive education
programme. Details of documented injuries from 1993 to 1999 were analysed using the Epi-Info software.
A total of 347 injuries occurred, mainly due to improper disposal of needles, re-capping and carelessness
during use. The percentage of injuries attributed to disposal fell from 69.2% in 1995 to 38.5% in 1996 (after
the education programme). A further decrease was noted after the additional introduction of small sharps
containers. In 1995, 73% of injuries involved housekeeping staff, this fell to 12% in 1998. Relatively simple
interventions decreased the numbers of injuries, and we recommend that all healthcare institutions should
have a system of documenting needlestick injuries, and take measures to decrease their incidence.

Introduction
Healthcare workers are at risk of acquiring infections from their patients, particularly those that are
blood borne such as HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis
C. Percutaneous injuries, especially those caused by
hollow needles are the commonest route for infection. The risk of transmission of HIV following a
hollow needle injury has been shown to be approximately 0.3%, compared with 0.09% for mucosal
exposure, and 0.009–0.09% following injury from a
solid needle.1–5
In developing countries such as India, re-usable
metal needles were used until the late 1980s. These
were autoclaved and re-used, but with increasing
knowledge about blood borne pathogens a change
to disposable needles took place. Used disposable
needles would be placed with other infectious waste
into plastic containers in each ward. The containers
would be emptied by housekeeping staff into larger
containers and taken for incineration. The presence
of used needles presented a hazard to those who
empty the containers; therefore segregation of
waste was introduced together with separate sharps
containers.
Recently, devices for vascular access modified to
reduce the chance of percutaneous injuries have
become available. These are relatively expensive
and so are not routinely used in the developing
countries such as India, despite the higher prevalence of blood-borne pathogens compared to developed nations. It is nonetheless important to prevent
the spread of blood-borne pathogens to healthcare
workers. We describe the change in pattern of

SHORT REPORT
needlestick injuries following simple and relatively
inexpensive interventions: namely intensive education programmes and the introduction of sharps
containers in patient care areas.
Method
In 1993, the Staff and Student Health Service of
the Christian Medical College Hospital, Vellore
introduced a system of reporting and documenting
occupational exposure to blood and body fluids and
administering appropriate postexposure prophylaxis.
In 1995 large containers for sharps were placed in
the centre of each ward, usually in the nurse’s station or treatment room. Along with the introduction of these containers was a week-long intensive
education programme on blood-borne pathogens
and the importance of safe disposal of sharps. In
1998, smaller containers were introduced into all
patient areas. Healthcare workers were again educated on the proper disposal of sharps and
instructed to take these containers to the bedside
while doing a procedure. Documented exposures
from 1993 to May 1999 to blood and body fluids
were analysed using the Epi-Info software.
Results
A total of 347 injuries due to hollow needles were
documented. The main causes were improper disposal, carelessness during procedures and re-capping needles (Table I). ‘Carelessness during
procedures’ included injuries to workers assisting
with a procedure, and those to the non-dominant
hand while removing the needle from the patient’s
vein. Injuries due to a restless patient, or an irritable, fidgety child were included under ‘patient factors’. Figure 1 shows the percentage of needlestick
injuries attributable to improper disposal of sharps.
In 1995, 73% of injuries involved housekeeping
(domestic) staff, who accounted for only 24% of
injuries in 1996, and 12% in 1998.
Discussion
From 1993 to 1995 the proportion of needlestick
injuries caused by improper disposal of sharps had
increased from 42% to 69%. Thereafter this proportion fell, corresponding to the education programme and introduction of large sharps
containers. A further fall was seen after the introduction of smaller containers in 1998. The main
reduction was in injuries to housekeeping staff. The
increase in total injuries reported in 1998 (Table I)
followed better reporting stimulated by the second
education programme.
Most needlestick injuries are due to preventable
causes such as re-capping needles, improper disposal, or sealing a sample for blood gas analysis
with a cork. Klontz et al.
6 following a survey in
Florida, found that 62% of injuries could have been

prevented by use of proper needle disposal techniques. McCormick et al.
7 demonstrated a two-fold
reduction in injuries by making disposal units available at the beside. Active steps must be taken to
reduce the number of such injuries. Our study
shows the effectiveness of simple steps such as education and introduction of an adequate number of
sharps containers. Healthcare workers should never
re-cap a needle but discard it directly into a sharps
container. Other measures that could help are
single-handed sealing of blood gas samples and
using an instrument to remove the needle from the
syringe. A continuing education programme with
feedback from staff is essential, and we strongly
recommend that all healthcare institutions should
have a system for documenting and analysing
injuries, and adopt measures for their prevention.
