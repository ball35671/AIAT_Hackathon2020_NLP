abstract
Objectives: This study compares the effectiveness of two types of interventions with no intervention on
the prevention of needle stick injuries (NSIs).
Methods: Health care workers, who were at risk for NSIs, were eligible for this three-armed cluster randomized controlled trial. In total, 23 hospital wards were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 intervention
groups, which were given either a needle safety device and a workshop (NW; 7 wards, n = 267) or a workshop only (W; 8 wards, n = 263), or to a control group (C; 8 wards, n = 266). The primary outcome was the
half-year incidence of NSIs, which was measured through questionnaires and official notification at the
occupational health service at baseline (T0), 6 months (T1) and 12 months (T2) after baseline. Analysis
were done by intention to treat. This study is registered as a prospective randomized trial, number
NTR1207.
Results: A statistically significant difference was found between the groups for the half-year incidence of
NSIs (p = 0.046) on the basis of questionnaire data with ORs for reported NSIs for the NW group compared
with the control group of 0.34 (95% CI: 0.13–0.91) and 0.45 (95% CI: 0.19–1.06) for the W group compared
with the control group. The officially registered NSIs during the study period showed no statistical differences between the groups.
Conclusions: The combined intervention of the introduction of needle safety devices and an interactive
workshop led to the highest reduction in the number of self-reported NSIs compared to a workshop alone
or no intervention.

1. Introduction
Worldwide, needle stick injuries (NSIs) are frequently reported
as occupational injuries among health care workers (Leigh et al.,
2008; EU-OSHA 2008). Twelve-month NSI incidences of 26–80%
are reported among health care workers (Askarian et al., 2007;
Smith et al., 2006). The health effects of a NSI can be significant
when blood-to-blood contact occurs from patient to health care
worker. Particularly reported in this respect are the transmission
of bloodborne pathogens such as human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) (Davanzo
et al., 2008). Infection by these viruses can lead to serious and even
fatal illnesses (Kuruuzum et al., 2008). Since there is currently no
vaccine or cure for HIV/AIDS, a course of post-exposure prophylaxis is recommended as soon as possible after occupational exposure (Peate, 2004; Young et al., 2007). HBV infection is preventable
by vaccination, but no vaccine against hepatitis C is available (Puro
et al., 2005).
Unsafe procedures, difficult working conditions and unsafe
devices (Wicker et al., 2008) as well as lack of knowledge, training
and enforcement (Zungu et al., 2008) and fatigue (Fisman et al.,
2007) are reported as causes for NSIs. Wicker et al. (2008) recommended the introduction of safety devices as one of the main starting points to prevent NSIs. Additional preventive measures, such as
training in safe working routines (Wicker et al., 2008) and personal
protective equipment (Berguer and Heller, 2005) are expected to
further improve safe work conditions.
The objective of this study was to evaluate whether the number
of NSIs decreased among health care workers at risk in the wards
of a Dutch academic hospital due to: (i) the introduction of injection needles with safety devices in combination with an interactive
workshop or (ii) an interactive workshop only.

hospital divisions, were randomly assigned to an intervention
group that was subjected to the use of a ‘Needle safety device plus
a Workshop’ (NW group; seven wards, n = 267), to an intervention
group that was subjected to a ‘Workshop only’ (W group; eight
wards, n = 263) or to a ‘Control group’ with no intervention (C
group; eight wards, n = 266). Health care workers from the hospital
wards were followed in the NW group (n = 267), in the W group
(n = 263) and in the C group (n = 266) for 12 months and their
half-year incidences of NSIs were compared.
2.2. Interventions
2.2.1. Workshop
The intervention ‘workshop’ consisted of a one-hour interactive
PowerPoint presentation where participants of one ward were
informed and information was exchanged with each other about
the prevalence, causes, consequences and prevention of NSIs in
their hospital wards. Each workshop was performed by two trainers: one person guided the process and one person, experienced in
working with different types of hospital needles, actively involved
all participants. One trainer wrote a short report of the interactive
discussion during the workshop. The workshops were carried out
in the coffee or meeting room of the wards during the change
between the morning and evening shifts (15:00–16:00 h). At each
ward, the workshop was offered two to three times between
February and May 2007. Feedback on awareness and attitude to
risks, best practices and possible improvement with respect to
the prevention of NSI was given to the head nurse of every ward
by means of a short leaflet after finishing all workshops.
2.2.2. Needle safety device & workshop
The intervention ‘needle safety device & workshop’ consisted of
workshops (see paragraph above) followed by the introduction of a
new injection needle with a safety device (BD EclipseTM). This
injection needle with a safety device (see Figs. 1a and 1b), which
was selected by the occupational health service of the academic
hospital, was introduced through the supplier of this device. The
supplier demonstrated the new working method for the injection
needles with safety devices after the last workshop and during
the official breaks of that day at each ward. The day after the demonstration, all of the existing injection needles on the ward were
replaced by the new injection needles with the safety device.
Appointments concerning stock control were made with a contact
person at each ward.
2.3. Measurement instruments
Questionnaires and an official hospital notification registry
were used as measurement instruments at three time points: baseline (T0) in December 2006, 6 months follow-up (T1) and
12 months follow-up (T2). The questionnaire was developed using
an existing questionnaire for monitoring Dutch safety projects
(Rigo, 2005). The questionnaire contained questions relating to:
– Personal and job characteristics: age, gender, profession (nurse
or physician), managerial tasks (yes/no), type of employment
(fixed or temporary), contractual hours.
– Needle stick injuries: frequency of NSIs during the previous
6 months.
– Behavioral process measures: knowledge, attitude, motivation,
skills, facilitation for safer work with needles and safety culture
at the ward.
– Implementation and appreciation of the interventions (at
6 months follow-up).
The pre-existing official hospital register for reporting NSIs was
used as second measure of the frequency of NSIs during the previous 6 months.
2.4. Outcome measures
2.4.1. Primary outcome measures
The primary outcome variable was the number of NSIs within a
6 months period. On an individual level, all workers at risk for NSI
were questioned on the occurrence of NSIs during the previous
6 months on an ordinal scale (no; yes, once; yes, more than once).
On the cluster level, all officially registered NSIs of the study wards
were retrieved from the official hospital database during the same
measurement period as the individual level with questionnaires.
2.4.2. Behavioral change measures
Behavioral change (Grol, 1997) for the prevention of NSIs was
evaluated among the health care workers at risk. Six process measures were constructed to determine the behavioral change at the
individual and department levels in the three groups for the workers at the wards. Knowledge (Cronbach’s alpha at baseline: 0.47)
was assessed by means of four questions about the prevalence
and consequences of NSIs (‘right’, ‘not right’ or ‘don’t know’); a
sum score (0–4) of the right answers across these four questions
was calculated. Attitude (Cronbach’s alpha at baseline: 0.78) was

H.F. van der Molen et al. / Safety Science 49 (2011) 1180–1186 1181
assessed by means of seventeen propositions about safe working
with needles by workers themselves, colleagues and management
(5-point ordinal scale varying from ‘totally agree’ to ‘totally disagree’); a sum score (0–68) of the propositions was calculated after
recoding with the maximal score as the highest positive attitude
towards safe working with needles. Motivation was assessed by
means of one question about the motivation to carry out measures
in order to work safely with needles (nominal scale ‘yes’, ‘no’, ‘not
applicable, I already work as safe as possible’), with ‘yes’ or ‘already
work as safe as possible’ representing the presence of motivation.
Skills were assessed by three separate questions about sufficient
skills to work safe with three specific type of needles, i.e., injection
needles, blood tapping needles and infusion needles (nominal
scale: ‘yes’, ‘no’, ‘don’t know’), with ‘yes’ representing the sufficiency of skills. Facilitation for safer work with needles was
assessed by ten questions: one question about the existence of a
safety policy (nominal scale: ‘yes’, ‘no’, ‘don’t know’), with ‘yes’
representing the existence of a safety policy at the department,
two dichotomous questions regarding the availability of personal
protective equipment concerning gloves and safety goggles, one
dichotomous question about the use of measures, and safety culture (Cronbach’s alpha at baseline: 0.89) with six questions about
the attention for safety aspects at the wards (five-point ordinal
scale from ‘too little attention’ to ‘too much attention’). For safety
culture, a sum score of optimal attention (i.e., adequate attention
in between too little and too much) across these six questions
was calculated with the maximum score (six) as the level of optimal safety culture in the wards.
2.5. Sample size
No sample size calculation was performed, because all eligible
wards of the academic hospital were included with exception of
the pediatric wards. The pediatric wards were not included
because other injection needles were being used in children that
could not be replaced by needles with safety devices during the
study period. In total, 23 eligible wards with 796 participants at
risk for NSIs were included in this study.
2.6. Randomization
The stratified allocation of the wards to the intervention groups
or to the control group was performed using a random, computerized allocation procedure. The primary researcher (HM) blindly
randomized the groups for the hospital wards and workshop
teachers as well as the needle supplier and the needle-use trainers.
The trainers who guided the workshops were assigned by the project leader of the occupational health service on the basis of availability. The intervention and implementation strategy made blind
group assignment impossible for the participating wards, the
workers and the trainers.
2.7. Statistical methods and analysis
Differences in individual and job characteristics between the
intervention groups and the control group at baseline were examined using generalized estimated equations (GEE) correcting for
wards.
The number of self-reported NSIs during the previous 6 months
for each respondent was dichotomized (no versus P1) for each
time of measurement. Longitudinal analysis of self-reported NSIs
were performed and included all respondent data. Differences in
the proportion of respondents with NSIs between the intervention
groups and the control group for each time of measurement were
examined using GEE correcting for wards. Changes in the proportion of workers with NSIs during follow-up (T1 and T2) were
analyzed using GEE with wards and workers as cluster variables
and the type of intervention, time and their interaction (intervention x time) as co-variables under the assumption of an exchangeable working correlation matrix. The effects of both interventions
were compared with the control group using odds ratios.
The number of official hospital register-based NSIs was converted into the cluster level, i.e., the number of NSIs for each ward
during the previous 6 months corresponding with the time frame
of the questionnaire-based NSIs (T0, T1 or T2, respectively). For calculating the NSI incidence, the number of included workers at
baseline per ward was used as the denominator. Differences in
the proportions of respondents with NSIs between the intervention
groups and the control group for each time of measurement were
examined using cross sectional non-parametric Kruskal–Wallis
tests.
The six behavioral process measurements were dichotomized
(presence of motivation, skills, facilitation) or converted into continuous variables on a scale of 0–100 (degree of knowledge, attitude and safety culture). Only participants with complete data at
baseline, 6 and 12 months follow-up (T0, T1 and T2, respectively)
were included in the analysis. To analyze the differences between
the intervention and control groups over time, GEE analysis for the
dichotomous variables and linear mixed-model (LMM) analysis for
continuous variables were performed based on repeated measures
with adjustments for cluster randomization. Differences within the
intervention and control groups over time (T0 versus T1 and T1
versus T2) were also examined using paired t-tests or McNemar
tests.
The analysis were performed on an intention-to-treat basis. Statistical analysis were carried out in SPSS version 15.1. Statistical
significance was defined as p < 0.05 for all outcome measures.
3. Results
3.1. Participants
Fig. 2 shows the hospital wards (clusters) and their workers
(individuals) in the various study phases. Of the 23 eligible and
included wards, a total of 796 workers at risk for NSIs participated
in the study. At the individual level, the baseline questionnaires
were returned by 495 participants (response: 62%). Personal characteristics of the participants at baseline are depicted in Table 1.
Participants using different types of needles, being often at risk
for patient blood contact or for NSIs did not differ between groups
at baseline.
3.2. Performance indicators of the intervention on the cluster
and individual levels
At the cluster level, all 15 intervention wards (NW and W
groups) received the workshop and the existing injection needles
were replaced by injection needles with safety devices after
instruction for eight of these wards (NW group). In total, eight
trainers carried out 44 workshops (23 in NW group and 21 in W
group). At the individual level, 308 of the aimed for 530 participants (58%) attended the workshop (62% in the NW group and
54% in the W group).
Data from the questionnaire at 6 months follow-up showed that
65% of the NW group and 56% of the W group reported attending a
workshop; one respondent of the control group reported to attending a workshop. From the NW group, 89% reported the use of injection needles with safety devices; 2% in the W group and 5% in the C
group reported the use of injection needles with safety devices. In
total, 47% (W group; n = 45) to 56% (NW group; n = 43) reported
that the workshop increased safer work, while 62% of the NW

3.3.1. Questionnaire-based NSI
Information about NSIs was available at baseline from 491 participants. In total, 36 participants (7.3%) reported at least 1 NSI during the last 6 months at baseline (T0). The proportion of
participants with at least 1 NSI at T0 was 7.2% (NW), 6.3% (W)
and 8.5% (C) in the three groups (p = 0.827) (see Table 2 and
Fig. 3). When corrected for cluster effects of the wards and individual participants, there were no statistically significant differences
in the proportion of participants with NSIs between groups at T1
and T2 (p = 0.616). When averaged over T1 and T2, there was a statistically significant difference in the proportion of participants
with NSIs between groups (p = 0.046) with ORs of 0.34 (95% CI:
0.13–0.91) for the NW group compared to the control group and
0.45 (95% CI: 0.19–1.06) for the W group compared to the control
group.

3.3.2. Official hospital register-based NSIs
The proportion of participants with NSIs at T0 was 3.4% (NW),
2.7% (W) and 3.4% (C) in the three groups (see Table 2). No significant differences between groups were observed at baseline (T0),
6 months (T1) and 12 months (T2) follow-up (p = 0.932, 0.718
and 0.277, respectively).
3.4. Behavioral change measures
Information about behavioral process measures was available at
baseline, 6 months and 12 months follow-up from 160 participants
(see Table 3). Knowledge, attitude, motivation, skills and availability of personal protective equipment were not significantly different between the intervention and control groups over time.
Preventive policy with respect to safer work with needles was
significantly different between the intervention groups and the
control group over time (p = 0.047). The greatest increases in preventive policy were reported in the NW group from 34% at baseline
to 70% at 6 months follow-up (p < 0.000) and 60% at 12 months follow-up (p = 0.004).
Measures to increase safer work practices with needles were
significantly different between the intervention and control groups
over time (p < 0.000). The greatest increases in implemented measures were reported in the NW group from 12% at baseline to 65%
at 6 months follow-up (p < 0.000) and 72% at 12 months follow-up
(p < 0.000), and in the W group from 18% at baseline to 41% at
6 months follow-up (p = 0.003).
Safety culture in the wards was different between the
intervention and control groups over time (p = 0.050). The greatest
increases in safety culture, in terms of optimal attention to safety
when working with needles, were reported in the NW group from
48 at baseline to 63 at 6 months follow-up (p = 0.018) and 69 at
12 months follow-up (p = 0.003).
4. Discussion
4.1. Effectiveness and methodological issues
The reductions in self-reported NSIs in the NW and W groups
with 64% and 21%, respectively, over the 12 months follow-up period are consistent with the estimated preventive fraction of Wicker
et al. (2008). The strength of this effectiveness study lies in the fact
that it was carried out by means of a RCT design on nursing wards
during patient care (Rogers and Goodno, 2000; Lachin et al., 1998).
The most important confounding factor in this study (i.e., working
with injection needles) was equally divided between the groups.
Also, the half-year NSI incidence showed no significant difference
between the intervention and control groups at baseline. Other
confounding factors could be age, apprenticeship and working under non-fixed contracts (see Table 2). These factors seem interrelated, possibly indicating a higher proportion of less-experienced
workers in the NW intervention group compared to the other
groups. Eventually, in the NW group this could result in a higher
proportion at risk for NSIs, more susceptibility to behavior change
and higher rates of turnover.
Following the quality list for methodological quality for randomized studies of healthcare interventions (Downs and Black,
1998), the largest limitation of this study was the high proportion
of workers lost to follow-up. At the cluster level, all wards remained in the study, but at the individual level 49% were lost at
12 months follow-up for the main outcome measure of selfreported NSIs compared to baseline. This relatively high loss to follow-up affects the internal validity of the study; however, the
losses to follow-up are comparable between the NW (52%) and C
(59%) groups and to a lesser degree with the W group (36%). In
addition, through a complete longitudinal dataset analysis for the
main outcome measure, the statistical power remained adequate
to detect a statistically and clinically relevant effect.
Method triangulation by means of the official hospital-based
registration of NSIs was meant to reduce the risk of reporting bias.
From the questionnaire respondents at baseline, 39% of the health
care workers indicated that they did not officially report NSIs. Notifications by official hospital-based registers, however, are also selfreported and likely to underestimate the actual occurrence of NSIs
(Schmid et al., 2007), introducing even more bias (Sohn et al.,
2004a). No reduction in the number NSIs as registered in the official hospital database could be due to a lack of compliance to systematically report to the occupational health service and the cross
sectional analysis of these data.
4.2. Implications for research and practice
Several additional prospective studies (Rogers and Goodno,
2000; Rogues et al., 2004; Sohn et al., 2004b; Tuma and Sepkowitz,
2006; Adams and Elliott, 2006; Valls et al., 2007) have demonstrated the reducing effect of safety devices on NSIs. Most studies,
however, did not use control groups and did not provide insight
into the behavioral change aspects that are necessary for the
implementation and continuing use of safety devices within specific settings and contexts, like the academic hospital setting in this
study. Although the duration at risk will be reduced when injecting
activities are carried out with the safety device, additional safety
measures should still be carried out, such as the implementation
of safety devices for other types of needles and sharp instruments,
education and training (Valls et al., 2007), user evaluation of needle
protective devices (Adams and Elliott, 2006), adequate (number of)
needle containers (Sellick et al., 1991) and reducing long working
hours (Fisman et al., 2007).
For practice, the use of relatively simple protective needle
safety devices and interactive communication are effective measures for reducing NSI’s. In these interactive communications,
additional safety measures, such as good housekeeping, training
and the use of personal protective equipment, could be discussed
and implemented. Vaccination (hepatitis B vaccination) and adequate procedures when a NSI occurs (e.g., post-exposure prophylaxis) remain necessary for secondary prevention purposes.
