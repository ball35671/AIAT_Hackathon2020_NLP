ABSTRACT
Introduction: The performance of a new safety peripheral intravenous catheter (PIVC) that contains a
blood control feature in the hub (blood control) was compared against the current hospital standard without
blood control (standard).
Methods: In this prospective, non-blinded trial, patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either device.
Insertions were performed and rated by emergency room nurses. Primary endpoints included clinical
acceptability, incidence of blood leakage, and risk of blood exposure. Secondary endpoints were digital
compression, insertion success, and usability.
Results: 15 clinicians performed 152 PIVC insertions (73 blood control, 79 standard). Clinical acceptability of the blood control device (100%) was non-inferior to the standard (98.7%) (p < 0.0001). The blood
control device had a lower incidence of blood leakage (14.1% vs 68.4%), was superior in eliminating the
risk of blood exposure (93.9% vs 19.1%) and the need for digital compression (95.3% vs 19.1%), while maintaining non-inferior insertion success rates (95.9% vs 93.7%) and usability ratings (p < 0.0001).
Discussion: In comparison with the hospital-standard, the new safety PIVC with integrated blood control
valve had similar clinical acceptability ratings yet demonstrated superior advantages to both clinicians
and patients to decrease blood leakage and the clinician’s risk of blood exposure, during the insertion
process.

1. Introduction
The peripheral intravenous catheter (PIVC) is the most commonly used device for gaining vascular access in the clinical setting.
Nearly 300 million PIVCs are used in United States hospitals alone
each year (Maki, 2008; Maki et al., 2006). Use of PIVCs places health
care workers at risk for exposure to blood and possible transmission of a number of pathogens, including hepatitis B and C and
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Exposure may occur because
of needlestick injuries (NSIs) and/or blood that is back-flowing
through the open end of the catheter hub.
The incidence and need for reduction of NSIs among providers
inserting PIVCs have been a subject of study globally (Elmiyeh et al.,
2004; Mallin and Sinclair, 2003; Porta et al., 1999; Saia et al., 2010;
Sharma et al., 2010; Yang and Mullan, 2011). Comparatively, less
attention has been paid to accidental mucocutaneous blood exposure, and the impact of risks in in curred through such exposures,
that can occur through catheter leakage, backflow at the hub, or
splatter that originates when needle-safety mechanisms are activated during PIVC insertion. One study assessing the safety of PIVCs
found that blood exposure occurred in 10%–27% of all PIVC insertions – either on the clinician’s skin, gloves, mask or clothes or on
the surrounding environment (Prunet et al., 2008). Another study
demonstrated that the very small droplets of blood (<1 nL) from PIVC
spatter confer negligible risk of transmittable diseases such as hepatitis B and C and HIV (Wittmann et al., 2013). However, results from
a conflicting study indicated that spatter contamination, along with
“oozing” of blood from the device, deposits particles that could

potentially cause transmission of blood-borne viruses (Roff et al.,
2014). Regardless of these contradictory conclusions, investigators of both studies emphasized the importance of instituting
improvements for reducing mucocutaneous blood exposures among
health care workers during PIVC insertions.
Both risk of NSIs and blood exposure have the potential to be greatly
reduced, if not eliminated, with the advent of improved PIVC technology. For PIVCs with blood control, there are three main categories
of devices: active, passive, and closed systems. The closed system, or
integrated closed intravenous catheter systems (CICS), includes a preattached stabilization platform and extension set, and represents the
most expensive of the blood control devices. The “active” safety blood
control catheters are less expensive and do not include a preattached extension set. These devices have a safety mechanism within
the catheter itself that must be activated by the clinician for the needle
guard to lock over the introducer needle, as well as an integrated blood
control valvewithin the catheter hub. The “passive” safety blood control
devices are generally the least expensive blood control device, also
do not have a pre-attached extension set, and the safety mechanism
engages during the normal use of the product.
Recently, three studies have been published evaluating the ease
of insertion and the effectiveness of both active and passive safety
catheters in reducing staff’s risk of accidental needlestick, in reducing the occurrence of abnormal blood reflux, and in reducing
staff exposure to patients’ blood (Onia et al., 2011; Prunet et al.,
2008; Tamura et al., 2014). However, no such studies have been
published evaluating a new active safety catheter that also contains a blood control feature in the catheter hub, and no studies
have examined PIVC usage in an emergency department (ED) setting.
Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess the clinical performance of a new blood control catheter compared with the current
hospital standard in ED patients requiring PIVC insertion. Primary
outcomes of the study were to assess device acceptability ratings,
incidence of blood leakage, and risk of blood exposure, and the
secondary outcomes evaluated use of digital compression during
the insertion process, PIVC insertion success rates, and clinical
usability.
2. Methods
2.1. Study design and devices
This was a prospective, non-blinded, randomized, controlled,
single-center post-market study conducted in the ED of Alberta Health
Services’ Foothills Medical Centre in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Subject
insertions were randomized 1:1 by participating clinicians to either
the blood control device or to the standard-of-care control. The study
was reviewed and approved by the hospital’s Research Ethics Board
(REB) andmade publicly available on clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02119351)
prior to subject recruitment. All insertions were performed per hospital requirements following standard precautions.
The blood control device for the study was the ViaValve® Safety
I.V. Catheter (Smiths Medical, St. Paul, MN), and the standard device
was the ProtectIV® Safety I.V. Catheter (Smiths Medical, St. Paul, MN),
the current standard of care for the hospital. Clinicians participating in the study used the straight hub version of the standard device
during the study to appropriately compare with the blood control
device performance; however, the primary configuration used at the
hospital outside of the study was the standard winged product. Both
study devices are active safety PIVCs, and the functional difference between the 2 products is that the blood control device includes
a valve that is designed to restrict blood flow back out of the catheter hub upon initial venepuncture. The blood control device also
contains a window within the introducer needle of the 20–24 G sizes
for early confirmation of vessel entry.
2.2. Study population
Licensed ED nurses at least 18 years of age inserting at least 2
PIVCs per week for a minimum of 3 months were eligible for study
inclusion. All eligible individuals in the ED were asked to participate in the study. Those interested and eligible provided informed
consent and baseline demographic information about their medical
and PIVC insertion experience. After being trained on the protocol
and blood control device, the clinicians performed 20 practice insertions into vein pad models before beginning study insertions on
subjects.
All patients who were indicated to receive a PIVC and were willing
and able to sign an informed consent were eligible for enrollment
as a study subject. Indicated use of a PIVC was defined as: the need
to gain access to a vein or artery to sample blood, monitor blood
pressure, or administer intravenous fluids as part of treatment.
2.3. Data collection
Study clinicians collected and recorded all data. After obtaining subject informed consent, baseline demographic information
was collected, and the subject was then randomized to receive either
the blood control or standard device. For each PIVC insertion attempted, the study clinicians were allowed a total of 3 venepuncture
attempts to gain vascular access. Data collection about the PIVC insertion continued until PIVC removal for all successful insertions
(if possible) or stopped at the time an insertion failure status was
reached. Study subjects were able to have 1 or more PIVCs inserted by 1 or more clinicians, depending upon the subject’s medical
needs and participating clinicians’ availability.
For each successful PIVC insertion, clinicians answered questions regarding clinical acceptability, blood exposure risk, blood
leakage, use of digital compression, insertion success, securement, and clinical usability (ease of use) of the assigned PIVC. Once
a clinician completed all study insertions, an overall assessment of
the performance of both PIVCs was collected. Data were also collected for clinician or subject withdrawal, adverse events related
to the PIVC insertion, and deviations from the clinical protocol.
2.4. Statistical analysis
The primary endpoints were clinical acceptability, incidence of
blood leakage, and risk of blood exposure. Secondary endpoints included the need for digital compression, insertion success, and
clinical usability. For all of the primary and secondary endpoints
except the measurement of blood leakage, clinicians indicated their
agreement with provided statements using a 6-point Likert scale
and were grouped into 2 categories of Agree (Strongly Agree, Agree,
and Somewhat Agree) and Disagree (Somewhat Disagree, Disagree, and Strongly Disagree).
The unit of observation was the insertion of an intravenous catheter. The study was initially designed to enroll 30 clinicians, with
each clinician performing a total of 10 insertions, 5 with each device
(300 insertions total). The sample size was based on the primary
outcome of clinical acceptability and the planned non-inferiority
comparison of the blood control device to the standard device, with
a non-inferiority margin of 15%, 90% power, at a one-sided alpha
of 0.05, and an anticipated acceptability rating of 95% (Blackwelder,
1982). With 10 observations per clinician, a modest intra-clinician
correlation of 0.2, and a low attrition rate (5%), a total of 300 insertions were planned. However, because of clinician availability,
15 clinicians were targeted to perform a maximum of 20 insertions each, with a target of at least 150 insertions total.
Statistical analyses were performed using SAS, version 9.2 (SAS
Institute, Cary, NC). Study subject data were summarized using descriptive statistics. Two-sided 95% confidence intervals were

calculated for event-rate differences between the standard and blood
control devices. For inferential assessments between the two groups,
Fisher’s exact test was used for binary variables, and a t-test was
used for continuous variables. A p-value of <0.05 was considered
statistically significant. As there were multiple observations per clinician and to account for potential correlations within clinicians,
generalized estimating equations (GEE) with the exchangeable correlation structure for within-clinician correlations were used.
3. Results
A total of 15 ED nurses and 150 subjects were enrolled in the
study. Two clinicians withdrew before performing any insertions,
and 1 subject withdrew from the study after the initial attempt to
place the assigned PIVC was unsuccessful. Tables 1 and 2 provide
descriptive summary statistics of the demographic data for participating clinicians and subjects, respectively. Two of the
participating subjects received 2 insertions, bringing the total number
of study insertions to 152. There were a total of 4 PIVC-related
adverse events reported during the study. All events were hematomas, 2 for each catheter type, and both resolved with observation.
A total of 73 insertions were attempted or successfully placed
using the blood control device and 79 using the standard device.
Despite the complete range of sizes made available (14–24 g), the
device sizes selected for insertion were primarily the 18 g × 1¼″
(46/73 blood control and 41/79 standard insertions) and 20 g × 1¼″
(27/73 blood control and 33/79 standard insertions). There were 4
standard device insertions where an 18 g was used for the first venepuncture and 20 g for the second, and one 14 g × 1¼″ standard
device was also used. As the setting was the ED, the indwell times
were either of short duration (mean approximately 2 hours) or
unknown due to patients being moved to an inpatient status. Table 3
provides additional summary statistics for the PIVC insertion data
for both devices, including insertion technique, vessel adequacy, insertion location, number of venipunctures per subject, and catheter
dislodgement during needle withdrawal.
3.1. Clinical acceptability
Clinicians rated the clinical acceptability of each PIVC insertion
with the statement, “The PIVC was clinically acceptable for the
purpose of intravenous or arterial insertion.” Table 4 presents the
summary statistics by device and the results of the statistical comparisons of superiority of the blood control PIVC compared to the
standard device for the pre-specified endpoints. The clinical acceptability of the blood control device was statistically noninferior to the standard, with 72/72 of the evaluable blood control
insertions (100%) and 76/77 standard insertions (98.7%) receiving
a clinical acceptability rating of somewhat agree or above (noninferiority margin = 15%; p < 0.0001). The predominant response was
“strongly agree” – 64/72 for the blood control device (88.9%) and
67/77 for the standard device (87.0%). There was 1 rating of somewhat disagree, which was reported from use of the standard catheter.
A test for superiority of the blood control device to the standard
device for clinical acceptability was performed and was not
significant.
3.2. Blood exposure
Clinicians reported blood leakage through a yes/no response to
the question, “During the process of catheter insertion, withdrawal of the needle and connection of the Luer, did you observe blood
leaking from the catheter hub?” Of the 152 total insertions, 62 instances of blood leakage were reported, 10 using the blood control
device (14.1%) and 52 using the standard device (68.4%) (Table 4).
The results demonstrated that the blood control device was superior to the standard device in preventing blood leakage (p < 0.0001).
In addition to reporting blood leakage, clinicians assessed overall
blood exposure risk of each insertion by providing a Likert-scale rated

response to the question, “During the process of catheter insertion, withdrawal of the needle and connection of the Luer, the PIVC
eliminated the risk of blood exposure.” For the blood control device,
60 of the 64 evaluable insertions (93.8%) were rated “somewhat
agree” or above, compared with 13 of 68 evaluable insertions (19.1%)
for the standard device (p < 0.0001) (Table 4). The results demonstrated that the blood control device was superior to the standard
device in eliminating the perceived risk of blood exposure during
the catheter insertion process (Fig. 1).
3.3. Need for digital compression
Digital compression was assessed by providing a Likert-scale rated
response to the question, “During the process of catheter insertion, withdrawal of the needle and connection of the Luer, the PIVC
eliminated the need for digital compression to prevent blood leakage
from the catheter hub”. For the blood control device, 61 of the 64
(95.3%) evaluable insertions were rated “somewhat agree” or above,
compared with 13 of the 68 (19.1%) evaluable insertions from the
standard device (p < 0.0001) (Table 4). The results demonstrated that
the blood control device was superior to the standard device in eliminating the clinician’s need to use digital compression during catheter
insertion (Fig. 1).
3.4. Insertion success
Insertion success was defined as the ability of the clinician to
successfully place the PIVC in the subject with ≤3 venepunctures
total (maximum of 2 attempts and 1 successful insertion). For the
blood control device, 70 of the 73 insertions (95.9%) were reported as successful, compared with 72 of the 79 insertions for the
standard device (93.7%) (Table 4). Of the successful insertions, the
blood control device had 2 instances where 2 venipunctures were
required for successful placement, whereas the standard device had
9 instances requiring 2 venepunctures and 1 requiring 3
venepunctures. The overall “first stick” success rate of the blood
control device was 90.4% compared with 81.0% for the standard
device or 1.06 and 1.15 venepunctures per successful insertion, respectfully. In examining the first stick success rates by device size,
the 18 g rate was 93.5% (43/46) and 90.2% (37/41) respectively for
the blood control and standard devices; whereas the 20 g was 85.2%
(23/27) and 75.8% (25/33). While the results successfully demonstrated that the insertion success rate of the blood control device
is non-inferior to that of the standard device (non-inferiority
margin = 15%; p = 0.0003), the blood control device did not demonstrate superiority (p = 0.7209).
3.5. Clinical usability and overall assessment
Clinical usability was a term encompassing a number of statements that assessed performance parameters of the PIVCs after each
insertion. Clinicians submitted Likert-scale rated responses to 7 clinical usability questions. Table 5 presents the summary statistics by
device for the percent of clinicians who agreed (strongly agree, agree,
somewhat agree) and disagreed (somewhat disagree, disagree,
strongly disagree) with the statements. Eleven of the 13 clinicians
also completed an overall assessment of the performance of both
devices. Overall, the clinical usability ratings were positive for both
devices. Clinicians stated that the blood control device would have
the same or better likelihood of insertion success as the standard
device, and all clinicians agreed that they would recommend use
of the blood control device over other catheters they have used. Both
devices were rated overall as clinically acceptable by all clinicians.
4. Discussion
This study demonstrates the ability of a new blood control catheter to decrease the observed blood leakage and risk of blood
exposure to both clinicians and patients, while maintaining the same
level of performance and clinical acceptability as the catheter type
currently being used as the hospital standard of care. Reducing the
amount of blood exposure observed during the insertion process
is beneficial for both the clinicians, in terms of potential bloodborne
pathogens, but also to the patients’ comfort or level of anxiety if
having to observe blood leakage. Although not evaluated in this study,
first stick success may also impact patient comfort or satisfaction,

as both pain and anxiety have been previously described being
associated with peripheral IV cannula insertion (Deguzman et al.,
2012; McNaughton et al., 2009; Winfield et al., 2013). Differences
in first stick success rates were primarily observed between the 20 g
devices, and the blood control 20 g device has the window for early
blood visualization.
Although the blood control device demonstrated superiority in
reducing the number of observed blood leakage events, more blood
leakage events were reported using both products than was initially anticipated. Requiring clinicians to switch from a winged
product to a catheter with a straight hub likely elevated the blood
leakage incidence due to a change in the technique for how the catheter hub is held during the insertion process. Despite changing back
and forth between two devices and switching to a product without
wings, the first stick success rate of 1.06 for the blood control device
was lower than the standard device and the US national average
of 2.2 sticks per successful insertion per patient (LaRue, 2000).
Some users also reported not using digital compression with the
standard device, a technique that is necessary to prevent blood
leakage in standard devices. However, despite using the compression in that group, blood leakage was still observed. Having a blood
control feature allows clinicians to modify their insertion technique, freeing up their second hand to focus on becoming more
efficient with completing the cannula insertion and securement.
In addition, it was noted that the Luer connection forces were
different between the two devices in order to pass through the valve
of the blood control catheter. Additional practice insertions requiring Luer connection, as well as consistently using the same device
for consecutive insertions rather than switching between two devices
for randomization, may lead to an even lower rate of blood exposure with the blood control device.
4.1. Limitations
There were some limitations to the study that could have affected the results. Because the clinicians were able to contribute to
the endpoint multiple times, overall ratings of each device could
have been skewed. The general estimating equation (GEE) analysis was performed to take into account the correlation among
observations from each clinician. In addition, the number of insertions performed by each clinician varied from nurse to nurse. This
lack of uniformity in the number of product uses could have introduced variability in the overall ratings; for example, it is possible
that those performing the greatest insertions could have become
more comfortable with the device, prompting more positive ratings.
Also, the study was designed to collect data from 30 clinicians performing 300 insertions but was completed and analyzed with 15
clinicians and 152 insertions due to clinician availability. Finally, the
fact that the study could not be designed as a double-blind investigation lent some inherent, albeit unavoidable, clinician bias to the
results.
5. Conclusion
The blood control PIVC achieved a clinically meaningful reduction in blood leakage and blood exposure events with similar overall
acceptability to standard PIVCs. This offers ED nurses an important reduction in the risk of occupational blood-borne illness
exposure.
Additional research comparing performance of multiple blood
control PIVCs in a clinical setting would help differentiate performance between the available products; however, the insertion
technique for each device is different and would be challenging to
evaluate in a randomized non-biased design.
Acknowledgements
The authors would like to thank all study participants and ED
nurses who participated in the study. The authors would like to specifically acknowledge Peggy Pereda and Wei Cao at Regulatory and
Clinical Research Institute, Inc. for their statistical planning, analysis, and expertise and Smiths Medical for funding the study.
Conflict of interest
This study was designed and funded by Smiths Medical, the manufacturer of both the blood control and standard PIVCs that were
evaluated. The data were collected by emergency nurses who did
not have any affiliation with the study Sponsor, and the statistical
analyses were also performed independently by Regulatory and Clinical Research Institute, Inc. The co-author, Laura Seiberlich, is an
employee of the study Sponsor; all other authors have no financial conflicts to report.
