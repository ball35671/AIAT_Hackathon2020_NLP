OBJECTIVE. Measuring the effect of the Needlestick Safety and Prevention Act (NSPA) is challenging. No agreement exists on a common
denominator for calculating injury rates. Does it make a difference? How are the law and safety-engineered devices related? What is the
effect on injuries and costs? This study examines those issues in assessing the impact of the legislation on hospital worker percutaneous
injuries.
METHODS. Using a historic prospective design, we analyzed injury data from 85 hospitals. Injury rates were calculated per 100 full-time
equivalents, 100 staffed beds, and 100 admissions each year from 1995 to 2005. We compared changes for each denominator. We measured
the proportion of the injury rate attributed to safety-engineered devices. Finally, we estimated a national change in injuries and associated
costs.
RESULTS. For all denominators, a precipitous drop in injury rates of greater than one-third (P-c.001) occurred in 2001, immediately
following the legislation. The decrease was sustained through 2005. Concomitant with the decrease in rates, the proportion of injuries from
safety-engineered devices nearly tripled (P<.001) across all denominators. We estimated annual reductions of more than 100,000 sharps
injuries at a cost savings of $69-$415 million.
CONCLUSIONS. While the data cannot demonstrate cause and effect, the evidence suggests a reduction in hospital worker injury rates
related to the NSPA, regardless of denominator. It also suggests an association between the increase in safety-engineered devices and the
reduction in overall injury rates. The decreases observed translate into significant reductions in injuries and associated costs.

 This study begins to assess whether
different denominators yield different conclusions regarding
the impact of the NSPA on percutaneous injury rates.
In identifying the influence of safety devices within the
overall impact of the NSPA, we considered that safety devices
preceded the legislation and were also a significant focus of
the legislation. The adoption of safety devices was low before
the NSPA, and injury rates changed little in the years prior
to the legislation. A key requirement of the NSPA was the
purchase and use of safety devices. Therefore, the adoption
of safety devices, while not a proxy for the impact of the law,
likely influenced the overall impact of the law. We assess the
relationship between these 2 factors, from the early days of
safety devices through the first years following the NSPA. This
will contribute to a more complete understanding of the
changes brought about by both the safety devices and the
legislation.
METHODS
Study Design
We employed a historical prospective design using the Exposure Prevention Information Network (EPINet), a multihospital sharps injury database maintained by the International Healthcare Worker Safety Center at the University of
Virginia. Since 1993, sharps injury incident reports or summaries were voluntarily contributed by a subset of US hospitals. Data from the years 1995 to 2005 were selected, reflecting 23,908 injuries from 85 hospitals in 10 states. The
University of Virginia Institutional Review Board approved
this study.
Variables
Incident report forms capture injuries from needles and other
sharp devices ("sharps injuries"). All data were stripped of
personal identifiers and merged into an aggregate database.
Any choice of denominators must be relevant to the outcome and must also be relatively common and available. We
compared changes in injury rates calculated using 3 different
hospital-based denominators that met these criteria: number
of staffed beds, number of admissions, and number of personnel (FTEs). These denominators reflect hospital size, patient turnover, and staff size, each of which might be related
to injury rates. FTEs include all personnel employed by the
institution, whether or not they have blood exposure risk.
Using "at-risk" employees would provide a more accurate
assessment of risk, but those data are not systematically available. Using all personnel underestimates the overall risk by
including those who have little or no risk of sharps injury.
Denominator values were obtained from the American Hospital Association's (AHA) Annual Survey Report for each
hospital for each year.15
 We also included in the analysis geographic region (Northeast, Midwest, South, West), type of
hospital (teaching, nonteaching), and population density
(metropolitan or nonmetropolitan) as potentially confounding variables.16,17
We determined safety-device-related injuries from "yes"
indications on the incident form ("If the item causing the
injury was a needle or sharp medical device, was it a 'safety
design' with a shielded, recessed, retractable or blunted needle
or blade?").
Analysis
Hospitals without AHA denominators (30) were removed
from the sample for calculation of rates. Of the remaining,
73% contributed data in both the pre- and postlegislation
period.
We calculated injury rates for each year using 3 different
denominators, and for each rate we calculated the proportion
from safety-engineered and conventional (nonsafety) devices.
Last, we applied our findings to national estimates of needlestick injuries and costs.
Primary analyses included hospitals contributing data during the prelegislation or postlegislation period and for which
the annual denominator was available. In subsequent analyses, we imputed denominators in missing years based on a
hospital's previous and subsequent reported values. For calculation of rates, we excluded data from hospitals that were
missing denominator values for all years. For calculation of
totals and proportion, we included all injuries. Poisson regression, using the chosen denominator as an offset, was used
to compare injury rates in the pre- and posdegislation periods. These methods were also used to compare pre- and
postlegislation rates adjusting for type of hospital (teaching,
nonteaching) and population density (metropolitan or nonmetropolitan).
RESULTS
All Injury Rates by Denominator
During the pre-NSPA period (1995-2000), a cumulative total
of 184 years of data was collected, representing 13,377 percutaneous injuries. For the post-NSPA period (2001-2005),
150 years of data were collected, with a total of 5,379 injuries.
Using FTEs as the denominator, we calculated a rate of
4.00 injuries per 100 FTEs for the pre-NSPA period. The postNSPA rate was 2.48 injuries per 100 FTEs, a rate ratio of 0.62
(P<.001; Figure 1A). We obtained similar results for the
other denominators: a rate ratio of 0.64 (P< .001) per 100
beds (Figure IB) and 0.57 (P < .001) per 100 admissions (Figure 1C). These results reflect 38%, 36%, and 43% reductions
from the pre- to post-NSPA periods.
Applying a Poisson regression model and adjusting injury
rates for type of hospital, region, and density, the estimated
decreases in rates from the pre- to post-NSPA years were
39%, 33%, and 39% for FTEs, beds, and admissions, respectively. When data were reanalyzed to replace missing denominators with values interpolated from previous and subsequent years, the results were nearly identical (reductions
within 1%) to those using only years with reported values.

Proportion of Injuries from Safety Devices
Figure 1 also shows the relative proportion of injuries from
conventional and safety-engineered devices. In each analysis,
the fraction of injuries attributable to safety devices increased
concomitantly with an overall reduction in injury rates. From
1995 to 2000, about 10% of injuries overall were attributable
to safety devices; in 2001, post-NSPA, this proportion increased to 20% and continued to climb over the next 4 years,
reaching 45% of overall injuries by 2005.
DISCUSSION
Hospital Selection
Our sample of hospitals was not statistically derived and may
not be representative of all hospitals. Although self-selected,
they are diverse in size, geographic location, and ownership.
In our preliminary analyses, the circumstances and mechanisms of sharps injuries in all hospital groups (eg, large/small,
teaching/nonteaching) were strikingly similar. Controlling for
these factors statistically did not alter the findings.
It is likely that our sample includes hospitals with higher
safety awareness. If so, then these hospitals probably adopted
more safety technology or practices than other hospitals before passage of the NSPA, making a reduction more difficult
to observe than nonparticipating hospitals. However, they
may also have more vigorously adopted the requirements after
passage of the NSPA, overestimating the impact compared to
other hospitals. Since there are no comparable national data
during the prelegislation years, we cannot address these potential biases.
Denominators: All Injuries
For all 3 denominators, percutaneous injury rates for hospital
healthcare workers decreased significantly in the year following enactment of the NSPA, a reduction that was sustained
over the 5 years following the legislation. Since denominators
were relatively stable compared to numerators, changes in
number of injuries influenced heavily the rate changes. More
than 80% of our hospitals had postlegislation sharps injury
rates that were lower than prelegislation rates, supporting the
conclusion that this was an overall trend.
Patterns of Injury Rates
The long-term trends in injury rates for all denominators
were similar: negligible change in injury rates prior to the
legislation, followed by a precipitous drop in rates in the year
combined rate per 100 beds for the years 1995-2000 is 22.09 (SE,
0.179). The rate for the years 2001-2005 is 14.03 (SE, 0.182), a rate
ratio of 0.64 (SE, 0.010; P< .001). C, Percutaneous injury rates per
100 admissions by year, 1995-2005. The combined rate per 100
admissions for the years 1995-2000 was 0.53 (SE, 0.005). The rate
for the years 2001-2005 was 0.30 (SE, 0.004), a rate ratio of 0.57
(SE, 0.009; P<.001).

following the legislation. After 2001, with small variations,
injury rates remained well below pre-NSPA rates regardless
of the denominator used (Figure 1). One might expect decreasing rates over the post-NSPA period due to advances in
safety technology and continued progress in using these devices. We did see an overall downward trend, but the pattern
was uneven. The pattern similarity across denominators suggests that they may be correlated and therefore produce comparable outcomes or that differences among these variables
may be masked by the powerful impact of the legislation.
The conclusion of each analysis, though, is slightly different,
explaining injury risk as a function of hospital size, patient
turnover, and staff size.
Injuries from Safety Devices
The pattern we observed for proportion of injuries attributable to safety devices was also similar across the 3 denominators, with a relatively stable (and low) proportion before
the legislation and an increasing proportion in the years after.
That pattern of safety device proportion of injuries parallels
the national market share of safety devices, which experienced
a sharp increase after passage of the NSPA.18
 An increase in
proportion of injuries attributable to safety devices may not
represent a contradiction; any time a sharp device is used,
the risk of injury exists. If all sharp devices were safety engineered, they would account for 100% of sharps injuries,
but we would expect the overall injury rate to be even lower
than the rates observed here.
We found lower injury rates for safety devices than for
nonsafety devices (data not shown); however, the denominators used here remained relatively stable for each hospital
across the study period. Because the sales and presumed use
of safety devices increased substantially in the post-NSPA
period and the sales of nonsafety devices decreased, a safety/
nonsafety-device-specific analysis might have demonstrated
an even greater difference between the rates. Relevant purchasing data were not available.
Other System Factors
Legislation often fails to produce the intended results, so it
is possible that passing the NSPA alone would not have resulted in the observed reductions. Other factors may have
contributed to the result. For example, a rise in safety consciousness and adoption of safer practices independent of the
legislation might have reduced injuries. In fact, all hospital
occupational injuries and illnesses decreased nationally over
the study period, but there was no significant drop in 2001
that paralleled the sharps injury observations.19
The number and types of safety devices grew substantially,
and earlier models were refined over the period examined.
This may have supported and encouraged the adoption of
safety devices in the absence of a national law. Without these
devices, the law may have had little effect. However, even
with many devices on the market, the significant increase in
market share of safety devices and the overall reduction in
injuries did not occur until after the legislation.718
 Again, this
suggests that the legislation had an independent effect on
injury rates.
OSHA's increased efforts to enforce the revised Standard
likely contributed to the observed decrease in injury rates.
The number of OSHA citations for violations of the Standard
more than doubled in the years following passage of the
NSPA. Similarly, the dollar amount of related penalties increased, from a total of $21,000 in 2001 to $108,200 in 2005.20
The threat of citations and monetary penalties may well have
accelerated hospital compliance, resulting in a reduction in
injuries. If OSHA continues to bring pressure to bear on
hospitals not in compliance, further reductions may be
expected.
Trends in adherence to standard precautions in hospitals
over the period studied could also affect the risk of injury.21
The role of safer work practices in risk reduction likely interacts with safety technology.
Costs Related to Decreases in Injuries
Administrators and policy makers want to translate changes
in injuries to changes in exposure-related costs. We did not
measure these directly, but our findings permit a crude estimate of these changes as well. These estimates are offered
with a caveat that the sample may not be representative of
all hospitals, but it was the basis for the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention's (CDC) national hospital needlestick
injury estimates.22
The most frequently cited national estimate of annual hospital needlestick injuries is 384,325, calculated using EPINet
and CDC-National Surveillance System for Healthcare Workers data from 1997-1998 (prelegislation).3
 Using the most
conservative (lowest) injury rate reduction among the 3 denominators examined, 36%, we estimate that 138,357 needlestick injuries were prevented in each year of the post-NSPA
period. Follow-up costs of reported percutaneous injuries,
according to the US General Accounting Office, range from
$500 to $3,000.23
 These costs do not include treatment costs
of infected healthcare workers, wages and time lost, emotional
distress, or loss of life. We did not factor in the higher cost
of safety-engineered devices, although these costs will likely
decline with the increase in production volume. Using these
costs estimates, we calculated a savings range of $69-$415
million related to injury follow-up costs for each year since
2001.
CONCLUSIONS
The findings suggest that the 3 denominators chosen worked
well in demonstrating changes in injury rates over the period
surrounding the NSPA. The patterns were quite similar, regardless of the denominator examined: marked reduction in
injury rates in the first year following the legislation, followed
by consistently lower rates in the years after, demonstrating

an association between the NSPA and the injury experience
of hospital workers. Extrapolating these decreases to the
country provides national estimates of reductions in number
of injuries and associated costs.
Even if hospitals adopted safety devices and practices at a
high rate, the challenge in nonhospital service delivery venues
remains. As more care is delivered outside hospitals—in offices, ambulatory centers, and nursing homes—healthcare
worker safety from contaminated sharps injury must be addressed. The law applies equally to these facilities, and compliance is required.
Healthcare practitioners, educators, administrators, researchers, device manufacturers, and policy makers all have
roles to play in addressing the remaining challenges in needlestick risk reduction. Protecting the health of the healthcare
workforce is critical to preserving the healthcare system.
