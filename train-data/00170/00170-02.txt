Abstract
Summary There has been considerable interest in using safeguarded needles to reduce needlestick injury. In a randomised design, we studied the efficacy and safety of two such needles (the Insyte AutoGuard and the Protective Acuvance), by comparing them with a conventional catheter needle (Insyte), for intravenous cannulation (18 G) in 150 patients and for intra‐arterial cannulation in another 150 patients (20 G). For intravenous cannulation, the success rates were similar in the three groups but insertion of the AutoGuard or Acuvance catheter was significantly more difficult than the conventional catheter. For the Acuvance, the back‐flow of blood into the chamber was sometimes too slow. For intra‐arterial cannulation, insertion of the AutoGuard was significantly more difficult than the other two devices, mainly because the backflow chamber of the AutoGuard was too short so that the chamber often filled with blood before cannulation. Insertion of the Acuvance was significantly more difficult than the conventional catheter. For both intravenous and intra‐arterial insertion, handling of the withdrawn needle was judged significantly safer in the AutoGuard group than the other two groups, whereas there was no significant difference in the safety between the Acuvance and conventional groups. In five subjects from the AutoGuard group, blood splashed on retraction of the needle. Blood contamination during needle withdrawal occurred frequently in the control and Acuvance groups, but rarely occurred in the AutoGuard group. Therefore, the AutoGuard needle is more suitable for intravenous cannulation, and the Acuvance is more suitable for intra‐arterial cannulation.

Needlestick injury can transmit infectious viruses, such as hepatitis or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [1-3]. The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, an agency of the US Department of Health and Human Services, has issued guidelines for the prevention of transmission of these viruses to health care personnel [4]. Recently, the US Federation made changes to the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 and issued the ‘Needlestick Safety and Prevention Act’, which came in effect in April 2001 [5]. One major change to this Act was that the use of safety‐engineered sharp devices is required. The safety devices are defined as ‘a non‐needle sharp or needle device used for withdrawing body fluids, accessing a vein or artery, or administering medications or other fluids, with a built‐in safety feature or mechanism that effectively reduces the risk of an exposure incident’[5].

There are several types of catheter needles with safeguard mechanisms. For some catheters, the safeguard mechanism cannot be activated unless the needle is removed, whereas for others, the safeguard mechanism can be activated before removal of the needle. Theoretically, the latter is safer, as at no time is the tip of the sharp needle tip exposed after venepuncture. The latter type includes the Insyte AutoGuard (Becton Dickinson Infusion Therapy Inc., Utah, USA) and Protective Acuvance (Johnson & Johnson Medical, Texas, USA).

The Insyte AutoGuard (Fig. 1) is a catheter whose needle can be retracted into the safety barrel before removal of the needle. In a previous study, we have shown that, compared with the conventional catheter, the AutoGuard provided safer handling of a withdrawn needle without reducing its ease of insertion into the vein [6]. Possible disadvantages of the AutoGuard needle are that its blood chamber is shorter than that of a conventional one and that it is not possible to attach a syringe to the chamber. Therefore, there may be some difficulties in intra‐arterial cannulation.

The Insyte AutoGuard cannula (Becton Dickinson Infusion Therapy, Inc., Utah, USA). Pressing the button after insertion of the cannula into a blood vessel retracts the needle into the safety barrel by a spring mechanism. It will not be retracted inadvertently unless the cannula is detached from the safety barrel.

The Protective Acuvance consists of two needles, one inside the other. The internal needle has a flat, or blunt end (Fig. 2). The inner blunt needle is initially inside the outer sharp needle. As the cannula is threaded off the sharp needle, the tip of the inner blunt needle will automatically extend slightly beyond the bevel of the outer needle, and when withdrawn, the tip of the needle is blunted. Since this catheter has a longer blood chamber than the AutoGuard and a syringe can be attached to the chamber, the Acuvance catheter may be more suitable for intra‐arterial cannulation. There have been no reports studying the efficacy of this catheter.

We compared the efficacies of the Insyte AutoGuard, Protective Acuvance and a conventional catheter for intravenous and intra‐arterial catheterisations.

Methods
In a randomised design, we compared the efficacies and safety of the three different catheters for intravenous insertion (part 1) and for intra‐arterial insertion (part 2). We studied 300 patients (150 patients for each part of the study), aged 18–85 years, who were scheduled for elective surgery, and in whom intravenous cannulation was indicated in part 1 and in whom intra‐arterial cannulation was indicated in part 2. Patients were not studied if they had blood‐borne infection or bleeding disorder, had any pathology of the wrist, were of American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status 4 or greater, or suffered from insulin dependant diabetes mellitus. Institutional research ethics committee approved the study and a written informed consent was obtained from patients.

During part 1 (intravenous cannulation), a tourniquet was applied to the patient's forearm in the operating theatre and the cephalic vein identified. If it was difficult to identify the vein or it was judged that an 18‐G catheter was too large to insert into the vein, the patient was withdrawn from the study. During part 2 (intra‐arterial cannulation), after induction of general anaesthesia and tracheal intubation, a wad of gauge was placed under the patient's wrist and the radial artery was located. If it was difficult to locate the artery, the patient was withdrawn from the study. Each researcher was allowed to use each device 10 times before the start of the formal study.

In each part of the study, patients were randomly allocated into three groups. Block randomisation (in blocks of 15) was used for the allocation and cards indicating allocations were placed in serially numbered, sealed opaque envelopes: in one group (control group) a conventional catheter (Insyte, Becton Dickinson Infusion Therapy Inc., Utah, USA) was used, in the second group (AutoGuard group) the Insyte AutoGuard was used, and in the third group (Acuvance group) Protective Acuvance was used. For intravenous cannulation, an 18‐G catheter was used in all the groups, whereas for intra‐arterial insertion, a 20‐G catheter was used in all the groups. Before insertion of a test catheter, a metal tray (20 × 25 cm), lined with absorbable paper, was placed on the floor as close as possible to the insertion site.

After insertion of a catheter into the cephalic vein in part 1 and the radial artery in part 2, the researcher and an assistant did the following: the segment of the blood vessel proximal to the insertion site was compressed. In the control and Acuvance groups, the needle was removed and in the AutoGuard group the researcher pressed the button of the device to retract the needle into the safety barrel during removal of the needle from the catheter (but, before complete removal), an infusion line attached to the catheter and a sticky drape applied to the insertion site. The researcher placed the used needle on the tray during these procedures.

In both parts of the study, when it was judged that the needle had not been inserted successfully into the blood vessel after removal of the needle, another attempt at insertion was allowed using a new device. If both attempts failed, the study was ended and an intravenous or intra‐arterial catheter was inserted at any site according to each anaesthetist's preference. The number of attempts at insertion of the cannula (1, 2 or failure) was recorded.

The ease of insertion of the needle through the skin into a blood vessel at the first attempt was assessed using a 10‐cm visual analogue scale (VAS) graded from ‘easy’ to ‘difficult’. Problems with backflow of blood during attempts at catheterisation (too slow a backflow or difficulty in catheterisation due to the chamber filling with blood before catheterisation) were recorded. Any problems that occurred during insertion (defined as the period from opening the package of the device to the removal of the needle), such as inadvertent withdrawal of the needle into the shaft, were recorded. The ease of handling of the needle, in terms of safety, during the period from the start of the removal of the needle to the end of the application of a drape over the insertion site, was assessed using another 10 cm VAS graded from ‘safe’ to ‘dangerous’.

Any needlestick injury and the presence or absence of blood contamination from either the inserted catheter or needle and the site of contamination (e.g. researcher, assistant, patient) were recorded. The needle was collected from the tray and disposed of in a sharps container. The presence or absence of blood on the tray was assessed by a researcher who was blinded to the allocation. If blood was visible, the number of bloodstains was counted. The number of bloodstains was counted as 10 if there were more than 10 stains.

Statistical analysis
The normal plot (plots of normal scores) and Shapiro‐Francia W′ test showed that the VAS for the ease of insertion of the test catheter and the ease of handing the needle were not normally distributed. Therefore, the Kruskal–Wallis test was used to compare the ease of insertion and the ease of handling of the needle between the three groups. If this showed significance, the Mann–Whitney U‐test was used for comparison between two groups. The Chi squared test was used to compare the incidence of blood contamination of the tray between the groups. If this showed significance, Fisher's exact test was used for comparison between the groups. A value of p < 0.05 was considered significant.

The 95% confidence interval (CI) for medians for the VAS in each group was calculated using the SINTERVAL commend (sign test) in Minitab release, which shows a confidence interval close to 95%. CIs for the median differences were also calculated for the difference in the VAS between two groups.

We considered that 50 patients would be required for each group to reduce the type II error (or beta error) to 10% (i.e. power of 90%), based on calculations from our previous study [6].

Results
Patients' characteristics were generally similar between the groups for both parts of the study (Table 1).

For intravenous cannulation, the success rates of catheterisation were similar in the three groups (Table 2). Insertion of an AutoGuard or Acuvance catheter was significantly more difficult than insertion of the conventional catheter, but there was no difference between the AutoGuard and Acuvance (Table 3). The main reasons for difficulty were that, for the Acuvance needle, backflow of blood was often too slow, whereas for the AutoGuard, the chamber sometimes filled with blood before catheterisation (Table 3).

For intra‐arterial cannulation, the success rate of the AutoGuard catheter was somewhat lower (86%) than that of the other two catheters (94% and 98%) (Table 2). Insertion of the AutoGuard was significantly more difficult than the other two devices; insertion of the Acuvance was significantly more difficult than the conventional catheter (Table 3). Insertion of the AutoGuard was often difficult because blood had filled the chamber before cannulation, whereas insertion of the Acuvance was sometimes difficult because backflow of blood was slow (Table 2).

For both intravenous and intra‐arterial insertion, handling of the withdrawn needle was judged significantly safer in the AutoGuard group than in the other two groups, whereas there was no significant difference in the safety between the Acuvance and conventional groups (Table 3). No problems, such as inadvertent withdrawal of the needle or failure to activate a safety mechanism, occurred in any patient.

Blood contamination occurred between removal of the needle and connection of an infusion line in more patients in the AutoGuard group compared with the other two groups (Table 4). In the AutoGuard group, in one of 50 patients receiving an intravenous catheter and in four of 50 patients receiving an intra‐arterial catheter, blood splashed on the palm or trunk of the researcher on retraction of the needle into the safety barrel. Close examination of these catheters showed that blood had penetrated the plug at the rear of the chamber (Fig. 3).

A sample of the AutoGuard needle from which blood splashed from the proximal end of the device. Note that blood has penetrated the plug from the backflow chamber (arrow).

There was no incident of needlestick injury. Blood contamination on the tray where a withdrawn needle was placed occurred frequently in the control and Acuvance groups, but it rarely occurred in the AutoGuard group. The incidence of blood contamination in the control or the Acuvance groups was significantly greater than that in the AutoGuard group (Table 4).

Discussion
Intravenous cannulation
For intravenous cannulation, insertion of the AutoGuard or Acuvance catheters was significantly more difficult than the conventional cannula (Table 3). Nevertheless, the success rates of intravenous cannulation were similar in the three products (Table 2).

The AutoGuard was judged safer for the handling of the used needle, with a lower incidence of blood contamination than the conventional needle (Tables 3 and 4). This result is consistent with our previous study [6]. In contrast, there were no significant differences between the Acuvance and conventional catheters in the safety of handing withdrawn needles and in the incidence of blood contamination (Tables 3 and 4).

For the Acuvance, the researchers felt that the back‐flow of blood into the chamber was sometimes too slow to detect promptly that the needle had been inserted into a vein (Table 2). No such a problems were observed with the conventional or AutoGuard catheters. Therefore, for intravenous cannulation, the Insyte AutoGuard needle has more advantages than the Acuvance.

Intra‐arterial cannulation
For intra‐arterial cannulation, insertion of the AutoGuard was the most difficult, followed by the Acuvance needle, with the conventional needle being the easiest to insert (Table 3).

With the AutoGuard catheter, the researchers felt that the backflow chamber was too short so that it often filled with blood before insertion of the cannula into an artery. In addition, it was not possible to attach a syringe to the backflow chamber. Therefore, it was often difficult to confirm constant backflow during intra‐arterial cannulation. In contrast, with the Acuvance needle, there was no such difficulty, as the backflow chamber was longer and a syringe could be attached to its chamber.

Blood splashed from the proximal end of the AutoGuard needle in 4 of 50 patients (8%) when intra‐arterial cannulation was attempted, and in 1 of 50 patients when it was used for intravenous cannulation. In our previous study, we did not experience such a splash in any of 50 patients during intravenous insertion [6]. Close examination of these catheters showed that blood had penetrated the plug at the rear of the chamber.

We sent these catheters to the manufacturer (Becton Dickinson Infusion Therapy Inc., Utah, USA) for analysis and received the following reply: ‘the Insyte™ AutoGuard™ product satisfies ISO standard that the plug will not leak for 15 s under a pressure of 16 inches of water, which is equivalent to 29 mmHg. It is not clear how long had passed before the clinician activated the retractor mechanism and the splash was driven by the spring energy, not flow itself. The plug has been redesigned to slow blood flow through the plug that will help to eliminate this incidence’. Although we did not record arterial blood pressure in this study, the pressure was always much higher than 29 mmHg. The incidence of splash was greater for intra‐arterial insertion in comparison with intravenous insertion, and thus the permeability of the plug, rather than the spring energy, would have been the major reason for these complications.

For intra‐arterial cannulation, the AutoGuard needle had more problems than the Acuvance or conventional needles, and these problems seemed to outweigh the advantages of the AutoGuard in its safety of handling of used needles and reduced blood contamination from the withdrawn needle. Therefore, for intra‐arterial cannulation, the Protective Acuvance has more advantages than the Insyte AutoGuard needle.

In conclusion, we believe that, although both the Insyte AutoGuard and the Protective Acuvance needles can be used in intravenous and intra‐arterial cannulation for intravenous cannulation, the AutoGuard needle is more suitable, whereas for intra‐arterial cannulation the Acuvance is more suitable. Nevertheless, both AutoGuard and Acuvance needles are associated with greater difficulty with cannulation than a conventional needle, and thus further improvements are required before needles with safeguard mechanisms can be used reliably and routinely.
