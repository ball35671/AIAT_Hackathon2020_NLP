Background Farmers are at increased risk of developing work-related respiratory diseases including asthma, but
little is known about their occupational health and safety (OHS) knowledge and exposure prevention
practices. Educational interventions may improve knowledge and practice related to prevention.
Aims To determine the feasibility of an educational intervention for farmers in a community health centre
setting.
Methods This was a pilot study. Farmers were recruited by the community health centre and completed a
questionnaire on symptoms, OHS knowledge and exposure prevention practices. The intervention
group received education on work-related asthma and exposure control strategies, and was offered
spirometry and respirator fit testing. All subjects were asked to repeat the questionnaire 6 months
later.
Results There were 68 study participants of whom 38 formed the intervention group. At baseline, almost
60% of farmers reported having received OHS training and were familiar with material safety data
sheets (MSDSs); fewer (approximately 40%) reported knowledge of OHS legislation and availability of MSDSs. Approximately, two-thirds of subjects reported using respiratory protection. The
response rate for repeating the questionnaire was 76% in the intervention group and 77% in the controls. Among the intervention subjects, statistically significant increases were observed in reported
safety training, familiarity and availability of MSDSs and knowledge of OHS legislation.
Conclusions Gaps in OHS knowledge were observed. The educational intervention on OHS knowledge and exposure prevention practices in the community health centre setting was feasible. Larger, more-controlled
studies should be undertaken as this study suggests a positive effect on OHS knowledge and prevention practices.
Key words Educational intervention; exposure prevention; farmers; occupational health and safety; work-related
asthma; work-related lung disease.
Introduction
Agricultural workers are at risk of developing work-related
respiratory disease, including asthma [1]. Since elimination of their exposures is not feasible, preventative practices
become important in reducing exposure to respiratory
hazards. Despite this, little is known about the use of prevention practices among farmers [2,3], possibly because
farmers work in small, often family-owned, workplaces that
are geographically disperse and challenging to reach. There
are limited studies of educational interventions directed at
respiratory hazards in the farming community [4–8].
Short Report
The West Elgin Community Health Centre (WECHC)
provides primary health care, health promotion and
community services to the municipality of West Elgin, in
Southwestern Ontario. This municipality has 216 farms
and a total of 300 farm operators [9]. A previous WECHC
survey found infrequent use of protective equipment and
a 10% prevalence of respiratory symptoms [10]. The
primary goal of this pilot study was to test the feasibility
of educating farmers on work-related asthma (WRA),
occupational health and safety (OHS) and the use of
exposure prevention practices through the WECHC.

Methods
The study was approved by the Research Ethics Board at
Queen’s University. Recruitment of local farmers by the
WECHC was multifaceted: advertisements were placed
in the local newspaper, participants from previous surveys were contacted and information was distributed to
meetings of local farm groups and the local Women’s
Institute.
At recruitment, all participants were asked to complete a questionnaire on respiratory and skin symptoms,
knowledge of OHS and exposure prevention practices.
Participants who were able to attend the educational
evening formed the intervention group; those unable to
attend formed the control group. This pilot study was
not randomized. Both groups repeated the questionnaire
6 months after the intervention.
The educational intervention was held one evening
at the WECHC, led by clinicians, safety consultants and
suppliers of safety equipment. The session consisted of
rotating stations with information on work-related asthma
and agricultural causes; spirometry testing; respirator
demonstrations and fit testing; exposure reduction strategies; and barriers to personal protective equipment use.
Results were analysed using SAS v9.2 (SAS Institute,
Cary, NC), using tests of independent samples for betweengroup comparisons and paired tests for within-group
comparisons; Student’s t-test for continuous variables and
Chi square or McNemar’s tests for categorical variables.
Results
A total of 68 farmers were recruited: 38 farmers attended
the educational intervention and 30 farmers formed the
control group. Seventy-seven per cent of the controls and
76% of the intervention group completed the follow-up
survey. At baseline, the average age was 50 years, with no
significant difference between the two groups (Table 1).
However, control subjects were more than twice as likely
to be female (77% versus 32%) and were engaged in different types of farming; intervention subjects were twice
as likely to be livestock farmers (60% versus 27%) and
much less likely to be swine or poultry farmers (10%
versus 30%). Almost all the participants lived on family
farms and spent a similar amount of time farming each
week. Those who attended the intervention had significantly greater reporting of at least one symptom (69%
versus 31%), as well as nasal and/or ocular symptoms
(39% versus 17%).
The reporting of OHS knowledge and prevention
practices at baseline are presented in Table 2. On followup, there were many negative changes and few improvements in the control subjects; there were modest and
significant increases in knowledge of their workers’ compensation status and having been fit tested for an N95
respirator.
Conversely, the OHS knowledge in the intervention
group tended to increase. Significant positive increases
were observed in reporting completion of safety training,
familiarity with material safety data sheets (MSDSs),
availability of MSDSs and knowledge of OHS legislation. Among prevention activities, there were significant
increases in reporting use of N95 masks and wet sweeping of spills.
Discussion
The successful execution of the evening session,
combined with the high follow-up rate, indicates that the
intervention was feasible. Use of the community health
centre to provide education may be particularly helpful
in the agricultural sector where there are many small
family farms geographically dispersed.
Approximately 70% of farmers reported using a mask
when they felt it necessary. However, there was very little

reported use of a powered air purifying respirator or a fitted N95, and none used a mask while brushing animals
(Table 2). Other studies have also found low reporting of
respiratory protection [4,7].
There was significant positive improvement observed
in OHS knowledge and some exposure prevention practices among the intervention group; these changes were
not observed in the control group. These findings suggest
that the educational intervention may have had a positive effect on OHS knowledge and prevention practices.
Previous studies with varying target age group, location,
content and sponsoring organizations have documented
improvements in knowledge and behaviours with educational interventions [5–8]. Importantly, many intervention group subjects acknowledged the session as a form
of safety training.
The design of this pilot study did not include randomization, which may have resulted in selection bias
and the differences between the control and intervention groups at baseline. Self-selection may have
resulted in a motivated intervention group, indicated
by their greater symptoms, potentially accounting for
their uptake of prevention practices and OHS knowledge. As well, the self-reporting of knowledge and
prevention practices may be subject to recall bias.
Contamination between control and intervention subjects is possible, but the negative trends in the control
group suggest that the effect was minimal. However,
positive changes in the control group may be explained
by sharing of information between family members.
Ideally, future studies should be designed with community clusters, randomized group allocation, more
detailed participant information and larger sample
sizes to permit more thorough analysis.
The educational intervention on WRA, OHS and
the use of exposure prevention practices in the community health centre setting was feasible. Future studies of the effectiveness of the educational intervention
should be undertaken, as the results from this pilot
study suggest the educational evening had a positive
effect on participants’ OHS knowledge and prevention
practices.
