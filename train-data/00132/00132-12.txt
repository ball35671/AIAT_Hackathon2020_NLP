Abstract
This paper describes the implementation and evaluation of the Coke Oven Intervention Program developed jointly by the United Steel Workers of America and the University of Pittsburgh. The program was offered on four occasions at each of seven coke oven plants over a 2-year period. Participants were compared with nonparticipating co-workers and controls from matched plants on knowledge of the Coke Oven Standard and workplace behaviors. Few baseline differences were found among participants, nonparticipants, and controls. Participants improved significantly as a result of the program, with those attending multiple programs accruing the greatest benefits. Panel controls interviewed on six occasions throughout the 2-year period showed little improvement. Reasons for and implications of the effectiveness of the program are discussed.
