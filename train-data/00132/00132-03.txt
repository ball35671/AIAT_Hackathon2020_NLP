ABSTRACT: Allergic occupational asthma is frequent in farming populations. As educational
interventions can improve disease management, the short-term effect of an educational
intervention in asthmatic farmers was evaluated on the basis of spirometric indices and
exhaled nitric oxide fraction (FeNO).
Farmers with occupational asthma (n581), mostly sensitised against cow dander and storage
mites, participated in a 1-day educational programme. Outcome measures were assessed at
baseline and after 4–6 weeks, using FeNO, lung function and a questionnaire. Results were
compared with those of a control group without intervention (n524).
In the educational group, the proportion of subjects reporting work-related symptoms was
reduced after the intervention. The FeNO decreased from a geometric mean of 28.2 to 25.7 ppb,
and, in subjects with an elevated (.35 ppb) baseline FeNO (n532), from 59.7 to 49.2 ppb. The
corresponding changes in the control group were 25.6 versus 27.7 ppb and 49.5 versus 48.1 ppb.
Spirometric results were unaltered in the two groups.
Thus exhaled nitric oxide fraction, a marker of allergic airway inflammation, indicated a
beneficial effect of a short-term educational intervention in farmers with occupational asthma.
This suggests a potential for exhaled nitric oxide fraction in assessing the efficacy of preventive
measures within a short time with higher sensitivity than spirometry.

Agriculture is associated with a high risk of
development of occupational asthma [1].
The best treatment would be complete
avoidance of exposure [2], which, would often
imply a change of occupation. For a variety of
reasons, including economic factors, this
approach is rarely feasible. As a consequence,
education about technical, organisational and
personal preventive measures is an important
part of disease management, particularly since
educational interventions are generally known to
be effective in asthma treatment [3, 4]. However,
the available data in farmers seem to be limited to
questionnaires as outcome measures [5–7] and do
not include biomarkers of the disease.
An important biomarker of asthma is exhaled
nitric oxide fraction (FeNO), which is known to be
sensitive to allergen burden [8, 9] as well as antiinflammatory therapy [10, 11]. Changes in FeNO,
after either allergen exposure or corticosteroid
treatment, occur rapidly and are detectable after
a short time. It was thus hypothesised that FeNO
might be suitable for the detection of a reduction
in airway inflammation within a few weeks after
an educational intervention in farmers with
occupational asthma, in parallel to a change in
respiratory symptoms.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Farmers with occupational asthma (n5120),
mainly sensitised against cow dander and storage mites, took part in a 1-day educational
programme organised by two German statutory
accident insurance institutions for the agricultural sector at six locations in Bavaria (Germany).
A total of 81 subjects (49 males (mean¡SD age
49.8¡9.1 yrs) and 32 females (45.9¡8.6 yrs))
were included in the present study, as they were
regularly working in a stable and were able to
return to the same location for a second visit 4–6
weeks after the intervention. The control group
comprised farmers with occupational asthma not
participating in the educational programme (19
males (44.5¡10.9 yrs) and five females
(41.2¡7.7 yrs)). They were visited at their farms

for baseline measurement and again 4–6 weeks later. All
participants gave their written informed consent and the study
was approved by the ethics committee of Ludwig Maximilians
University (Munich, Germany).
The education, of 4–5 h duration, included two presentations
by one of the authors of the present article (J. Su¨ltz), who is a
pulmonologist and occupational physician. The first presentation provided general information about the pathogenesis of
asthma and allergies, environmental influences, medication
and prevention. The second presentation gave details about
major occupational allergens causing asthma, particularly cow
dander and mites, with special focus on prevention in the
workplace based on original data [12]. All major issues were
illustrated by examples drawn from the patients’ cases. A
representative of the insurance institution added further
information about technical and organisational means of
allergen avoidance and demonstrated the use of personal
protective equipment.
Assessments were performed in a separate room. First, FeNO
was determined using a handheld device (Niox MinoTM;
Aerocrine, Solna, Sweden). Afterwards, forced expiratory
volume in one second and forced vital capacity were measured
(SpiroProTM; Jaeger, Wu¨rzburg, Germany) following established guidelines [13] in up to eight consecutive attempts. A
short interview-based questionnaire asked about the kind of
animals farmed (dairy animals or swine), current symptoms at
work (at least one of shortness of breath, cough with/without
phlegm, wheeze and nasal irritation (yes/no)), current smoking
(yes/no), medication (inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting
b2-agonists (yes/no)), daily working hours in the stable, use of
protective personal equipment (yes/no) and usual practices in
the stable.
Data are presented as proportions or means (geometric where
appropriate) and corresponding SEM or SD. FeNO data were
logarithmically transformed for analysis. Fisher’s exact test
and an unpaired t-test were used to compare groups at
baseline, and McNemar’s test and a paired t-test to compare
values assessed before and after intervention. Significance was
assumed at p,0.05.
RESULTS
In the intervention group (n581), 56 (69%) participants were
exclusively dairy farmers, 10 (12%) kept swine exclusively and
15 (19%) were exposed to both dairy animals and swine or
other animals. In the control group (n524), 20 (83%) subjects
were dairy farmers and four (17%) kept both dairy animals and
swine or other animals. Compared to the control group, the
educational group was older (p50.040) and more often
exhibited at least one current respiratory symptom at work
(p50.007). Baseline FeNO did not differ significantly between
the groups (table 1).
The intervention group showed a decrease in the proportion of
subjects reporting at least one current respiratory symptom at
work (p50.012; table 1), whereas the percentage of subjects
wearing headgear in the stable rose (p50.001). The geometric
mean FeNO decreased from 28.2 to 25.7 ppb (p50.042). When

evaluating only subjects showing a baseline FeNO of .35 ppb
(n532), FeNO decreased from 59.7 to 49.2 ppb (p50.003; fig. 1).
Spirometric indices did not change significantly after the
intervention. In the control group, none of the outcome
measures showed a significant change over time.
DISCUSSION
The present study demonstrated a significant decrease in FeNO
and concomitant reduction in work-related respiratory symptoms 4–6 weeks after a 1-day educational intervention in
animal farmers with occupational asthma. This improvement
was not detectable by spirometry alone.
To date, only a few studies have evaluated the effects of
specific education in farmers [5–7]. Based upon questionnaires,
these studies revealed changes in knowledge, attitude and
behaviour after the intervention. Outside occupational medicine, clinical and lung function measures, including peak flow
measurements and the frequency of emergency department
visits, have also been utilised in order to evaluate educational
interventions [3, 4]. Among the functional measures, FeNO
appears to be particularly attractive since it reflects both the
effect of allergen burden or avoidance [8, 9] and antiinflammatory effects, e.g. of corticosteroids [10, 11]. The
assessment of airway hyperresponsiveness might also provide
valuable information [14] but was not performed in the present
study as the measurement was not feasible in the educational
fieldwork setting.
Indeed, FeNO measurements have been used in large-scale
epidemiological studies [15–17] and are also attracting interest
in occupational medicine [18]. Currently, only a few studies
have used a portable device in epidemiological fieldwork [19,
20]. No problems were encountered during measurements and
the device has been demonstrated to be in acceptable agreement
with a stationary nitric oxide analyser [21, 22]. It should be noted
that all subjects were capable of performing the FeNO manoeuvre adequately, whereas the same was not true for
spirometry performed according to American Thoracic Society
guidelines, despite multiple attempts. At the same time, FeNO
measurement was more sensitive than spirometry. It may thus
be more suitable for monitoring short-term effects related to
airway inflammation, which, conversely, might have an impact
upon the long-term course of the disease, as reflected in
spirometry or visits to physicians. This suggests a potential role
for FeNO measurement in occupational fieldwork.
In order to assess whether or not the present results were a
result of the specific intervention, subjects not participating in
the educational programme were included as a control group.
This group did not show any changes during follow-up,
particularly no decrease in FeNO, although the respective
sample size was sufficient to detect a relative reduction of the
same magnitude as that in the intervention group (baseline
.35 ppb) with a power of .95% at a significance level of 5%.
The intervention group showed more respiratory symptoms
than control farmers, indicating that subjects with more severe
disease were more inclined to participate in the programme.
This difference in disease severity was also indicated by lower
proportion of subjects taking protective measures in the control
group and by medication use. The control group served mainly
to assess repeatability of assessments, since it was obvious that
selection was unavoidable and no randomised design could be
realised in the circumstances given.
Importantly, FeNO at baseline was slightly but not significantly
elevated in the intervention group, whereas, after intervention,
values were essentially the same in both groups. A variety of
factors, including exposure, practices and medication, might
have been altered by the education, but no significant changes
could be traced to explain the reduction in FeNO and
symptoms. This remained true in the subjects who showed a
reduction in FeNO of .10 or .20% after intervention (n541
and 29, respectively); there were no specific characteristics that
differed significantly from those of the others, probably due to
various changes in several influencing factors. Exposure to
swine confinement has been shown to cause an increase in
FeNO in healthy nonatopic subjects [23]. Correspondingly, in
the present farmers with atopic asthma, the reduction in FeNO
might have been partially due to a reduction in exposure level.
There were no changes in the proportions of patients taking
corticosteroids or long-acting b2-adrenoceptor agonists. It was
not possible to collect reliable data on medication intake by
objective means, such as inhalation counters. While talking
with the farmers, however, it became apparent that a
considerable number took their medication irregularly. The
intervention might have favoured more regular steroid use,
contributing to the decrease in FeNO. Irrespective of the
differences between the groups and the unresolved issues
regarding causative factors, it appears to be safe to derive as a
message of the present study that FeNO measurement was
capable of demonstrating an effect of specific education within
a short time using easy-to-perform measurements. The type of
evaluation performed in farmers might also be suitable in other
occupations involving work-related asthma.
In conclusion, the exhaled nitric oxide fraction showed a
significant short-term reduction after an educational intervention in animal farmers with workplace-related allergic asthma,
indicating a success of the education. Thus exhaled nitric oxide
fraction has potential in the fast evaluation and, possibly,
optimisation of nonpharmacological interventions in patients
with occupational asthma.
