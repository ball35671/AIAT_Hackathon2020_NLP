A tenet of behavioral education is that interactive training produces superior retention compared with reading. However, this has not often been directly tested and never with practical occupational information in working adults. Adults from diverse occupational backgrounds learned the principles of proper respiratory protection presented (a) in a book, (b) on a computer monitor, (c) through interactive computerized training consisting of textual information and illustrative pictures followed by quizzes and feedback, or (d) passively viewing the information and quizzes in Condition c on a computer monitor. Interactive training produced significantly more correct test answers at immediate posttraining, 1 week, and 2 months. This study demonstrated the superiority of interactive training for teaching occupational safety and health information in working adults. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)
