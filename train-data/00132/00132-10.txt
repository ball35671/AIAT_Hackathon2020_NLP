 Owing to their scientifi c and technological importance, tailored synthesis of inorganic crystals with exposed high active
facets has intensively been studied. [1]
 In principle, the percentage of the specially exposed facet and the surface area of
the nanocrystals could be maximized by reducing the thickness along the particular crystallographic axis and increasing
the 2D lateral size of the planes. In this regard, Lu et al. have
fi rst prepared the anatase TiO 2 single-crystals with 47% of
highly active (001) facets by using hydrofl uoric acid (HF) as
a capping agent to prevent their growth along the [001] direction. [2]
 More recently, Lou et al. have also demonstrated that
ultrathin anatase TiO 2 nanosheets ( ∼ 3 nm in thickness and a
few hundred nanometer in lateral size) with nearly 100% of
exposed (001) facets can be obtained by using diethylenetriamine (DETA) to prohibit the growth of titania along the
[001] direction. [3]
 However, although ultrathin nanocrystals with a large percentage of exposed facets are easy to image, their synthesis
is still extremely diffi cult. This is because the van der Walls
force inherently exists between the adjacent ultrathin active
nanosheets, which can drive them to form stacked lamellar or
spherical structures. [4]
 One way to obtain the stable ultrathin
nanosheets with high-energy facets is to grow them into a
3D self-organized porous architecture. In addition to prevent their ultrathin active nanosheets building blocks from
aggregation while maintaining the maximum exposed facets,
such unique porous architecture is also highly attractive for
two reasons: (i) it provides interconnected open pores that

can ensure a rapid diffusion of reactants and products during
catalytic reactions; (ii) it is expected to have large surface
area, which can provide more active sites for the adsorption
of reactant molecules, making the catalytic process more
effi cient.
 In addition, it is generally accepted that the metastable
(001) surface of semiconductors (e.g. TiO 2 ) is more reactive
than the thermodynamically stable (101). [2−6]
 However, the
(111) surface is composed of alternating monolayers of anions
and cations, thus, a strong electrostatic fi eld perpendicular to
the (111) surface is created. [7]
 Such unique surface is likely
to serve as an active site with high selectivity. [8]
 Restricted
by synthesis methods, [8c]
 pure substrate-free semiconductors
with high percentage of the (111) surface has rarely been
reported.
 As a p-type semiconductor with metal vacancies in the
lattice, Cu 2 S has a bulk band gap of 1.2 eV, [9]
 which can be
considered as an ideal sunlight absorbing material for solar
cells, [10]
 cold cathode emitter, [11]
 and nanoscale switches. [12]
Cu 2 S particles with different morphologies such as
platelike, [13a]
 rodlike, [13b]
 tubelike [13c]
 and hollow spheres [13c]
have been synthesized. However, to the best of our knowledge, 3D hierarchical Cu 2 S microstructure consisting of
ultrathin nanosheets with a high percentage of exposed facets
has not been reported yet.
 Herein, we fi rst report a facile hydrothermal route for the
synthesis of unique 3D-open porous hierarchical Cu 2 S microsponges (HCMs) by using cetyltrimethylammonium bromide
(CTAB) as a morphology controlling agent. The obtained Cu 2 S
microsponges are constructed from 2D ultrathin ( ∼ 1.5 nm)
single-crystal nanosheets with nearly 99% exposed (111)
facets. The microsponges exhibit high photocatalytic activity
for phenol degradation under visible light irradiation, which
is 97 times higher than that for Degussa P25. Interestingly,
it is found that the formation of Cu 2 S microsponges under
this one-pot hydrothermal reaction follows a unique anisotropic branched-growth process, which 2D-sheet-like Cu 2 S
nanocrystals can gradually develop into 3D-open porous
sponge-like microstructures through their anisotropic growth
of branched nanosheets on the polar (111) surfaces.
 The obtained porous Cu 2 S microsponges after washing
away the surfactants can be well dispersed in ethanol upon
sonication (Figure 1 a, inset), resulting in a dark gray colloidal suspension which refl ects a good light absorption.

image reveals that the obtained product consists of 3D-open
porous uniform particles with sponge-like architecture and
a diameter of 400–600 nm (Figure 1 a). The high-magnifi cation FESEM image (Figure 1 b) shows that these spongelike architectures are constructed by plenty of 2D-ultrathin
nanosheets. These nanosheets adopt a fashion of intergrowth
to support each other and interweave together into a highly
porous particle, preventing the complete aggregation of Cu 2 S
nanosheets. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images
(Figure 1 c and Figure S1 in supporting information) reveal a
typical porous particle (ca. 500 nm in diameter) constructed
with nanosheets as building blocks. The dark stripes and the

intergrown nanosheets, respectively. These results are well
consistent with the FESEM observations. The energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis (Figure 1 d) clearly manifests that
the HCMs are composed of Cu and S with molar ratio of 2.1: 1,
close to that of the standard stoichiometric composition of
Cu 2 S phase. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern (Figure 1 e)
indicates that the HCMs have a digenite phase (JCPDS card
No. 02-1284; space group Fm 3¯ m; a = 0.561 Å). Four intense
diffraction peaks at 2 θ = 27.9, 46.3, 55.3 and 85.9 ° can be
attributed to the 111, 200, 220, 422 refl ections, respectively,
indicating a face-centered cubic ( fcc ) digenite phase with well
crystallinity. No other peaks were observed, suggesting the
pure phase nature of Cu 2 S microsponges. The selected area
electron diffraction (SAED, Figure 1 f) further confi rms the
crystalline characteristic of the Cu 2 S nanosheets.
 To further analyze the chemical composition of the
HCMs sample, inductively coupled plasma atomic emission
spectroscopy (ICP-AES) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis were carried out. The ICP-AES result
reveals a Cu:S of 2.13:1, which is consistent with the EDX
analysis. The XPS spectrum of Cu in the 2p region for HCMs
(Figure S2) shows the binding energies of Cu 2p 3/2 and Cu
2p 1/2 peaks at 931.8 and 952.8 eV, respectively, which are typical values for Cu 1 + in Cu 2 S. [14]
 In order to further reveal the intrinsic structure information, a small portion of the sample is crashed for TEM observation. Interestingly, it was found that the deposition of the
crashed Cu 2 S microsponges on the TEM grid were from the
assembly of the Cu 2 S nanosheets into an extended lamellar
structure (Figure 2 and Figure S3). High-magnifi cation TEM

images (Figure 2 b and Figure S3a-b) reveal that the stacking
was composed of alternating layers. Based on the analysis of
more than 60 Cu 2 S nanosheets from 10 different stacks, the
average thickness of the as-prepared nanosheets is measured to be 1.5 nm-less than three unit cells thick (the lattice
constant of the unit cell of the digenite Cu 2 S is about 5.561
Å, Figure S4). The HRTEM image (Figure 2 c) taken on the
fl at-surface of the Cu 2 S nanosheets shows two clear crystal
lattices with same interplanar spacing of 1.96 Å, which corresponds to the (220) and (202) planes of fcc digenite Cu 2 S
with an interfacial angle of 60 ° The corresponding Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) pattern of an individual Cu 2 S nanosheet
oriented parallel to the TEM grid (inset in Figure 2 c) can be
indexed to diffractions of the [111] zone, confi rming that the
Cu 2 S nanosheets have (111) as basal planes. The HRTEM
image (Figure 2 d and Figure S3d) taken on the side-face of
Cu 2 S nanosheets reveals crystal planes with a d-spacing of
0.32 nm, corresponding to the (111) plane of digenite Cu 2 S,
which further confi rms that the dominant exposed facets of
the Cu 2 S nanosheets can be identifi ed as (111) plane on both
the top and bottom. Assuming that each Cu 2 S nanosheet is
tetragonal in shape, a sheet with the thickness of ∼ 1.5 nm
and size of 400 − 600 nm implies that 99% of the exposed
surfaces are (111) facets.
 The morphology evolution examined at various growth
stages of the hydrothermal process shows that a quasihexagonal sheet-like Cu 2 S structure (ca. 400–600 nm in diameter, marked by blue arrow) is fi rstly formed after the hydrothermal treatment at 120 ° C for 5 h (Figure S5a and S9a).
The corresponding HRTEM image and SAED patterns (Figure S6b and inset in Figure S6a) confi rm the
quasi-hexagonal Cu 2 S nanosheets grow along [220] orientation while maintaining the (111) as the top facets. As the
reaction prolongs to 12 h, a large number of small branchednanosheets growing on the surface of Cu 2 S based sheets
are observed (Figure S5b). These branched-nanosheets can
further grow out to form the scaffold and serve as a ‘glue’
to bind the neighboring nanosheets (Figure S5c,S6c). The
HRTEM image taken from the conjoined place of two neighboring nanosheets (Figure S6d) shows that the two planes are
of the same lattices fringes (0.32 nm), meaning that they grow
from the same axis and along the [220] direction. XRD patterns of products (Figure S5d) obtained at different time of
hydrothermal reaction show that the 220 diffraction is much
higher than the 111, 200, 311 and 422, further confi rming that
Cu 2 S nanosheets should preferentially grow along [220] orientation. It should be mentioned that a large scale regular
mesoporous Cu 2 S microspheres (MCMs, ∼ 2.5 μ m in diameter) consisting of nanoparticles ( ∼ 5 nm) can be obtained
in the absence of CTAB (Figure S7,S8). This result confi rms
that the CTAB plays an important role in the anisotropic
growth of the ultrathin Cu 2 S nanosheets. The XRD pattern
(Figure S8e) of the resulting Cu 2 S microspheres maches the
highly crystalline chalcocite phase of Cu 2 S (JCPDS card No.
02–1286).
 On the basis of these evolutions of the morphology,
an anisotropic branched-growth mechanism is proposed
(Figure 3 ). Herein, the glutathione (GSH) is used not only

as a sulfur source, but also as a reducing agent to reduce
Cu (II) to Cu (I). At the early stage (Step 1, Figure 3 ), bromine ion (Br − ) in CTAB can bind to the (111) polar plane
of the positively charged Cu + more strongly than other nonpolar surfaces due to the coulombic force. The presence of
Br − adsorption on the (111) surface of the freshly prepared
sheet-like structure (obtained at the 120 ° C for 5 h) is confi rmed by the scanning TEM (STEM) and EDX elemental
mapping. The EDX elemental mapping image of Cu 2 S
nanosheets oriented parallel to the TEM grid clearly demonstrates the existence of Br − on the (111) surface of the Cu 2 S
nanosheet (Figure S9b). Such strong adsorption prevents
the Cu 2 S nanocrystals to grow along the [111] direction and
is responsible for directing the formation of the sheet like
structure. Similar as the growth process of ultrathin zeolite
nanosheets demonstrated recently, [15]
 one way to obtain thermally stable ultrathin nanosheets is to grow them into a 3D
architecture. To minimize the surface free energy of the crystals, these ultrathin Cu 2 S nanosheets can further grow along
nonpolar [220] direction from the polar (111) surfaces, while
still maintaining the maximized exposure of (111) surfaces
with CTAB as a protective capping agent (Step 2, Figure 3 c).
The branched-nanosheets further grow to support each other,
preventing collapse of the ultrathin Cu 2 S nanosheets, and
fi nally, a porous sponge-like structure is formed via the anisotropic growth (Step 3, Figure 3 ).
 N 2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of the HCMs shows
a type-IV curves with H3-type hysteresis loop (Figure S10).
The adsorption at the high relative pressure around P/P 0 =
0.97 is indicative of large pores, which are derived from the
interstitials among the closely packed particles. The poresize distribution (Figure S10a, inset) shows a wide distribution from 10 to 110 nm, further confi rming the existence of
mesopores and macropores in the hierarchical pore structure. The BET surface area and pore volume of the HCMs
are calculated to be 82.4 m 2
 /g, and 0.56 cm 3
 /g respectively,
which are lower than that of mesoporous Cu 2 S microspheres
(MCMs, 184.8 m 2
 /g, 1.51 cm 3
 /g, Figure S10b). The UV-VisNIR diffuse refl ection spectra (Figure 4 a) reveal that HCMs
have signifi cantly enhanced light absorption over the entire
wavelength range (from ultra-violet to near-infrared) compared to MCMs and Degussa P25 (used as a reference). As
schematically illustrated in the inset of Figure 4 a, we believe
that the intermeshed ultrathin Cu 2 S nanofl akes in HCMs
allows multiple refl ections of incident light, which may lead
to the enhanced light-harvesting ability of HCMs. [16]
 Herein,
we measured the band gap of HCMs, MCMs and P25 to be
1.3, 1.6 and 3.1 eV, respectively (Figure 4 b). Compared to
the band gap (1.2 eV) of bulk Cu 2 S, [9]
 the HCMs (or MCMs)
show blue shift of 0.1 eV (0.3 eV for MCMs), indicating a
quantum size effect. [17]
 It is well known that the bandgap of
the nanocrystals is generally infl uenced by the particle size
and the defect in the structure, and the decrease of the particle size can cause a blue shift of the absorption edge. Since
the MCMs are composed by ultra-small Cu 2 S nanoparticles ( ∼ 5 nm, Figure S7, S8), which is much smaller than the
2D-ultrathin nanosheets in HCMs (400–600 nm in diameter,
Figure S5a and Figure S9a), resulting in the wider bandgap
for MCMs. Moreover, the 3D-open porous HCMs show an
increased absorption in the near-IR region, characteristic

of digenite due to inter band transitions (absorptions) from
valence states to the unoccupied states. [18]
 The photocatalylytic activity of the samples was tested
by photodegradation of phenol under visible light irradiation. The absorption peak at λ = 269 nm is found to drop
rapidly with extension of the exposure time and completely
disappears after about 150 min (Figure 4 c). No new absorption band appears in either the visible or ultraviolet region,
which indicates the complete photodegradation of phenol.
However, when the reaction is conducted without catalyst
or under dark, no reaction is observed even after 180 min
(Figure S11), indicating that it is a photocatalytic reaction. As
shown in Figure 4 c (inset), the HCMs exhibit a little higher
activity (100% within 150 min) than MCMs (80% within
150 min), while the commercial P25 shows almost no photocatalytic activity in the visible light region (less than 5%
within 150 min). The linear relationships of ln (C 0 /C) versus
time reveal that the photodegradation reaction follows a
pseudo-fi rst-order reaction. The apparent fi rst-order reaction
rate constants for the samples HCMs is 0.0194, indicating that
the photodegradation rate is 1.9 and 97 times higher than that
from MCMs (0.0102 min − 1 ) and Degussa P25 (0.0002 min − 1 ),
respectively (Table S1). Additionally, in ordered to further
prove the (111) facet-dependent photocatalytic property
of HCMs, the photocatalytic performance of irregular Cu 2 S
microsponges [ICMs, Figure S12a] with poor (111) facet-preferential orientation was also investigated. Table S1 clearly
shows the photodegradation rate of HCMs (0.0194 min − 1 )
is about 5 times higher than that from ICMs (0.0039 min − 1 ).
Further more, the BET surface area (82.4 m 2 /g for HCMs,
78.6 m 2 /g for ICMs), the crystallinity (Figure S12b) and the
light absorption (Figure S12c) difference between HCM and
ICMs can be eliminated under this condition. Therefore, the
difference of the photodegradation ability can be mainly
attributed to the exposed (111) facet of the HCMs.
 The hydroxyl radicals (•OH) are usually main oxidizing
species in the photodegradation process. In this study, we further studied the photocatalysis by using photoluminescence
(PL) technique to detect •OH radical. [19]
 The PL intensity at
about 445 nm increases gradually with increasing irradiation
time (Figure 4 d), indicating that a large amount of the •OH
radicals are produced on the surface of exposed active (111)
facets for HCMs. These photocatalytic results clearly demonstrate that the exposing (111) facets of HCMs are responsible
for its ex-cellent photocatalytic activity.
 In conclusion, we have demonstrated a facile hydrothermal
route to fabricate 3D-open porous HCMs constructed from
the ultrathin crystallized Cu 2 S nanosheets ( ∼ 1.5 nm) with
99% exposed (111) facets. Detailed mechanistic studies and
microscopic analyses suggest that the simple features such the
Cu 2 S sheet-like structure can in turn form 3D-open porous
sponge-like microstructures with further anisotropic growth
of branched nanosheets on the polar (111) surface. The asprepared 3D-open porous HCMs exhibit superior photoreactivity ( > 90 times for phenol photodegradation) compared to
commercial P25 under a visible light irradiation, and the •OH
radicals are the main active species in the photodegradation
reaction. Moreover, it provides some new insights into the
design and fabrication of advanced photocatalytic materials
with complex hierarchical architectures for high effi ciency in
solar energy conversion.
 Experimental Section
Synthesis of 3D-Open Porous Hierarchical Cu 2 S Microsponges:
In a typical synthesis, Cu(NO 3 ) 2 •3H 2 O (0.20 g), glutathione (GSH,
0.307 g) and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) (1.0 g)
were dissolved in 30 mL of deionized water to form a clear solution
after stirring for 30 min at 40 ° C. The obtained solution was then
transferred and sealed into a Tefl on-lined stainless-steel autoclave
(50 mL in capacity). The autoclave was heated at 120 ° C for 24 h,
and then allowed to cool down to room temperature. The black
products were washed with deionized water and ethanol for
3 times to remove surfactants and other impurities.
Characterization: Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images were taken on a Hitachi S-4800 microscope
(Japan) operated at 1 kV and 10 μ A. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) experiments were conducted on a JEOL JEM-2100F
microscope (Japan) operated at 200 kV. The samples for TEM measurements were suspended in ethanol and supported onto a holey
carbon fi lm on a Cu grid. Wide-angle XRD patterns were recorded on
a Bruker D8 diffractometer (Germany) with Ni-fi ltered Cu K α radiation (40 kV, 40 mA). Nitrogen sorption isotherms were measured at
77 K with a Micromeritcs Tristar 3020 analyzer (USA). The chemical
composition of Cu element in the HCMs sample was determined
by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICPAES) on a P-4010 ICP instrument. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) was recorded on a VG Multilab 2000 (VG Inc.) photoelectron spectrometer by using monochromatic Al K α radiation under
vacuum at 2 × 10 − 6 Pa. All the binding energies were referenced to
the C 1s peak at 284.8 eV of the surface adventitious carbon. All of
the samples were degassed under vacuum at 120 ° C for 24 h prior
to measurements. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method was
utilized to calculate the specifi c surface areas using adsorption
data in a relative pressure range from 0.05 to 0.25. The pore size
distribution (PSD) was derived from the adsorption branch of the
isotherms using the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) model. The total
pore volume (Vt) was estimated from the adsorbed amount at a
relative pressure (P/P 0 ) of 0.998. The UV-vis-NIR diffuse refl ection
spectra were collected on a Shimadzu UV-2450 spectrophotometer
(Japan) from 200 to 800 nm using BaSO 4 as a reference.
Photodegradation Measurements: The photoactivity of the
samples was investigated by the degradation of phenol under visible light ( λ ≥ 420 nm) irradiation. In a typical experiment, 30 mg
of the photocatalyst was added into a fl ask containing 30 mL of
aqueous solution of phenol (100 mg/L), and then the mixed
solution was shaken in dark overnight. After reaching adsorption
equilibrium, the photocatalytic reaction was initiated by irradiating
the system with a 350 W Xenon lamp. At given time intervals, 4 mL
of aliquots was withdrawn and centrifuged to remove the catalyst particles. The supernatant liquid was fi nally analyzed using a
UV-vis spectrophotometer (UV-2450). For comparison, the photocatalytic activities of the mesoporous Cu 2 S microspheres (MCMs)
and commercial TiO 2 powder (Degussa P25) were also tested
under the same conditions.
Analysis of Hydroxyl Radicals (•OH): The production of hydroxyl
radicals on the surface of visible light-illuminated HCMs was

detected by a photoluminescence (PL) method using coumarin
as a probe molecule. Coumarin could readily react with hydroxyl
radicals to produce highly fl uorescent product, 7-hydroxycoumarin
(7HC) (see structure model in Figure S8). The experimental procedure was similar to the measurement of the photocatalytic activity.
In a typical process, HCMs (30 mg) and an aqueous solution of
coumarin (30 mL, 5 × 10 − 4 M) were mixed with magnetic stirring
for 4 h under a dark condition. Then, the mixture was irradiated
using visible light ( ≥ 420 nm). After irradiation for certain time,
the reaction solution was fi ltered for measuring the increase in
the photoluminescence (PL) intensity around 445 nm excited by
