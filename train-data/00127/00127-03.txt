OBJECTIVE To explore the effect of Aripiprazole on the serum prolactin(PRL),glucose and lipids of schizophrenia patients before and after the treatment.METHODS All 60 schizophrenia patients were treated with Aripiprazole for 8 weeks.Before the treatment,after 4-week and 8-week treatment,the levels of serum prolactin(PRL),blood sugar(GLU),triglycerides(TG),total cholesterol(T-CH),high-density lipoprotein cholesterol(hdl-c),apolipoprotein A1(apoA1),and apolipoprotein B(apoB) were measured.RESULTS After the treatment,the level of PRL had a little reduce,but there was no significant difference(P0.05).The levels of GLU,TG,T-CH,HDL-c,apoA1 and apoB demonstrated no significant changes after the treatment(P0.05).CONCLUSION Aripiprazole has no impact on the levels of the serum prolactin,glucose and lipid.
