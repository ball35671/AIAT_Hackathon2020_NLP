Objective: This study explored the relative efficacy of three different doses of clozapine.
Method: Fifty patients who met Kane et al.’s criteria for treatment-refractory schizophrenia
or schizoaffective disorder were studied. All subjects were randomly assigned to 100, 300,
or 600 mg/day of clozapine for 16 weeks of double-blind treatment. Forty-eight patients
completed this first 16 weeks. Of the 50 patients, 36 went on to second and third 16-week
trials of double-blind treatment at the remaining doses. Results: Four subjects (8%) responded to the first 16-week condition, and one subject (2%) responded to the next 16-
week crossover condition. A chi-square comparison of the response rates from the three
dose groups failed to show a significant effect. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) comparison of Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale—Anchored (BPRS-A) total change scores
from baseline to last observation carried forward showed a significant dose effect
(600>300>100 mg/day) at 16 weeks of treatment. A crossover ANOVA of the BPRS-A total
scores from the 48-week study also showed that the main effect for dose was highly significant; the 100-mg/day dose gave the higher (poorer) values, and the 300- and 600-mg/
day doses gave equal (better) values. Gender played a role in clinical response to treatment at 100 mg/day. Conclusions: Clozapine treatment at 100 mg/day was less effective
than at 300 or 600 mg/day. At 100 mg/day, women responded better than did men. The 600
mg/day group had the best results, but an occasional patient required up to 900 mg/day.
Overall response rates were lower than expected.

The introduction of chlorpromazine by Delay and
Deniker (1) represented a major advancement in the
treatment of schizophrenia and other psychoses. In
the following 20 years, other, similar neuroleptic
agents with different chemical structures became
available. Some were more potent than others, but all
shared a common mechanism of action that centered
on dopamine 2 receptor antagonism. None appeared
to be superior to the others in terms of clinical efficacy, and all of the neuroleptics produced an array of
distressing extrapyramidal symptoms that varied in
form and severity. These early antipsychotic drugs
were introduced without systematic multiple-dose
studies, and, unfortunately, it took many years to understand that high equivalent doses were associated
with more side effects and, in some cases, a poorer
treatment response (2).
Clozapine was initially tested in the 1970s (3) and
represented the beginning of a new generation of antipsychotic agents. Early U.S. studies suggested that clozapine had an atypical side effect profile; it appeared not
to produce extrapyramidal side effects such as tardive
dyskinesia and akathisia. It was associated with a
higher risk for agranulocytosis. The drug was also associated with a higher risk of seizures; this risk seemed to
be related to dose or plasma level . The paradoxical effect of hypersalivation was also observed. While cloza-

pine was not marketed in the United States because of
the risk for agranulocytosis, it continued to be used in
some European countries with success.
In a landmark study, Kane et al. (5) showed that
30% of the patients with schizophrenia with treatment-refractory psychotic symptoms responded to
clozapine, whereas only 4% of comparable patients responded to chlorpromazine. The Kane et al. study was
important for several reasons. 1) It was the first study
to show that one neuroleptic drug was significantly
more effective than another in treating positive psychotic symptoms. 2) The study suggested that clozapine treatment may be associated with improvement of
the negative symptoms of psychosis. 3) Finally, and
perhaps most important, the Kane et al. study showed
that a significant proportion of the patients with the
treatment-refractory symptoms of schizophrenia responded to clozapine, although all of the patients had
been resistant to prior treatment with at least three
neuroleptic agents.
The Kane et al. study led to worldwide interest in
clozapine, treatment-refractory schizophrenia, and the
development of other atypical neuroleptic agents.
When clozapine was reintroduced into the United
States, little was known about either the optimal dose
or optimal length of treatment. However, it soon became clear that, as with earlier neuroleptic agents, U.S.
psychiatrists tended to use higher clozapine doses than
did European psychiatrists (6). The Kane et al. 6-week
study used flexible dosing up to 900 mg/day of clozapine, with mean peak doses exceeding 600 mg/day.
Longer treatment trials were suggested by Meltzer (7),
who found in an open study that 6 months of clozapine treatment yielded a 50% response rate. A recent
double-blind study by Rosenheck et al. (8) suggested a
lower response rate for clozapine than that reported by
either Kane et al. or Meltzer and a higher response rate
for the typical neuroleptic haloperidol. The respective
response rates at 6 weeks for clozapine and haloperidol were 24% and 13%, and 37% and 32% after 1
year, respectively.
Our study was designed to provide information
about the appropriate dose of clozapine. In a doubleblind manner, we examined patients with treatment-refractory schizophrenic symptoms in an initial trial of at
least 4 months, using three different clozapine doses:
100, 300, and 600 mg/day. Patients who completed the
4-month study but did not respond to clozapine were
further studied with the two other double-blind clozapine doses, each for a 4-month period.
METHOD
Subjects
Fifty individuals with chronic psychosis were either recruited or
referred for clozapine treatment from a large population of state
hospital patients. The Kane et al. (5) criteria were followed for selecting patients with treatment-refractory symptoms of schizophrenia. All subjects 1) met the DSM-III-R criteria (verified by the Structural Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R) for either schizophrenia or
schizoaffective disorder; 2) had not shown satisfactory clinical response to treatment with at least three neuroleptic drugs (each given
for at least 6 weeks in doses equivalent to 1000 mg/day of chlorpromazine); 3) had Clinical Global Impression (CGI) (9) scale ratings of moderately ill; and 4) had Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale—
Anchored (BPRS-A) (10) total scores of at least 45, with ratings of
moderately ill on at least two of the four BPRS-A positive symptoms
(i.e., hallucinatory behavior, conceptual disorganization, unusual
thought content, and suspiciousness). Table 1 shows the demographic and clinical characteristics for the entire study group. The
current hospital stay ranged from 1 to 38 years; the group had an estimated median of five psychiatric hospitalizations (range=1–25).
The duration of the current hospitalization was inversely related to
the number of hospitalizations (e.g., two patients had single documented hospitalizations of 35 and 38 years). In short, the selected
experimental group had severe treatment-refractory symptoms that
had affected their individual lives for a quarter of a century or more
and precipitated numerous psychiatric hospitalizations.
Design
Overview of the 16-week cross-sectional trial. All patients signed
informed consent forms and were transferred to the 32-bed research
unit of the Norristown State Hospital Clinical Research Center,
where they adapted to their new environment for at least 4 weeks
without any modifications in their medication regimens. During this
adaptation period (the naturalistic baseline), weekly systematic evaluations of psychopathology were initiated; these continued throughout the remainder of the 16 weeks of study. The evaluations included
the BPRS-A, the CGI scale, and the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) (11) for psychopathology.
After this naturalistic baseline period, an attempt was made to
place all patients on a regimen of 10 mg/day of haloperidol treatment (haloperidol phase) for an additional 4 weeks as both a direct
test for treatment response and as a standardized preparation for
clozapine treatment. Of the 50 subjects, 44 entered the haloperidol
phase, and none showed clinical improvement; in fact, on average,
the group showed a worsening of symptoms. The other six patients
did not enter the haloperidol phase, either because of prior sensitivity to haloperidol or because there were problems managing them on
the ward. These six continued their naturalistic baseline treatment
(fluphenazine: N=3, chlorpromazine: N=2, thioridazine: N=1). At
the conclusion of the haloperidol phase, all subjects were randomly
assigned to one of the three dose groups for 16 weeks of doubleblind treatment. Briefly, this was a cross-sectional trial wherein each
patient was randomly assigned to one dose of clozapine. Table 2
provides details for each of the three dose groups. There was no placebo control group in this investigation.

CLOZAPINE DOSE RESPONSE
Overview of the 48-week longitudinal design. Throughout the initial 16-week study, all patients were evaluated for treatment response. Following the procedures of Kane et al., treatment responders were defined as those who had either CGI scores of less than 3 or
BPRS-A total scores of less than 35 and who showed 20% reductions in their BPRS-A total scores between their naturalistic baseline
ratings and their ratings from the 16th week of the trial. Responders
were either discharged from the hospital or transferred to another
unit where their treatment was switched to open use of clozapine
without disclosure of doses. Those judged to be nonresponders were
offered the opportunity to continue in another 16-week, doubleblind clozapine trial in a balanced crossover trial with one of the two
other study doses. If treatment failure again occurred during these
16 weeks, a third 16-week treatment period was offered to the subjects, using the final study dose. Therefore, in this 48-week study, a
patient could participate in a series of three 16-week trials, receiving
double-blind clozapine treatment with all three study doses. For administrative reasons, the first 10 subjects were not eligible to continue after the original 16-week trial. Of the remaining 40 patients,
36 patients began and completed the entire 48-week, double-blind
study. Table 3 provides details for each of the three dose groups.
Double-blind titration schedule. All subjects received the same
number of identical capsules each morning and each afternoon. An
initial dose of 25 mg was administered on the first day, 50 mg on
each of the second and third days (divided equally between morning
and evening doses), 75 mg on each of the fourth and fifth days (divided into a 25-mg dose in the morning and a 50-mg dose in the
evening), and 100 mg on each of the sixth and seventh days (divided
into a 25-mg dose in the morning and a 75-mg dose in the evening).
The dose was then titrated upward by 100 mg per week for the first
3 weeks and thereafter at a rate of 200 mg per week until the assigned double-blind dose was achieved. Thus, those patients who
were randomly assigned to 100 mg/day of clozapine achieved the assigned dose by the end of the first week, whereas those randomly assigned to 300 mg/day or 600 mg/day of clozapine achieved the assigned dose by the end of the third and fifth weeks, respectively. To
decrease a dose when necessary for a subsequent 16-week trial, the
dose was titrated downward at a rate and in increments identical to
the rate and increments of the dose increases.
Definitions of dropouts and completers. Any patient who withdrew from the study because of adverse effects or medical complications before 2 weeks of active clozapine treatment was classified as a
dropout and was not considered in any analysis. Patients who experienced a worsening of symptoms during any 16-week treatment
phase were monitored closely. A decision could have been made to
discontinue the current dose and move on to the next 16-week treatment phase. Any patient who received his or her randomly assigned
dose of clozapine for 2 weeks was considered a completer, and his or
her last observation was carried forward for end-point analysis. The
only noncompleters in the first 16-week trial were two patients who
withdrew from the study for medical reasons (ruptured appendix
and intestinal resection).
Evaluations
The BPRS-A, CGI, and SANS scale scores were assessed by four
research psychiatrists or senior fellows who were blind to clozapine
doses (J.K.S., J.d.L., C.N., and A.O.-W.). During the baseline, haloperidol, and first clozapine phases, ratings were assessed weekly.
During subsequent 16-week treatment phases, ratings were assessed
monthly. Each rater followed his or her assigned patients through all
of the 16-week phases. The reliability of the ratings was monitored
in two ways. 1) Weekly patient rating sessions were conducted by using either hospital patients or training tapes (including recommended anchor points), followed by a detailed discussion by all raters. Informal interrater reliability was computed each week, and any
drift or discrepancies in ratings were discussed. 2) After 6 months
and then at 1-year intervals, formal intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) (12) were computed for the BPRS-A total scores. ICCs
were 0.85, 0.89, and 0.92 for the raters.
Statistical Analysis
Patients were included in the statistical analyses even if they did
not complete a full 16-week treatment period. If a patient had received his or her randomly assigned treatment dose for 2 weeks but
could not continue because of severity of symptoms, his or her last
available observation was carried forward for analysis. Table 2 and
table 3 indicate the duration of clozapine treatment for both the 16-
and 48-week treatment phases. Table 4 combines the treatment responses across all 48 weeks. SPSS 7.5 for Windows was used to perform all statistical analyses, with the exception of the crossover analysis of variance (ANOVA) of the 48-week data set. All significance
tests were performed by using two-tailed probabilities with an alpha
level of 0.05.
Data were grouped in two ways for statistical analysis. The first
group consisted of all patients who completed the initial 16 weeks
of clozapine treatment. Of the original 50 patients recruited, 48

a Not every patient completed the entire 16 weeks of the dosing

dose for 2 weeks, his or her data were carried forward for endpoint analysis. Two subjects in both the 100-mg/day and 600-mg/
day groups had their last observations carried forward.

were deemed to have completed the initial 16-week, double-blind
treatment phase and were included in the analysis. Of these, 44 subjects (92%) had actually completed the entire 16-week treatment
period; four had data carried forward. The second group consisted
of all patients who completed the first 16 weeks of clozapine treatment plus the two additional 16-week treatment periods. Of the
original 50 patients, 36 completed the entire 48-week study and
were included in the analysis. These groups are referred to as the
16- and 48-week data sets.
The 16-week data set was analyzed in several ways. Initially, a chisquare analysis of response rates was performed with patients categorized as responders or nonresponders following the criteria of
Kane et al. Next, mean BPRS-A total score change from the naturalistic baseline to the last observation carried forward was evaluated.
Total scores were computed by using all individual BPRS-A items.
The univariate ANOVA model included one between-subject factor—group (three levels: 100 mg/day, 300 mg/day, and 600 mg/day).
Post hoc pairwise comparisons were performed by using Tukey’s
honestly significant difference test. Finally, an exploratory ANOVA
model included two between-subject factors—group (three levels:
100 mg/day, 300 mg/day, and 600 mg/day) and gender (two levels)—
including the group-by-gender interaction.
The 48-week analytic approach was modified. Here, a crossover
analysis of variance design (four by three) as described by Kirk (13)
was used because all 36 subjects appeared in each of the three dose
groups. Each patient was randomly assigned to the first dose and
then received second and third treatment doses. In the crossover
ANOVA design, four dependent variables were entered into the
model (clozapine week 4, 8, 12, and 16 BPRS-A total scores from
each dosing period) as a within-subject factor (time), along with another within-subject factor—group (three levels: 100 mg/day, 300
mg/day, and 600 mg/day). The crossover model assumed that there
were no interactions.
RESULTS
None of the patients responded to treatment with
haloperidol, confirming the selection of patients with
treatment-refractory symptoms for this study. It is interesting that, as shown in table 5, many of them
showed a worsening of symptoms during the standardized lead-in period with haloperidol treatment.
When we used the criteria of Kane et al., four patients
(8%) responded to the first clozapine dose and one
subject (2%) to the next clozapine dose. None of the
patients responded to the third clozapine dose. Of the
five responders, two subjects responded to a dose of
300 mg/day, three to 600 mg/day, and none to 100
mg/day. A chi-square test comparing rates of responders and nonresponders during the first 16-week period
across the three dose groups was nonsignificant (χ2=
3.5, df=2, n.s.).
Results of the 16-week study (N=48). Mean BPRS-A
total scores across the first full 16-week study are displayed in figure 1. Table 5 summarizes mean scores.
No significant naturalistic baseline differences were
observed between the treatment groups. Levene’s test
of equality of error variance showed that the error
variance for the change scores from the naturalistic
baseline to the last observation carried forward was
equivalent across groups (F=0.05, df=2, 45, p>0.93).
An ANOVA of between-group differences in BPRS-A
total change scores from baseline to the last observation carried forward revealed a statistically significant dose effect (F=3.35, df=2, 45, p<0.04). Twoway comparisons by means of Tukey’s honestly significant difference test (p<0.05 criterion) revealed
that the 600-mg/day group had a better clinical response than the 300-mg/day and 100-mg/day groups.
The comparison between the 300-mg/day and 100-
mg/day groups failed to reach statistical significance
(p=0.13).
We wondered whether gender contributed to the
overall variance in a systematic fashion. Therefore,
another ANOVA was performed with both group
(three levels: 100 mg/day, 300 mg/day, and 600 mg/
day) and gender (two levels) as main effects, as well
as the group-by-gender interaction. First, Levene’s
test of equality of error variance showed that the error variance with gender included was equivalent
across groups (F=0.74, df=5, 41, p>0.64). In an
ANOVA of between-group differences from baseline
to the last observation carried forward, a significant
group effect was again obtained (F=5.08, df=2, 41, p<
0.01). Gender was not statistically significant (F=
1.54, df=1, 41, p>0.22), and the group-by-gender interaction failed to reach statistical significance (F=
0.56, df=2, 41, p>0.57). Two-way comparisons by
means of Tukey’s honestly significant difference test

CLOZAPINE DOSE RESPONSE
again revealed that the 600-mg/day group had a better clinical response than both the 300-mg/day (p<
0.14) and 100-mg/day (p<0.01) groups. The difference between the 300-mg/day and 100-mg/day
groups failed to reach statistical significance (p=
0.51). Figure 2 plots the mean BPRS-A total change
scores across dose groups with scores separated by
gender. It is interesting that for the 100-mg/day dose,
a difference in clinical response was observed between men and women (women responded more than
men), which was not seen for the other two doses.
Results of the 48-week study (N=36). Mean BPRS-A
total scores across the entire 48-week study are shown
in figure 3. Each of the three dosing phases across the
48 weeks were 16 weeks in length, with data from each
dosing period represented as week 4, 8, 12, or 16. This
analysis included a total of 36 subjects. In the crossover analysis, the main effect for group was highly significant (F=9.91, df=2, 34, p<0.0001), with the 100-
mg/day dose showing the highest (poorest) values and
the values of the 300-mg/day and 600-mg/day doses
being approximately equal. The main effect for time
was also significant (F=6.47, df=3, 34, p<0.01). There
was no group-by-time interaction term in this crossover model.
Because of the limited range of response, no attempt
was made to study the relationships of plasma levels of
clozapine. At a descriptive level, however, all responders had levels that were greater than 350 ng/ml of clozapine (not including norclozapine). Extrapyramidal
symptom results from this group have been reported
elsewhere and essentially showed that clozapine did
not cause rigidity or akathisia (14, 15).
DISCUSSION
A group of state hospital patients was treated with
three different doses of clozapine in a 48-week, double-blind study. The study initially began as a 16-week
cross-sectional investigation (N=48) that was extended
into a 48-week longitudinal study (N=36), with individual patients receiving a trial with each of the three
doses (16 weeks each). The number of patients who
improved to the point that they were judged to be responders by using the Kane et al. criteria was small
compared to other studies of the efficacy of clozapine.
If we consider all the patients treated across the entire
48-week, double-blind study, approximately 10% (five
of 48) demonstrated sufficient clinical improvement to
be considered treatment responders. Four additional
patients responded to clozapine when they received
open medication at higher doses (800–900 mg/day),
but even adding these additional patients brought
the number of responders to only 19% (nine of 48).
Clearly, these results, based on the Kane et al. response
criteria, are at variance with the bulk of the findings on
clozapine efficacy.
The reasons for this lower response rate are not
clear, but several factors need to be considered. 1) The
patients enrolled in this study were chronically ill, perhaps more chronically ill than other groups reported in
the literature. 2) The Kane et al. criteria for treatment
response are categorical and, perhaps, insensitive to
modest clinical gains. 3) The demonstration of clinical
response was strongly influenced by the choice of baseline measure. 4) The raters may have been highly conservative in their assessment of symptoms across time.
Each of these possibilities will be considered in turn.
The first relates to the general problem of patient selection and subject variance across hospital sites. As
shown in table 1, for our group, mean age was 44.8
years; mean duration of illness was 25.1 years. The

a Although the interaction did not reach statistical significance, it is
interesting that the curves for men and women are equivalent at
the 300-mg/day and 600-mg/day doses. While taking the 100-mg/
day dose, the women, on average, showed no change, whereas
the men, on average, worsened.

a Each dosing phase was 16 weeks in length, and the designation
of weeks 4, 8, 12, and 16 refers to time on a specific dose of clozapine. The order of the three dose groups was randomly assigned. The baseline measure designated in the figure is the naturalistic period before the start of clozapine treatment; the
haloperidol baseline is excluded.

mean duration of the current hospitalization was 8.6
years (range=1–38); the group had an estimated median of five hospitalizations (range=1–25). The pivotal
Kane et al. sample of 319 patients (5) was nearly a decade younger; the mean age was 35.7 years. The Lindenmayer et al. sample (16) had a mean age of 34 years
and a duration of illness of 15 years, and the Lieberman et al. (17) study group had a mean age of 28 years
and a duration of illness of 9 years. Clearly, the patients enrolled in this study were older and extremely
chronically ill, indeed, to our knowledge, more chronically ill than other subject groups reported to date.
Lieberman et al. (17) found poorer clozapine response
was associated with age at onset (19 years or less) and,
to a lesser extent, duration of illness (9 or more years).
In addition, at the time of our study, treatment with
clozapine had commenced in the state hospital. More
than 100 state hospital patients had already begun
treatment with clozapine and, therefore, were not eligible for our study. This biases our study group in the
sense that the majority of the remaining patients were
much more difficult to manage clinically and many
had additional comorbid medical problems. Perhaps
these opaque subject factors combined to result in a
lowering of the rate of clinical response.
The second possibility relates to the issue of defining
treatment response. According to Kane et al., the a priori definition of treatment response to clozapine is categorical: patients with either a CGI of less than 3 or a
BPRS-A total score of less than 35 who showed a 20%
reduction in their BPRS-A total score. It is possible that
some of our chronically ill patients responded to clozapine at a level that was clinically meaningful but was
below the threshold of improvement sufficient to meet
these a priori criteria. This would be consistent with
general clinical observations that the majority of patients treated with clozapine, who are not terminated
because of side effects, tend to improve according to
ward staff and relatives, although these impressions
are often found to be made on the basis of an improved
level of social function, a reduction in level of aggression, and fewer periods of isolation and restraint. Our
group showed a significant decline in BPRS-A total
scores across both the 16-week and the 48-week evaluations, although the level of improvement was below
the Kane et al. threshold. It is not surprising that a preliminary analysis of part of these data with less stringent response criteria showed much more of a response
rate than reported here (18).
A third possible reason for the low response rate
may relate to the issue of baseline selection. With treatment response partly defined as a 20% reduction in the
BPRS-A total score, the initial baseline calibration of
symptom severity is critical. This baseline selection
strongly influences the determination of treatment efficacy. In our design, two legitimate baselines were available. The first option was the naturalistic baseline, and
the second option was the haloperidol baseline; the 1-
week washout was not considered a valid baseline. Examination of figure 1 and table 5 shows that symptom
severity at these two potential baselines was different.
Group BPRS-A total scores worsened when patients
were placed on 4 weeks of haloperidol treatment as
compared to the naturalistic baseline. When an exploratory ANOVA was performed by using BPRS-A total
change from haloperidol baseline to last observation
carried forward, it was interesting that the basic results
did not change although the magnitude of BPRS-A
changes scores was greater. On close inspection, the
absence of greater statistical significance resulted from
a twofold increase in the level of variance between the
naturalistic baseline and the haloperidol baseline. The
switch to haloperidol as a standardized lead-in to the
clozapine treatment significantly increased the level of
“noise” in the data. We compared the efficacy of clozapine against the real-life level of clinical care within
this state hospital. It may be the case that research designs requiring patients to be switched to some standardized neuroleptic (such as haloperidol) may artificially worsen the clinical condition of the study group
at baseline and thus inflate the actual effects of the
treatment. Akathisia was present in fewer than 20% of
the subjects during the natural baseline but in over
40% of the subjects after 4 weeks of haloperidol treatment, 10 mg/day.
A fourth possible reason for the low response rate
may relate to our raters being highly conservative in
their ratings of symptoms across time. Admittedly, the
study was done within the context of a large state hospital, where the expectations for clinical improvement
are often modest. While acknowledging that our raters
may have adopted modest expectations for clinical improvement, it is worth noting that all ratings were on
the basis of defined anchor points. Moreover, weekly
group ratings were performed and scores were discussed by all raters by using a heterogeneous selection
of inpatients, outpatients, and training tapes in an effort to guard against various kinds of rater drift.
On the basis of the negative findings of treatment
response by using the Kane et al. criteria, it is tempting
to assume that the results shed little light on the question of clozapine dose response. However, this was
not the case. When we used the Kane et al. criteria, no
patient responded to 100 mg/day of clozapine. Indeed,
almost 50% of the patients at this dose had a worsening of their psychosis and had to be terminated from
this phase of the study. In contrast, only 9% of the patients were terminated from the 300-mg/day dose,
whereas 4% were terminated from the 600 mg/day
dose for a worsening of their psychosis. On the basis
of the ANOVA results of both the 16- and 48-week
data sets, we were able to conclude that there was a
statistically significant dose response. In the case of
the 16-week data, there was a significant difference
between 600-mg/day response and response from the
other two doses; however, in the 48-week data set, the
300-mg/day and 600-mg/day responses were equivalent; both were better than the 100-mg/day response.
The small group size precluded the establishment of
any relationships between clozapine blood levels and

clozapine response. However, all patients who did respond had blood levels in the range of 350 ng/ml of
clozapine. Notably, one subject required 900 mg/day
to reach this value.
It is interesting that the cross-sectional 16-week
analysis yielded more statistically powerful findings of
a dose effect than was found in the 48-week crossover
analysis. In general, when patients are used as their
own control subjects in a repeated-measures design,
the dose response effect is stronger. However, with this
data set, the crossover design introduced uncontrolled
sources of variance, such as carryover effects from the
previous dose and time, and these could not be systematically partitioned in our analysis. Nonetheless, we
are not aware of any other multiple-dose, double-blind
studies. A recent 12-week, double-blind clozapine
study investigated patients with low (50–150 ng/ml),
medium (200–300 ng/ml), or high (350–450 ng/ml)
blood levels of clozapine that were achieved with mean
doses of 165, 373, and 511 mg/day, respectively (19).
This study suggests that therapeutic blood levels are
higher than 250 ng/ml (mean dose=373 mg/day) when
using equally divided doses and blood drawn approximately 12 hours after the last dose. Prior studies using
an evening dose or blood drawn in less than 12 hours
after clozapine administration recommended higher
blood levels. Hasegawa et al. (20) recommended 370
ng/ml (mean dose=385 ng/ml), Perry et al. (21) recommended 350 ng/ml (mean dose=384 mg/day), Potkin et
al. (22) recommended 420 mg/ml (mean dose=400 mg/
day), and Kronig et al. (23) recommended 350 ng/ml
(mean dose=484 mg/day). Therefore, it appears that
the average patient needs to be treated with at least
300–600 mg/day of clozapine to achieve a therapeutic
response. It is also clear that some patients need higher
doses to obtain this response.
