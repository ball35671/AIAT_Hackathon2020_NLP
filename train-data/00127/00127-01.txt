Objective The study investigated the relationship between serum level and clinical response to clozapine in different dose for treating schizophrenic patients. Methods 82 subjects in high dose(500 mg/d) group and 94 subjects in low dose (200 mg/d)group were treated for six weeks. Therapeutic efficacy was measured by BPRS and the adverse reaction was rated by TESS. Steady serum level was monitored within 1, 2, 4, 6 week. Results No difference was found in the decreased score rate of BPRS and the rate of recovery between high and low dose groups. The scores of TESS in high dose group were higher than those in low dose group, but no significantly. No significant correlation was found between the scores of BPRS and TESS and serum clozapine level. But, better clinical responses were observed in the patients with their serum clozapine level300 μg/L, efficacy was not increased and side effects are more severely in the patients with their serum clozapine level 600 μg/L. Conclusion A serum clozapine concentration of 300 μg/L was the cutoff for distinguishing responders and nonresponders. The results indicate that monitoring serum clozapine concentration have the clinical significance for using the drug reasonably.
