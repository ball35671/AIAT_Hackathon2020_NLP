Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy of goserelin versus a low-dose cyclic oral contraceptive
(OC) in improving pelvic pain in women with endometriosis and to compare recurrence of symptoms during follow-up.
Design: Open-label, randomized trial.
Setting: University hospital endometriosis center.
Patients: Fifty-seven women with moderate or severe pelvic pain and laparoscopically diagnosed endometriosis.
Interventions: Six-month treatment with goserelin depot (n = 29) or a low-dose cyclic OC
(n = 28) followed by 6-month follow-up.
Main Outcome Measures: Variation in severity of symptoms during treatment and at the end
of follow-up as shown by a linear analog scale and a verbal rating scale.
Results: At 6 months of treatment, a significant reduction in deep dyspareunia was observed in
both groups, with goserelin superior to the OC at linear analog scale assessment. Nonmenstrual
pain was diminished on both scales without differences between treatments. Women taking the OC
experienced a significant reduction in dysmenorrhea. At the end of follow-up, symptoms reappeared without differences in severity between the groups.
Conclusions: Low-dose cyclic OCs may be a valuable alternative for the treatment of dysmenorrhea and nonmenstrual pain associated with endometriosis. Symptoms recurred in most subjects 6
months after drug withdrawal. Fertil Steril 1993;60:75-9

necessarily achieved by conservative surgery even
when pelvic denervation is performed (1, 2).
Current medical treatments including danazol, gestrinone, and GnRH agonists are often temporarily
effective, but side effects limit the possibility of
long-term treatments and costs are high (3, 4).

A medical therapy with minor side effects and
limited cost would be of great benefit. Previous findings suggest that estrogen (E)-progestin birth control pills may alleviate pelvic pain in patients with
endometriosis, but high-dose preparations that
usually caused unpleasant side effects and increased thromboembolic risk were used (5, 6).

Different formulations are now available with low
E-progestin content, but reports on their use in patients with endometriosis with pelvic pain are anecdotal. We performed a prospective study to compare the efficacy of a low-dose oral contraceptive
(OC) with that of a GnRH-a in the relief of pelvic
pain associated with endometriosis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy
of goserelin versus a cyclic low-dose monophasic
OC in improving pelvic pain in 18- to 35-year-old
patients with endometriosis during treatment and
to compare symptom recurrence after drug withdrawal. Fifty-seven subjects were recruited at a university hospital endometriosis center. Local institutional approval and informed patient consent to
the study were obtained.
Eligible patients had had a diagnostic laparoscopy with no attempts at endometriosis reduction
other than biopsy within 3 months of study entry.
The disease was staged according to the revised
American Fertility Society classification (7). Subjects who had received any treatment for endometriosis other than nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs in the preceding 3 months were excluded as
were those with the usual contraindications to OCs.
Each woman completed a questionnaire on the presence and severity of dysmenorrhea, deep dyspareunia, and nonmenstrual pelvic pain. Dysmenorrhea
and nonmenstrual pelvic pain were evaluated by
means of a multidimensional verbal rating scale, a
modified version of the one proposed by Andersch
and Milsom (8). This scale defines pain according
to limitation of ability to work (unaffected, 0; rarely
affected, 1; moderately affected, 2; clearly inhibited,
3), coexistence of systemic symptoms (absent, 0;
present, 1), and need for analgesics (no, 0; rarely, 1;
regularly, 2; inefficacious, 3) and ranks their simple
sum into three groups (1 to 3, mild; 4 and 5, moderate; 6 and 7, severe). The severity of deep dyspareunia was graded on a unidimensional verbal rating
scale, as described by Biberoglu and Behrman (9),
that defines pain according to the limitations of sexual activity (discomfort tolerated, mild, 1; intercourse painful to the point of causing interruption,
moderate, 2; intercourse avoided because of pain,
severe, 3). The women were also requested to specify the severity of dysmenorrhea, nonmenstrual
pelvic pain, and deep dyspareunia according to a
10-point linear analog scale in which 0 indicated
the absence of pain, 1 to 5 mild pain, 6 and 7
moderate pain, and 8 to 10 severe pain. Subjects
were recruited who had at least one moderate or
severe symptom on both pain scales.
A randomization list was used to allocate patients to a 6-month treatment with goserelin, 3.6
mg in a 28-day subcutaneous depot formulation, or
a cyclic low-dose monophasic OC containing ethinyl E2 (EE2), 0.02 mg and desogestrel 0.15 mg per
pill. In the OC group, if spotting or breakthrough
bleeding occurred, patients could switch to a contraceptive with EE2 , 0.03 mg and desogestrel 0.15
mg per pill.
Patients underwent clinical examinations at
which also side effects were recorded each month
until the end of treatment, after which they were
seen every 2 months during a 6-month follow-up. In
the goserelin-treated patients, the follow-up period
was considered to start 4 weeks after the last injection. The patients completed the pain questionnaire a second time at the end of treatment and a
third time at the end of the follow-up.
Clinical characteristics of the patients in the goserelin and OC groups were compared by unpaired
Student's t-test and x2 analysis. Differences between the two groups in mean pain scores according
to the linear analog and verbal rating scales before
and at the end of treatment and at the end of the
follow-up period were analyzed by split-plot
ANOV A, two factor mixed design. Differences in
percentages of patients with moderate plus severe
symptoms at baseline and at the end of follow-up
were evaluated by x2 analysis with continuity correction. Assuming a 35% recurrence of moderate/
severe pelvic pain at the end of follow-up in women
taking goserelin, the number of patients in the
study would allow an 80% chance of detecting a
35% difference between the goserelin and OC
groups (35% versus 70% symptom recurrence rate
was considered a clinically significant effect) at the
usual level of statistical significance (a = 0.05).
RESULTS
Initially, 62 women were considered eligible for
the study, but 5 refused randomization. Twentynine of the remaining 57 subjects were allocated to
the goserelin arm and 28 to the OC arm. Mean ± SD
age (years), height (em), and weight (kg) were 28
± 5, 161 ± 5, and 56 ± 8 in the goserelin group and
27 ± 5, 162 ± 6, and 58 ± 7 in the OC group. Eight
(28%) of the former subjects and 7 (25%) of the
latter were parous. Endometriosis was at stage I in
12 (41%) women of the goserelin group and 14

(32%), stage III in 5 (17%) and 4 (14%), and stage
IV in 2 (7%) and 1 (4%). None of the above differences were significant. Six subjects in the OC group
switched to the birth control pill with 0.03 mg of
EE2 because of intermenstrual bleeding, and one of
them then withdrew at the 4th month of treatment
because of severe headaches. Six other women did
not complete the follow-up: 1 pregnant woman in
the goserelin group, 1 lost to follow-up in each
group, and 1 in the goserelin group and 2 in the OC
group who requested additional hormonal therapy
after the end ofthe treatment. The efficacy analysis
of pain symptoms was conducted on the 26 women
in the goserelin group and the 24 women in the OC
group who were evaluated throughout the entire
study period.
Modifications in pain scores during and after
therapy are listed in Table 1. At the end of treatment, a significant reduction in deep dyspareunia
was observed in both groups, with goserelin superior to OC according to the linear analog scale
(mean difference, 1.8; 95% confidence interval (CI),
0.1 to 3.5). Nonmenstrual pain was diminished on
both scales without differences between treatments. Women taking OCs experienced a significant reduction in dysmenorrhea on both pain scales
(mean of paired differences on linear analogue
scale, 4.3; 95% CI, 3.7 to 4.8; mean of paired differences on verbal rating scale, 2.6; 95% CI, 2.1 to 3.0).
No between-group evaluation was performed because of the obvious absence of dysmenorrhea in
amenorrheic patients in the goserelin group. At the
end of follow-up, no significant differences were observed between the groups in any symptom on either pain scale. Within-group evaluation by linear
analog scale indicated a persistent significant reduction of deep dyspareunia compared with baseline in the goserelin group (mean of paired differences, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.2 to 2.0). Table 2 shows the
distribution of patients during the study period according to the grading of pain symptoms. Analyzing
pain symptoms on the two scales in dichotomous
fashion (absent and mild versus moderate and severe), we observed no significant differences in the
percentages of women with clinically important
(moderate or severe) dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia,
and nonmenstrual pain at the end of the follow-up
in both within- and between-group evaluations
with respect to pretreatment frequencies.
The side effects of the two treatments are listed
in Table 3. Both drugs were generally well tolerated, and only one patient in the OC group withdrew during the treatment period.
DISCUSSION
In our study a low-dose cyclic OC was found effective in reducing pelvic pain in women with endometriosis. Although comparison of dysmenorrhea
with the goserelin group was not performed at the
end of treatment because of the absence of menstrual flows during GnRH -a administration, significant relief from the symptom was reported by the
women taking OCs. Reduction of dyspareunia at
the end of treatment was greater in the goserelin
than in the OC group according to the linear analog
scale, despite the vaginal dryness and decreased libido observed in some patients taking the GnRH -a.
Why the linear analog scale should reveal a difference when the verbal rating scale did not is unclear,
particularly because Andersch and Milsom (8) reported a significant correlation between the verbal
and analog methods, but random fluctuation of
data cannot be excluded. Relief from nonmenstrual
pain was similar in the two groups.

istration (10-12). Kennedy et al. (13) treated 50 endometriosis patients with nafarelin, and after 3
months of follow-up observed that symptoms improved with respect to baseline in 25 women,
whereas they were unchanged in 10 and worsened
in 4 (8 were lost to follow-up and 3 were not evaluated because they were pregnant). Dlugi et al. (14),
in the only published placebo-controlled study specifically designed for patients with endometriosis
with moderate or severe pain, reported that 57% of
32 women treated with leuprolide acetate depot
complained of recurrent, although less severe, dysmenorrhea after 6 months of follow-up. Medical
treatments induce only a temporary quiescence of
the lesions (15, 16). The incidence of symptom recurrence at the resumption of ovarian activity may
be particularly high in a series such as ours in which
moderate or severe pain was a selection criterion.
The small sample size is a major drawback of the
present study, and we cannot exclude the possibility that a limited difference in pain relief between
78 Vercellini et al. GnRH-a versus OC for pain in endometriosis Fertility and Sterility 
treatments went unrecognized. Furthermore, the
unexpectedly high frequency of pain recurrence in
the goserelin-treated subjects invalidates the calculation of the study sample size and could affect interpretation of the results. This was not a blind
trial, but we considered that even with a doubledummy design, recognition of the treatment taken
would have been so immediate as to make the procedure useless. Completion of the pain questionnaire by the patients should have avoided undue
investigator influence.
We have no data on the effects of a low-dose cyclic OC on endometriotic lesions. Fedele et al. (17)
observed an improvement in implants at follow-up
laparoscopy after administration of an E-progestin
combination, but diZerega et al. (18) have demonstrated that P alone is sufficient for survival of the
lesions. One epidemiological study has shown an
increased risk of endometriosis in women taking
OCs (19), but with a high E content compared with
the preparations now available, and selection and
indication biases cannot be excluded because clinical symptoms of endometriosis could per se lead to
increased OC use (20). Follow-up laparoscopy in patients with endometriosis undergoing medical therapies is controversial at the moment (21), and we
did not include it in the study protocol.
Although it is tempting to propose low-dose cyclic OC as the treatment of choice for safe and inexpensive long-term pelvic pain relief in women with
endometriosis, our data are limited to a 6-month
period. Further studies are needed to verify whether
the good antalgic results observed are maintained
during longer periods of OC administration.
