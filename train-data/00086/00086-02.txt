Objective: To compare the efficacy of leuprolide and continuous oral contraceptives in the treatment of
endometriosis-associated pain.
Design: Prospective, randomized, double-blind controlled trial.
Setting: Academic medical centers in Rochester, New York, and Boston, Massachusetts.
Patient(s): Forty-seven women with endometriosis-associated pelvic pain.
Intervention(s): Forty-eight weeks of either depot leuprolide, 11.25 mg IM every 12 weeks with hormonal
add-back using norethindrone acetate 5 mg orally, daily; or a generic monophasic oral contraceptive (1 mg
norethindrone þ 35 mg ethinyl estradiol) given daily.
Main Outcome Measure(s): Biberoglu and Behrman (B&B) pain scores, numerical rating scores (NRS), Beck
Depression Inventory (BDI), and Index of Sexual Satisfaction (ISS).
Result(s): Based on enrollment of 47 women randomized to continuous oral contraceptives and to leuprolide, there
were statistically significant declines in B&B, NRS, and BDI scores from baseline in both groups. There were no
significant differences, however, in the extent of reduction in these measures between the groups.
Conclusion(s): Leuprolide and continuous oral contraceptives appear to be equally effective in the treatment of
endometriosis-associated pelvic pain. (Fertil Steril 2011;95:1568–73. 2011 by American Society for

Chronic pelvic pain is a common and significant affliction of women,
with an estimated lifetime prevalence of 33%–39% and a point prevalence of 12% (1, 2). This syndrome accounts for approximately 10%
of outpatient gynecologic evaluations, one-third of gynecologic
laparoscopies, and up to 12% of hysterectomies (3).
Among women with chronic pelvic pain, approximately onethird have endometriosis (4). Endometriosis-associated pelvic pain
can be treated medically or surgically. Conservative surgical treatment is typically associated with significant reduction in pain on
a short-term basis. However, 50% of patients report recurrence of
pain by 12 months postoperatively (5). A variety of medical
regimens, including danazol, progestins, and GnRH analogs, have
been shown to be effective in suppressing endometriosisassociated pelvic pain when treatment is continued for 6 months
(6–8). After discontinuation of medication, however, pain scores
return toward baseline levels (6–8). These drugs have generally
not been studied for more than 6 months owing to side effects,
complexity, or cost.
Currently, the only treatment for endometriosis-associated
chronic pelvic pain approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for greater than 6 months is a combination of
IM leuprolide acetate (LA; a GnRH analog) and oral norethindrone acetate (NA) for up to 12 months (9). However, such
treatment requires periodic injections plus a daily pill and is
quite costly.
As an alternative to GnRH analogs, the use of cyclic oral
contraceptives (OCs) has been advocated as a practical,
inexpensive strategy for long-term medical treatment of
endometriosis-associated pain. Although such an approach has
a number of advantages, including safety of long-term use,
simplicity, and cost, there are limited data regarding its efficacy
(10, 11). Continuous use of OCs has the additional potential
advantages of reduced dysmenorrhea and reduced reseeding of
endometriosis.
In view of theses considerations, we performed a randomized,
double-blind trial of continuous OCs versus leuprolide/norethindrone in the treatment of women with endometriosis-associated pelvic pain. We hypothesized that over a 12-month period of treatment,
both treatments would result in a significant reduction in pain but
that there would be no difference between the two treatments in
the extent of pain reduction.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Overview
The research design was a prospective double-blind, randomized clinical
trial. Women were recruited from gynecologic practices associated with
the University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, Rochester,
New York, and Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria are shown in Table 1. Eligible women who
provided informed consent were randomized to receive either 48 weeks of
a generic monophasic OC (1 mg norethindrone þ 35 mg ethinyl estradiol)
given daily or 48 weeks of depot leuprolide, 11.25 mg IM every 12 weeks
with hormonal add-back using NA 5 mg orally daily. Each participant
received one injection every 12 weeks (depot leuprolide or saline with an
inert powder suspension formulated to look alike) and also received tablets
to take daily (NA or OC, each made into a powder and placed in an identical
capsule). Medication began at the onset of the first menstrual period after
enrollment. Baseline measures of pain and quality of life, described below,
were obtained before beginning treatment and were repeated at 12-week
intervals through week 48.
Study Population, Recruitment, and Informed Consent
The principal investigators (PIs) at each site (Rochester, DSG; Boston,
MDH) were directly involved with recruitment from referral practices.
In Rochester, the study was presented by the PI to faculty in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology and to four private practice obstetrics
and gynecology groups. In Boston, participants were recruited from the
Center for Reproductive Medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital
and from radio and print advertisements. Eligible and interested participants attended an intake visit, at which informed consent was obtained.
The study was approved by the Research Subjects Review Board of the
University of Rochester and the Human Research Committee of Partners
Healthcare.
Pain and Quality-of-Life Assessments
Pain intensity, quality of life, and psychosocial functioning were assessed
initially at the intake visit after informed consent had been obtained. These
three domains captured the multidimensional nature of the experience of
chronic pain (12) and provided data especially relevant to the evaluation
of pain in women (13). The specific instruments described below were
administered on the intake visit before treatment and at 12, 24, 36, and
48 weeks after commencement of treatment. In Rochester, all visits
occurred in the General Clinical Research Center. In Boston, all visits
took place at the Center for Reproductive Medicine of Brigham and
Women’s Hospital.

Biberoglu and Behrman patient ratings (B&B pain score) (14) This
instrument, widely used in many treatment studies of endometriosisassociated pain, assesses dyspareunia, dysmennorrhea, and noncyclic pelvic
pain. It is a 0–9 scale, with 0–3 points assigned for each type of pain.
Numerical Rating Scale (NRS pain score) (15) This is a 0–10 scale
that measures the participant’s range of pain levels independent of the
menstrual cycle or intercourse. In a structured daily diary, participants
recorded NRS ratings of their global pain each day.
Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) (16) This is a 21-item self-report
instrument that provides a rapid assessment of depressive symptoms. It has
been used in a large number of studies of chronic pain, including chronic
pelvic pain (17, 18).
Index of Sexual Satisfaction (ISS) (19) This is a 25-item measure of
self-reported satisfaction with the sexual aspects of an intimate relationship.
Since dyspareunia is nearly always present with chronic pelvic pain, sexual
satisfaction is an important outcome variable.
Data Processing and Analysis
Data forms for de-identified data were developed by the Department of
Biostatistics at the University of Rochester. Forms from both clinical units
were transferred to the Department of Biostatistics as soon as they were
completed and tracked on a log system. Data were entered, using double
entry validation, onto an SAS database with a password-protected account.
The main hypothesis was assessed by comparing B&B and NRS scores for
each treatment group across time and by comparing the change in these
scores across time between the two treatment groups. Linear mixed models
were fitted for each treatment with a categorical time variable to assess the
change in pain scores over time. In addition, a linear mixed model was run
for all data with both the treatment variable and time to assess their effects
simultaneously. This analysis used repeated measurements on each subject
at different time points, which were assumed to be correlated in the modeling
process. Parameters were estimated by restricted maximum likelihood and
generalized least squares using SAS (20). In addition to the two pain scores,
similar analyses were performed on BDI and ISS.
RESULTS
Over the period 2005–2008, 47 women were recruited to the study
protocol, 28 in Boston and 19 in Rochester. Of these 47 women,
26 were randomized to treatment with OCs and 21 to treatment
with leuprolide. There were seven patients who dropped out immediately after the screening visit, three in the OC group and four in the
NA group. Thus, baseline scores were available for 40 participants.
There were no significant differences in any of the four baseline outcome measures between Rochester and Boston. For the purposes of
hypothesis testing, data from Rochester and Boston were combined.

Demographic and baseline data are shown in Table 2. Based on
c2
-tests for categorical variables and two-sample t-tests for mean
age and baseline outcome measures, there were no differences in
race, parity, marital status, or age between the two randomized treatment groups or between patients from the Rochester and Boston
sites. There were no significant differences between treatment
groups in baseline outcome measures, with the exception of ISS,
with a P value of .0286.
The trend in pain reduction scores for each treatment at each time
point is shown in Figure 1. It can be seen that both B&B and NRS
pain scores declined after the commencement of both NA and OC
treatment and that self-reported pain measures continued at a lower
level for both NA and OC through 48 weeks of treatment. Using the
linear mixed model described above and as reported in Table 3, the
reductions in B&B and NRS pain scores from baseline levels were
statistically significant at each of the five time points measured
through 48 weeks, with the exception of the B&B score at 36 weeks
for the OC group (P¼.06). However, comparisons of treatment show
that the extent of pain reduction from baseline, whether measured by
B&B or NRS, was no different for the two treatments. Analysis

using two-sample t-tests at each time point also confirms that the
difference in treatments was not significant (data not shown). Significant reductions were seen in BDI scores for both treatments at all
time points, with the exception of the BDI score at 4 weeks in
both groups. The ISS appeared to show improved scores in weeks
24–48 of leuprolide treatment, but there was no overall difference
in treatment effect on sexual satisfaction between the two treatments
using mixed model analysis.
No significant adverse events were reported. Based on responses
to a survey of side effects by each subject at each visit, there were six
or fewer total reported episodes of headache, breast tenderness,
bloating, reduced libido, mood change, and nausea in each treatment
group. Vaginal bleeding was reported in 22 of 81 responses in the
OC group, as compared with 12 of 72 responses in the NA group
(P¼.24) Hot flashes occurred in 11 of 82 and 12 of 73 responses
in the OC and NA groups (P¼.65).
DISCUSSION
The major findings of this prospective, randomized, double-blind
48-week trial of a continuous OC versus LA in the treatment of
endometriosis-associated pelvic pain were that [1] both treatment
arms provided a significant reduction in pain from baseline and
[2] there was no significant difference in the extent of pain relief
between the two treatment regimens.
A detailed cost-effectiveness evaluation is beyond the scope of
this report, but based on 2009 prices in Boston, Massachusetts,
and Rochester, New York, the cost of leuprolide depot 11.25 mg
(four injections at $1,800 each) plus NA 5 mg (336 pills at $2.40
each) totals $8,006. The OC arm (ethinyl estradiol 35 mg plus
NA) entailed 16 3-week pill packs at $28.38 each, totaling $454.
Thus, to achieve a reduction in pain that is not significantly different
from leuprolide treatment, a 48-week treatment of OCs would save
$7,552 per patient over 48 weeks.
There has been only one previous randomized trial of a GnRH
agonist versus continuous OCs in the treatment of endometriosisassociated pain. Zupi and colleagues randomized 133 women to
three regimens in the treatment of women with relapsing pain after
surgery for endometriosis (21): GnRH agonist plus add-back
consisting of transdermal E2 25 mg and norethindrone 5 mg,
GnRH agonist alone, or a continuous contraceptive consisting of
ethinyl estradiol 30 mg and gestodene 0.75 mg daily. Patients were
treated for 12 months with assessments of pain, quality of life,
and measurement of bone mineral density. In contrast to our study,
Zupi et al. found that patients treated with GnRH agonist with or
without hormonal add-back had better relief of dysmenorrhea,
dyspareunia, and pelvic pain at 6 and 12 months of treatment and
at 6-month follow-up than those on OCs. The GnRH agonist groups,
however, showed increased bone loss compared with the OC group.
One reason for the different results in this study may be different
assessments of pelvic pain (a visual analog scale versus two
measures—the often used B&B scale and the validated NRS scale
in this trial). The varying conclusions of our study and that of
Zupi et al. point to the importance of conducting confirmatory
studies in different populations.
The strengths of this clinical trial include its study design
(randomized, double-blind prospective, multicenter) and the choice
of contemporary medical regimens currently in widespread clinical
use in the United States. It examined two well-characterized and
widely accepted pain assessments: the B&B patient ratings, the
most widely used pain score for assessing endometriosisassociated pelvic pain; and the NRS, a commonly used general
pain assessment. In addition, the two centers permitted diversity in
geography and in the types of practices from which patients were
recruited, allowing the potential for more generalizable conclusions.
The greatest weakness of the study is its limited sample size, a direct result of significant challenges in subject recruitment. Both sites
were unable to achieve patient accrual goals. In Rochester, it was anticipated that subjects would be recruited from university practices
and several affiliated practices. Recruitment, particularly among
the private groups, fell well short of expectations, largely because
of changes in practice patterns—patients with pelvic pain and symptoms of endometriosis were often treated empirically. In Boston, it
was anticipated that the majority of patients would come from the
practice of the co-PI (MDH), who maintains an extensive endometriosis referral practice. In the end, very few patients came from his
practice, largely because nearly all patients had already been treated
with a regimen similar to one of the treatment arms, and the great
majority of subjects were recruited from print and radio advertisements. The study was powered to recruit 188 subjects, 94 from
each site. In the end, only 47 patients, 28 from Boston and 19
from Rochester, entered the trial. As it turned out, the observed
reduction in pain scores was greater than assumed in the power
analysis, resulting in statistically significant declines in each group,
even with the smaller sample size. That said, we would have greater
confidence in the conclusions if the sample size were greater.
A second limitation was the high dropout rate. Of the 40 patients
enrolled at baseline, only 24 (60%) completed the trial. Reasons for
dropout varied but included lack of improvement in pain symptoms,
side effects, and a decision to proceed with alternative therapies such
as surgery. Recognizing potential bias from dropout, our linear
mixed model took account of all data at each monitoring visit across
time. Thus, we used all available data on each subject. That said, the
reduced number of subjects at the study’s end limited statistical
significance, particularly in the later weeks of treatment.
Finally, this trial did not use a placebo arm. Since FDA approval
of nafarelin in 1989 as the first GnRH agonist for the treatment of
endometriosis, the FDA has not required a placebo arm, allowing
equivalence with an approved drug as demonstration of efficacy. It
has long been accepted that use of a placebo in pelvic pain trials
is unethical, and for that reason a placebo arm was not used in
this trial.
In conclusion, this 48-week randomized prospective trial of a continuous OC pill versus a GnRH agonist plus progestin hormonal
add-back demonstrated roughly equal clinical and quality-of-life
outcomes. Given the lower cost and generally low side effects of
OCs, these data support the use of continuous OCs as first-line
therapy in the medical treatment of endometriosis-associated
pelvic pain.
