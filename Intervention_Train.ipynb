Beyth, MD, MS; Linda Quinn, MS; and C. Seth Landefeld, MD\\r\\nBackground: Warfarin is effective in the treatment and prevention of many venous thromboembolic disorders, but it often leads\\r\\nto bleeding.\\r\\nObjective: To develop a multicomponent program of management of warfarin therapy and to determine its effect on the frequency of warfarin-related major bleeding in older patients.\\r\\nDesign: Randomized, controlled trial.\\r\\nSetting: University hospital in Cleveland, Ohio.\\r\\nPatients: 325 patients 65 years of age or older who started\\r\\nwarfarin therapy during hospitalization.\\r\\nInterventions: Patients were stratified according to baseline risk\\r\\nfor major bleeding and were randomly assigned to receive the\\r\\nintervention (n 5 163) or usual care (n 5 162) by their primary\\r\\nphysicians for 6 months. The intervention consisted of patient\\r\\neducation about warfarin, training to increase patient participation,\\r\\nself-monitoring of prothrombin time, and guideline-based management of warfarin dosing.\\r\\nMeasurements: Major bleeding, death, recurrent venous thromboembolism, and therapeutic control of anticoagulant therapy at 6\\r\\nmonths.\\r\\nResults: In an intention-to-treat analysis, major bleeding was\\r\\nmore common at 6 months in the usual care group than in the\\r\\nintervention group (cumulative incidence, 12% vs. 5.6%; P 5\\r\\n0.0498, log-rank test). The most frequent site of major bleeding in\\r\\nboth groups was the gastrointestinal tract. Death and recurrent\\r\\nvenous thromboembolism occurred with similar frequency in both\\r\\ngroups at 6 months. Throughout 6 months, the proportion of total\\r\\ntreatment time during which the international normalized ratio\\r\\nwas within the therapeutic range was higher in the intervention\\r\\ngroup than in the usual care group (56% vs. 32%; P < 0.001).\\r\\nAfter 6 months, major bleeding occurred with similar frequencies\\r\\nin the intervention and usual care groups.\\r\\nConclusions: A multicomponent comprehensive program of\\r\\nwarfarin management reduced the frequency of major bleeding in\\r\\nolder patients. Although the generalizability and cost-effectiveness\\r\\nof this program remain to be demonstrated, these findings support\\r\\nthe premise that efforts to reduce the likelihood of major bleeding\\r\\nwill lead to safe and effective use of warfarin therapy in older\\r\\npatients.\\r\\nAnn Intern Med. 2000;133:687-695. www.annals.org\\r\\nFor author affiliations, current addresses, and contributions, see end of text.\\r\\nBleeding is the major side effect of warfarin and is a\\r\\nmajor deterrent to its use, especially in older patients.\\r\\nOlder people are widely thought to be at increased risk for\\r\\nwarfarin-related bleeding (1\\xe2\\x80\\x938), and they are less likely to\\r\\nbe treated with warfarin, even when it has been proven\\r\\nefficacious, in part because of concern about risk for bleeding (9\\xe2\\x80\\x9313). Efforts that reduce the frequency of major\\r\\nwarfarin-related bleeding not only will increase the net\\r\\nbenefit of therapy but also will facilitate more appropriate\\r\\nand widespread use of warfarin therapy in older patients.\\r\\nMethods for identifying patients at highest risk for bleeding have recently advanced (5\\xe2\\x80\\x937, 14\\xe2\\x80\\x9321), and experience\\r\\nwith specialized programs that coordinate the management\\r\\nof anticoagulant therapy suggests that clinical outcomes\\r\\nmay be improved (6, 14, 18, 22\\xe2\\x80\\x9327). However, there is\\r\\nlittle controlled or experimental evidence on how to optimize management of anticoagulant therapy in older patients and prevent bleeding.\\r\\nWe developed a multicomponent comprehensive program for management of warfarin therapy aimed at improving control of the anticoagulant effect and reducing\\r\\nevents (such as use of an interacting medicine) that might\\r\\nprecipitate bleeding. We hypothesized that this intervention would be acceptable to most elderly persons starting\\r\\nwarfarin therapy and would reduce the frequency of warfarin-related major bleeding.\\r\\nMETHODS\\r\\nPatients\\r\\nPatients hospitalized at University Hospitals of Cleveland, a 900-bed teaching hospital, between September\\r\\n1992 and October 1995 who were 65 years of age or older\\r\\nand were receiving 10 000 units or more of intravenous\\r\\nunfractionated heparin every 24 hours were screened daily.\\r\\nOf these patients, we identified 426 persons who were 65\\r\\nArticle\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa9 2000 American College of Physicians\\xe2\\x80\\x93American Society of Internal Medicine 687\\r\\nyears of age or older, who resided in Cuyahoga County,\\r\\nOhio, and for whom treatment with warfarin was planned\\r\\nfor 10 or more days (Figure 1). Patients were excluded if\\r\\nthey had been treated with warfarin at any time during the\\r\\nprevious 6 months, were admitted from a nursing home,\\r\\nwere enrolled in another clinical trial, were too ill to give\\r\\nconsent and had no available surrogate, were discharged\\r\\nprematurely, or did not speak English; if their private physician refused to participate; or if no random allocation was\\r\\ntaking place (for example, during vacations or holidays).\\r\\nEligible patients who were enrolled did not differ significantly from those who were not enrolled with regard to\\r\\nage, ethnicity, sex, or indication for therapy.\\r\\nPatients were stratified according to their baseline risk\\r\\nfor major bleeding by using the Outpatient Bleeding Risk\\r\\nIndex (20). This index includes four independent risk factors for major bleeding: age 65 years or older, history of\\r\\ngastrointestinal bleeding, history of stroke, and one or\\r\\nmore of four specific comorbid conditions (recent myocardial infarction, hematocrit , 30%, creatinine concentration . 133 mmol/L [1.5 mg/dL], or diabetes mellitus). Patients with one or two risk factors were classified as\\r\\nintermediate risk, and those with three or more risk factors\\r\\nwere classified as high risk; estimated frequencies of major\\r\\nbleeding in 6 months were 6% and 35%, respectively.\\r\\nAfter stratification, patients were randomly assigned to\\r\\nreceive usual care or intervention. Informed consent for\\r\\nobservation and data collection was then sought from both\\r\\ngroups, and informed consent to participate in the intervention was sought from the intervention group. This\\r\\nmethod, initially proposed by Zelen (28), allows the study\\r\\nto test the effectiveness of offering the intervention rather\\r\\nthan simply the efficacy of the intervention in patients who\\r\\nconsent to participation before random assignment. The\\r\\nsample size was calculated to provide 80% power and an a\\r\\nlevel of 0.05. The study protocol and informed consent\\r\\nprocedures were approved by the hospital\\xe2\\x80\\x99s institutional\\r\\nreview board.\\r\\nIntervention\\r\\nThe intervention had two main components. The first\\r\\ncomponent consisted of a guideline-based consultation\\r\\nthat assessed the patient\\xe2\\x80\\x99s indications for therapy and potential risk factors for warfarin-related bleeding. We used\\r\\nthis method previously to reduce the frequency of anticoagulant-related bleeding during hospitalization (27). Specific recommendations about modifiable risk factors, such\\r\\nas use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, were made\\r\\nand implemented. The study investigators directed warfarin dosing and international normalized ratio (INR) testing\\r\\nafter hospital discharge. The second component included\\r\\npatient education, coaching, and self-monitoring of prothrombin time; this component was grounded in social\\r\\nlearning theory (29\\xe2\\x80\\x9331) and experimental evidence (32,\\r\\n33) showing that increasing participation of patients in\\r\\ntheir care can improve clinical outcomes but that increasing patient knowledge alone is insufficient (34, 35). Patient\\r\\neducation consisted of one-on-one teaching by a lay educator using a specifically formatted workbook for older\\r\\nadults to teach them about warfarin, indications for its use,\\r\\ndrug and food interactions, and the signs and symptoms of\\r\\nbleeding. The lay educator reviewed the workbook and was\\r\\ntaught how to use the prothrombin time monitor by one\\r\\nof the authors but had no formal medical training. Coaching was aimed to increase patients\\xe2\\x80\\x99 participation in their\\r\\ncare and to improve information-seeking skills. Patients\\r\\nwere trained and encouraged to communicate more effectively with physicians and other health personnel about a\\r\\nrange of issues, such as health concerns, drug interactions,\\r\\nFigure 1. Eligibility and random assignment of patients.\\r\\nArticle Prevention of Bleeding Complications in Older Patients Receiving Warfarin\\r\\n688 7 November 2000 Annals of Internal Medicine Volume 133 \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Number 9 www.annals.org\\r\\nor changes in lifestyle or diet. Finally, patients were taught\\r\\nto self-monitor the prothrombin time by using a home\\r\\nportable monitor (Coumatrak Protime Test System, Biotrack, Inc., Mountain View, California). The monitor uses\\r\\na fingerstick to obtain a blood sample and has well-established accuracy (36\\xe2\\x80\\x9338).\\r\\nPatients were initially assessed, educated, and taught to\\r\\nuse the portable monitor while hospitalized; training lasted\\r\\n30 minutes to 1 hour. They were seen daily while hospitalized, warfarin therapy was adjusted as needed, and any\\r\\nconcerns or questions about anticoagulant therapy were\\r\\naddressed. Within 3 days of discharge from the hospital,\\r\\nthe lay educator or study investigator made a home visit to\\r\\nassess patients\\xe2\\x80\\x99 use of the portable monitor and to check\\r\\nthe prothrombin time. In general, patients were instructed\\r\\nto check their prothrombin time three times during the\\r\\nfirst week after hospital discharge, weekly for the remainder\\r\\nof the first month, and monthly thereafter depending on\\r\\ntheir results. Patients phoned in their results to the coach,\\r\\nwho reviewed the results with one of the investigators and\\r\\nprovided same-day follow-up, including recommendations\\r\\nfor dose and subsequent INR testing. Patients were instructed to call whenever they had questions or concerns\\r\\nabout their warfarin management or possible side effects, if\\r\\nthey were hospitalized for any reason, or if they began\\r\\nreceiving new medications. After the 6-month intervention\\r\\nperiod, management and dosing of warfarin therapy reverted back to patients\\xe2\\x80\\x99 personal physicians.\\r\\nPatients assigned to usual care received medical care,\\r\\nincluding management, dosing, and medical information,\\r\\naccording to the discretion and practices of their personal\\r\\nphysician.\\r\\nData Collection\\r\\nTrained abstractors who were not involved with the\\r\\nintervention component of the study collected data from\\r\\nthe medical chart at the start of anticoagulant therapy; at\\r\\neach subsequent hospitalization; and by blinded interview\\r\\nat enrollment and 1, 3, and 6 months after enrollment and\\r\\nevery 6 months thereafter. Data elements included demographic characteristics, clinical history including comorbid\\r\\ndiagnoses, indications for therapy, potential risk factors for\\r\\nbleeding, functional status, and new illnesses or comorbid\\r\\nconditions that developed after enrollment. Surveillance\\r\\nfor bleeding and thromboembolism was conducted identically in the intervention and control groups and consisted\\r\\nof 12 items inquiring about bleeding and thromboembolism at each follow-up interview. Whenever an event was\\r\\nreported, the clinical characteristics of the bleeding or\\r\\nthromboembolic episode were determined by review of the\\r\\nrelevant medical record and abstracted without identifying\\r\\npatient information onto a standard form. All dates of\\r\\ndeath were confirmed by death certificates, and all causes\\r\\nof death were confirmed by review of death certificates and\\r\\nmedical records. Follow-up was complete for all patients.\\r\\nEnd Points\\r\\nThe primary end point was the first major bleeding\\r\\nevent during the 6-month intervention period. Using explicit criteria in the Bleeding Severity Index (39) for the\\r\\namount, rate, and consequences of bleeding, we defined\\r\\nmajor bleeding as overt bleeding that led to the loss of at\\r\\nleast 2.0 units of blood in 7 days or less or was otherwise\\r\\nlife-threatening (for example, intracranial bleeding). Bleeding was classified without information about possible risk\\r\\nfactors or randomization status. Two author-reviewers who\\r\\nwere blinded to group assignment adjudicated bleeding\\r\\nevents; their agreement was high (k statistic, 0.97).\\r\\nSecondary outcomes were death and recurrent venous\\r\\nthromboembolism at 6 months; major bleeding after 6\\r\\nmonths; and control of anticoagulant therapy during the\\r\\nfirst 6 months of therapy, as measured by the INR. The\\r\\ntherapeutic range of the INR was defined as 2.5 to 3.5 for\\r\\npersons with mechanical heart valves and 2.0 to 3.0 for\\r\\npersons with all other indications (40). Therapeutic quality\\r\\ncontrol was assessed by using the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpatient-time\\xe2\\x80\\x9d approach,\\r\\ndescribed by Rosendaal and colleagues (41), for three time\\r\\nperiods after discharge from the hospital: 0 to 1 month, 1\\r\\nto 3 months, and 3 to 6 months of therapy. This approach\\r\\nestimates the amount of time a patient is in the therapeutic\\r\\nrange based on the actual INRs measured, assuming a linear relationship between consecutive INRs. Patients with\\r\\nonly one INR measurement during the time period and\\r\\nthose not discharged with continued warfarin therapy were\\r\\nexcluded from the analyses.\\r\\nStatistical Analysis\\r\\nStatistical analyses of all outcomes were performed on\\r\\nan intention-to-treat basis. The rate of major bleeding during the 6-month intervention was determined. The rates of\\r\\nmajor bleeding during hospitalization and at 1 month and\\r\\nPrevention of Bleeding Complications in Older Patients Receiving Warfarin Article\\r\\nwww.annals.org 7 November 2000 Annals of Internal Medicine Volume 133 \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Number 9 689\\r\\n6 months after discharge were also ascertained. Control of\\r\\ntherapy and other secondary outcomes were evaluated.\\r\\nDifferences between groups were evaluated by using\\r\\nthe chi-square statistic for categorical variables, the Wilcoxon rank-sum statistic for continuous variables, and the\\r\\nlog-rank test for survival curves.

Fifty-seven percent of patients were women,\\r\\nand 67% were white. The primary indication for warfarin\\r\\ntherapy was venous thromboembolism in 38% of patients,\\r\\natrial fibrillation in 17%, cerebrovascular disease in 15%,\\r\\nheart prosthesis in 11%, and other indications in 19%.\\r\\nThe baseline risk for bleeding was classified as intermediate\\r\\nin 85% of patients and high in 15%. At enrollment, the\\r\\nintervention group and the usual care group did not differ\\r\\nin clinical or sociodemographic variables (Table 1).\\r\\nAmong the 163 patients randomly assigned to the intervention group, 132 (81%) participated in the intervention. Of the 163 patients, 46 patients (28%) monitored\\r\\ntheir prothrombin time themselves; 50 (31%) had a\\r\\nspouse, other relative, or visiting nurse help with their prothrombin time monitoring; and 36 (22%) were monitored\\r\\nconventionally without self-monitoring (20 had physical\\r\\nlimitations, such as severe arthritis or decreased vision; 12\\r\\nfelt more comfortable with venipuncture; 3 stopped warfarin therapy during the index hospitalization; and 1 was\\r\\ndischarged to a nursing home that precluded use of the\\r\\nportable monitor). Thirty-one patients (19%) declined to\\r\\nparticipate in the intervention; their anticoagulant therapy\\r\\nwas managed by their personal physician.\\r\\nThe cumulative incidences of major bleeding at 1, 3,\\r\\nand 6 months were 4.6%, 4.6%, and 5.6%, respectively, in\\r\\nthe intervention group and 7%, 12%, and 12%, in the\\r\\nusual care group (P 5 0.0498, log-rank test) (Figure 2).\\r\\nThe most common site of bleeding during the 6 months\\r\\nwas the gastrointestinal tract in both groups (Table 2).\\r\\nMajor bleeding was fatal in one patient in the intervention\\r\\nTable 1.

Excessive\\r\\nanticoagulation and a recent history of an invasive procedure or surgery at the time of major bleeding were more\\r\\ncommon among patients in the usual care group than\\r\\namong those in the intervention group (Table 2). Of the\\r\\neight major bleeding events that occurred in the intervention group, six occurred in patients who had declined the\\r\\nintervention, including the one patient with fatal gastrointestinal bleeding and two patients with intracranial bleeding.\\r\\nAlmost half (12 of 25) of the major bleeding events\\r\\noccurred during the index hospitalization; of these, 3 occurred in the intervention group and 9 occurred in the\\r\\nusual care group (P 5 0.08). The respective cumulative\\r\\nincidences of major bleeding were 2.7% and 2.2% at 1\\r\\nmonth after discharge and 3.7% and 6.5% at 6 months\\r\\nafter discharge among patients who survived to discharge\\r\\n(P . 0.2 by log-rank technique). After 6 months, major\\r\\nbleeding occurred in 2 patients in the intervention group\\r\\nand 3 patients in the usual care group (P . 0.2).\\r\\nA total of 4091 INR measurements were taken during\\r\\n26 065 patient-days of follow-up; the median number of\\r\\ndeterminations per patient was 17 (range, 2 to 39) in the\\r\\nintervention group and 10.5 (range, 2 to 44) in the usual\\r\\ncare group. Patients in the intervention group were within\\r\\nthe therapeutic range at each of the three time periods\\r\\nsignificantly more often than were patients who received\\r\\nusual care (proportion of total treatment time with INR in\\r\\nthe therapeutic range, 56% vs. 32%; P , 0.001) (Table 3).\\r\\nAt 6 months, 21 patients (13%) in the intervention\\r\\ngroup and 26 patients (16%) in the usual care group (P .\\r\\n0.2) had died. The difference in the death rates between\\r\\nthe groups was 0.011 death per patient-month (95% CI,\\r\\n20.01 to 0.03). Recurrent venous thromboembolism at 6\\r\\nmonths occurred in 14 patients (8.6%) in the intervention\\r\\ngroup and 21 patients (13%) in the usual care group (P 5\\r\\n0.2). The difference in recurrence rates between the two\\r\\ngroups was 0.013 recurrence per patient-month (CI,\\r\\n20.005 to 0.031).\\r\\nDISCUSSION\\r\\nWe found that a comprehensive program of anticoagulant management reduced the frequency of major bleeding in older patients randomly assigned to be offered the\\r\\nintervention at the start of long-term anticoagulant therapy\\r\\nin the hospital. The intervention was acceptable to most\\r\\nolder patients to whom it was offered, did not require\\r\\nextensive training, and could be implemented in a manner\\r\\nsimilar to the use of a home glucometer. The greatest difference between the intervention and usual care groups in\\r\\nthe frequency of major bleeding occurred during the first\\r\\nweek (when anticoagulant therapy was started in the hospital) and after the first month of therapy (when outpatient\\r\\ntherapy was presumably stabilized). The groups differed\\r\\nlittle during the second through fourth weeks of therapy,\\r\\nwhen patients were generally discharged and warfarin was\\r\\nfirst monitored in the outpatient setting.\\r\\nThe improvements in patient outcomes were accompanied by substantial and consistent differences between\\r\\nthe intervention and usual care groups in control of the\\r\\nanticoagulant effect. For patients in the intervention\\r\\ngroup, the INR was in the therapeutic range more than\\r\\nhalf the time\\xe2\\x80\\x94nearly twice as much of the time as that in\\r\\nthe usual care group. In the usual care group, the INR was\\r\\nsupratherapeutic more than one third of the time during\\r\\nthe first month of outpatient therapy and was subtherapeutic most of the time thereafter.\\r\\nVarious approaches to the comprehensive management of long-term anticoagulant therapy have been described (6, 14, 18, 22\\xe2\\x80\\x9326), but their effects on the process\\r\\nand outcomes of care have not been evaluated. Patient\\r\\neducation and self-management of anticoagulant therapy\\r\\ncan improve anticoagulant control in carefully selected\\r\\nFigure 2.

Other advances that may improve\\r\\nmanagement of anticoagulant therapy include use of lowerintensity therapy for venous thrombosis (43) and in the\\r\\nsetting of prosthetic valves (44), identification of risk factors for bleeding and risk stratification of patients (2, 6, 7,\\r\\n14, 15, 18, 20, 21), use of INR as a measure of anticoagulant effect (45, 46), and portable prothrombin time monitors (42, 47-50). We previously evaluated the efficacy of\\r\\nconsultation on the frequency of in-hospital bleeding in\\r\\npatients treated with heparin or warfarin and demonstrated\\r\\na reduction in this event from 31% to 13% (27).

Thus, it has been unclear whether lower rates\\r\\nof bleeding could be achieved in practice. In this study, the\\r\\nsample was assembled with few exclusion criteria and consisted of a heterogeneous group of older persons; the bleeding rates in the usual care group were similar to those in\\r\\nprevious observational studies. The comprehensive intervention achieved a frequency of major bleeding in participating patients that was similar to the lower rates achieved\\r\\nin previous randomized trials of the efficacy of warfarin.\\r\\nSeveral methodologic considerations support the validity of our major findings. The experimental study design,\\r\\nrandom assignment of patient, and intention-to-treat analysis make it unlikely that our findings are attributable to\\r\\nunrecognized confounding or selection bias. Although data\\r\\ncollection could not be blinded to group assignment, measurement bias was minimized by systematic surveillance of\\r\\nthe intervention and control groups, use of an explicit and\\r\\nhighly reliable method for classifying the major outcomes,\\r\\nand blinding to group assignment of outcome classification. The conclusion that the intervention was beneficial is\\r\\nfurther supported by the consistency of the intervention\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\napparent effects on bleeding, recurrent thromboembolism,\\r\\nand INR control.\\r\\nThe study was not designed to determine the relative\\r\\nimportance of the components of the intervention. Thus,\\r\\nwe cannot determine how much of the improved INR\\r\\ncontrol and lower bleeding rate are attributable to patient\\r\\neducation, patient participation, or expert guidance of warfarin monitoring and dosing. Our study also did not determine why some patients declined to participate in the\\r\\nintervention program; these patients, one quarter of whom\\r\\ndeveloped major anticoagulant-related bleeding, may benefit greatly from efforts to understand and reduce their\\r\\nrisks for bleeding. A formal cost analysis is beyond the\\r\\nscope of this study. We estimate the cost of self-monitoring\\r\\nfor 6 months to be $1385 ($1295 for a monitor plus $90\\r\\nfor 6 months of supplies). Finally, we studied hospitalized\\r\\nolder patients starting long-term anticoagulant therapy.\\r\\nThe benefit of the intervention has not been demonstrated\\r\\nin other patients, such as outpatients starting anticoagulant\\r\\ntherapy, and the intervention would probably have less\\r\\nincremental benefit in settings in which usual care achieves\\r\\nthe high rates of INR control achieved by the intervention.\\r\\nA comprehensive program of anticoagulant management should be considered in typical clinical settings; the\\r\\nrate of major bleeding may be cut by half or more over 6\\r\\nmonths, and the rate of death or recurrent thromboembolism may be reduced by one quarter. Extending such an\\r\\nintervention to other settings may promote appropriately\\r\\nmore widespread use of warfarin to prevent stroke and\\r\\nother serious thromboembolism in older patients who may\\r\\nnow go untreated (9\\xe2\\x80\\x9312, 58\\xe2\\x80\\x9360).\\r\\nFrom Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, University\\r\\nHospitals of Cleveland, and Cleveland Veterans Affairs Medical Center,\\r\\nCleveland, Ohio.\\r\\nTable 3.

The aim of this study was to compare the quality of self-managed oral anticoagulant therapy with conventional\\r\\nmanagement.\\r\\nMethods: This was a pragmatic, open-label, randomized, controlled trial where 100 patients receiving long-term oral anticoagulant therapy\\r\\nreferred to a Danish clinic for self-management was randomized to either self-management of oral anticoagulant therapy (including a\\r\\nteaching program of self-management followed by 6 months of self-management) or 6 months of conventional management. The primary\\r\\nendpoint was an intention-to-treat analysis of a composite score combining the variance (median square of the standard deviation) of the\\r\\nInternational Normalized Ratio (INR) value (using a blinded control sample analyzed monthly by a reference laboratory), death, major\\r\\ncomplications, or discontinuation from the study. Secondary endpoints \\xe2\\x80\\x93 assessed in per-protocol analyses \\xe2\\x80\\x93 were the variance of the INR\\r\\nvalue (using the blinded control sample) and time within therapeutic INR target range using the standard INR values from the coagulometer\\r\\nand laboratory measurement.\\r\\nResults: There was no significant difference in the primary endpoint between the self-management and conventional management groups\\r\\n(composite score 0.16 vs. 0.24, respectively, p = 0.09). Self-management was significantly better (0.16 vs. 0.24, p = 0.003) with regard to the\\r\\nvariance in a per-protocol analysis. The difference in time within therapeutic INR target range was not significantly better (78.7% vs. 68.9%,\\r\\np = 0.14) using self-management.\\r\\nConclusion: The quality of self-management of oral anticoagulant therapy is at least as good as that provided by conventional management.\\r\\nD 2006 European Federation of Internal Medicine.

Introduction\\r\\nOral anticoagulation therapy with coumarin is prescribed\\r\\nas prevention and treatment to patients who have an\\r\\nincreased risk of thromboembolism [1]. Since oral anticoagulation therapy increases the risk of bleeding, the\\r\\ntherapy requires a balance between the risks of these two\\r\\noutcomes.\\r\\nOral anticoagulation therapy is conventionally monitored\\r\\nby laboratory analysis of the International Normalized Ratio\\r\\n(INR) on plasma obtained by venipuncture. Based on the\\r\\nINR value, health care providers determine the appropriate\\r\\ndosage of coumarin.\\r\\nDespite close monitoring of therapy, thromboembolism\\r\\nand bleeding are common worries and account for a large\\r\\nproportion of the morbidity and mortality in these patients.\\r\\nVariable oral anticoagulation therapy is the most important\\r\\n0953-6205/$ - see front matter D 2006 European Federation of Internal Medicine.

Low quality of oral anticoagulation therapy has also\\r\\nbeen shown in other groups of patients [4].\\r\\nOptimized oral anticoagulation therapy is thus likely to\\r\\nimprove the quality of treatment [5,6]. A potential avenue of\\r\\nimprovement is patient self-management, in which patients\\r\\nanalyze a drop of blood in a portable coagulometer (INRmonitor) to decide on coumarin dosage. To date, nine\\r\\nrandomized controlled trials of patient self-management\\r\\nhave been conducted [3,7 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 14], three of which reported a\\r\\nstatistically significant difference in favor of patient selfmanagement. The studies have primarily used surrogate\\r\\noutcomes, such as time within therapeutic INR target range,\\r\\nwhich is highly dependent on the frequency of testing, the\\r\\ntherapeutic INR target range, and the method of calculation.\\r\\nFurthermore, it has recently been shown that time within\\r\\ntherapeutic INR target range does not correlate well with the\\r\\nfrequency of complications [13].\\r\\nAnother measure of the treatment quality is the variability of the INR. Large variability is associated with an\\r\\nincreased risk of complications [2,15,16].\\r\\nOften, the laboratory INR is compared to that measured\\r\\nby the coagulometer. Yet, using two different methods of\\r\\nmeasurement is misleading since the INR-result of the two\\r\\nmethods deviate and the estimated deviation is, therefore,\\r\\nuninformative [17]. External INR control samples using the\\r\\nsame method of estimating the INR with the same frequency\\r\\nof testing should, therefore, be used when comparing\\r\\ndifferent types of management.\\r\\nIn general, limitations of sample size, questionable\\r\\nmeasurement standardization, inappropriate control selection, randomization procedure, etc. make the interpretation of the existing reports of patient self-management\\r\\ndifficult.\\r\\nGiven conflicting evidence from previous trials, we\\r\\nwished to re-evaluate self-management for oral anticoagulation therapy. We hypothesized that self-management\\r\\nyields a better quality of treatment than the conventional\\r\\nmanagement in eligible patients, and the aim of this study\\r\\nwas to compare the quality of self-management with\\r\\nconventional management in a randomized, controlled\\r\\ntrial.\\r\\n2. Materials and methods\\r\\n2.1. Study population\\r\\nOut of approximately 3 million inhabitants in western\\r\\nDenmark, an estimated 18,000 persons were prescribed oral\\r\\nanticoagulation therapy during the period from June 2002 to\\r\\nAugust 2003. Patients were potentially eligible for this study\\r\\nif they were referred for patient self-management by a\\r\\ngeneral practitioner or hospital department to the Center of\\r\\nSelf-Managed Oral Anticoagulation, Skejby Sygehus, Aarhus University Hospital. Inclusion criteria were: on oral\\r\\nanticoagulation therapy for at least 8 months, age more than\\r\\n18 years, and willingness to be randomized. Exclusion\\r\\ncriteria were previous use of patient self-management and\\r\\nresidence/travel abroad.\\r\\nEligible and willing patients were evaluated for their\\r\\nability to conduct patient self-management. The evaluation\\r\\nhad four dimensions: physical health, mental suitability,\\r\\ninterest in oral anticoagulation therapy, and expected level\\r\\nof compliance with patient self-management. All of the\\r\\nevaluations were performed and recorded with the patient\\r\\npresent.\\r\\nThe protocol for the study complied with the Helsinki II\\r\\ndeclaration and was approved by the local scientific ethics\\r\\ncommittee and The Danish Data Protection Agency. The\\r\\npatients were included after having given oral and written\\r\\nconsent. The study was conducted according to good\\r\\nclinical practice (GCP) standards and was monitored and\\r\\napproved by the GCP-unit, Aarhus University Hospital,\\r\\nAarhus, Denmark.\\r\\n2.2. Study design\\r\\nThis was a pragmatic, open-label, randomized, controlled\\r\\ntrial. Patients who were judged to be qualified for patient\\r\\nself-management were randomly assigned to patient selfmanagement or conventional management using a computerized, prospective, randomization schedule. Randomization\\r\\nin blocks with various sizes in numbers of 2, 4, and 6\\r\\nwithout blinding of allocation was used.\\r\\nThe training for patient self-management is shown\\r\\nschematically in Fig. 1. First, the patient practiced analyzing\\r\\nblood specimens. The patient then gradually assumed\\r\\nmanagement of the oral anticoagulation therapy, initially\\r\\nby suggesting the anticoagulant therapy dosage and\\r\\nsubsequently by taking over the dosage adjustment followed\\r\\nby monitoring. After 27 weeks the patient were required to\\r\\ndisplay their skills in an exam. If this test was passed, the\\r\\npatient was labeled self-managing. To resolve problems,\\r\\npatients were instructed to contact the Center of SelfManaged Oral Anticoagulation.\\r\\nSelf-management patients reported their INR values and\\r\\ncoumarin doses to the training center every 3rd month. The\\r\\nperformance of each patient\\xe2\\x80\\x99s coagulometer was controlled\\r\\nby the patient approximately every 11th month and by the\\r\\nDepartment of Clinical Biochemistry, Skejby Sygehus,\\r\\nAarhus University Hospital every 9th month.\\r\\nIn the conventional management group, the physician or\\r\\nhospital that had managed the patient\\xe2\\x80\\x99s oral anticoagulation\\r\\ntherapy before the patient was enrolled in the study\\r\\ncontinued their conventional management for the 6 months\\r\\nafter enrollment. After these 6 months, these patients began\\r\\ntraining in patient self-management, and the patient completed participation in the study when she/he had passed the\\r\\npatient self-management exam.\\r\\nT.D. Christensen et al. / European Journal of Internal Medicine 17 (2006) 260 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 266 261\\r\\n2.3. Observation period\\r\\nThe analysis focused on three time periods:\\r\\n1) 8\\xe2\\x80\\x93 12 months before randomization\\r\\n2) Primary observation period (6 months of either patient\\r\\nself-management or conventional management)\\r\\n3) Patient self-management training (27 weeks)\\r\\nThere was a 6-month primary observation period; for the\\r\\npatient self-management subjects, this began immediately\\r\\nafter successful completion of the patient self-management\\r\\nexam. For the conventional management subjects, it began\\r\\nimmediately after randomization.\\r\\n2.4. INR-analysis methods and INR values\\r\\nPatients in the patient self-management group used the\\r\\nCoaguChek\\\\ S coagulometer (Roche Diagnostics, Switzerland) equipped with CoaguChek\\\\ PT-test strips. A finger\\r\\npuncture device (Softclix\\\\) was used to release a drop (10 \\xe2\\x80\\x93\\r\\n25 Al) of capillary whole blood, which was applied to the\\r\\ntest strip and inserted into the coagulometer. The INR value\\r\\nwas displayed after 1\\xe2\\x80\\x93 2 min and recorded by the patient on\\r\\na dedicated data sheet. INR was measured on the\\r\\ncoagulometer once a week and these results were used by\\r\\nthe patient to adjust the coumarin dosage.\\r\\nPatients in the conventional management group continued their pre-randomization routine consisting of at least\\r\\nmonthly blood sampling either at the hospital laboratory\\r\\nnearest the patient\\xe2\\x80\\x99s home or with a coagulometer at a\\r\\nphysician\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office. These results were used to adjust the\\r\\ncoumarin dosage.\\r\\nIn both groups, an additional (control) blood sample was\\r\\ntaken once a month from each patient. This sample was sent\\r\\nthe same day for INR analyses to the Department of Clinical\\r\\nBiochemistry, Skejby Sygehus, Aarhus University Hospital.\\r\\nA Behring Coagulation Timer (Behring Werke AG, Marburg, Germany) was used with Nycotest\\\\ PT thromboplastin (Axis-Shield PoC AS, Oslo, Norway) with an ISI-value\\r\\nfrom 1.02 to 1.06.\\r\\nThe result of these INR analyses was blinded for all\\r\\nexcept for one secretary who would ensure the safety of the\\r\\npatient by contacting the managing physician if the INR\\r\\nvalue was below 1.5 or above 4.5.\\r\\nIf the patient temporarily stopped oral anticoagulation\\r\\ntherapy or reduced the dose (e.g., because of surgery), the\\r\\nINR values were excluded from that time until 10 days after\\r\\nre-initiation of full oral anticoagulation therapy.\\r\\nCoumarin dose was expressed as mg/day. Warfarin\\r\\n(Marevan\\\\) or phenprocoumon (Marcoumar\\\\) was used\\r\\nas coumarin.\\r\\n2.5. Endpoint and statistical analysis\\r\\nMajor complications were defined as thromboembolism\\r\\nand bleeding events requiring intervention. Death, major\\r\\ncomplications, and/or discontinuation of the study were\\r\\nreported to the investigator either by the patient or by the\\r\\nmanaging physician and were verified by medical records.\\r\\nThe primary endpoint of the trial was a composite\\r\\nconsisting of the variance (median square of the standard\\r\\ndeviation) of the INR value from the monthly control\\r\\nsample plus \\xe2\\x80\\x98\\xe2\\x80\\x98penalty points\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x99 for death, major complication,\\r\\nor study discontinuation. For deaths, major complications,\\r\\nand discontinuation, the points were set in the protocol to\\r\\n1000, 100, and 10, respectively. This was done during the\\r\\ntraining phase (27 weeks) and the 6-month primary\\r\\nobservation period. If a patient randomized to conventional\\r\\nmanagement dropped out during the training for patient selfmanagement (after the primary observation period), his/her\\r\\nvariance was added to the patient self-management group.\\r\\nThus, these dropouts negatively affected the result of the\\r\\npatient self-management group.\\r\\nWeek number 0 3 6 9 12 15 18 21 24 27 30 33 36 39 42 45 48 51\\r\\nHospital INR Weekly Every 3rd week Every 4th week None\\r\\nCoaguChek\\xc2\\xae INR Daily Weekly\\r\\nAnticipated skills Training Dose adjustment with\\r\\napproval first\\r\\nDose adjustment with\\r\\npost-hoc supervision Self-management and report\\r\\nTeaching lesson X X X X\\r\\nExam X\\r\\nSelf control of the\\r\\ncoagulometer X\\r\\nX External control of\\r\\nthe coagulometer\\r\\nFig. 1. Self-management of oral anticoagulant therapy training program. The patient starts with 3 weeks of daily INR measurements on the CoaguChek\\\\\\r\\ncoagulometer and by weekly hospital INR measurements. After these 3 weeks of daily training, INR measurements are made weekly and hospital INR\\r\\nmeasurements are obtained every 3rd or 4th week for another 24 weeks. In this 24-week period, co-responsibility for dosage adjustment is gradually transferred\\r\\nfrom physician to patient. Self-control analyses and external control of the CoaguChek\\\\ coagulometer are made every 11th month and by the laboratory at the\\r\\nDepartment of Clinical Biochemistry, Skejby Sygehus, Aarhus University Hospital every 9th month, respectively.\\r\\n262 T.D. Christensen et al. / European Journal of Internal Medicine 17 (2006) 260 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 266\\r\\nThe main secondary endpoint was the variance of the\\r\\nINR value in the control sample in a per-protocol analysis.\\r\\nFurthermore, time within therapeutic INR target range was\\r\\nestimated in the two trial arms using the coagulometer\\r\\nmeasurements in the patient self-management group and the\\r\\nlaboratory measurements in the conventional management\\r\\ngroup.\\r\\nIn the primary analysis, the data were analyzed by\\r\\nintention-to-treat, and the secondary analysis was perprotocol. The Mann \\xe2\\x80\\x93Whitney U-test was used to compare\\r\\ngroups, and the Wilcoxon W-test was used to compare\\r\\npaired data. We considered a p level below 0.05 (two-tailed)\\r\\nto be statistically significant.\\r\\nAs the variance of the INR values in our population was\\r\\nunknown, we estimated sample size using the time within\\r\\ntherapeutic INR target range, which was expected to be\\r\\napproximately 77% in the patient self-management group\\r\\nand 67% in the conventional management group with a\\r\\nstandard deviation of 15% [18]. In order to detect this\\r\\ndifference with a type I error of 0.05 and 80% power, 36\\r\\npatients were needed. Due to the short follow-up and an\\r\\nanticipated failure of some patients to complete patient selfmanagement training, 50 patients in each group were\\r\\nconsidered appropriate.\\r\\n3. Results\\r\\n3.1. Patients\\r\\nTwo hundred and forty patients were referred to the\\r\\nCenter of Self-Managed Oral Anticoagulation for patient\\r\\nself-management from 1 May 2002 to 6 August 2003, and\\r\\n100 patients were randomized. Baseline demographics in\\r\\nthe two treatment groups are displayed in Table 1. We\\r\\nexcluded 140 patients for the following reasons: not on oral\\r\\nanticoagulation therapy for at least 8 months (n = 77), age\\r\\nunder 18 years (n = 9), previous use of patient selfmanagement (n = 3), refusal to participate (n = 18), no\\r\\nresponse from the patient after referral (n = 5), residence/\\r\\ntravel abroad (n = 6), unqualified for patient self-management (n = 15; 13% of all the patients assessed), and other\\r\\nreasons (n = 7).\\r\\nIn the patient self-management arm, three patients\\r\\ndropped out: one during the training period (withdrawn\\r\\nby the treating physician), one patient during patient selfmanagement training, and one patient died during the\\r\\nprimary observation period. In the conventional management arm, one patient was withdrawn by the treating\\r\\nphysician in the primary observation period and four\\r\\npatients dropped out during patient self-management\\r\\ntraining. The two patients withdrawn by physicians were\\r\\nexcluded from the analysis. Thus, 98 patients were\\r\\nincluded in the primary endpoint analysis and 92 were\\r\\nincluded in the secondary endpoint analysis. Time within\\r\\ntherapeutic INR target range was estimated using data\\r\\nfrom 90 patients since 2 patients in the conventional\\r\\nmanagement group only had one INR sample taken.

Outcome\\r\\nAmong the 98 patients included in the primary\\r\\nanalysis, the median values of the composite endpoint\\r\\nin the patient self-management and conventional management groups were 0.16 and 0.24, respectively ( p = 0.09).\\r\\nAmong the 92 patients included in the secondary analysis,\\r\\nthe median values of the secondary endpoint in the patient\\r\\nself-management arm (n = 47) and conventional management arm (n = 45) were 0.16 and 0.24, respectively\\r\\n( p = 0.003).

Discussion\\r\\nUsing a composite endpoint in the intention-to-treat\\r\\nanalysis, we found the quality of oral anticoagulation\\r\\ntherapy using patient self-management to be comparable\\r\\nto conventional management. In the per-protocol analysis,\\r\\nthe difference favoring patient self-management was statistically significant.\\r\\nIn the conventional management group, a reduction in\\r\\nvariance of INR was observed when patients underwent\\r\\ntraining for patient self-management. In the patient selfmanagement group, a reduction in variance was found after\\r\\nthe shift from training to the period of patient selfmanagement (Table 4). The patients referred to our clinic\\r\\ncomprised a selected group with various indications for oral\\r\\nanticoagulation therapy. All patients were evaluated for\\r\\npatient self-management and only those deemed qualified\\r\\nwere then randomized. By enrolling only patients qualified\\r\\nfor patient self-management, we avoided mixing of the\\r\\neffects of patient qualification with those of the procedures\\r\\nunder study.\\r\\nThe ideal outcome in oral anticoagulation therapy studies\\r\\nis the incidence of major complications and mortality, but\\r\\nsuch studies require large numbers of patients and a long\\r\\nfollow-up. In this trial we used a composite endpoint\\r\\nconsisting of both surrogate and clinical outcomes. Owing\\r\\nto the serious drawbacks of time within therapeutic INR\\r\\ntarget range, we used the variance of the INR value as an\\r\\nindicator of the treatment quality and included a blinded\\r\\ncontrol sample. The frequency of sampling was equal in the\\r\\ntwo study arms, and the INR values in blood samples were\\r\\nobtained by the same laboratory at a short enough interval\\r\\n(< 24 h) to have no significant effect on the INR [19,20]. Of\\r\\nthe two studies with relatively large numbers of patients\\r\\n[3,13], only the study by Ko\\xc2\\xa8 rtke and Ko\\xc2\\xa8 rfer [3] was\\r\\npowered to detect a difference in the number of complications.

However, this study had several limitations,\\r\\nincluding important deviations to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines [21] and\\r\\nfailure to account for dropouts.\\r\\nMene\\xc2\\xb4ndez-Ja\\xc2\\xb4ndula et al. [13] recently reported a dropout\\r\\nrate of 21%, and the dropouts were not accounted for in the\\r\\nstatistical analysis. In our study, the dropout rate was\\r\\napproximately 5%. Including the dropout patients in the\\r\\nstatistical analysis helps avoid overestimation of the positive\\r\\neffect of patient self-management in the primary endpoint.\\r\\nOwing to the 27-week training period and to prospective\\r\\ninclusion of patients, there was a time gap regarding\\r\\nintervention. This might have resulted in frustration among\\r\\npatients randomized to conventional management since they\\r\\nhad been referred for patient self-management. This could\\r\\nhave lowered the quality of conventional management and\\r\\nearly dropout rate from that arm. We estimated that a 6-\\r\\nmonth follow-up period was the longest we could achieve\\r\\nwithout generating a reluctance of potential subjects to take\\r\\npart.\\r\\nThe patients in our study were specifically referred for\\r\\npatient self-management, indicating that they had been prescreened with respect to motivation for patient selfmanagement. We do not know what proportion these\\r\\npatients constitute of the typical oral anticoagulation therapy\\r\\npatient population.\\r\\nThe change in dose of warfarin in the patient selfmanagement group could have been due to chance, to\\r\\nimprecision of the coagulometer used, or to the fact that\\r\\npatients randomized to patient self-management aimed for a\\r\\nmore intense anticoagulation (i.e., a higher INR). This\\r\\nfinding calls for further investigation.\\r\\nThere are probably several reasons why a patient selfmanagement group performs at least as well as a group of\\r\\npatients under conventional management. The former group\\r\\nreceives more detailed information about oral anticoagulation therapy and the influence of diet, infectious diseases,\\r\\nalcohol, drug interactions, etc. on oral anticoagulation\\r\\ntherapy than is practically feasible for an average health\\r\\ncare provider. At this point, large, well-designed, randomized, controlled trials using clearly defined clinical endpoints are needed to thoroughly investigate patient selfmanagement.\\r\\nAcknowledgements\\r\\nThis study has been financially supported by grants from\\r\\nThe Danish Heart Foundation (grant no. 02-2-3-35-22017),\\r\\nSnedkermester Sophus Jacobsen og hustru Astrid Jacobsens\\r\\nFond, Fonden til L\\xc3\\xa6gevidenskabens Fremme (A.P.

To investigate if the weekly\\r\\nmeasurement and dosing of international normalized ratio (INR) at\\r\\nhome using the online Internet-based system was superior to conventional treatment, we performed a randomized, controlled trial.\\r\\nPatients and Methods: All 669 patients in our anticoagulation\\r\\nclinic were asked to participate in the trial, providing that they had\\r\\nInternet access and could use the CoaguChek XS system. A total of\\r\\n140 patients were included and randomized to (A) once weekly\\r\\nmeasurement and report online, (B) twice weekly measurement and\\r\\nreport online, and (C) continued conventional treatment with INR\\r\\nmeasurement in the lab every 4 weeks and dose adjustment by letter.\\r\\nResults: Group A had 79.7% (95% CI 79.0\\xe2\\x80\\x9380.3) of time in therapeutic range (TTR), group B 80.2% (95% CI 79.4\\xe2\\x80\\x9380.9) of TTR,\\r\\nand group C 72.7% (95% CI 71.9\\xe2\\x80\\x9373.4) TTR. Groups A and B\\r\\nperform statistically significantly better than the conventional group\\r\\nC, with a difference of TTR of 7% points (p < 2.2 \\xc2\\xb7 1016), whereas\\r\\nno difference was seen between A and B. Conclusion: Home measurement of INR and the reporting and dosing of results online once a\\r\\nweek increase TTR from 72% to 79% as compared to conventional\\r\\ncomputer-assisted monitoring in an anticoagulation clinic.\\r\\nKey words: telemedicine, INR, oral anticoagulation\\r\\nIntroduction\\r\\nT\\r\\nraditionally oral anticoagulation with warfarin or phenprocoumon has been monitored in patients visiting hospitalbased clinics on a monthly basis. Usually, the patient\\r\\npresents to an office or at a laboratory drawing center,\\r\\nwhere a venous blood sample is taken and transported to the laboratory for analysis. In the laboratory a prothrombin time is performed, and the result is expressed in international normalized ratio\\r\\n(INR) as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO), making\\r\\nthe result worldwide transferable and usable. After a variable length\\r\\nof time, in some hospitals within an hour and in others after a day, the\\r\\nresult is available to the patient\\xe2\\x80\\x99s physician. The physician reviews\\r\\nthe patients result and after consulting the patient\\xe2\\x80\\x99s medical record,\\r\\nwith information on present dose of drug, previous INR level, target\\r\\nfor INR, and therapeutic range according to diagnosis, determines a\\r\\nclinical course of action and/or drug dose adjustment. The patient is\\r\\ncontacted, usually by writing and in some cases by phone, and is\\r\\ngiven the instructions for drug intake and next date of measurement.1\\r\\nThis is traditionally managed in a paper record system.\\r\\nDue to an unacceptable frequency of adverse events caused by\\r\\nmistakes or failures in correct dosing or transfer of prescription doses\\r\\nto paper, many clinics in Denmark have started using electronic\\r\\nexpert systems or electronic patient record systems for the managing\\r\\nof these chronic patients.\\r\\nDue to the widening indications for oral anticoagulation especially\\r\\natrial fibrillation during the last 15 years and the increase in age of the\\r\\npopulation, the number of patients on anticoagulation has increased\\r\\nin Denmark from estimated 10,000 patients out of 5.5 mill population\\r\\nin treatment in 1993 to 90,000 in 2007.2 The current demand for oral\\r\\nanticoagulation therapy is expected to increase up to sixfold by 20503\\r\\nand this imposes a severe burden on the healthcare system.\\r\\nIn our local clinic the number of patients has increased from 250 to\\r\\naround 700. To cope with this burden we developed our AC anticoagulation computer system (CSO/AC; IntraMed A/S, V\\xc3\\xa6rl\\xc3\\xb8se,\\r\\nDenmark) to be accessible for the patients via the Internet.4 Figure 1\\r\\nshows the user interface, and Figure 2 shows the architecture of the\\r\\ninstallation. According to Danish law, this is only legal if security\\r\\nrules are followed, including controlling identity via both civil registration number and a digital signature system (OCES), administered\\r\\nby the Danish National IT and Telecom Agency.5\\r\\nFrom 2006 to 2008, we conducted pilot studies on the system\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nfunctionality and also performed a pilot study with 15 patients on\\r\\nself-testing on the CoaguChek S system (Roche Diagnostics A/S,\\r\\nHvidovre, Denmark), reporting the INR online to the CSO patient\\r\\nrecord system.\\r\\nThe reception of an INR measurement prompts an immediate demand for attention in the anticoagulation clinics computer screen. The\\r\\nattending doctor handles the patients within an hour, creating a letter of\\r\\nfuture dosage, accessible immediately on the patient\\xe2\\x80\\x99s own PC.\\r\\nBased on the patient experience with the functionality of the\\r\\nsystem and the convenience for the patients, saving time and\\r\\ntransport expenses, we decided to find out, whether the system would\\r\\nincrease quality of treatment, as measured by time in therapeutic\\r\\nrange (TTR).6\\r\\nDOI: 10.1089/tmj.2010.0128 \\xc2\\xaa MARY ANN LIEBERT, INC. . VOL. 17 NO. 3 . APRIL 2011 TELEMEDICINE and e-HEALTH 169\\r\\nMaterials and Methods\\r\\nSTUDY DESIGN\\r\\nA randomized, controlled trial (RCT) was carried out at the anticoagulation clinic in the Vejle County Hospital to test the hypothesis\\r\\nthat patient self-testing (PST) using an online access to the anticoagulation (AC) clinic might be superior to standard anticoagulation\\r\\ncontrol. All (669) patients in treatment at the AC clinic received a letter\\r\\nexplaining about the investigation and they were asked\\xe2\\x80\\x94provided they\\r\\nhad a computer, had Internet access, and were willing to measure with\\r\\nthe point-of-care test system at home\\xe2\\x80\\x94whether they would like to\\r\\nparticipate in this three-armed controlled trial. Those willing to participate, 140 patients, were randomized to one of three groups: group\\r\\nA, measuring INR at home once a week; group B, measuring INR twice\\r\\na week; and group C, continuing regular visits to the AC clinic for the\\r\\nnext year before being switched to the PST methodology.\\r\\nThis study was approved by the Science Ethics Committee in the\\r\\nRegion of Southern Denmark (Project-ID: S-20080053). The primary\\r\\noutcome, quality of anticoagulation treatment, TTR for the single\\r\\npatient depending on each patients own therapeutic range during the\\r\\nstudy period, was recorded according to the Rosendaal method.6\\r\\nSecondary outcomes were the number of INR measurements below\\r\\n1.5 or above 5.0. Numbers of adverse clinical events were recorded\\r\\nbut were too infrequent to be of value.\\r\\nSAMPLE SIZE AND STATISTIC ANALYSIS\\r\\nOur expectation was that the TTR would increase 10% based on\\r\\nprevious studies.7 Based on statistics for the conventional treatment,\\r\\nit was seen that during 300 days\\r\\nof observation for the single\\r\\npatient the range of days within\\r\\nTR was from 150 to 300 days, the\\r\\nestimated standard deviation\\r\\n(SD) then 30 days. As the mean\\r\\nwas 210 days and we wanted to\\r\\ndetect an increase of 30 days,\\r\\nwith a type 1 risk of 1% and a\\r\\npower to detect the difference of\\r\\n95%, 35 patients were needed in\\r\\neach group for at least 300 days.\\r\\nHence, 140 patients were randomized to the three groups.\\r\\nThe primary variable was TTR\\r\\nas measured with the Rosendaal\\r\\nmethod in each arm. The difference in TTR between groups A,\\r\\nB, and C was calculated using\\r\\nchi-squared test, t-tests, or the\\r\\nnonparametric equivalent where\\r\\nappropriate using the R-software\\r\\n(R Foundation for Statistical\\r\\nComputing, Vienna, Austria).\\r\\nEach patient in groups A, B,\\r\\nand C, respectively, was also\\r\\ncompared to the previous 12-month period if data were available, and\\r\\nstatistics performed with the paired sample Wilcoxon rank sum test.\\r\\nSTUDY POPULATION\\r\\nAll included patients were on lifelong therapy and been in treatment for at least 6 months. They were asked to participate on the\\r\\ncondition that they were willing to accept a randomization to a\\r\\ncontrol group continuing conventional care for the next 12 months.\\r\\nThe participants should be able to use the Internet and demonstrate\\r\\ntheir ability to use the CoaguChek XS system for measuring INR after\\r\\na 1-h teaching session. Patients were excluded from group A if they\\r\\nhad more than two intervals longer than 3 weeks without testing. In\\r\\ngroup B, patients excluded for having more than two intervals longer\\r\\nthan 2 weeks. In group C, patients were excluded for having more\\r\\nthan two intervals longer than 5 weeks. In all groups, patients were\\r\\nexcluded if they had a one period longer than 60 days without testing.\\r\\nRECRUITMENT\\r\\nAll participants received a letter asking them to participate and\\r\\nexplaining the design of the study. Patients responding were further\\r\\ninformed by the staff and evaluated for their ability to cope and\\r\\nparticipate in the investigation.\\r\\nEDUCATION AND TRAINING\\r\\nPatients in groups A and B were educated in using the computer interface and the CoaguChek XS point-of-care test system\\r\\nwithin *2 h. All patients in treatment at the clinic are aware of the\\r\\nFig. 1. User interface for the AC anticoagulation computer system.\\r\\nCHRISTENSEN ET AL.\\r\\n170 TELEMEDICINE and e-HEALTH APRIL 2011\\r\\ntheoretical aspects of anticoagulation, mechanism of action, meaning and importance of INR values and target ranges, diet and lifestyle,\\r\\nand symptoms of over-coagulation, drug interaction, and compliance. Group C was not trained beyond this education.\\r\\nThe patients\\xe2\\x80\\x99 ability to measure correctly was tested by comparing\\r\\nobtained values from the point-of-care instrument to the laboratory\\r\\nresult. Patients and the point-of-care instrument were accepted if\\r\\nable to measure within 0.5 INR of difference. One patient was unable\\r\\nto measure within 0.5 and was excluded before randomization.\\r\\nThe randomization program QuickCalcs (GraphPad Software, Inc.,\\r\\nLa Jolla, CA) generated a random allocation sequence and the patients were assigned to group A, B, or C accordingly. The trial was\\r\\nunblinded. The patients received a manual for online access and\\r\\nreporting of their INR and further on the communication system\\r\\nconnected to the reporting of the single INR measurement (e-mail\\r\\nsystem integrated in the EPJ-expert system). They entered the study\\r\\nimmediately after training consecutively over a period of 1 year\\r\\n(from April 22, 2008).\\r\\nMANAGEMENT OF PST PATIENTS\\r\\nGroup A measured once a week and group B twice a week and\\r\\nreported the single value, which was acted upon by the AC clinic by\\r\\nadjusting dose for the following period and reported via the system. If patients reported problems\\r\\nor asked questions on the parallel mail system, they\\r\\nwere answered by the AC staff or contacted via\\r\\ntelephone. The AC staff responded within 4 h to\\r\\nreported INR values. Patients not reporting their\\r\\nINR within the agreed time were alerted through\\r\\nmail by letter. Patients observing values below 1.5\\r\\nor above 5 were alerted by the system to contact the\\r\\nclinic immediately as was the rule for changes\\r\\nexceeding biological possible limits. The doctors,\\r\\nthree junior and two senior, in the clinic decided all\\r\\nchanges in medication in the same way for groups\\r\\nA, B, and C.\\r\\nEvery half-year the patients visited the clinic to\\r\\nmake a parallel measurement on their point-of-care\\r\\nsystem with the laboratory method. All fulfilled the\\r\\ndemand of maximum difference of 0.5 INR.\\r\\nTRADITIONAL MONITORING\\r\\nPatients randomized to group C visited the clinic\\r\\naccording to the usual rules of measurements being\\r\\nmaximum 4 weeks, but dependable on percentage\\r\\nchange in warfarin-dose with shorter time interval.\\r\\nINR analysis was performed on a STAGO STA-R\\r\\nEvolution (DIAGNOSTICA STAGO, Asnie`res sur\\r\\nSeine, France) dose adjustments were performed by\\r\\nthe attending doctor.

Twice a\\r\\nweek being considerable more expensive, the advantage is too inferior to be applied in daily practice.\\r\\nThe stability of INR values over a year was better for self-testing,\\r\\nthe SD of the single patient in the once a week group being 0.44 INR\\r\\nagainst the conventional control group 0.55 INR ( p < 0.045).\\r\\nIn the secondary outcome parameters, the number of INR measurements below 1.5 or above 5.0 showed no significant difference\\r\\nbetween groups A and B ( p \\xc2\\xbc 0.92), and both were significant better\\r\\nthan group C ( p < 2.0 \\xc2\\xb7 106\\r\\n).\\r\\nNo patients died during the trial. Only one patient was admitted to\\r\\nhospital during the trial. The reason for hospitalization was an INR over\\r\\n9, without bleeding. We believe that this remarkable finding is caused\\r\\nby the patients who chose to participate are younger and more engaged,\\r\\nknowledgeable, computer literate, and, in general, in better health.\\r\\nThe TTR of 80% is, to our knowledge, the highest published value\\r\\nin RCT until now. A recent article had a TTR with conventional versus\\r\\nPST of 59% and 74%, but with wide confidence intervals caused by a\\r\\nrelatively low number of 66 observation years for 132 patients, and\\r\\nwith measurement every 4.6 days.7 The Dabigatran study8 had only\\r\\n60% in TTR, using conventional management.\\r\\nThe absolute value of TTR is important as it is a marker for the risk\\r\\nof bleeding and thrombosis. A 10% difference in TTR thus corresponds to an increased risk of 1.29 for mortality, 1.10 for stroke, and\\r\\n1.12 for other thrombolic events.9\\r\\nWe observed the same mean INR in the three groups, meaning that\\r\\nthere was no tendency for the doctors to be more cautious in the\\r\\ncontrol group.\\r\\nComparing outcome parameters in the single patient in the period\\r\\n1 year before trial and during trial, the above observations from the\\r\\nRCT were reaffirmed, as the groups with once and twice weekly\\r\\nmeasurements improved (Table 5), whereas the control group showed\\r\\nno improvement. This demonstrated the absence of a Hawthorne or\\r\\nplacebo effect. This was true even though the frequency of testing\\r\\nincreased from every 21.3 days to every 15.3 days in the conventional control group. This can be explained by the doctors being more\\r\\ncareful, repeating measurements more than usual.\\r\\nA concern using point-of-care testing instruments is always that\\r\\nthe measurements have a bias or an increased analytical imprecision.\\r\\nFor the CoaguChek XS the analytical quality has been thoroughly\\r\\ndocumented,10\\xe2\\x80\\x9314 and our finding that patient SDs are smaller than\\r\\nduring conventional treatment emphasizes this. Thus, the analytical\\r\\nimprecision is unimportant in relation to patient variation.15,16\\r\\nA possible bias of the CoaguChek XS system was controlled by\\r\\nparallel measurements toward the Stago laboratory method and acceptable difference were seen (data not shown).\\r\\nTo monitor a possible drift in electronics during the trial period,\\r\\nthe average dose of warfarin before and during the RCT was calculated. As Table 6 shows no increase or decrease in average weekly\\r\\ndose was seen for the single patient or the groups, demonstrating that\\r\\nthe CoaguChek XS monitors were without clinical significant measurement bias.\\r\\nThe reduced SD for INR values during PST could be expected to\\r\\nreflect more frequent and finer adjustment of the INR dose. This is,\\r\\nhowever, not seen, as the SD of dose in mg/week did not change\\r\\nsignificantly though the PST; groups A and B showed lower values\\r\\nagainst group C\\xe2\\x80\\x99s increased values. We do believe, however, that the\\r\\nmore frequent testing enables smaller adjustments to keep INR in\\r\\ntherapeutic range. A larger study is needed to confirm this.\\r\\nWhen comparing patient self-management (PSM) (testing and\\r\\nself-dosing) against PST as in this article, it seems that quality of\\r\\nmanagement is better with PST, 79.7% of time in TR against 70.2%\\xe2\\x80\\x93\\r\\n74% for PSM.17\\xe2\\x80\\x9319\\r\\nAs PST is expensive in medical manpower as compared to PSM, we\\r\\nwill now randomize our 180 patients currently in PST to continue in\\r\\nPST or self-dosing via the expert computer system, to see if quality\\r\\ncan be maintained.\\r\\nIn conclusion, we believe that to have documented that managing\\r\\npatients anticoagulation by telemedicine and based on home measurement of INR is safe and possibly of a better quality as measured by\\r\\nTTR than patients\\xe2\\x80\\x99 self-management. Patient preference and satisfaction using this telemedical solution will be reported in a separate article.\\r\\nAcknowledgments\\r\\nThe authors would like to thank Biomedical Laboratory Scientist\\r\\nHanne Leth Laursen for teaching patients to measure INR and to\\r\\naccess the electronic patient journal and for registration of adverse\\r\\nTable 6.

We compared\\r\\nthis self-management of oral anticoagulant therapy with\\r\\nconventional management by a specialist anticoagulation clinic\\r\\nin a randomised cross-over study.\\r\\nMethods 50 patients on long-term oral anticoagulant\\r\\ntreatment were included in a randomised controlled crossover\\r\\nstudy. Patients were self-managed or were managed by the\\r\\nanticoagulation clinic for a period of 3 months. After this period\\r\\nthe alternative strategy was followed for each patient.\\r\\nProthrombin time (expressed as international normalised ratio\\r\\n[INR]) were measured at intervals of 1\\xe2\\x80\\x932 weeks in both periods\\r\\nwithout knowledge of type of management. The primary\\r\\nendpoint was the number of measurements within the\\r\\ntherapeutic range (therapeutic target value \\xc2\\xb150\\xc2\\xb75 INR units).\\r\\nFindings There was no significant difference in the overall\\r\\nquality of control of anticoagulation between the two study\\r\\nperiods. Patients were for 55% and for 49% of the treatment\\r\\nperiod within a range of \\x010\\xc2\\xb75 from the therapeutic target INR\\r\\nduring self-management and anticoagulation clinic\\r\\nmanagement, respectively (p=0\\xc2\\xb706). The proportion of patients\\r\\nwho spent most time in the therapeutic target range was larger\\r\\nduring self-management than during anticoagulation clinicguided management. The odds ratio for a better control of\\r\\nanticoagulation (defined as the period of time in the therapeutic\\r\\ntarget range) during self-management compared with\\r\\nanticoagulation clinic-guided management was 4\\xc2\\xb76 (95% CI\\r\\n2\\xc2\\xb71\\xe2\\x80\\x9310\\xc2\\xb72). A patient-satisfaction assessment showed\\r\\nsuperiority of self-management over conventional care.\\r\\nInterpretation Self-management of INR in the population in\\r\\nthis study is feasible and appears to result in control of\\r\\nanticoagulation that is at least equivalent to management by a\\r\\nspecialist anticoagulation clinic. It is also better appreciated by\\r\\npatients. Larger studies are required to assess the effect of this\\r\\nnovel management strategy on the incidence of\\r\\nthromboembolic or bleeding complications.\\r\\nLancet 2000; 356: 97\\xe2\\x80\\x93102\\r\\nIntroduction\\r\\nOral anticoagulant treatment with vitamin K antagonists,\\r\\nsuch as warfarin or coumarin derivatives, has been shown\\r\\nto be effective for the prevention and treatment of\\r\\nthromboembolic events in various clinical\\r\\ncircumstances.1,2 Some patients need to be treated with\\r\\nvitamin K antagonists for a long time, even life-long, such\\r\\nas patients with mechanical prosthetic heart valves or\\r\\npatients with recurrent venous thromboembolism due to\\r\\nfamilial thrombophilia. The biological effect of these\\r\\ncompounds\\xe2\\x80\\x94ie, inhibition of the synthesis of vitamin Kdependent coagulation factors\\xe2\\x80\\x94is extremely variable,\\r\\nboth interindividually and intraindividually. Factors\\r\\ninfluencing this variability include fluctuating\\r\\nbioavailability, inconstant dietary vitamin K intake,\\r\\nchanges in other drugs that the patient might be taking,\\r\\nand variable binding to plasma proteins.2,3 To prevent\\r\\nunder-treatment or overdosing, regular laboratory control\\r\\n(by means of the prothrombin time, expressed as and\\r\\nreferred to throughout this paper as international\\r\\nnormalised ratio [INR]) of the intensity of anticoagulation and dose-adjustments are necessary.4 This\\r\\nmanagement of oral anticoagulant therapy is often\\r\\nexecuted by hospital-based or specialised anticoagulation\\r\\nclinics, such as the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThrombosis Service\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in the\\r\\nNetherlands. Although this type of management is\\r\\nthought to be superior to less well-organised management\\r\\nof oral anticoagulation,5,6 and despite a strong\\r\\norganisation, laboratory quality control, and automated,\\r\\ncomputerised dose-adjustments, for many patients the\\r\\nintensity of anticoagulation does not fall within the\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9ctherapeutic target range\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for long periods.7\\xe2\\x80\\x9310 Besides, the\\r\\nvisits to the anticoagulation clinic are rather timeconsuming and, for some patients, inconvenient.\\r\\nEasy and reliable laboratory devices have become\\r\\navailable, which allow the measurement of the prothrombin\\r\\ntime (expressed as INR) from one drop of capillary whole\\r\\nblood.11\\xe2\\x80\\x9313 Application of these devices may allow patient\\r\\nself-testing of the intensity of anticoagulation and selfadjustment of the warfarin dose.14 Self-management of oral\\r\\nanticoagulant therapy may result in a more individualised\\r\\napproach, increased patient responsibility, and enhanced\\r\\ncompliance, which may lead to improvement in the\\r\\nregulation of anticoagulation. An additional advantage\\r\\ncould be that patients can do the test at home (saving travel\\r\\nand time during working hours) and are less dependent of\\r\\nthe anticoagulation clinic. A potential disadvantage of selfmanagement could be a poorer regulation of oral\\r\\nanticoagulant therapy, due to less professional guidance.\\r\\nAlso, self-management of oral coagulation may\\r\\ntheoretically be associated with increased anxiety of\\r\\npatients or even preoccupation with their disease.\\r\\nPrevious studies have shown the feasibility of selftesting and self-management of oral anticoagulation,15\\xe2\\x80\\x9319\\r\\nwhile two investigations showed the potential superiority\\r\\nof self-management over that of general practitioners.20,21\\r\\nOral anticoagulation self-management and management by a\\r\\nspecialist anticoagulation clinic: a randomised cross-over\\r\\ncomparison\\r\\nManon E Cromheecke, Marcel Levi, Louisa P Colly, Bas J M de Mol, Martin H Prins, Barbara A Hutten, Rachel Mak,\\r\\nKatinka C J Keyzers, Harry R B\\xc3\\xbcller\\r\\nDepartment of Cardiopulmonary Surgery (M E Cromheecke MD,\\r\\nB J M de Mol MD, R Mak BSc), Department of Vascular Medicine and\\r\\nDepartment of Internal Medicine (M Levi MD, H R B\\xc3\\xbcller MD,\\r\\nK C J Keyzers BSc), and Department of Clinical Epidemiology and\\r\\nBiostatistics (M H Prins MD, B A Hutten PhD), Academic Medical\\r\\nCentre, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands;\\r\\nAmsterdam Thrombosis Service (LPC), Amsterdam, Netherlands\\r\\n(L P Colly MD)\\r\\nCorrespondence to: Marcel Levi, Department of Vascular\\r\\nMedicine/Internal Medicine, Academic Medical Centre F-4,\\r\\nMeibergdreef 9, 1105 AZ Amsterdam, Netherlands\\r\\n(e-mail: m.m.levi@amc.uva.nl)\\r\\nFor personal use only.

The aim of the present study was to\\r\\ndirectly compare the quality of self-management of oral\\r\\nanticoagulation with conventional care by the Thrombosis\\r\\nService in the Netherlands in a randomised cross-over study.\\r\\nMethods\\r\\nStudy design\\r\\nThe study was approved by the Institutional Review Board\\r\\nof the Academic Medical Centre of the University of\\r\\nAmsterdam, the Netherlands.\\r\\nThe study was done in two phases. In the first phase a\\r\\ndirect comparison was made between self-measurement\\r\\nand self-dosing of vitamin K antagonists and\\r\\nanticoagulation-clinic-based management. The second\\r\\nphase of the study was done as a randomised cross-over\\r\\nstudy comparing self-management of oral anticoagulation\\r\\nwith anticoagulation-clinic management.\\r\\nIn the first phase 15 patients on chronic (more than 6\\r\\nmonths) anticoagulant therapy were educated and trained\\r\\nto measure their own INR and to adjust their dose of\\r\\nwarfarin. Patients measured their INR at home at weekly\\r\\nintervals during a 6 week period. On the basis of this INR\\r\\npatients devised their own dosing schedule for the next\\r\\nweek. Within 2 h they came to the anticoagulation clinic to\\r\\nhave their INR measured using blood obtained by\\r\\nvenipuncture. An experienced physician of the\\r\\nanticoagulation clinic then proposed a dosing scheme\\r\\nbased on the anticoagulation-clinic INR value, in most\\r\\ncases with a computerised dosing program. This part of\\r\\nthe study allowed us to establish the feasibility of selfmeasurement and self-dosing of anticoagulation by\\r\\npatients and the concordance between self-measured INR\\r\\nand clinic INR as well as between self-dosing of oral\\r\\nanticoagulation and physician-based dosing. The\\r\\nanticoagulation clinic INR and dosing scheme formed the\\r\\nbasis for patient management.\\r\\nIn the randomised cross-over comparison (second\\r\\nphase) 50 patients on chronic anticoagulant therapy with\\r\\noral agents were educated and trained to self-manage\\r\\nanticoagulation. Patients were then randomised (by sealed\\r\\nenvelopes) to either 3 months of anticoagulation\\r\\nmanagement by the specialised anticoagulation clinic\\r\\n(Thrombosis Service) or three months of self-management\\r\\nof anticoagulation. After 3 months, the alternative\\r\\nmanagement strategy was used. To be able to assess the\\r\\nquality of anticoagulation in both study periods, the INR\\r\\nwas measured at intervals of 1\\xe2\\x80\\x932 weeks in all patients in\\r\\nboth study periods by a central laboratory. These results\\r\\nwere not made available to patients or managing\\r\\nphysicians. The frequency of INR self-testing by patients\\r\\nduring the self-management period and the frequency of\\r\\nINR determination by the Thrombosis Service during the\\r\\nanticoagulation clinic period was not more often than once\\r\\nweekly and at least once in 2 weeks. The primary endpoint\\r\\nof the study was the number of measurements that were\\r\\nwithin 0\\xc2\\xb75 INR units from the therapeutic target INR\\r\\nduring each study period. Secondary endpoints included\\r\\nthe percentage of time in the target range during the study\\r\\nperiod, the number of patients who were in the therapeutic\\r\\ntarget range for 0\\xe2\\x80\\x93100% of the time during each period,\\r\\nand the number of patients who achieved a better control\\r\\nof anticoagulation during one of the two management\\r\\nstrategies.\\r\\nPatients\\r\\nConsecutive ambulant patients, seen at the outpatient\\r\\ndepartments of Cardiology and Internal Medicine of the\\r\\nAcademic Medical Centre, Amsterdam, who received\\r\\nlong-term anticoagulation and who were self-supporting\\r\\nwere eligible for the study. The most important\\r\\ndemographic and medical characteristics of the\\r\\nconsenting patients are given in table 1. Indications for\\r\\nanticoagulation were prosthetic heart valves, prevention of\\r\\narterial thrombosis (mostly in patients with atrial\\r\\nfibrillation), and secondary prevention of venous\\r\\nthromboembolism in patients with familial thrombophilia.\\r\\nEducation of patients\\r\\nAll patients underwent a structured educational\\r\\nprogramme to be able to do anticoagulation selfmanagement. This educational programme was adapted\\r\\nfrom previously published educational programmes.21,22\\r\\nBriefly, the program consisted of two 2 h sessions. In the\\r\\nfirst session a small group of patients (four to six per\\r\\ngroup) received structured and interactive teaching on the\\r\\nfunction of the coagulation system, and the principles and\\r\\nmonitoring of anticoagulant therapy. Instructions on selfmeasurement of the INR by means of a capillary finger\\r\\nstick and use of an automated device was given via a video\\r\\npresentation and live demonstration. Patients were then\\r\\ngiven the opportunity to measure their own INR (at least\\r\\nonce or as many times as they wished) in the presence of\\r\\nan instructor. In the 10 days between the first and the\\r\\nsecond session, patients had the opportunity to measure\\r\\ntheir INR in their own environment and to report their\\r\\nexperience in the second session. This second session was\\r\\nalso used to learn and practise how to devise a proper\\r\\noral-anticoagulant dosing scheme. For teaching purposes,\\r\\na standard dose-adaptation nomogram was used, but\\r\\npatients were encouraged to adjust and tailor this\\r\\nnomogram according to their individual experience. After\\r\\nconcluding the educational programme patients started\\r\\nself-management of anticoagulation. A 24 h help desk was\\r\\nset up to answer any questions or to assist with any\\r\\nproblem that might arise.\\r\\nMeasurement of INR\\r\\nVenous blood (9 vol) was collected in 3\\xc2\\xb72% sodium citrate\\r\\n(1 vol) and plasma was obtained by centrifugation at\\r\\n1800\\x01g for 20 min. The prothrombin time (PT) was\\r\\nmeasured in plasma by Tromborel-S reagent (Dade\\r\\nBehring, Leusden, Netherlands, ISI value 1.19) on a\\r\\nElekra 1600 coagulometer (MLA, Pleasantville, NY). PT\\r\\nvalues were expressed as an INR according to\\r\\ninternational convention. Self-measurement of INR was\\r\\ndone on capillary blood (obtained by a fingertip puncture,\\r\\nSoftclix lancet system) on a Coaguchek coagulometer\\r\\n(Roche Diagnostics, Almere, Netherlands), with\\r\\nCoaguchek PT teststrips (Roche Diagnostics).23,24\\r\\nSubjective quality of care assessment\\r\\nA self-perceived assessment of the quality of care was\\r\\nmade by patients using a structured questionnaire\\r\\ncontaining 32 items, which has been described\\r\\npreviously.21 This questionnaire measures patients\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\r\\nfeelings about oral anticoagulation, general treatment\\r\\ntopics, treatment satisfaction, self-efficacy, daily frictions\\r\\nand worries, and social issues. For each category a\\r\\nminimum of 1 point (total dissatisfaction) and a\\r\\nFor personal use only. Not to be reproduced without permission of The Lancet.\\r\\nwho were using phenprocoumon had a smaller variability\\r\\nin INR values than those who were using acenocoumarol,\\r\\nbut this difference did not reach significance. There was\\r\\nalso no relevant difference in the percentage of values\\r\\nwithin the therapeutic range between these two groups.\\r\\nA good agreement was observed between self-devised\\r\\nand anticoagulation-clinic-prescribed dosing schemes. A\\r\\ncomplete agreement in dosing scheme (total week\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dose\\r\\nof anticoagulant agent and division of this dose over the\\r\\ndays of the week) was seen in 68% of the cases. The mean\\r\\ndifference in self-proposed versus clinic-based dosing\\r\\nschemes (expressed as total week\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dose of oral\\r\\nanticoagulant agent) was 4% (SD 10). A difference of\\r\\n10% or more in dose between the self-devised scheme and\\r\\nthe clinic scheme was found in 13% and a difference of\\r\\n15% or more between the schemes was present in 2%.\\r\\nThere was no discrepancy concerning the dosing schemes\\r\\nin divergent directions (ie, patients proposing to take a\\r\\nhigher dose and clinic physicians proposing to take a\\r\\nlower dose) in any of the dosing schedules.\\r\\nComparison between self-management and thrombosis\\r\\nservice\\r\\nThe frequency of INR determination in the selfmanagement period was once every 8\\xc2\\xb76 days, compared\\r\\nwith a test frequency of once every 9\\xc2\\xb70 days in the\\r\\nThrombosis Service period.\\r\\nOf the 50 patients included in this phase of the trial,\\r\\none patient turned out to be unable to self-manage\\r\\nanticoagulation due to progressive visual impairment. All\\r\\nother patients were able to self-manage their\\r\\nanticoagulation during the study and the help-desk was\\r\\ninfrequently consulted (0\\xc2\\xb73 times per patient in 3\\r\\nmonths). In the remaining 49 patients the mean difference\\r\\nof all measured INRs from the therapeutic target value\\r\\nwas 10% (SD 20) during the 3 months of selfmanagement compared with 12% (22) in the period\\r\\nmanaged by the thrombosis service. There was no\\r\\nsignificant difference in the control of anticoagulation\\r\\nbetween the two study periods (figure 2).

This assessment has been validated in a previous\\r\\nstudy.21 The questionnaire was submitted to the\\r\\nparticipating patients before and after they finished the\\r\\nperiod of self-management. A control group of patients on\\r\\noral anticoagulation receiving regular anticoagulationclinic-based care (matched for age, sex, and indication for\\r\\nanticoagulation) served as a reference population. The\\r\\ninternal reliability coefficient of the questionnaire\\r\\n(Cronbach-) was assessed as previously described.25\\r\\nSample size and statistical analysis\\r\\nAll data are presented as mean (SD). The agreement\\r\\nbetween self-measurements and laboratory measurements\\r\\nin the initial phase of the study was analysed as previously\\r\\ndescribed.26,27 The accuracy of the control of\\r\\nanticoagulation was assessed by evaluating the number of\\r\\nINR values within and outside the therapeutic target\\r\\nrange and by measuring the length of time of adequate\\r\\nanticoagulation. The time in the therapeutic target range\\r\\nwas calculated by means of linear interpolation.28 The\\r\\nnumber of 50 patients for the randomised cross-over\\r\\nstudy was based on an assumption, as follows. From\\r\\nprevious studies it can be concluded that, with\\r\\nThrombosis-Service-managed anticoagulant therapy, at a\\r\\ngiven time about 20\\xe2\\x80\\x9340% of patients are not in the\\r\\ntherapeutic target range.7\\xe2\\x80\\x939 On the assumption that if 20%\\r\\nof patients are not in the therapeutic target range during\\r\\nthe observation period (ie, 120 occasions per period), a\\r\\nsignificant difference of 15% or more (-error 0.05, power\\r\\n0.8) in accuracy of anticoagulation will be detected\\r\\nbetween the two groups with a total study population of\\r\\n50 patients. If no such difference was observed, the\\r\\nmanagement strategies could be considered to be\\r\\nequivalent. For comparisons of groups the Wilcoxon\\r\\nsigned-rank test and two-tailed Fisher\\xe2\\x80\\x99s exact test were\\r\\nused.\\r\\nResults\\r\\nFeasibility and safety of self-management\\r\\nIn the first phase of the study a direct comparison of INRs\\r\\n(self-measured and measured at the anticoagulation\\r\\nclinic) and warfarin-dosing schemes (self-devised or\\r\\nclinic-based) was made for the 6-week study period. All\\r\\npatients were able to measure the INR at home and to\\r\\ndevise a dosing scheme for the next week. There was an\\r\\nacceptable correlation between the self-measured INR\\r\\nand the clinic INR (figure 1). The mean difference\\r\\nbetween all self-measurements and all clinic\\r\\nmeasurements was 12\\xc2\\xb73% (SD 10\\xc2\\xb71), with a  value for\\r\\nthe agreement between the two methods of 0\\xc2\\xb764 (limits of\\r\\nagreement 0\\xc2\\xb708 [1\\xc2\\xb704], weighed  0\\xc2\\xb746). The intra-class\\r\\ncorrelation coefficient was 0\\xc2\\xb791 (95% CI 0\\xc2\\xb786\\xe2\\x80\\x930\\xc2\\xb795). A\\r\\ndifference of more than 0\\xc2\\xb75 and 1\\xc2\\xb70 units of the selfmeasured INR from the corresponding clinic value was\\r\\nseen in 21% and 5% of the measurements, respectively.\\r\\nWhen analysed to find to what extent such a deviation of\\r\\nthe test result would lead to a different dosing scheme\\r\\n(according to the proposed dosing algorithm), this would\\r\\nhave been the case in 2% of measurements. The relation\\r\\nbetween the self-measured INR value (y) and the\\r\\nreference laboratory value could be expressed by the linear\\r\\nregression equation y=0\\xc2\\xb7993x\\x040\\xc2\\xb7057.

In particular, in patients in whom the control of\\r\\nanticoagulation was fairly good, the percentage of time in\\r\\nthe target range was larger for patients on selfmanagement than during management by the thrombosis\\r\\nservice (figure 2). The number of patients having more\\r\\nthan 50% of the time in the therapeutic target range\\r\\n(defined as the therapeutic target value \\xc2\\xb10\\xc2\\xb75) was 29\\r\\n(60%) in the self-management period versus 25 (52%) in\\r\\nthe thrombosis service period. The number of patients\\r\\nwith more than 75% of the time in the therapeutic target\\r\\nrange was 13 (27%) during self-management versus 6\\r\\n(12%) in the thrombosis-service period (2\\xc2\\xb75, 1\\xc2\\xb70\\xe2\\x80\\x936\\xc2\\xb77). Of\\r\\nthe 49 patients 34 had a better control of anticoagulation\\r\\n(defined as the period of time in the therapeutic target\\r\\nrange) during self-management than during\\r\\nanticoagulation clinic-guided management (4\\xc2\\xb76,\\r\\n2\\xc2\\xb71\\xe2\\x80\\x9310\\xc2\\xb72). In five of 49 patients there was no difference\\r\\nand in ten of 49 patients the anticoagulation-clinic\\r\\nmanagement resulted in a better control of\\r\\nanticoagulation than self-management. The number of\\r\\ndose adjustments was equal in both study periods and also\\r\\nthe magnitude of the dose-adjustments was not\\r\\nsignificantly different between the two study periods.\\r\\nSerious under-anticoagulation or over-anticoagulation\\r\\n(INR <1\\xc2\\xb75 or >5\\xc2\\xb70) occurred during 3\\xc2\\xb75% of the selfmanagement period and during 5\\xc2\\xb73% of the\\r\\nanticoagulation-clinic-management period (p=0\\xc2\\xb707).\\r\\nNo relation between a better control of anticoagulation\\r\\nand age, educational level, or indication for\\r\\nanticoagulation could be established.\\r\\nNo major bleeding episodes (defined as bleeding\\r\\nrequiring hospital admission or transfusion or any centralnervous-system bleeding) were seen in either management\\r\\ngroup during the observation period. In the\\r\\nanticoagulation clinic-management group three minor\\r\\nbleedings occurred (one joint bleeding after minor trauma\\r\\nat an INR of 7\\xc2\\xb75, one minor calf-muscle bleeding at an\\r\\nINR of 4\\xc2\\xb72, and one episode of recurrent nose bleeding at\\r\\nan INR of 6\\xc2\\xb75), whereas in the self-management period\\r\\none minor nose bleeding (INR 2\\xc2\\xb74) occurred. In the\\r\\nanticoagulation-clinic-management period there was one\\r\\nepisode of clinically suspected recurrent venous\\r\\nthrombosis (though not confirmed by objective testing) at\\r\\nan INR or 1\\xc2\\xb74 and one patient with a prosthetic aortic\\r\\nvalve suffered from a transient ischaemic attack. During\\r\\nself-management there were no symptoms and signs of\\r\\nthrombotic complications. The differences in clinical\\r\\noutcome were not significant.

Not to be reproduced without permission of The Lancet.\\r\\noral anticoagulation and a number of retrospective\\r\\ncohort studies have indicated that self-management of\\r\\nanticoagulant treatment was equivalent or superior to\\r\\nconventional care.1\\xc2\\xa76\\xe2\\x80\\x9318 Part of this effect may be\\r\\nexplained by the feasibility of more frequent control of\\r\\nthe INR. In multicentre prospective randomised trials it\\r\\nwas shown that control of anticoagulation was better in\\r\\npatients who managed their anticoagulation themselves\\r\\ncompared with patients who had their anticoagulation\\r\\nmanaged by a general practitioner.20,21 The present\\r\\nreport is the first to indicate that self-management is at\\r\\nleast as effective as management of anticoagulation by\\r\\nspecialised anticoagulation centres.\\r\\nIn the present study the adequacy of anticoagulant\\r\\ncontrol was expressed in terms of being in the\\r\\ntherapeutic target range. In fact, the incidence of\\r\\nbleeding or thrombotic episodes would provide a\\r\\npotentially more revelant outcome assessment.\\r\\nHowever, the size and the design of our study did not\\r\\npermit us to establish a significant difference in these\\r\\nfactors. Nevertheless, clinical studies show that there is\\r\\na clear relation between adequate control of\\r\\nanticoagulation and a lower incidence of bleeding and\\r\\nthrombotic complications in patients on oral\\r\\nanticoagulants.9,29 Hence, the small improvement during\\r\\nself-management of oral anticoagulation, as shown in\\r\\nour study, may potentially be extrapolated to a\\r\\nbeneficial effect of this management strategy on clinical\\r\\noutcome.\\r\\nAlthough we did not specifically select patients for our\\r\\nstudy, a certain degree of selection cannot be excluded.\\r\\nIndeed, young patients or patients with a busy working\\r\\nor social life might be over-represented in our study\\r\\ngroup. Strictly speaking, we can limit our conclusions\\r\\nonly to the feasibility of self-measurement of INR and\\r\\nself-dosing to the type of patients included in our study.\\r\\nHowever, others have found that all patients who are\\r\\nable to lead an independent and self-supporting life are\\r\\nin principle capable of self-management of\\r\\nanticoagulation, irrespective of education and social\\r\\nstatus. Other education and self-management\\r\\nprogrammes for patients, such as self-control and selfmanagement of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus,\\r\\nhave been similar in this respect.34 In our practice,\\r\\nlimiting factors for self-measurement of the INR with\\r\\nthe Coaguchek device were mainly physical factors, such\\r\\nas visual impairment. Another limitation of our study is\\r\\nthat the results apply only to patients on chronic\\r\\nanticogulant therapy and not to those just starting oral\\r\\nanticoagulant agents.\\r\\nDespite the ability of patients to self-manage oral\\r\\nanticoagulation, adequate support remains necessary.\\r\\nOngoing education, counsel in case of sustained\\r\\ndysregulation of anticoagulation, or advice on\\r\\ninterruption of therapy in case of bleeding or the need to\\r\\nundergo an invasive procedure are, among others, issues\\r\\nthat need to be taken care of. In the organisation of such\\r\\nsupport the anticoagulation clinics should play a major\\r\\nrole. Nevertheless, self-management of anticoagulation\\r\\nmay be a cost-effective approach, as was shown in a\\r\\nprevious analysis.35\\r\\nIn conclusion, we have shown that self-management\\r\\nof oral anticoagulant therapy is feasible and at least as\\r\\neffective as management by a specialised anticoagulation\\r\\nclinic. In addition, self-management was well accepted\\r\\nand appreciated by the participating patients.

Results from patients at the start of the selfmanagement period were not different from the results\\r\\nobtained in the control group. There were no differences\\r\\nbetween the two groups in INR target ranges, number of\\r\\nyears on anticoagulant treatment, and the degree of\\r\\neducation (table 2). The internal reliability of the\\r\\nquestionnaire was acceptable as indicated by the\\r\\nCronbach- values. There were significant differences in\\r\\nall five categories of the questionnaire in favour of the\\r\\nself-management group (table 2). Scores for general\\r\\ntreatment satisfaction and self-efficacy were higher in\\r\\nthe self-management group, whereas the score for daily\\r\\nanxieties, distress, and strain were significantly lower.\\r\\nDiscussion\\r\\nOral anticoagulation with warfarin is an effective\\r\\nmeasure for the treatment and prevention of arterial and\\r\\nvenous thromboembolism. However, the substantial\\r\\ninterindividual and intraindividual variation in the\\r\\nbiological effect of vitamin K antagonists renders many\\r\\npatients outside the therapeutic target range over long\\r\\nperiods of time. This is cumbersome for several reasons.\\r\\nFirst, clinical studies show that under-coagulation and\\r\\nover-coagulation enhance the risk of adverse clinical\\r\\noutcomes\\xe2\\x80\\x94ie, thromboembolism and bleeding,\\r\\nrespectively.29\\xe2\\x80\\x9331 For example, the annual incidence of\\r\\nmajor bleeding in patients on vitamin K antagonists for\\r\\nvarious indications is 0\\xc2\\xb79\\xe2\\x80\\x932\\xc2\\xb75% and this risk increases\\r\\nseveral-fold in patients with higher INRs. Hence, the\\r\\nvariability in the intensity of anticoagulation necessitates\\r\\nfrequent laboratory control and dose-adjustment, which\\r\\nconstitutes a second drawback of oral anticoagulation.\\r\\nPrevious studies have shown that anticoagulation\\r\\nmanagement by specialised anticoagulation clinics\\r\\nresults in better control of anticoagulation compared\\r\\nwith control in general practice.5,6 However, in certain\\r\\nareas this may even amplify the practical problem of\\r\\nfrequent checks. Self-management of anticoagulation\\r\\nmay overcome the need for frequent visits to an\\r\\nanticoagulation clinic, may achieve maximal\\r\\nindividualisation, and improved compliance, which are\\r\\nall factors that have been shown to improve the quality\\r\\nof anticoagulation.29\\xe2\\x80\\x9332 In our study we show that selfmanagement of oral anticoagulation results in a control\\r\\nof anticoagulation that is at least as good and potentially\\r\\nsuperior to control by a specialised anticoagulation\\r\\nservice in a randomised cross-over trial. Patients\\r\\nappeared to be able to measure their INR adequately\\r\\nand to devise appropriate dosing schemes for their\\r\\nwarfarin. Some variation between the INR values\\r\\nobtained with the portable self-testing device and\\r\\nlaboratory INRs was detectable. This is in accordance\\r\\nwith previous reports, but in fact the variation was not\\r\\nlarger than the variation that may be encountered\\r\\nbetween different laboratories measuring an INR value\\r\\nfrom a single sample.23,33 There was a slight benefit in the\\r\\ncontrol of anticoagulation during the self-management\\r\\nperiod in comparison with the period that\\r\\nanticoagulation was managed by the anticoagulation\\r\\nclinic. In addition, patient-independence of the clinics\\r\\nconsiderably improved patient satisfaction with their\\r\\nanticoagulant treatment in comparison to patients\\r\\nreceiving conventional care, which confirms identical\\r\\nfindings in one of the previous studies.21 Previous studies\\r\\nhave also shown the feasibility of self-management of\\r\\nFor personal use only.

Periodic laboratory testing of international normalized ratio (INR) and a subsequent dose adjustment are therefore mandatory. The use of home\\r\\ntesting devices to measure INR has been suggested as a potential way to improve the comfort\\r\\nand compliance of the patients and their families, the frequency of monitoring and, finally, the\\r\\nmanagement and safety of long-term oral anticoagulation. In pediatric patients, increased doses\\r\\nto obtain and maintain the therapeutic target INR, more frequent adjustments and INR testing,\\r\\nmultiple medication, inconstant nutritional intake, difficult venepunctures, and the need to go\\r\\nto the laboratory for testing (interruption of school and parents\\xe2\\x80\\x99 work attendance) highlight\\r\\nthose difficulties. After reviewing the most relevant published studies of self-testing and selfmanagement of INR for adult patients and children on oral anticoagulation, it seems that these\\r\\nare valuable and effective strategies of INR control. Despite an unclear relationship between\\r\\nINR control and clinical effects, these self-strategies provide a better control of the anticoagulant effect, improve patients and their family quality of life, and are an appealing solution in\\r\\nterm of cost-effectiveness. Structured education and knowledge evaluation by trained health\\r\\ncare professionals is required for children, to be able to adjust their dose treatment safely and\\r\\naccurately. However, further data are necessary in order to best define those patients who might\\r\\nbetter benefit from this multidisciplinary approach.\\r\\nKeywords: oral anticoagulation, vitamin K antagonists, international normalized ratio, INR\\r\\nself-management, INR self-testing\\r\\nIntroduction\\r\\nLong-term oral anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists could display the risk of\\r\\nhemorrhagic or thromboembolic complications.

Indeed, current practice guidelines\\r\\nsuggest the strategy of self-management for patients treated\\r\\nwith vitamin K antagonists who are motivated and can demonstrate competency in self-management strategies, including\\r\\nthe self-testing equipment (Class IIb).4\\r\\nIn pediatric patients, increased doses to obtain and maintain the therapeutic target INR, more frequent adjustments\\r\\nand INR testing, multiple medication, inconstant nutritional\\r\\nintake, difficult venepunctures, and the need to go to the\\r\\nlaboratory for testing (interruption of school and parents work\\r\\nattendance) highlight these difficulties.5\\r\\n The purpose of this\\r\\nsection of our paper is to review the most relevant published\\r\\nstudies of self-testing and self-management of INR for adult\\r\\npatients and children on oral anticoagulation.\\r\\nMethods\\r\\nWe considered only randomized controlled trials comparing\\r\\nthe effects and the clinical outcomes of self-testing or selfmanagement of oral anticoagulation therapy with standard\\r\\nmonitoring and care, including personal physicians and\\r\\nanticoagulation hospitals or clinics. We included studies\\r\\nfocusing on adult patients and children on oral anticoagulation therapy irrespective of the indication for treatment.\\r\\nResults\\r\\nIn the adult population, we identified 20 published randomized controlled trials that met the inclusion criteria (Table 1).\\r\\nFourteen trials included patients on oral anticoagulant\\r\\ntreatment for any indication.6\\xe2\\x80\\x9319 Four trials considered only\\r\\npatients on lifelong oral anticoagulation after heart valve\\r\\nreplacement with a mechanical prosthesis.20\\xe2\\x80\\x9323 Two trials\\r\\nincluded only patients on long-term anticoagulation for atrial\\r\\nfibrillation.24,25 Twelve trials analyzed the strategy of selfmanagement6,8,10,12\\xe2\\x80\\x9315,17\\xe2\\x80\\x9319,21,25 while seven trials the strategy\\r\\nof self-testing.7,11,16,20,22\\xe2\\x80\\x9324 Gadisseur et al reported the results\\r\\nof both self-management and self-testing.9\\r\\nIn the pediatric population, we identified only one randomized controlled trial that met the inclusion criteria.26\\r\\nJones et al in 2011 published a review of the literature concerning oral anticoagulation therapy in children, and they\\r\\ndemonstrated that time in therapeutic range was from 39%\\r\\nto 81% but they did not describe randomized trials of either\\r\\nself-testing or self-management.27\\r\\nClinical effectiveness\\r\\nThe best way to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of selftesting and self-management is the control of the anticoagulant\\r\\nTable 1 Most relevant published randomized controlled trials reporting self-testing and self-management of oral anticoagulation\\r\\nAuthor (year) Indication to OA Control group\\r\\npatients, n\\r\\nIntervention group\\r\\npatients, n\\r\\nType of intervention\\r\\nSawicki (1999)6 Any 82 83 SM\\r\\nBeyth et al (2000)7 Any 162 163 ST\\r\\nCromheecke et al (2000)8 Any 49 49 SM\\r\\nKortke et al (2001)20 Mechanical prosthesis 295 305 ST\\r\\nSidhu et al (2001)21 Mechanical prosthesis 48 34 SM\\r\\nGadisseur et al (2003)9 Any 221 99 SM\\r\\nKhan et al (2004)24 AF 39 40 ST\\r\\nSunderji et al (2004)10 Any 70 69 SM\\r\\nGardiner et al (2005)11 Any 24 29 ST\\r\\nMen\\xc3\\xa9ndez-J\\xc3\\xa1ndula et al (2005)12 Any 369 368 SM\\r\\nVoller et al (2005)25 AF 101 101 SM\\r\\nFitzmaurice et al (2005)13 Any 280 337 SM\\r\\nChristensen et al (2006)14 Any 50 50 SM\\r\\nSiebenhofer et al (2007)15 Any 96 99 SM\\r\\nMatchar et al (2010)16 Any 1457 1465 ST\\r\\nAzarnoush et al (2011)22 Mechanical prosthesis 103 103 ST\\r\\nVerret et al (2012)17 Any 56 58 SM\\r\\nSiebenhofer et al (2012)18 Any 73 68 SM\\r\\nThompson et al (2013)23 Mechanical prosthesis 100 100 ST\\r\\nDignan et al (2003)19 Any 157 153 SM\\r\\nAbbreviations: AF, atrial fibrillation; OA, oral anticoagulation; SM, self-management; ST, self-testing.\\r\\nVascular Health and Risk Management 2016:12 submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.com\\r\\nDovepress\\r\\nDovepress\\r\\n389\\r\\nINR self-management\\r\\neffect. The simplest indicators of the anticoagulant effect\\r\\nare the mean INR within the target range and the mean time\\r\\nspent within the target range. Owing to our review of the\\r\\nliterature, nine trials reported mean INR within the target\\r\\nrange.6,8\\xe2\\x80\\x9310,12,15,20,21,25 Every single trial showed a better INR\\r\\ncontrol in the self-testing or self-management group but this\\r\\nimprovement was statistically significant only in five trials.12,15,20,21,25 Improvements ranged from 3% to 17% (Table 2).\\r\\nMoreover, 14 trials analyzed the mean time spent within the\\r\\nINR target range (Table 3).7,9\\xe2\\x80\\x9317,21\\xe2\\x80\\x9324 Among these trials, 12\\r\\ndocumented an improvement in the self-testing or -monitoring\\r\\ngroup,7,9,10,13\\xe2\\x80\\x9317,21\\xe2\\x80\\x9324 but the statistical significance was reached\\r\\nonly in five trials.7,15,16,21,22 Finally, two trials did not show a\\r\\nbeneficial effect in the intervention group.11,12\\r\\nEven if self-testing or self-management of oral anticoagulation is more effective or, at least, as effective as conventional\\r\\ncare management, some authors argued against the correlation between improvement of INR control and decrease in\\r\\nmajor complications and call into serious question the usefulness of evaluating the safety of oral anticoagulation by using\\r\\nthe percentage of mean INR and/or time within target range.12\\r\\nThe use of point-of-care devices for routine INR measurements has demonstrated safety, reliability, and effectiveness\\r\\nin infants and children requiring long-term oral anticoagulation therapy.28,29\\r\\nBaumann et al in the EMPoWarMENT study26 have\\r\\nstudied 28 wafarinized children performing self-testing for\\r\\n>3 months and randomized them to self-testing at home\\r\\nor self-management. The mean age was 10 years,1\\xe2\\x80\\x9319 and\\r\\n93% were followed during 12 months. Mean number INR\\r\\ntest over the study was around 22 either for self-testing or\\r\\nself-management. Time in therapeutic range was 77% for\\r\\nself-testing and 83% for self-management. INRs >5 were\\r\\nnot related to warfarin dosing decision but to unexpected\\r\\nillness. Patients with self-management made dose decisions\\r\\nconsistent with the guidelines in 90% of time.\\r\\nClinical benefits\\r\\nThe ideal endpoint of oral anticoagulation therapy studies is\\r\\nthe evaluation of major complications. However, the reduction of oral anticoagulation-related complications \\xe2\\x80\\x93 namely,\\r\\nbleeding and thromboembolic events \\xe2\\x80\\x93 as a consequence of\\r\\na better control of the anticoagulant treatment (as discussed\\r\\nearlier) is still a matter of debate.\\r\\nWhen we take into consideration previous reviews of the\\r\\nliterature calculating the overall effect size, there is general\\r\\nagreement on the reduction of thromboembolic complications determined by self-testing or self-management. Overall,\\r\\nthese strategies show a 50% reduction of thromboembolic\\r\\ncomplications as compared to the control group.3,30,31\\r\\nConversely, the analysis of bleeding complications is\\r\\nmore challenging. Heneghan et al found a significant onethird reduction of hemorrhagic complications in their review\\r\\npublished in 2006,3\\r\\n but other investigators did not.30,31 These\\r\\ndifferent conclusions should probably be explained by a\\r\\nnonhomogeneous definition of major and minor hemorrhagic\\r\\ncomplications used in every report.\\r\\nTable 2 Mean INR within target range\\r\\nAuthor (year) Control\\r\\ngroup %\\r\\nIntervention\\r\\ngroup %\\r\\nControl vs\\r\\nintervention\\r\\ngroup P-value\\r\\nSawicki (1999)6 43.2 53 0.22\\r\\nCromheecke et al\\r\\n(2000)8\\r\\n49 55 0.06\\r\\nKortke et al (2001)20 62 79 <0.001\\r\\nSidhu et al (2001)21 58 67.6 <0.0001\\r\\nGadisseur et al\\r\\n(2003)9\\r\\n61.3 66.3 0.14\\r\\nSunderji et al (2004)10 58.7 64.8 0.23\\r\\nMen\\xc3\\xa9ndez-J\\xc3\\xa1ndulal\\r\\n et al (2005)12\\r\\n55.6 58.6 0.02\\r\\nVoller et al (2005)25 58.5 67.8 0.0061\\r\\nSiebenhofer et al\\r\\n(2007)15\\r\\n57.1 72.4 <0.001\\r\\nNote: Bold indicates statistical significance (P-value <0.05).\\r\\nAbbreviation: INR, international normalized ratio.\\r\\nTable 3 Mean time spent within INR target range\\r\\nAuthor (year) Control\\r\\ngroup %\\r\\nIntervention\\r\\ngroup %\\r\\nControl vs\\r\\nintervention\\r\\ngroup P-value\\r\\nBeyth et al (2000)7 32 56 <0.001\\r\\nSidhu et al (2001)21 63.8 76.5 <0.0001\\r\\nGadisseur et al (2003)9 67.9 68.6 0.33\\r\\nKhan et al (2004)24 70.4 71.1 NS\\r\\nSunderji et al (2004)10 63.2 71.8 0.14\\r\\nGardiner et al (2005)11 66 61 NS\\r\\nMen\\xc3\\xa9ndez-J\\xc3\\xa1ndula\\r\\net al (2005)12\\r\\n64.9 64.3 NS\\r\\nFitzmaurice et al\\r\\n(2005)13\\r\\n68 70 NS\\r\\nChristensen et al\\r\\n(2006)14\\r\\n68.9 78.7 NS\\r\\nSiebenhofer et al\\r\\n(2007)15\\r\\n66.5 75.4 <0.029\\r\\nMatchar et al (2010)16 62.4 66.2 <0.001\\r\\nAzarnoush et al\\r\\n(2011)22\\r\\n55.5 61.5 <0.05\\r\\nVerret et al (2012)17 75.5 80 0.79\\r\\nThompson et al\\r\\n(2013)23\\r\\n45 52 0.05\\r\\nNote: Bold indicates statistical significance (P-value <0.05).\\r\\nAbbreviations: INR, international normalized ratio; NS, not significant.\\r\\nVascular Health and Risk Management 2016:12 submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.com\\r\\nDovepress\\r\\nDovepress\\r\\n390\\r\\nPozzi et al\\r\\nFinally, the same consideration could be done to the\\r\\nanalysis of mortality. In fact, Heneghan et al found different\\r\\nresults in their reviews published in 2006 and 2012.3,30 In the\\r\\nformer, there was a significant reduction of overall mortality\\r\\nin the self-testing/ self-management group,3\\r\\n while in the latter\\r\\nthe difference was not statistically significant.30 The relative\\r\\nweight of oral anticoagulation control, thromboembolic\\r\\ncomplications, and bleeding in determining overall mortality\\r\\nis difficult to estimate and other factors may participate in\\r\\nthe outcome of patients\\xe2\\x80\\x99 population.\\r\\nPrevious studies in children have shown a rate of bleeding ranging from 0.5% to 1.7% with oral anticoagulation\\r\\ntherapy, with only one death reported related to the patient\\r\\nanticoagulation therapy;32 only two prospective studies have\\r\\nreported thromboembolic events with a rate under 2% and\\r\\n10% per patient year.\\r\\nIn the EMPoWarMENT study, there were no hemorrhagic\\r\\nor thromboembolic events, and baseline time in therapeutic\\r\\nrange for the self-monitoring group was less than the selftesting group due to poor adherence in four patients.27 As an\\r\\nanswer, it has been now well demonstrated that the ability of\\r\\nparents to use point-of-care monitor and parental knowledge\\r\\nis the major criterion for clinical effectiveness and benefits.\\r\\nQuality of life assessment\\r\\nThe success of an effective oral anticoagulation could be\\r\\nalso evaluated with the treatment-related quality of life.\\r\\nOur review of the literature identified six trials that assessed\\r\\nquality of life outcomes.6,8,16,17,18,24\\r\\nSawicki et al evaluated at baseline and 6-month followup the treatment-related quality of life using a structured\\r\\nquestionnaire containing 40 items.6\\r\\n The 40 items covered\\r\\nfive topics: general treatment satisfaction, self-efficacy,\\r\\nstrained social network, daily hassles, and distress. General\\r\\ntreatment satisfaction and daily hassles scores improved in\\r\\nthe self-management group and remained unchanged in the\\r\\nroutine care group. The scores of self-efficacy and distress\\r\\nimproved in both groups but improved significantly more in\\r\\nthe self-management group. The intervention had no significant effect on the strained social network scores. Interestingly,\\r\\nthe general treatment satisfaction scores displayed the most\\r\\npronounced improvement. Other investigators used the same\\r\\nstructured questionnaire in order to perform a self-perceived\\r\\nassessment of the quality of care.8,17 As previously outlined,\\r\\nthere were significant differences in all five categories of the\\r\\nquestionnaire in favor of the self-management group: scores\\r\\nfor general treatment satisfaction and self-efficacy were\\r\\nhigher in the self-management group whereas the score for\\r\\ndaily anxieties, distress, and strain were significantly lower.\\r\\nMoreover, Matchar et al evaluated patients\\xe2\\x80\\x99 satisfaction with\\r\\nanticoagulation, measured with the Duke Anticoagulation\\r\\nSatisfaction Scale, and quality of life, measured with the\\r\\nHealth Utilities Index Mark.3,16\\r\\nAt 2 years (the minimum duration of follow-up), patient\\r\\nsatisfaction with anticoagulation as measured by the Duke\\r\\nAnticoagulation Satisfaction Scale was greater in the selftesting group than in the clinic-testing group and a cumulative gain in health utilities according to the Health Utilities\\r\\nIndex Mark 3 was noted in the self-testing group as compared\\r\\nwith the clinic-testing group. Finally, Siebenhofer et al\\r\\nfocused attention on elderly patients and found a pronounced\\r\\nimprovement in general treatment satisfaction after participation in the self-management program.18\\r\\nConversely, Khan et al did not find any difference in quality of life measurements and health beliefs about warfarin\\r\\nbetween the control and self-monitoring groups using the\\r\\n36-item United Kingdom Short Form Health Survey and\\r\\nEuropean Quality of Life questionnaire.24\\r\\nTwo main studies have described the quality of life in\\r\\nchildren on home INR self-testing or self-management.33,34\\r\\nKIDCLOT-PAC-QL\\xc2\\xa9 was the first preliminarily validated\\r\\ninventory to assess quality of life in anticoagulated children;\\r\\nit determined confounders to therapy and may facilitate partnership in care.33 In 2013, Newall et al tried to evaluate the\\r\\nimpact of a home INR self-testing on the quality of life of\\r\\nchildren and their families. In all, 55 parents and 35 children\\r\\nparticipated; time in therapeutic range was 71%, and parents\\r\\nreported statistically significant improvement in quality of\\r\\nlife for themselves, their family, and their child.34\\r\\nCost-effectiveness evaluation\\r\\nOur review identified only one trial performing a costs evaluation.16 In this study, costs were higher in the self-testing group\\r\\nbut not significantly different from those in the clinic-testing\\r\\ngroup (difference = $1,249; P=0.32).\\r\\nOnly one study has been found in the pediatric population\\r\\nas well.35 The home monitoring saved a total of 1 hour and\\r\\n19 minutes per INR test and has a cost saving to society of\\r\\n$66.83 per INR test compared to traditional care incorporating health sector costs, travel expenses, and lost time.\\r\\nDiscussion\\r\\nThe self-testing and self-management of INR during oral\\r\\nanticoagulation is safe and effective and provides an accurate\\r\\ncontrol of the anticoagulant treatment.

In fact, it has been demonstrated that\\r\\nthere is a linear relationship between the frequencies of INR\\r\\ntesting and quality of oral anticoagulation.36\\r\\nNevertheless, this accurate control of oral anticoagulation\\r\\ndoes not automatically translate into a substantial reduction\\r\\nof major complications. In the largest randomized clinical\\r\\ntrial \\xe2\\x80\\x93 THINRS (The Home INR Study) \\xe2\\x80\\x93 weekly home INR\\r\\ntesting did not reduce the aggregate outcome of stroke, major\\r\\nbleeding, or death as compared to monthly clinic INR testing.16\\r\\nIn contrast, there is a general agreement in the amelioration of the quality of life provided by the self-testing or selfmanagement of INR. In fact, from a theoretical standpoint,\\r\\npatients should perform their INR measurements in the same\\r\\nlaboratory in order to reduce the inter-laboratory variability,\\r\\nwhich can span from 10% to 30%.37 This dependence from\\r\\nthe same laboratory could represent a major limitation of\\r\\npatients\\xe2\\x80\\x99 personal or professional daily activities. Self-testing\\r\\nor self-management of oral anticoagulation might effectively\\r\\nface this limitation and this is clearly witnessed by a global\\r\\nimprovement of general treatment satisfaction as compared\\r\\nto standard care.6,8,16\\xe2\\x80\\x9318,24\\r\\nA structured teaching program is however of outmost\\r\\nimportance and plays a key role in self-strategies of oral\\r\\nanticoagulation. This is even more important in children,\\r\\nelderly, or low-level education or social status patients.\\r\\nLimitations\\r\\nOur review displays of course several limitations. Firstly,\\r\\nalthough comprehensive, we could have potentially missed\\r\\nsome published studies. Moreover, the analysis of published\\r\\ndata was not performed in a statistical manner and without\\r\\nany stratification according to the indications, frequency\\r\\nof tests or the length of the anticoagulant treatment, and\\r\\ndifferent models of standard routine care. Finally, we did\\r\\nnot take into consideration the type of education and training and the reasons and rate of dropout of the self-testing/\\r\\nself-management group.\\r\\nConclusion\\r\\nThe present review article reported that self-testing and selfmanagement for INR control provided a better control of the\\r\\nanticoagulant effect and improved patients\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and their family\\r\\nquality of life. These findings would be very useful in the\\r\\nactual clinical setting.\\r\\nAnd the reviewers would expect that the system and\\r\\nprocedure of self-testing and self-management for INR\\r\\ncontrol would evolve to be more user-friendly, and hope that\\r\\nespecially in child patients, the novel anticoagulant therapy\\r\\nwould be innovated to a stage wherean INR control would\\r\\nnot necessary.\\r\\nThey are valuable and effective strategies of INR control.\\r\\nDespite an unclear relationship between INR control and\\r\\nclinical effects, these self-strategies provide a better control\\r\\nof the anticoagulant effect, improve patients\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and their family quality of life, and are an appealing solution in term of\\r\\ncost-effectiveness. For children, structured education and\\r\\nknowledge evaluation by trained health care professionals,\\r\\nchildren, and their caregivers appear to be able to adjust\\r\\ntheir dose treatment safely and accurately. Further data are\\r\\nhowever necessary in order to best define those patients who\\r\\nmight better benefit from this multidisciplinary approach.\\r\\nDisclosure\\r\\nThe authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.\\r\\nReferences\\r\\n1.

       "       b'ORIGINAL ARTICLE\\r\\nA randomised controlled trial of patient self management\\r\\nof oral anticoagulation treatment compared with primary\\r\\ncare management\\r\\nD A Fitzmaurice, E T Murray, K M Gee, T F Allan,FDR Hobbs\\r\\n.............................................................................................................................\\r\\nJ Clin Pathol 2002;55:845\\xe2\\x80\\x93849\\r\\nBackground: The increase in numbers of patients receiving warfarin treatment has led to the development of alternative models of service delivery for oral anticoagulant monitoring. Patient self management for oral anticoagulation is a model new to the UK. This randomised trial was the first to compare\\r\\nroutine primary care management of oral anticoagulation with patient self management.\\r\\nAim: To test whether patient self management is as safe, in terms of clinical effectiveness, as primary\\r\\ncare management within the UK, as assessed by therapeutic international normalised ratio (INR) control.\\r\\nMethod: Patients receiving warfarin from six general practices who satisfied study entry criteria were\\r\\neligible to enter the study. Eligible patients were randomised to either intervention (patient self management) or control (routine primary care management) for six months. The intervention comprised two\\r\\ntraining sessions of one to two hours duration. Patients were allowed to undertake patient self management on successful completion of training. INR testing was undertaken using a Coaguchek device and\\r\\nregular internal/external quality control tests were performed. Patients were advised to perform INR\\r\\ntests every two weeks, or weekly if a dose adjustment was made. Dosage adjustment was undertaken\\r\\nusing a simple dosing algorithm.\\r\\nResults: Seventy eight of 206 (38%) patients were eligible for inclusion and, of these, 35 (45%)\\r\\ndeclined involvement or withdrew from the study. Altogether, 23 intervention and 26 control patients\\r\\nentered the study. There were no significant differences in INR control (per cent time in range: intervention, 74%; control, 77%). There were no serious adverse events in the intervention group, with one fatal\\r\\nretroperitoneal haemorrhage in the control group. Costs of patient self management were significantly\\r\\ngreater than for routine care (\\xc2\\xa390 v \\xc2\\xa3425/patient/year).\\r\\nConclusion: These are the first UK data to demonstrate that patient self management is as safe as primary care management for a selected population. Further studies are needed to elucidate whether this\\r\\nmodel of care is suitable for a larger population.\\r\\nT\\r\\nhe expansion of clinical indications for warfarin,1 2\\r\\nparticularly stroke prevention in non-rheumatic atrial\\r\\nfibrillation,3 4 has heightened concerns over where and\\r\\nhow warfarin monitoring should be undertaken.5 6 This is an\\r\\nimportant policy issue for all healthcare systems because current data show that only one third of patients with identified\\r\\natrial fibrillation over the age of 65 are currently receiving\\r\\nanticoagulation.7\\r\\nCurrent models of oral anticoagulation management within\\r\\nthe UK include the traditional hospital outpatient model and\\r\\nvarious forms of community management, all of which\\r\\nrequire patient attendance at a clinic of some sort. We have\\r\\npreviously demonstrated the efficacy of primary care oral\\r\\nanticoagulation management using near patient testing to\\r\\nestimate international normalised ratio (INR) and computerised decision support software for dosage supervision within a\\r\\npractice nurse led clinic (the Birmingham model).8\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cStudies from Europe and the USA have suggested that\\r\\npatient self management can improve therapeutic control\\r\\ncompared with routine testing\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nAn alternative model of care involves patients measuring\\r\\ntheir own INR using near patient testing equipment and\\r\\ninterpreting the result themselves, in a similar way to diabetic\\r\\npatients monitoring their own glucose control. This model is\\r\\nwidespread in Germany and is known as patient self\\r\\nmanagement.9 Although convenience and patient autonomy\\r\\nare undoubtedly an important feature of this model, the relative clinical effectiveness of patient self management must be\\r\\nestablished before recommendations can be made regarding\\r\\nits wider implementation. Reliable portable machines are\\r\\navailable, which have been subjected to rigorous laboratory\\r\\nevaluation.10\\xe2\\x80\\x9312 Studies from Europe and the USA have\\r\\nsuggested that patient self management can improve therapeutic control compared with routine testing.13\\xe2\\x80\\x9319 However, the\\r\\nroutine care comparitor within these studies often represents\\r\\nsuboptimal performance.20 Furthermore, the cost implications\\r\\nof patient self management for the UK National Health Service system are not directly equivalent to the costs for private\\r\\nhealth insurance schemes in other countries.\\r\\nWe report the first data from a randomised controlled trial\\r\\nto investigate the efficacy of patient self management\\r\\ncompared with optimal routine management within the\\r\\nUK.21 Outcome measures included INR control in terms of the\\r\\npercentage of time spent within the therapeutic range and the\\r\\nproportion of tests within the therapeutic range, serious\\r\\nadverse events, and costs. Our study also investigated the criteria for the selection of patients for patient self management,\\r\\n.............................................................\\r\\nAbbreviations: CRF, clinical report form; EQA, external quality\\r\\nassurance; INR, international normalised ratio; IQC, internal quality\\r\\ncontrol\\r\\nSee end of article for\\r\\nauthors\\xe2\\x80\\x99 affiliations\\r\\n.......................\\r\\nCorrespondence to:\\r\\nDr D A Fitzmaurice,\\r\\nDepartment of Primary\\r\\nCare and General Practice,\\r\\nMedical School, University\\r\\nof Birmingham, Edgbaston,\\r\\nBirmingham B15 2TT, UK;\\r\\nD.A.Fitzmaurice@bham.ac.uk\\r\\nAccepted for publication\\r\\n13 June 2002\\r\\n.......................\\r\\n845\\r\\nwww.jclinpath.com\\r\\n on October 6, 2019 by guest.

Downloaded from \\r\\npatient attitude towards patient self management, and quality\\r\\nof life issues.\\r\\nMETHODS\\r\\nSix general practices in the West Midlands using the Birmingham model of anticoagulation management were recruited for\\r\\nour study. Before the original near patient testing and computerised decision support software trial, those practices had not\\r\\nbeen involved in anticoagulation monitoring and were typical\\r\\nof service practice. Clinics were nurse led and used a\\r\\nCoaguchek near patient testing device (Roche Diagnostics\\r\\nLewes, Sussex, UK) for INR measurement and computerised\\r\\ndecision support software (BAP-PC; University of Birmingham) for the interpretation of the results.\\r\\nAll patients attending the clinic, over the age of 18, receiving\\r\\nlong term anticoagulation treatment for a period of at least six\\r\\nmonths, with sufficient vision and manual dexterity to\\r\\noperate a Coaguchek near patient testing system, and with\\r\\nsatisfactory INR control, defined as achieving INR within 0.5\\r\\nof the target value for at least 60% of the time in the previous\\r\\n12 months, were identified. From this list, the practice nurse\\r\\nwas asked to select patients who would be capable of\\r\\nperforming patient self management, following the criteria of\\r\\nprevious treatment adherence, physical well being, anxiety,\\r\\ncognitive ability, visual acuity, and ability to follow simple\\r\\ninstructions. These selected patients were invited to an informal talk about the study and asked to give written consent.\\r\\nPatients who consented to participate in the study were\\r\\nrandomly allocated using computer generated coding into\\r\\neither intervention (patient self management) or control\\r\\n(routine clinic management).\\r\\nIntervention group (patient self management)\\r\\nThose in the self management group of patients were required\\r\\nto attend a training course involving two workshops of one to\\r\\ntwo hours, one week apart. Workshops, based within\\r\\nindividual practices, were organised by research staff and\\r\\nattended by practice staff. Sessions covered theoretical and\\r\\npractical aspects of anticoagulation management, including\\r\\nthe procedure for performing a blood test using the near\\r\\npatient testing device, quality control procedures, and managing the INR result using a specified algorithm (fig 1).\\r\\nAfter the first training session, patients were given a near\\r\\npatient testing device and test strips to practice blood tests at\\r\\nhome. They were asked to record at least six results and highlight any problems. At the second session they were given a\\r\\nseries of clinical vignettes to assess their understanding of INR\\r\\nmanagement. Patients were individually assessed by the\\r\\nresearch team and if it was felt that they were competent to\\r\\ncarry out self management, sufficient test strips and quality\\r\\ncontrol vials were provided for home use.\\r\\nFor a six month period, patients were required to perform\\r\\nan INR test every two weeks or after one week following dosage adjustment. Batch numbers and expiry dates of test strips\\r\\nand quality control vials distributed to patients were recorded\\r\\ncentrally. Daytime access to medical advice was provided via a\\r\\npager and patients were instructed that the dosing algorithm\\r\\ncould be overridden only after consultation with the research\\r\\nteam. Support was also available from their practice nurse and\\r\\ngeneral practitioner, and a record kept describing all contacts\\r\\nmade by the patients. Self management patients were\\r\\nprovided with a clinical report form (CRF) to record INR\\r\\nresults, warfarin dose, adverse events, advice received, and\\r\\nnumber of test strips used.\\r\\nInternal quality control (IQC) was provided by the\\r\\nmanufacturer and performed at week 1, week 8, and week 20\\r\\nof the study. Patients were also asked to perform IQC if they\\r\\nrecorded an unusual INR result or when using a new batch of\\r\\ntest strips. External quality control (EQC) was performed four\\r\\ntimes during the study period, twice at home without\\r\\nsupervision (weeks 10 and 20) and twice at the practice with\\r\\nsupervision by research personnel (weeks 12 and 22). EQC\\r\\nwas provided by the National External Quality Assessment\\r\\nScheme in the form of lyophilised plasma samples and\\r\\ndiluents. Two separate lyophilised samples were used and one\\r\\nsample was tested on three occasions. Patients performed EQC\\r\\ntests on the Coaguchek provided, and were given a performance grading based on the consensus result from other users\\r\\nof the same near patient testing device. This included all sites\\r\\nnationally, either within or remote from a laboratory setting.\\r\\nControl group\\r\\nControl patients were managed as before in routine practice\\r\\nclinics using the Coaguchek near patient testing device for\\r\\nINR measurement. Practice nurses entered data on INR, warfarin dose, number of test strips used, and any adverse events\\r\\non to the CRF at each visit.\\r\\nCollection of patients\\xe2\\x80\\x99 responses to self management\\r\\nAt study conclusion, a random sample of patients (eight\\r\\npatient self management and eight control) were given a\\r\\nsemistructured interview covering relevant themes generated\\r\\nfrom a series of focus groups, which involved professionals\\r\\ninvolved in anticoagulation management. Material was pooled\\r\\nto elicit questions relevant to their experience in the\\r\\nstudy\\xe2\\x80\\x94for example, the training, alternative methods of care,\\r\\nattitudes to self management, and self efficacy. Questions\\r\\nfrom a previously validated questionnaire22 regarding warfarin\\r\\ntreatment were also used, in addition to the SEIQoL tool for\\r\\nquality of life estimation.23 Interviews were audiotaped and\\r\\ntranscribed. Content analysis of the questionnaires was used\\r\\nto draw out common themes and valid comment.\\r\\nFigure 1 Patient algorithm.\\r\\n846 Fitzmaurice, Murray, Gee, et al\\r\\nwww.jclinpath.com\\r\\n on October 6, 2019 by guest.

One hundred and\\r\\ntwenty eight of 206 (62%) were considered inappropriate for\\r\\npatient self management by practice nurses, and 22 of 78\\r\\n(28%) of the remaining patients refused to enter the study.\\r\\nReasons for exclusion included; problems with manual\\r\\ndexterity (13%), anxiety (12%), lack of cognitive ability (8%),\\r\\nnon-compliance (6%), physically unwell (8%), or too elderly\\r\\nfor patient self management (12%). Fifty six of 206 (27%)\\r\\npatients entered the study (26 controls, 30 patient self\\r\\nmanagement). Seven patients randomised to patient self\\r\\nmanagement were not included for analysis: three did not\\r\\nattend the training sessions, one failed the assessment, and\\r\\nthree dropped out within the first month of the study (two\\r\\nbecause of a loss of confidence and one because of problems\\r\\nwith manual dexterity). Therefore, 23 patients randomised to\\r\\nthe patient self management group were included in the trial\\r\\nanalysis.\\r\\nThere were no significant differences in mean age (patient\\r\\nself management, 63 years; controls, 69 years) or Townsend\\r\\nscores between the two groups. A larger proportion of men\\r\\nthan women took part in the study (37 men, 12 women).\\r\\nTwenty one of the 23 participants were white and 17 of 23\\r\\nwere retired.\\r\\nClinical indications for warfarin treatment were similar\\r\\nbetween the two groups, with most patients receiving warfarin for atrial fibrillation (27 of 49).\\r\\nINR control and adverse events\\r\\nThere was no significant difference in prestudy (six months)\\r\\nINR percentage time in range (66% patient self management\\r\\nversus 76% controls). There were no significant differences\\r\\nbetween the two groups in the percentage time in range (74%\\r\\npatient self management versus 77% controls) or the\\r\\nproportion of tests in range (66% patient self management\\r\\nversus 72% controls) for the study period (table 2), and no\\r\\nsignificant change between prestudy and study data for either\\r\\ngroup.\\r\\nThere were seven self reported minor adverse events (two\\r\\nbreathlessness, two unexplained bruising, one haematuria,\\r\\nand one menorrhagia) and no serious events in the intervention group. There was one serious adverse event in the control\\r\\ngroup, a fatal retroperitoneal haemorrhage. There were no\\r\\nrecorded minor adverse events in the control group. Control\\r\\npatient data were abstracted from clinical records, whereas\\r\\nintervention patients were asked directly at follow up regarding adverse events. The need for telephone support was minimal.\\r\\nExternal quality assurance\\r\\nThe EQA results from the study participants were compared\\r\\nwith the results from 75 health care professionals using the\\r\\nCoaguchek near patient testing device. There were no significant differences in median INRs between the patients and the\\r\\nprofessionals (table 3).\\r\\nFrequency of testing and costs\\r\\nIn the six months before the study, there was no significant\\r\\ndifference between groups in mean number of tests performed\\r\\nfor each patient(6.1 patient self management versus 5.9 controls). The patient self management group showed a\\r\\nsignificant increase in the mean number of tests for each\\r\\npatient during the study (14.6 patient self management versus\\r\\n5.3 controls; p < 0.001), giving a mean frequency of testing of\\r\\n1.6 weeks for the patient self management group and five\\r\\nTable 1 Resource items and unit costs\\r\\nResource item Unit cost (\\xc2\\xa3) Source\\r\\nControl group\\r\\nFollow up attendance at anticoagulation clinic 8.84 Parry et al24\\r\\nIntervention group\\r\\nTest strip (for each strip) 2.30 Manufacturer\\r\\nAdvice by practice nurse (for each 15 minute consultation) 5.75 Netten25\\r\\nInternal quality control (for each assessment) 2.30 Manufacturer\\r\\nExternal quality control (for each assessment) 30.00 NEQAS\\r\\nTraining session (for each patient)*\\r\\nRoom hire 6.00 Parry et al24\\r\\nStaff time 20.00 Parry et al24\\r\\nTest strips 23.00 Manufacturer\\r\\nQuality control 1.46 Manufacturer\\r\\nEquipment (per machine) 400.00r Manufacturer\\r\\n*Assuming 5 patients for each training session.\\r\\nNEQAS, National External Quality Assessment Scheme.\\r\\nTable 2 International normalised ratio results\\r\\nPercentage time in\\r\\nrange (95% CI)\\r\\nPercentage of tests\\r\\nin range (95% CI)\\r\\nSelf management (n=23) 74 (67\\xe2\\x80\\x9381) 66 (61\\xe2\\x80\\x9371)\\r\\nControl (n=26) 77 (67\\xe2\\x80\\x9386) 72 (65\\xe2\\x80\\x9380)\\r\\nCI, confidence interval.\\r\\nTable 3 National External Quality Assessment\\r\\nScheme results\\r\\nSample 1\\r\\nMedian INRs\\r\\nSample 2\\r\\nMedian INRs\\r\\nPatients (n=23) 3.6, 3.8, 3.7 2.9\\r\\nProfessionals (n=75) 3.4 2.8\\r\\nINR, international normalised ratio.\\r\\nPatient self management of oral anticoagulation treatment 847\\r\\nwww.jclinpath.com\\r\\n on October 6, 2019 by guest.

Sixty one of 336 (18%) of INR\\r\\ntests performed by the patients in the self management group\\r\\nduring the study period were outside protocol criteria. The\\r\\nreasons given for extra tests were: concurrent antibiotic treatment, tooth extraction, and working abroad.\\r\\nThe mean cost each year for patients in the intervention\\r\\narm was \\xc2\\xa3425 compared with \\xc2\\xa390 for patients in the control\\r\\narm (p < 0.001). Intervention costs were based on capital\\r\\ncosts (spread over five years at a rate on interest of 6%) and\\r\\nrunning costs of the equipment, quality control, training, and\\r\\nsupport from the practice. Control costs were based on average\\r\\ncost for each patient attending a primary care clinic. These\\r\\ncosts included capital costs of equipment, training of the general practitioner and practice nurse (spread over five years at a\\r\\nrate on interest of 6%), running costs to include time spent by\\r\\npractice nurse in running the clinic, general practitioner support, test strips, and service charge for room usage (table 4).\\r\\nIndirect costs to the patient were not included.\\r\\nInterviews and questionnaires\\r\\nFive common themes emerged from the patient self management interviews: knowledge and management of condition\\r\\nand self empowerment, increased anxiety and obsession with\\r\\nhealth, self efficacy, relationship with health professionals,\\r\\nand societal and economic cost. No significant difference in\\r\\nquality of life was found between the two groups.\\r\\nDISCUSSION\\r\\nThis study aimed to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of\\r\\npatient self management compared with a routine primary\\r\\ncare clinic. Patient self management involved near patient\\r\\ntesting technology (Coaguchek), which has been shown to be\\r\\nsafe in previous studies.14 17 19 26 Patients managed the near\\r\\npatient testing device with minimal support following the\\r\\ntraining, and coped with both IQC and EQA procedures.\\r\\nNo difference in INR control or serious adverse events was\\r\\nfound between the two groups, demonstrating that selected\\r\\nUK patients are capable of measuring their own INR and dosing their warfarin accordingly. These are important data\\r\\nbecause a criticism of previous studies is that the standard\\r\\ncare comparitor was suboptimal,26\\xe2\\x80\\x9328 whereas INR percentage\\r\\ntime in range data for routine care are demonstrably better in\\r\\nour study than previously reported data (77% versus 50%,\\r\\nrespectively).14 29\\r\\nOnly 38% of patients receiving warfarin were considered\\r\\nsuitable for patient self management and nearly one third\\r\\n(28%) of these refused to participate. Furthermore, because\\r\\nabout a quarter of those patients randomised to patient self\\r\\nmanagement withdrew from the study overall, just under half\\r\\nof those considered eligible for patient self management consented and completed the study. Therefore, these excellent\\r\\nINR results may reflect that only motivated, compliant, and\\r\\nlong term treatment patients were recruited.\\r\\nAlthough poor treatment adherence has been cited as a\\r\\nmajor cause of unstable anticoagulation with warfarin,30\\r\\npatient self management has been shown to have a positive\\r\\ninfluence in the control of diabetes,31 32 and hypertension.33\\r\\nTherefore, it is possible that instead of aiming patient self\\r\\nmanagement primarily at motivated patients, a package of\\r\\ntraining, self management, and support may be the solution to\\r\\nencourage motivation in less dedicated patients. The results of\\r\\nour study interviews agreed with previous ones in that poor\\r\\nadherence can be improved with patient self management. For\\r\\nmost patients, the reduction in professional support was seen\\r\\nas a positive aspect of their care, as long as support was available. Further studies are needed to elucidate definitions for\\r\\nselection, perhaps based more on patient self selection and the\\r\\nidentification of inappropriate patients after training and\\r\\nassessment.\\r\\nTraining was based on the German nationally approved\\r\\nprogramme for anticoagulation29 and other centres have\\r\\ndescribed similar training of varying intensity.20\\r\\nThe patient self management group in our study performed\\r\\nINR tests almost three times more frequently than the\\r\\nroutinely managed group in demonstrating equivalent therapeutic control. The two weekly testing conducted within our\\r\\nstudy was based on previous studies.29 At present, there are no\\r\\nformal guidelines relating to the frequency of testing for optimum management and it is an area that also requires further\\r\\ninvestigation.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFor most patients, the reduction in professional support\\r\\nwas seen as a positive aspect of their care, as long as\\r\\nsupport was available\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nThe high cost for patients in the intervention arm is a function of the number of tests undertaken and the consumable\\r\\nand equipment costs of self management tests. If this\\r\\ntechnology becomes more more widely available and its associated costs fall over time then the costs for patient self management could become more favourable. Test strips are now\\r\\navailable on prescription, which would enable more patients to\\r\\nundertake patient self management, although there are obvious cost implications for the National Health Service.\\r\\nHowever, on current evidence, a more conventional approach\\r\\nto the management of patients receiving anticoagulation is by\\r\\nfar the cheapest option.\\r\\nFor our study, patients successfully performed EQA on four\\r\\nseparate occasions and these results will contribute to the\\r\\ndebate concerning patients\\xe2\\x80\\x99 ability to manage EQA.34 IQC is\\r\\nconsidered by some to be an adequate performance test for the\\r\\nreliability of the result, but although it is a useful test to assess\\r\\nday to day precision it could be argued that the target range is\\r\\nunacceptably wide. In addition, if EQA is deemed essential for\\r\\nhospital and primary care clinics undertaking INR measurement, the same conditions must apply to patient self management, although this has not been referred to in previous\\r\\npatient self management studies.\\r\\nIn conclusion, patient self management is in an embryonic\\r\\nphase in the UK, and these are the first data to suggest that it\\r\\nis as clinically effective as routine care, in this case primary\\r\\ncare management of oral anticoagulation. Evidently patient\\r\\nself management is more costly than practice based management as a result of increased use of the near patient testing\\r\\ndevice, test strips, quality assurance, and training. Some of\\r\\nthese excess costs may not prove necessary. Nevertheless, if\\r\\npatient self management costs are confirmed as higher than\\r\\nroutine care they could only be recouped within the National\\r\\nHealth Service by reductions in serious adverse events,\\r\\nparticularly stroke. Given that routine care in the UK is\\r\\nalready good this outcome is unlikely.\\r\\nBefore consideration can be given to widespread adoption\\r\\nof this model further UK research is needed. This will need to\\r\\ndeal with issues around the nature of training, the definition\\r\\nof patient eligibility, the frequency of testing, and costs.\\r\\nAlthough cost effectiveness appears unlikely considering\\r\\nthese preliminary data, patient self management has been\\r\\nTable 4 Total cost for each patient calculated for\\r\\neach year\\r\\nIntervention group Control group\\r\\nNumber 23 26\\r\\nMean 425.23* 89.71*\\r\\nSD 52.65 38.58\\r\\nMedian 413.53 88.40\\r\\nInterquartile range 388.23\\xe2\\x80\\x93459.53 53.04\\xe2\\x80\\x93123.76\\r\\nRange 342.23\\xe2\\x80\\x93563.03 17.68\\xe2\\x80\\x93141.44\\r\\n*p<0.001, t test.\\r\\n848 Fitzmaurice, Murray, Gee, et al\\r\\nwww.jclinpath.com\\r\\n on October 6, 2019 by guest.

Any new\\r\\nmodel of care will therefore have to show levels of control of\\r\\ngreater than 60% of time within the therapeutic range of INR to\\r\\nbe deemed safe and a greater than 10% superiority over routine\\r\\ncare to be deemed superior.13 The advantages for healthcare\\r\\npolicy of doing such trials in the UK are considerable, as the\\r\\ncomparator population will represent realistic \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbest practice\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nanywhere, and the results of any trial would therefore be valid\\r\\nand generalisable.15\\xe2\\x80\\x9317\\r\\nThis paper reports clinical outcomes of the first UK, and the\\r\\nlargest worldwide, study of non-selected patients to investigate\\r\\nself management of oral anticoagulation. Cost effectiveness,\\r\\nquality of life, and training aspects18 are reported separately elsewhere.\\r\\nMethods\\r\\nWe identified patients from primary care centres within the UK\\r\\nMidlands Research Consortium (MidReC). We purposively sampled centres to cover rural and suburban centres with a\\r\\nsocioeconomic range of patients. We identified eligible patients\\r\\nfrom practice generated computer lists. These were patients aged\\r\\n18 or over, with a long term (greater than 12 months) indication\\r\\nfor oral anticoagulation,19 who had taken warfarin for at least six\\r\\nmonths with a target INR of 2.5 or 3.5. Patient recruitment took\\r\\nplace in three phases: 15 practices in phase 1 (April 2001), 15\\r\\npractices in phase 2 (September 2001), and 19 practices in phase\\r\\n3 (April 2002).\\r\\nAdministrators verified computer lists to remove patients\\r\\nwho had discontinued warfarin, moved away, or died. We asked\\r\\ngeneral practitioners to remove only those patients they believed\\r\\nshould be excluded from the trial on clinical or social grounds.\\r\\nRemaining patients were sent written invitations to participate in\\r\\nthe study. Patients or carers (defined as someone who takes care\\r\\nof the patient but not employed to do so) who gave a positive\\r\\nresponse were invited to an information session in the patients\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\r\\ngeneral practice.\\r\\nWe allocated consenting patients to intervention or routine\\r\\ncare by central telephone randomisation using a variable block\\r\\nsized random allocation.

We asked intervention patients to\\r\\nattend two training sessions.18 Trained anticoagulation nurses\\r\\ngave patients training at the practice. This covered the theory of\\r\\nanticoagulation, the INR, INR targets, how to measure and interpret INR, how to adjust dose, and quality control. Patients who\\r\\ndid not attend training sessions were withdrawn and returned to\\r\\nroutine care.

They adjusted\\r\\ndosage by using a laminated dosing schedule based on a traffic\\r\\nlight system, where green represented INR within target range\\r\\n(no dose adjustment), amber represented INR slightly high or\\r\\nlow (minor dose adjustment dependent on stable dose), and red\\r\\nrepresented INR too high or too low (contact a healthcare professional). Patients were instructed to do internal quality control\\r\\ntests if they got an unusual INR result or started a new box of test\\r\\nstrips. Intervention patients were reviewed at a practice based\\r\\nclinic every three months to assess progress and to do external\\r\\nquality assessment procedures.\\r\\nPatients not considered capable of self management were\\r\\nasked to return to routine care. Similarly, at the three month\\r\\nassessment patients not safely self managing (for example, using\\r\\nmultiple finger pricks to obtain INR results) were returned to\\r\\nroutine care. Other reasons for withdrawal were self withdrawal\\r\\nand serious adverse events. Routine care patients continued\\r\\nattending either hospital or practice based anticoagulant clinics.\\r\\nThe primary outcome measure was therapeutic INR control\\r\\ndetermined by the percentage of time spent within the\\r\\ntherapeutic range.20 We collected adverse event data from\\r\\ngeneral practice records. We defined serious adverse events as\\r\\nthose needing treatment or medical evaluation. An independent\\r\\nadverse event committee (comprising a neurologist, a haematologist, and a general practitioner) were responsible for classifying serious adverse events at the end of the trial.\\r\\nPatients withdrawn from the intervention completed the\\r\\nstudy off the assigned treatment, and we collected INR data and\\r\\nincluded them in the intention to treat analysis. Patients who\\r\\nreached a study end point (discontinued warfarin, withdrew consent, or died) or were lost to follow-up (moved away) had no further INR data collected.\\r\\nStudy power and analysis plan\\r\\nWe did analyses by intention to treat (all patients randomised to\\r\\nintervention group), on treatment (patients actually receiving\\r\\nintervention), and off treatment (intervention data from patients\\r\\nwho discontinued the intervention early).\\r\\nFor the primary outcome, if INR control in terms of percentage of time spent within the therapeutic range in both groups\\r\\nwas equivalent at a level of 10%, with 5% significance and 80%\\r\\npower, we needed 261 patients in each group (total 522). For\\r\\ncomparisons of percentage time in range we established a common dataset for all analyses, which included information on time\\r\\nin range in both the pre-study (six months before inclusion in\\r\\nstudy) and study periods.\\r\\nWe used the paired t test and the Wilcoxon signed rank test\\r\\nfor comparisons of patients\\xe2\\x80\\x99 quantitative results between the prestudy and study periods. We used the two sample t test and the\\r\\nMann-Whitney test for quantitative comparisons between different groups of patients. For comparisons of proportions of\\r\\npatients the equivalent tests were McNemar\\xe2\\x80\\x99s test and the \\x012 test.\\r\\nThe purpose of the non-parametric Wilcoxon and MannWhitney tests was to confirm the results of the t test, which, in\\r\\nbroad terms, was the outcome in each case. Because of\\r\\noccasional missing data for individual comparisons, the degrees\\r\\nof freedom of some t tests varied slightly from those to be\\r\\nexpected if all patients had supplied all items of data.\\r\\nResults\\r\\nIn all, 2530 patients from 49 practices were eligible (mean\\r\\n51/practice, range 8-119). Total practice populations ranged\\r\\nfrom 2150 to 14500 patients (mean 7831/practice). Only 60\\r\\n(2%) patients were excluded by their general practitioner (mainly\\r\\nbecause of terminal illness), leaving 2470 patients who were\\r\\ninvited to participate in the study, of whom 1888 (76%)\\r\\nresponded; 1156 declined to participate, and 732 agreed to\\r\\nattend an information session to discuss participation in the trial.\\r\\nOf those who initially agreed to attend, 48 (7%) did not attend\\r\\nthe information sessions and 45 (6%) were unwilling to provide\\r\\ninformed consent. A further 22 (3%) were excluded by researchers (figure).\\r\\nOf patients initially agreeing to attend the information\\r\\nsession, 617 (84%) gave written informed consent and were randomised to the intervention or routine care arm of the study\\r\\n(337 intervention, 280 routine care). The number of patients per\\r\\npractice randomised ranged from 2 to 35 (mean 13). Of all\\r\\npatients invited to take part in the study, 617/2470 (25%) were\\r\\nrecruited (10-63% per practice). Significantly more men than\\r\\nwomen were invited to enter the study (1366 (55%) male v 1104\\r\\n(45%) female, P < 0.001) and randomised into the study (400\\r\\n(65%) male v 217 (35%) female, P < 0.001). The mean age of\\r\\nthose invited to participate was 69 (range 18-95) compared with\\r\\na mean of 65 for those recruited (range 18-87). Routine care\\r\\npatients were older than intervention patients (66 v 64,\\r\\nP = 0.015). In the intervention group, the mean age of those\\r\\ncompleting training was significantly lower than that of those\\r\\ninitially randomised (61 v 64, P = 0.012).\\r\\nClinical indications for warfarin in rank order were atrial\\r\\nfibrillation, mechanical prosthetic heart valves, recurrent pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis, cardiomyopathy, and\\r\\ntransient ischaemic attack or stroke. We found no significant differences between intervention and routine care in terms of coronary risk factors. Hypertension was the most widespread risk\\r\\nfactor (143, 42% intervention v 136, 49% routine care), followed\\r\\nby hyperlipidaemia (84, 25% v 61, 22%).\\r\\nOf 337 patients randomised to intervention, 242 (72%)\\r\\nattended and successfully completed training. Ten (3%) did not\\r\\nattend training, 80 (24%) did not complete training, and five (1%)\\r\\nreached a study end point (three patients discontinued warfarin,\\r\\none patient withdrew consent, and one patient died). Main\\r\\nreasons for not completing training were difficulties with obtaining a large enough blood sample or placing it correctly on to the\\r\\ntest strip. Of the 242 patients who completed training, 193 (80%)\\r\\ncompleted the intervention. Thirty four (14%) patients did not\\r\\ncomplete the intervention, and 15 patients reached a study end\\r\\npoint (seven discontinued warfarin, four died, and four moved\\r\\naway).\\r\\nIn the routine care group, five patients had no data collected\\r\\n(one withdrew permission for data to be collected from the\\r\\nmedical records, one discontinued warfarin, two died, and one\\r\\nbegan to self monitor immediately after randomisation). Twenty\\r\\nfive patients reached a study end point (nine died, 14 discontinued warfarin, and two moved away). Of the 280 patients\\r\\nrandomised to routine care, 250 (89%) completed 12 months.\\r\\nThe mean frequency of testing before the study was 38.1\\r\\n(95% confidence interval 36 to 40.2) days in the intervention\\r\\ngroup and 37.9 (35.6 to 40.2) days in the routine care group.\\r\\nDuring the study period, the mean frequency of testing was 12.4\\r\\n(11.9 to 12.9) days in the intervention group and 37.9 (37.1 to\\r\\n40.1) days in the routine care group.\\r\\nAdverse events\\r\\nIntention to treat analysis\\r\\nWe had 582.1 patient years of follow-up for the intention to treat\\r\\nanalysis.

The incidence of thrombotic events was\\r\\n0.97/100 patient years (one graft thrombosis).\\r\\nTherapeutic INR control\\r\\nIn the intention to treat analysis, we found no significant\\r\\ndifferences mean percentage of time within the therapeutic\\r\\nrange for INR between pre-study and study periods in either the\\r\\nintervention arm (t320 = 1.57, P = 0.12) or the routine care arm\\r\\n(t255 = \\xe2\\x88\\x92 0.37, P = 0.71) (table 2). INR control based on mean percentage of time within the therapeutic range during the study\\r\\ndid not differ significantly between the intervention and routine\\r\\ncare groups (70% v 68%; t575 = 1.35, P = 0.18).\\r\\nIn the intention to treat patients, we found a significant\\r\\ndifference in the percentage of time within the therapeutic range\\r\\nfor INR in pre-study and study periods between patients with\\r\\ntherapeutic targets of 2.5 and 3.5 in both groups. Intervention\\r\\ngroup: pre-study 74% versus 45% (t319 = 7.46, P < 0.001); study\\r\\n74% versus 55% (t319 = 7.48, P < 0.001). Routine care: pre-study\\r\\n72% versus 52% (t254 = 3.70, P < 0.001); study 71% versus 53%\\r\\n(t254 = 4.70, P < 0.001).\\r\\nIn the intervention group patients with a target of 3.5, a significant improvement occurred between pre-study and study\\r\\n(45% v 55%; t65 = 2.77, P = 0.007). No significant difference\\r\\noccurred in intervention group patients with a target of 2.5 (73%\\r\\nv 74%; t254 = 0.29, P = 0.77) or the routine care patients with\\r\\neither a target of 2.5 (72% v 71%; t217 = \\xe2\\x88\\x92 0.44, P = 0.66) or a target of 3.5 (52% v 53%; t37 = 0.07, P = 0.94) (table 3).\\r\\nIf we examine the distributions of percentage of time in\\r\\nrange by centiles, patients in the intervention group who were\\r\\npoorly controlled at baseline (defined as time in range below the\\r\\nmedian) showed a significant increase from pre-study to study,\\r\\nwhereas those in the routine care group did not. The magnitude\\r\\nof this improvement was approximately 20% (95% confidence\\r\\ninterval 9% to 32%) for the 3.5 target group and around 15%\\r\\n(6% to 24%) for the 2.5 target group. In the routine care group a\\r\\nchange of 3-5% occurred in both 2.5 and 3.5 target groups.\\r\\nWe found no significant difference in the number of patients\\r\\nwithin their individual therapeutic range, based on the last INR\\r\\nresult recorded within the study period (intervention 70% v routine care 72%) (table 4). We found a significant difference in\\r\\npoint prevalence in the intervention group patients between\\r\\nthose with a target of 2.5 and those with a target of 3.5 (73% v\\r\\n60%; P = 0.05).\\r\\nFinally, table 5 records the differences evident in tables 2, 3,\\r\\nand 4 between intervention and routine care patient groups. In\\r\\nevery case but one no significant difference exists between results\\r\\nfrom the two groups. The only marginal exception is in the case\\r\\nof INR percentage time in range for the 2.5 therapeutic target\\r\\ngroup in the study phase of the trial. However, once adjustment\\r\\nis made for the difference in pre-study levels (recorded in the\\r\\nright hand column) a significant difference no longer exists. The\\r\\nsignificance of the effect of the intervention for the 3.5 therapeutic target group is inevitably reduced here because of the extra\\r\\nuncertainty included in the comparison.\\r\\nDiscussion\\r\\nThis study is the largest to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of\\r\\npatient self management of oral anticoagulation compared with\\r\\nroutine care. Study recruitment was non-selective; the comparator provided good control of international normalised ratio\\r\\n(INR), both enhancing generalisability and reflecting real life.\\r\\nOverall, only 25% of eligible patients were randomised. A recent\\r\\nsmaller Dutch clinic based study had a similar recruitment rate,16\\r\\nalthough a Spanish study managed to recruit nearly 50% of eligible patients.17 Whether the relatively low recruitment rate\\r\\nrelates to the demands of self management or the fact that\\r\\npatients were being asked to participate in a trial is not clear. In\\r\\nGermany, where self managed anticoagulation is routine, up to\\r\\n80% of patients are able to self manage.21 This may reflect the\\r\\nreimbursement system as well as the motivation and ability of\\r\\npatients to do self management.\\r\\nTraining\\r\\nOf those patients who were randomised to self management\\r\\nmost (72%) were able to complete training, and 78% of those\\r\\nwho started self management were able to complete 12 months.\\r\\nSelf management is therefore a feasible model of care for an\\r\\nappreciable proportion of patients.\\r\\nTable 2 Percentage of time (95% confidence interval) within therapeutic range for international normalised ratio and number of patient years\\r\\nPatient group Pre-study Study Change Patient years\\r\\nIntervention total (n=337) 68 (64.3 to 70.7) 70 (68.1 to 72.4) 2.50 (\\xe2\\x88\\x920.64 to 5.65) 318\\r\\nRoutine care (n=280) 69 (65.2 to 72.1) 68 (65.2 to 70.6) \\xe2\\x88\\x920.69 (\\xe2\\x88\\x924.35 to 2.96) 264\\r\\nOn treatment (n=242) 69 (65.2 to 72.6) 72 (69.5 to 73.7) 2.29 (\\xe2\\x88\\x921.26 to 5.85) 214\\r\\nOn-treatment dropouts (n=34) 61 (51.3 to 70.9) 61 (53.2 to 68.7) \\xe2\\x88\\x920.13 (\\xe2\\x88\\x9210.4 to 10.2) 17\\r\\nTable 3 Percentage of time (95% confidence interval) within therapeutic range for international normalised ratio, by therapeutic target\\r\\nPatient group Pre-study Study Change P value\\r\\nIntervention, target 2.5 (n=255) 74 (70.7 to 77.2) 74 (72.3 to 76.6) 0.51 (\\xe2\\x88\\x922.94 to 3.96) 0.77\\r\\nIntervention, target 3.5 (n=66) 45 (37.3 to 51.7) 55 (50.0 to 60.0) 10.21 (2.84 to 17.59) 0.007\\r\\nRoutine care, target 2.5 (n=218) 72 (68.0 to 75.3) 71 (67.8 to 73.7) \\xe2\\x88\\x920.88 (\\xe2\\x88\\x924.78 to 3.02) 0.66\\r\\nRoutine care, target 3.5 (n=38) 52 (42.2 to 62.1) 53 (45.3 to 60.0) 0.38 (\\xe2\\x88\\x9210.35 to 11.11) 0.94\\r\\nTable 4 Percentage (95% confidence interval) of patients within their individual therapeutic range for international normalised ratio, and number of patient\\r\\nyears\\r\\nPatient group Pre-study Study Change Patient years\\r\\nIntervention, total (n=337) 73 (67.9 to 77.6) 70 (64.8 to 74.8) \\xe2\\x88\\x924 (\\xe2\\x88\\x9210.6 to 2.7) 318\\r\\nRoutine care (n=279) 75 (69.3 to 79.8) 72 (66.3 to 77.1) \\xe2\\x88\\x924 (\\xe2\\x88\\x9211.6 to 2.6) 264\\r\\nOn treatment (n=242) 76 (70.1 to 81.2) 72 (65.7 to 77.4) \\xe2\\x88\\x924 (\\xe2\\x88\\x9211.1 to 3.6) 214\\r\\nOn-treatment dropouts (n=34) 65 (46.4 to80.3) 56 (37.9 to72.8) \\xe2\\x88\\x929 (\\xe2\\x88\\x9227.6 to 10.3) 17\\r\\nPrimary care\\r\\npage 4 of 6 BMJ Online First bmj.com\\r\\n on 6 October 2019 by guest.

Patients\\r\\nwho completed the intervention were younger than those\\r\\nrandomised. Around half of the study patients had atrial fibrillation as their primary indication for warfarin.\\r\\nTherapeutic control\\r\\nWe found no overall significant differences between the study\\r\\narms for the primary outcome measure. Therapeutic INR\\r\\ncontrol was good in both arms; both groups spent around 70%\\r\\nof time within their therapeutic range, which is comparable to\\r\\nthe Dutch study (68.6% in the self management group) and significantly better than the Spanish group (58.6%).16 17 In keeping\\r\\nwith previous studies, patients with a target INR of 3.5\\r\\n(principally patients with mechanical heart valves) had poorer\\r\\ntherapeutic control than those with a target INR of 2.5. Examining the change from pre-study to study for self managed patients\\r\\nseparately for those with targets of 2.5 and 3.5 revealed that\\r\\nthose with poorer control, as monitored by time in range,\\r\\nimproved from pre-study to study. The improvement was\\r\\napproximately 15% in the 2.5 target group and 20% in the 3.5\\r\\ntarget group. This was not the case in the routine care group. Self\\r\\nmanagement is thus an effective and safe model of care for\\r\\npatients who have been trained appropriately and may even represent the model of choice for patients who are poorly controlled in routine care.\\r\\nRoutine care\\r\\nPatients in the routine care group were managed through a variety of different models, ranging from hospital outpatient clinics\\r\\nto primary care clinics. The therapeutic control seen compared\\r\\nfavourably with previously published data.5 Adverse event rates\\r\\nalso compared favourably with previously published international data; the overall adverse event rate was 2.8% compared\\r\\nwith 7.3% in the Spanish study and approximately 4.5% in the\\r\\nDutch study.16 17 22 The comparator to self management in this\\r\\nstudy was therefore robust.\\r\\nLimitations\\r\\nThe study was limited, as are other studies, by the parameters set\\r\\ndown for patients doing self management. Patients were asked to\\r\\ndo an INR test every two weeks, with weekly testing\\r\\nrecommended after a dose change. Although this makes\\r\\ncomparison with routine care problematic, it reflects the reality\\r\\nof the current models of service provision. The three month\\r\\nclinical reviews generally worked well, but again there were a few\\r\\npatients who had difficulty attending these sessions.\\r\\nOnly 25% of patients agreed to participate, but this probably\\r\\nreflects reluctance to participate in a trial and a high level of satisfaction with current services rather than a reluctance to self\\r\\nmanage. A quarter of patients did not complete training,\\r\\nhowever, and a further fifth withdrew prematurely, which\\r\\nsuggests that barriers to self management exist above and\\r\\nbeyond those to taking part in research. The findings warrant\\r\\nfurther research before self monitoring is commissioned more\\r\\nwidely in the UK (as in Germany), as demand from patients may\\r\\nbe limited.\\r\\nConclusions\\r\\nFor an appreciable number of motivated patients on oral anticoagulation, self management is a safe and realisable alternative to\\r\\nexisting models of care in healthcare systems with high quality\\r\\nroutine anticoagulation management. This model of care is particularly effective for treating patients with poor INR control,\\r\\nwho are a difficult population to manage and are at risk of\\r\\nadverse events. Now that self management for anticoagulation\\r\\nhas been shown to be as safe and effective as routine care, it\\r\\nwould be valid to test whether this reassurance alters patients\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\r\\n(and health professionals\\xe2\\x80\\x99) equipoise in considering whether to\\r\\naccept self management in this context.\\r\\nContributors: DAF was the principal investigator, wrote the first draft, and is\\r\\nthe guarantor.

       "       b'Patient self-testing is a reliable and acceptable alternative to\\r\\nlaboratory INR monitoring\\r\\nIt is likely that approximately 950 000 people in the UK\\r\\ncurrently receive oral anticoagulant therapy (OAT), with this\\r\\nnumber estimated to increase at approximately 10% /year\\r\\n(Rose, 1996). Warfarin is the most widely used oral anticoagulant in the UK and has a half-life of 36\\xe2\\x80\\x9342 h. The increased\\r\\nusage of warfarin is largely related to implementation of longterm anticoagulation in an ageing population for atrial\\r\\nfibrillation (Petersen et al, 1989). Newer indications include\\r\\nprimary prevention of ischaemic heart disease (MacCallum\\r\\net al, 2000) and long-term prevention of recurrent venous\\r\\nthromboembolism (Ridker et al, 2003). Consequently, several\\r\\nmodels of patient care, involving various degrees of decentralization, have been suggested to manage the increased\\r\\nworkload arising from the increased demand. One solution is\\r\\npatient self-testing (PST), i.e. the measurement of the\\r\\nprothrombin time (PT) expressed as an international normalized ratio (INR) by the patients themselves using capillary\\r\\nblood samples on small point of care (POC) coagulation\\r\\nmonitors. Such monitors need to be accurate over the full\\r\\ntherapeutic range of the INR, between 2\\xc3\\x860\\xe2\\x80\\x934\\xc3\\x865, and require an\\r\\nacceptable independent evaluation (Fitzmaurice & Machin,\\r\\n2001). A number of studies have proved comparability\\r\\nbetween POC testing and conventional laboratory techniques\\r\\nbased on POC testing by healthcare professionals (Bachour\\r\\net al, 2001; Vacas et al, 2001; Havrda et al, 2002; Shiach et al,\\r\\n2002; Loebstein et al, 2003; Jackson et al, 2004), whereas\\r\\nChris Gardiner,1 Karen Williams,1\\r\\nIan J.

One solution is patient self-testing (PST) of the international\\r\\nnormalized ratio (INR) using capillary blood samples on point-of-care\\r\\ncoagulation monitors at home. We conducted a prospective study to\\r\\ndetermine whether patients can achieve accurate INR values through PST,\\r\\nusing the CoaguChek S (Roche Diagnostics, Lewes, UK). The main outcome\\r\\nmeasurements were: comparability of INR values obtained by PST and the\\r\\nhospital laboratory, patient acceptability as assessed by a questionnaire and\\r\\nanticoagulant control. Eighty-four patients [53 men, 31 women; median age\\r\\n59 years (range 26\\xe2\\x80\\x9383)], receiving long-term oral anticoagulation (warfarin),\\r\\nwere recruited from our Anticoagulation Clinic. Patients were randomized to\\r\\nweekly self-testing or continuing 4-weekly hospital laboratory monitoring of\\r\\nINR. Comparison of INRs (n \\xc2\\xbc 234) showed no significant differences\\r\\nbetween the CoaguChek (median INR 3\\xc3\\x8602) and laboratory testing (median\\r\\nINR 3\\xc3\\x8607). There was excellent correlation between the two methods\\r\\n(r \\xc2\\xbc 0\\xc3\\x8695), with 85% of CoaguChek results within 0\\xc3\\x865 INR units of the\\r\\nlaboratory method. On four occasions, differences of >1 unit INR were\\r\\nobtained, but in each case the patient\\xe2\\x80\\x99s anticoagulation was unstable (INR\\r\\n>4\\xc3\\x865 by both methods) and the differences in INR would not have altered\\r\\npatient management. 87% of patients found self-testing straightforward, 87%\\r\\nwere confident in the result they obtained and 77% preferred self-testing. We\\r\\nconclude that PST is a reliable alternative to hospital clinic attendance and is\\r\\nacceptable to the majority of suitably trained patients.\\r\\nKeywords: anticoagulation, international normalized ratio.\\r\\nresearch paper\\r\\ndoi:10.1111/j.1365-2141.2004.05300.x \\xc2\\xaa 2004 Blackwell Publishing Ltd, British Journal of Haematology, 128, 242\\xe2\\x80\\x93247\\r\\nothers have questioned the reliability of POC test INR results\\r\\n(Poller et al, 2003; Vacas et al, 2003). Of note, INR results\\r\\nobtained by technically skilled healthcare professionals using\\r\\nPOC testing devices have been reported to be more reliable\\r\\nthan those achieved by non-technical trained individuals\\r\\n(Delaney et al, 1999). There is a paucity of data on the\\r\\ncomparison of INR results obtained by PST with laboratory\\r\\nINRs. White et al (1989) reported, in a study on 26 patients\\r\\nand based on results during the first 8 weeks of OAT,\\r\\ncomparison of INRs obtained by self-testing using a Coumatrack monitor (Du Pont, Wilmington, DE, USA) with those\\r\\nfrom hospital laboratories. However, comparisons between\\r\\nPST INR and laboratory INR were not performed on the same\\r\\nsample, limiting conclusions from this study. There are no\\r\\npublished evaluation studies on the reliability of PST within\\r\\nthe setting of a routine anticoagulant clinic in the UK.\\r\\nWe report data from a prospective trial, commissioned by\\r\\nthe Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency\\r\\n(MHRA) and approved by the British Committee for Standards in Haematology (BCSH) Haemostasis and Thrombosis\\r\\nTask Force, to investigate the accuracy and acceptability of PST\\r\\nin a trained and motivated group of patients.\\r\\nPatients and methods\\r\\nEthical approval was granted by the Joint University College\\r\\nLondon (UCL)/UCL Hospital (UCLH) Committees on the\\r\\nEthics of Human Research and patients gave informed\\r\\nconsent. Eighty-four patients were recruited from the UCLH\\r\\nHaematology Department Anticoagulant Clinic between September 2002 and April 2003.\\r\\nEligibility\\r\\nAll patients over the age of 18 years, attending the clinic, who\\r\\nhad received long-term oral anticoagulation for at least\\r\\n8 months and with a previous record of good compliance,\\r\\nwere identified. Approximately 800 patients were contacted by\\r\\nletter; 84 of these volunteered for the study and, following\\r\\nwritten consent, were prospectively randomly allocated to the\\r\\nintervention (PST) or control group (continuing with laboratory testing with no specific education or training).\\r\\nProtocol\\r\\nSelf-testing patients were trained by a single nurse practitioner\\r\\nin the use of a POC coagulometer (CoaguChek S; Roche\\r\\nDiagnostics) (Sawicki, 1999). Patients attended two training\\r\\nsessions at least 1 week apart, which covered theoretical aspects\\r\\nof oral anticoagulation and POC INR monitoring. Following a\\r\\nsatisfactory assessment of their ability to self-test, they\\r\\nproceeded to the trial (Murray et al, 2004). These patients\\r\\ntested themselves at home once a week and recorded the result\\r\\nfor a 6-month period. The results obtained by self-testing were\\r\\nnot used for management of anticoagulation during the study.\\r\\nAnticoagulant control was based on a laboratory test performed every 4 weeks. Self-test and laboratory INR tests used\\r\\nfor comparability studies were collected within 1 h of each\\r\\nother. The control group simply attended the anticoagulant\\r\\nclinic every 4 weeks or more frequently, if clinically indicated.\\r\\nThe purpose of the control group was to control for possible\\r\\nbiases because of selection and the effect of increased patient\\r\\ntraining. Dosage adjustments were performed for both groups\\r\\nof patients by the anticoagulant clinic staff using the laboratory\\r\\nINR and computer-assisted dosing (Dawn Clinical Software,\\r\\nMilnthorpe, Cumbria, UK). The PST group performed internal quality control (QC) tests (CoaguChek PT Control; Roche\\r\\nDiagnostics) every week and an external quality assessment\\r\\nusing a lyophilized plasma preparation provided by the UK\\r\\nNational External Quality Assessment Scheme (UK NEQAS),\\r\\nonce during the study (Murray et al, 2003). Patients in the selftesting group were asked to complete a patient acceptability\\r\\nquestionnaire after 3\\xe2\\x80\\x934 months. The questionnaire sought\\r\\nindividual patient\\xe2\\x80\\x99s views on six aspects of using the CoaguChek S: ease of use, frequency of repeated tests, difficulty of\\r\\ngetting an adequate sample, ease of the use of QC materials,\\r\\nconfidence in the result and preference for home testing versus\\r\\nhospital testing.\\r\\nProthrombin time/INR measurement\\r\\nVenous blood was collected into one-tenth volume 0\\xc3\\x86105 mol/\\r\\nl citrate (Vacutainer\\x01; Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ,\\r\\nUSA) using 19 or 21 gauge needles and minimal stasis and\\r\\nplasma was obtained by centrifugation at 2000 g for 10 min.\\r\\nTo measure the INR, a recombinant human thromboplastin\\r\\nreagent (Innovin; Dade Behring, Marburg, Germany) was used\\r\\non a CA-1500 coagulometer (Sysmex, Kobe, Japan). The\\r\\ngeometric mean was determined using blood from 20 healthy\\r\\nnormal volunteers and the thromboplastin-specific international sensitivity index provided by the manufacturer was\\r\\nverified using frozen INR verification plasmas (Precision\\r\\nBiologic, Dartmouth, Canada).\\r\\nAssessment of anticoagulant control. The different testing\\r\\nfrequencies used for PST, laboratory control and laboratory\\r\\nresults in the previous 6 months made direct comparison of\\r\\nthe time spent in the therapeutic range difficult, but this\\r\\nremained an important issue. Routine clinical practice\\r\\nrecommends the use of a target INR-value rather than a\\r\\ntarget range (Haemostasis and Thrombosis Task Force of the\\r\\nBCSH, 1998). For the purposes of this exercise, the target\\r\\nINR \\xc5\\x920\\xc3\\x865 INR units was used as an acceptable therapeutic\\r\\nrange. Time in range was determined using the time in range\\r\\ncalculator software (4S Dawn Clinical Software) using the\\r\\nmethod of Rosendaal et al (1993).\\r\\nStatistics. Statistical analysis was performed using analyse-itTM\\r\\nsoftware (Analyse-It Software, Leeds, UK). Mean INR values\\r\\nwere compared using a paired t-test, with statistical\\r\\nPatient Self-testing of INR\\r\\n\\xc2\\xaa 2004 Blackwell Publishing Ltd, British Journal of Haematology, 128, 242\\xe2\\x80\\x93247 243\\r\\nsignificance defined as P < 0\\xc3\\x8605. For the regression analysis,\\r\\noutliers were rejected where they were outside the 95%\\r\\nconfidence interval. Bland and Altman plots were used to\\r\\nillustrate the degree of agreement or divergence between the\\r\\ntwo methods, as the numerical value increased. Fisher\\xe2\\x80\\x99s exact\\r\\ntest was used to test the significance of the difference between\\r\\nthe observed time in therapeutic range between patient groups.\\r\\nResults\\r\\nEighty-four patients were randomized to the study; 44 to the\\r\\nself-testing group and 40 to the control group. Patient\\r\\ndemographics, target INR values and indications for anticoagulation were similar for both groups (Table I), although it\\r\\nwas notable that the median age of the control and self-testing\\r\\ngroups (58\\xc3\\x864 and 57\\xc3\\x869 years, respectively) was lower than that\\r\\nof the anticoagulant clinic population as a whole (65\\xc3\\x867 years).\\r\\nFour patients experienced difficulty performing self-testing\\r\\nand did not proceed onto the study following training. One\\r\\nfurther patient, randomized to the self-testing group, did not\\r\\nattend training. Therefore, of the 44 patients randomized to\\r\\nthe self-testing group, 39 commenced self-testing, whereas all\\r\\npatients randomized to the control group entered the study.\\r\\nNine self-testing patients and one from the control group\\r\\nfailed to complete the study (Table II). There were no\\r\\nsignificant differences between self-testing and laboratory\\r\\nINRs (234 paired measurements in 31 self-testing patients),\\r\\n(Table III). Excellent correlation was obtained between the\\r\\nmethods (r \\xc2\\xbc 0\\xc3\\x8695; Fig 1) and no trend was observed with\\r\\nincreasing INR-value (Fig 2). Overall, 85% of the results was\\r\\nwithin 0\\xc3\\x865 INR units of each other. On four occasions,\\r\\ndifferences of >1 unit INR were obtained, but in each case the\\r\\nINR was above the desired therapeutic range (INR >4\\xc3\\x865 by\\r\\nboth methods) and the differences in INR would not have\\r\\naltered patient management.\\r\\nNo significant difference between percentage time in therapeutic range in the self-testing and control groups was\\r\\nobserved using Fisher\\xe2\\x80\\x99s exact test (Table IV), irrespective of\\r\\nwhether the laboratory or CoaguChek methods were studied.\\r\\nTen minor bleeding/bruising events were reported, with five\\r\\nfrom each group. Overanticoagulation was thought to be a\\r\\ncontributory factor in five of these events (three in the selftesting group and two in the control group).\\r\\nQuestionnaires were returned by all 31 patients who were\\r\\nstill self-testing after 3 months (one of these failed to complete\\r\\nthe study, because of the moving from the area). Majority of\\r\\nthe patients (84%) initially found it difficult to obtain an\\r\\nadequate sample, but most of them subsequently found selftesting very easy (55%) or quite easy (32%). Only one patient\\r\\nfound the CoaguChek S difficult to use, but most patients\\r\\nfound that they occasionally had to repeat tests and some still\\r\\nexperienced difficulty in obtaining an adequate sample (16%).\\r\\nMost patients (87%) were confident in the result that they\\r\\nobtained and, of those who expressed a preference, most\\r\\n(77%) preferred self-testing rather than attending the hospital\\r\\nanticoagulant clinic. None of the patients experienced difficulty using the internal QC procedure.

During the\\r\\ncourse of the study, one instrument defect and one test-strip\\r\\nproblem were encountered. On each occasion, both the\\r\\npatient\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sample and the QC gave unexpected abnormal results\\r\\nand the problem, once identified, was easily corrected.\\r\\nHowever, on other occasions, abnormal QC values were\\r\\nobtained despite the patient\\xe2\\x80\\x99s own result demonstrating\\r\\nadequate control of anticoagulation. No instrument or teststrip defects were demonstrated on these occasions. The\\r\\nNEQAS samples produced a narrower range of results\\r\\n(percentage CV 7\\xc3\\x864% and 6\\xc3\\x866% for two separate exercises).\\r\\nDiscussion\\r\\nWe have showed that suitably trained patients can obtain their\\r\\nINR by PST using the CoaguChek S, currently the most widely\\r\\nused handheld PT/INR monitor in the UK. The PST results\\r\\nshowed excellent correlation with routine hospital laboratory\\r\\nmonitoring of OAT (r \\xc2\\xbc 0\\xc3\\x8693), with 85% of results within 0\\xc3\\x865\\r\\nINR units of each other. On the four occasions where\\r\\ndifferences of >1 unit INR were obtained, the INR was above\\r\\nthe desired therapeutic range (INR >4\\xc3\\x865 by both methods) and\\r\\nwould not have altered patient management. The INR system\\r\\nis known to be unreliable above 4\\xc3\\x865, limiting comparisons\\r\\nbetween different methods above this level (WHO Expert\\r\\nCommittee on Biological Standardisation, 1983). Neither\\r\\nsignificant differences in anticoagulant control were observed\\r\\nbetween the self-testing and control groups during the study,\\r\\nnor between results obtained in individual patients during the\\r\\nstudy period and the previous 6 months. This is in contrast\\r\\nwith the findings of White et al (1989) who reported that an\\r\\nimprovement in OAT could be achieved through PST alone.\\r\\nAnother study evaluated the accuracy of home testing, but\\r\\non a paediatric population (n \\xc2\\xbc 23) with home testing\\r\\nperformed by parents of children receiving OAT (Massicotte\\r\\net al, 1995) using the Biotrack monitor (Ciba Corning\\r\\nDiagnostics, Medfield, MA, USA). In a recent study of patients\\r\\nreceiving phenprocoumon (half-life 140 h) in the Netherlands,\\r\\na comparison of PST with patient self-management versus\\r\\nspecialized anticoagulant clinic management showed comparable levels of OAT control, as judged by mean time in range in\\r\\nFig 2.

However, paired PST\\r\\nand laboratory INR results were not directly compared.\\r\\nAlthough the number of patients who failed to complete the\\r\\nstudy was higher in the self-testing group than the control\\r\\ngroup (nine versus one), most patients found self-testing using\\r\\nthe CoaguChek S straightforward and felt confident with the\\r\\nresult they obtained (87%) and also expressed a preference for\\r\\nself-testing over attendance at the hospital anticoagulation\\r\\nclinic (77%).\\r\\nIt was generally felt that weekly QC testing was not costeffective, as the manufacturer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s stated range was too wide and\\r\\npoor level of imprecision was obtained. Furthermore, most\\r\\nout-of-range QC results were because of problems with the use\\r\\nand preparation of the QC reagent, rather than instrument/\\r\\ntest-strip faults. Monthly testing, as recommended by the\\r\\nBCSH recommendations (Fitzmaurice & Machin, 2001), may\\r\\nbe more appropriate with additional testing performed in the\\r\\nevent of an unexpected INR result, following possible monitor\\r\\ndamage and on starting a new box of test strips. As the NEQAS\\r\\nsamples produced a narrower range of results, they were\\r\\ngenerally perceived to be of more value than the internal QC.\\r\\nOccasional paired PST and laboratory testing or comparison\\r\\nwith a regularly quality controlled instrument in clinic may be\\r\\na useful alternative for ensuring adequate quality assurance.\\r\\nThe present study only assessed one particular POC INR\\r\\nmonitor. However, as patient demand for self-testing/selfmanagement becomes more widespread, monitoring devices\\r\\nfrom other manufacturers should become more widely available. Test strips for POC INR monitors may now be prescribed\\r\\non the Drug Tariff, subject to appropriate European Economic\\r\\nCommunity licensing (i.e. CE marking). However, it is\\r\\nrecommended that before such instruments are introduced\\r\\ninto clinical practice, they should have a satisfactory independent evaluation. The patient training on the use of such\\r\\ndevices needs to follow nationally agreed guidelines and\\r\\nrecommendations (Near Patient Testing Working Party.\\r\\nGeneral Haematology Task Force of BCSH. Thrombosis and\\r\\nHaemostasis Task Force of BCSH, 1995; Fitzmaurice &\\r\\nMachin, 2001). The cost-effectiveness of self-testing has not\\r\\nyet been formally studied in the UK. In addition to instrument\\r\\nand test-strip costs, any economic assessment must include\\r\\nelements, such as transport, for the patient and clinic\\r\\noverheads, the potential for improved anticoagulant control\\r\\nwith the reduced risk of thromboembolic or haemorrhagic\\r\\ncomplications, greater patient freedom and reduction in lost\\r\\npatient working time. The overall uptake for this trial was\\r\\napproximately 10% only. Some patients were apprehensive\\r\\nabout entering a clinical trial, while others felt that allocation\\r\\nto the control group offered no advantages but required more\\r\\nfrequent visits to clinic, but the low uptake suggests that the\\r\\nroutine clinical utilization of such a self-testing programme\\r\\nmay be limited to a minority of motivated patients receiving\\r\\nlong-term oral anticoagulation.\\r\\nWe conclude that PST using the CoaguChek S offers a\\r\\nreliable alternative to laboratory determination of INR and is\\r\\nacceptable to the majority of suitably trained patients who\\r\\npreviously attended a specialist anticoagulation clinic. Overall,\\r\\nthese results are reassuring and should encourage implementation of a validated self-testing approach using a CoaguChek S\\r\\nsystem. This will potentially enable patients to progress to selfmanage their own oral anticoagulant control using an agreed\\r\\ndosing algorithm. It is important that all self-testing patients\\r\\nremain registered with a clinician/nurse practitioner responsible for their oral anticoagulation regime in accordance with\\r\\nBCSH guidance (Fitzmaurice & Machin, 2001). Future MHRA\\r\\nstudies will assess the efficacy of a patient self-management\\r\\nprogramme.\\r\\nAcknowledgements\\r\\nThe authors are grateful for the funding from the Medicines\\r\\nand Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency and an unrestricted educational grant from Roche Diagnostics.\\r\\nCompeting interests: none.\\r\\nReferences\\r\\nBachour, R., Gardiner, C., Mackie, I.J. & Machin, S.J.

The PSM group members were instructed to monitor their serum\\r\\ninternational normalized ratio (INR) at community laboratories and to\\r\\nadjust their warfarin doses independently using provided nomograms.\\r\\nEducation on warfarin dose adjustment was limited to a single 15-minute\\r\\noffice visit.\\r\\nMain outcome measures\\xe2\\x80\\x82 The primary outcome was the proportion\\r\\nof INR values in the therapeutic range among participants. Feasibility\\r\\noutcomes included proportion of eligible patients consenting, patients\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\r\\npreference of management strategy, patients\\xe2\\x80\\x99 satisfaction, and visits or\\r\\nphone communication with physicians regarding dose adjustment. Safety\\r\\noutcomes included bleeding or thromboembolic events.\\r\\nResults\\xe2\\x80\\x82 Eleven patients completed the trial, contributing 99 patientmonths of monitoring and providing 122 INR measures. The mean\\r\\nproportion of INR values in therapeutic range among subjects in the\\r\\nPSM and physician-management groups was 82% and 80%, respectively\\r\\n(P = .82). The improvement in patient satisfaction with PSM was not\\r\\nsignificant. Ten of the 11 patients preferred PSM to physician management\\r\\nand elected to continue with this strategy after study completion (P=.001).\\r\\nNo calls or visits were made to the physician regarding dose adjustment\\r\\nduring the PSM period. There were no episodes of major bleeding or\\r\\nthromboembolic events.\\r\\nConclusion\\xe2\\x80\\x82 Patient self-management was not demonstrated to be\\r\\nsuperior to standard care, but was easily implemented and was the\\r\\nmethod preferred by patients. Our feasibility outcomes justify a larger trial\\r\\nand suggest that subject recruitment and protocol adherence would not\\r\\npose barriers for such a study.\\r\\nTrial registration number\\xe2\\x80\\x82NCT00925028 (ClinicalTrials.gov).\\r\\nEDITOR\\xe2\\x80\\x99S KEY POINTS\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Maintenance of a therapeutic international normalized ratio (INR) in patients\\r\\nhas proven to be difficult, with patients\\r\\nspending an average of only 57% to\\r\\n66% of the time within the therapeutic\\r\\nrange. Patient self-management (PSM) is a\\r\\nconcept in which patients obtain their INR\\r\\nvalues directly and adjust their warfarin\\r\\ndoses independently.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Data from randomized controlled trials\\r\\n(RCTs) examining PSM have consistently\\r\\nshown an increased proportion of INR\\r\\nvalues in the therapeutic range; decreased\\r\\nrates of thromboembolic events and major\\r\\nhemorrhage; and, in one study, a mortality benefit. Further, it has been shown\\r\\nthat patients are more satisfied with PSM\\r\\nstrategies, that PSM is cost-effective, and\\r\\nthat PSM is superior to both usual care and\\r\\ncare from tertiary anticoagulation clinics.\\r\\nDespite this, PSM has not been adopted\\r\\nin routine primary care in Canada, possibly because of its reliance on expensive\\r\\npersonal coagulation analyzers and tertiary\\r\\nhospital-based education programs.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 The primary objective was to determine\\r\\nwhether a PSM strategy implemented in\\r\\na typical Canadian family practice clinic\\r\\ncould reliably and consistently maintain\\r\\ntherapeutic INR values; results showed that\\r\\na simple PSM strategy in a typical primary\\r\\ncare practice with no additional resources\\r\\nis feasible and was preferred by patients.\\r\\nVol 57: August \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 ao\\xc3\\xbbt 2011 | Canadian Family Physician \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Le M\\xc3\\xa9decin de famille canadien e293\\r\\nAutogestion par le patient\\r\\ndu traitement \\xc3\\xa0 la warfarine\\r\\n\\xc3\\x89tude de faisabilit\\xc3\\xa9 pragmatique en contexte de soins primaires au Canada\\r\\nBrian E.

Since the introduction of warfarin into routine clinical practice, maintenance of a therapeutic international normalized ratio\\r\\n(INR) in patients has proven to be difficult, with patients\\r\\nspending an average of only 57% to 66% of the time\\r\\nwithin the therapeutic range.1\\r\\nPatient self-management (PSM) is a concept in which\\r\\npatients obtain their INR values directly and adjust their\\r\\nwarfarin doses independently. Data from randomized\\r\\ncontrolled trials (RCTs) examining PSM have consistently shown an increased proportion of INR values in\\r\\ntherapeutic range,2-7 decreased rates of thromboembolic\\r\\nevents and substantial hemorrhages,2,8 and in one\\r\\nstudy a mortality benefit.9 Further, it has been shown\\r\\nthat patients are more satisfied with PSM strategies,2,10\\r\\nthat PSM is cost-effective,11 and that PSM is superior to\\r\\nboth usual care3,5 and care from tertiary anticoagulation clinics.6,7 A recent systematic review found that the\\r\\naverage time in the therapeutic range for PSM was 72%\\r\\ncompared with 50% in community settings.1 Guidelines\\r\\nfrom the American College of Chest Physicians state\\r\\nthat \\xe2\\x80\\x9cin patients who are suitably selected and trained,\\r\\nPST [patient self-testing] or PSM is an effective alternative treatment model. We suggest that such therapeutic\\r\\nmanagement be implemented where suitable.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d12\\r\\nIn consideration of implementing PSM strategies\\r\\nin Canada, there are several points to examine. First,\\r\\nall RCTs examining PSM involved extensive training,\\r\\nwith nurse clinicians or specialized physicians at tertiary care centres to educate participants in the fundamentals of warfarin therapy and adjustment regimens\\r\\nand offered patient support. These resources are simply unavailable to Canadian family physicians. Second,\\r\\nelectronic INR testing devices were provided to all\\r\\npatients, which would cost each patient approximately\\r\\n$1000 with the additional cost of testing strips. Third,\\r\\nbenefit from PSM implementation in a typical Canadian\\r\\nsetting could be substantial. A Canadian study designed\\r\\nto examine a more pragmatic method of PSM is clearly\\r\\nnecessary.\\r\\nIn light of this, we conducted a practical open-label\\r\\nrandomized crossover trial using a PSM strategy that\\r\\nincorporated outpatient laboratory monitoring (rather\\r\\nthan point-of-care devices) and PSM education limited\\r\\nto 1 office visit. The primary objective was to determine whether a PSM strategy implemented in a typical Canadian family practice clinic could reliably and\\r\\nconsistently maintain therapeutic INR values. We also\\r\\nsought to determine patient preference for treatment\\r\\nstrategy and to evaluate the feasibility of conducting a\\r\\nlarge-scale RCT of similar design.\\r\\nMETHODS\\r\\nStudy design and population\\r\\nThe study was approved by the Ethics Committee at\\r\\nthe University of British Columbia in Vancouver, and\\r\\ninformed written consent was obtained from all participants. Patients were recruited from a private family\\r\\npractice in British Columbia. All patients receiving warfarin therapy were considered for participation. Inclusion\\r\\ncriteria included age older than 18 years, warfarin therapy that preceded the study for more than 3 months and\\r\\nthat would be expected to continue for the duration of\\r\\nthe study, previous record of compliance with medication, and competence judged by demonstrated ability\\r\\nto use drug-adjustment nomograms (Table 1). Patients\\r\\nwere excluded on the basis of severe psychiatric disease,\\r\\nserious language barrier, poor visual acuity, or the primary care physician\\xe2\\x80\\x99s judgment that the patient would\\r\\nbe a poor candidate for the study.\\r\\nTable 1. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSHEET E\\xe2\\x80\\x9d dose-adjustment nomogram for daily 4-mg dose of warfarin (4 pink-coloured pills*)\\r\\nINR range DOSE ADJUSTMENT follow-up\\r\\nBelow 1.5 Take an extra 5 mg (1 peach-coloured pill*) today AND switch to SHEET G (5 mg/d)\\r\\ntomorrow\\r\\n 1 wk\\r\\n1.5-1.9 Switch to SHEET F (4.5 mg/d) 1 wk\\r\\n 2.0-3.0 No change 2 wk\\r\\n3.1-3.9 No change; if still above 3 at follow-up, switch to SHEET D (3.5 mg/d) 1 wk\\r\\n4.0-5.0 Do not take tomorrow\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dose; switch to SHEET D (3.5 mg/d) 2-5 d\\r\\nAbove 5 Contact doctor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office\\r\\nINR\\xe2\\x80\\x94international normalized ratio.\\r\\n*Warfarin was prescribed to patients in the form of 5-mg (peach-coloured) and 1-mg (pink-coloured) tablets.\\r\\nVol 57: August \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 ao\\xc3\\xbbt 2011 | Canadian Family Physician \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Le M\\xc3\\xa9decin de famille canadien e295\\r\\nPatient self-management of warfarin therapy | Research\\r\\nAn open-label crossover design was used and participants were randomly assigned to 2 groups using computerized random selection. Group A was assigned to\\r\\nPSM and Group B to physician anticoagulation management (usual care); later, the treatment strategies were\\r\\nreversed. The duration of each stage (PSM and usual\\r\\ncare) was 4.5 months (126 days).\\r\\nPatient education and scheduled office visits\\r\\nA total of 3 scheduled office visits of 15 minutes\\xe2\\x80\\x99 duration took place, with 1 visit allocated for patient education. During the first visit, the consent form and the trial\\r\\nwere discussed. The second visit was used to determine\\r\\nthe patient\\xe2\\x80\\x99s willingness to participate and, if randomized to Group A, to educate the patient briefly on the\\r\\nfundamentals of anticoagulation therapy and to explain\\r\\nthe strategy of PSM. The study commenced the day of\\r\\nthe second office visit. A third office visit took place midstudy, at which time patients in Group B were educated\\r\\nin PSM methods and patients in Group A relinquished\\r\\ntheir PSM materials.\\r\\nPatient self-management\\r\\nAll bloodwork was done at community laboratories, which\\r\\nwere unaware of treatment assignments. Arrangements\\r\\nwere made for patients in the PSM group to receive their\\r\\nINR results either by mail or in person. A PSM binder\\r\\ngiven to each patient included a simple instruction page, a\\r\\nprogress chart, and warfarin dose-adjustment nomograms\\r\\nfor 5 different doses (Figure 113). Nomograms instructed\\r\\npatients which dose to switch to if necessary and when to\\r\\nretest their blood. The investigators did not contact PSM\\r\\nparticipants to ensure they were changing doses properly\\r\\nor at the correct times. Warfarin was prescribed to patients\\r\\nin the form of 5-mg (peach-coloured) and 1-mg (pinkcoloured) tablets. Patients were instructed to contact the\\r\\noffice by phone or in person any time they were having difficulty with the PSM or if their INR value exceeded 5.\\r\\nFigure 1.

The number of days in the therapeutic\\r\\nrange was also determined. Feasibility end points included\\r\\ndetermination of the proportion of eligible patients consenting, the preferred management strategy of individual\\r\\npatients at the end of the study, a treatment-related satisfaction survey measuring 5 categories of quality of life,\\r\\nand additional office visits and phone calls pertaining to\\r\\nanticoagulation. Categories in the survey included medical treatment satisfaction, self-efficacy, general psychological distress, daily hassles, and strained social network;\\r\\nthe survey was completed by all participants immediately\\r\\nbefore and after the PSM phase. This survey has been\\r\\nused in similar studies and has been validated.2 Safety end\\r\\npoints included hemorrhagic or thromboembolic complications. Major and minor hemorrhages were defined by\\r\\nthe bleeding severity index described by Landefeld et al.14\\r\\nIf it became necessary for patients to suspend their warfarin therapy temporarily during the study, the duration of\\r\\ntime was recorded and INR value recording recommenced\\r\\n1 week after restarting therapy.\\r\\nStatistical analysis\\r\\nOutcomes were analyzed according to intention-to-treat\\r\\nprinciples and were conducted using SAS (Statistical\\r\\nAnalysis System), version 9.2. The primary effectiveness\\r\\noutcome was the proportion of individual INR values\\r\\nwithin target range for each subject according to treatment group. To calculate the proportion of time within\\r\\ntarget range, initial and final INR results were carried\\r\\nforward and backward to days 0 and 126, respectively,\\r\\nand linear interpolation was used. Comparisons were\\r\\nmade using the paired t test for both the proportion\\r\\nof INR results within range and when comparing time\\r\\nspent within the therapeutic INR range. These methods have been used in similar trials previously.2,4,7,8,10 For\\r\\nthe secondary outcome of patient satisfaction, the differences between preintervention and postintervention\\r\\nscores on 32 individual items and on 5 derived categories were compared using paired t tests. A sign test was\\r\\nalso used to assess whether the number of items showing increased postintervention satisfaction exceeded the\\r\\nnumber expected by chance. This feasibility study was\\r\\ndesigned to be conducted at a single site over the course\\r\\nof 9 months; therefore, no formal sample size calculation was performed because all eligible consenting\\r\\npatients were to be included.\\r\\nRESULTS\\r\\nThirty-two patients were identified, and 13 who fulfilled the\\r\\ninclusion and exclusion criteria were invited to participate.\\r\\nEleven patients agreed to participate and were enrolled\\r\\n(85%). The mean age of participants was 73 years, and 64%\\r\\nof participants had no education beyond high school (Table\\r\\n2). The study observed 99 patient-months of monitoring\\r\\nand recorded 122 INR measures (Table 3). When comparing\\r\\nthe mean proportion of INR values in the therapeutic range\\r\\namong the 2 groups, there was a non-significant difference\\r\\nof 2.2% (95% confidence interval 19.1 to 23.6) favouring\\r\\nPSM (P=.82), with values for PSM and usual care of 82.4%\\r\\nand 80.2%, respectively. A non-significant difference was\\r\\nalso found comparing the number of days in therapeutic\\r\\nrange per patient using PSM and usual care (P=.76), with\\r\\nresults of 82.2% and 79.7%, respectively (Figure 2).\\r\\nTable 2.

Ten participants (91%) identified preference\\r\\nfor PSM and were invited to continue with this strategy.\\r\\nOne participant (9%) elected to continue with physician\\r\\nmanagement (P=.001). There were no statistical differences in any of the categories of the quality-of-life survey when comparing PSM with usual care.\\r\\nNo additional office visits or phone support were\\r\\nrequired to assist patients in PSM. There were no thromboembolic complications, suggesting good protocol\\r\\nadherence and comfort. One episode of self-limited\\r\\nbleeding, defined as minor, occurred in 1 patient during\\r\\nthe PSM phase. During the PSM phase, 2 patients suspended warfarin therapy for a total of 35 patient-days\\r\\n(1% of the total patient-days) to undergo procedures.\\r\\nDISCUSSION\\r\\nWarfarin therapy has been shown to decrease the risk\\r\\nof complications in thrombogenic conditions, although\\r\\ncontrol of this drug in the therapeutic range is a serious\\r\\nchallenge. Patient self-management has proven to be an\\r\\neffective strategy, but typical implementation methods\\r\\nare not feasible in Canadian primary care practices. In\\r\\nour study we have shown that a simple PSM strategy in\\r\\na typical primary care practice with no additional resources is feasible and was preferred by patients; however,\\r\\nwe cannot conclude its superiority or noninferiority to\\r\\nstandard care with respect to INR control. This study justifies a large trial of similar design and has demonstrated\\r\\nthe feasibility of conducting such a trial in a communitybased setting as measured by high consent, established\\r\\npreference by patients, and minimal need for primary\\r\\ncare physicians\\xe2\\x80\\x99 involvement during the study.\\r\\nIn this study the proportion of days in the therapeutic\\r\\nrange for PSM and usual care were 82.2% and 79.7%,\\r\\nrespectively. These proportions are higher than either\\r\\nPSM in large clinical trials (72%)1 or usual care in primary care clinics (50%).1 A 6-month quality assessment\\r\\nof randomly selected patients taking warfarin in the\\r\\nstudy clinic (conducted before this study) showed that\\r\\n80% of days were within the target INR (unpublished\\r\\ndata). This suggests that management of the usual care\\r\\ngroup was not influenced by the study.\\r\\nThere were 2 significant differences between our\\r\\nstudy and large RCTs examining PSM. First, patient\\r\\neducation occurred during a single 15-minute office\\r\\nvisit rather than several extensive training sessions at\\r\\na tertiary care centre, which were standard in other\\r\\nRCTs.2,4,6-8,10,15 We believe that our simple instructional\\r\\n5\\r\\n4.5\\r\\n4\\r\\n3.5\\r\\n3\\r\\n2.5\\r\\n2\\r\\n1.5\\r\\n1\\r\\n0.5\\r\\n0\\r\\n0 20 40 60 80 100 120\\r\\nDAYS\\r\\nINR*\\r\\nFigure 2.

The mean age of the patient\\r\\npopulation in this study was similar to published values for populations receiving warfarin therapy,16 and the\\r\\nlevel of education was likely not above average for this\\r\\nage group (Table 1).\\r\\nSecond, INR values were obtained through community laboratory testing rather than point-of-care devices.\\r\\nPatients received their results either in person or through\\r\\nthe mail. Some difficulty was experienced in dealing with\\r\\nthe public hospital laboratory, as mailings to patients\\r\\nwere in a few instances delayed or not sent, requiring study investigators to contact laboratory management. This was in contrast to the local private laboratory\\r\\nin which there were no administrative errors. Patients\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\r\\nunimpeded access to their INR results would be critical in\\r\\nany future applications of this management strategy.\\r\\nWe found no statistical difference in general patient\\r\\nsatisfaction between the PSM and the usual care groups.\\r\\nThis is in contrast to 2 previous studies using the same\\r\\nsurvey. One study reported statistical improvement in all\\r\\n5 categories10 and a second in 4 categories.2 Our study\\r\\nwas likely underpowered to detect these differences.\\r\\nThis study is subject to several limitations. First is\\r\\na lack of external validity, as only 1 practice was used\\r\\nin patient recruitment. This is more likely to affect the\\r\\nusual care group in which physician variability in INRbased warfarin dosing is to be expected, rather than the\\r\\nPSM group, which used a standard dosing algorithm.\\r\\nSecond, the inclusion and exclusion criteria involved\\r\\nconsiderable subjectivity; however, this is typical in similar research and more robust criteria do not currently\\r\\nexist. This study was not designed to determine the criteria for PSM patient selection. Physicians wishing to\\r\\nimplement a PSM strategy should monitor use before\\r\\nallowing patient independence to ensure only appropriate patients are selected. Finally, our relatively small\\r\\nsample size limited our ability to determine possible\\r\\nstatistical significance. The use of a crossover design,\\r\\nhowever, was a substantial strength of this small trial,\\r\\nas it was able to control for differences between groups\\r\\nbecause subjects acted as their own controls.\\r\\nConclusion\\r\\nWe attempted to assess the feasibility and effectiveness\\r\\nof implementing a PSM strategy for patients using warfarin therapy in a real-world Canadian primary care setting, using community laboratories and comparatively\\r\\nlittle training. We have found that, for appropriately\\r\\nselected patients, this strategy is effective in maintaining\\r\\ntherapeutic INR values and is the strategy patients find\\r\\nmost desirable. This study established the feasibility\\r\\nof implementing a fully powered study to assess the\\r\\neffectiveness of a simple and pragmatic PSM intervention in Canadian primary care. The results of this study\\r\\ndemonstrated neither superiority nor noninferiority of\\r\\nPSM compared with usual care, although it was not\\r\\npowered to detect such a difference.\\r\\nDr Grunau is a resident in the Department of Family Medicine and the\\r\\nDepartment of Emergency Medicine at the University of British Columbia\\r\\n(UBC) in Vancouver.

The optimal intensity of oral anticoagulation for an individual patient is the target INR that results in the lowest incidence of thromboembolic plus bleeding complications. For patients with native valve lesions, one must consider the cardiac morphology and pathophysiology, for example, the etiology of the disease, left atrial diameters, loss of active atrial contraction (atrial fibrillation), left ventricular pump function, and left ventricular diameters, to determine an optimal INR target. In patients with prosthetic devices, the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthrombogenicity\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of the heart valve prosthesis is an additional risk factor for intracardiac thrombus formation and thromboembolic episodes. This \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthrombogenicity\\xe2\\x80\\x9d may vary significantly from device to device. INR self-testing improves the overall prognosis of patients on lifelong oral anticoagulation therapy because patients remain more precisely within that target therapeutic INR range. For most patients under phenprocoumon, one to two INR measurements per week are a sufficient frequency to provide a stable intensity of anticoagulation.\\r\\n\\r\\noral anticoagulation heart valve disease heart valve prostheses prothrombin time point-of-care testing \\r\\nThis is a preview of subscription content, log in to check access.\\r\\nPreview\\r\\n\\r\\nReferences\\r\\n1.\\r\\nHorstkotte D.
